The government undertook crisis-management steps on the Korean peninsula, such as intensifying the alert posture at the front, and this atmosphere is already reflected in inter-Korean relations and the stock market. President Kim Yong-sam, who is currently visiting Russia, is the person who feels the pitch of crisis on the Korean peninsula most sensitively. ROK-U.S. Hotline in Operation. Judging that UN Security Council sanctions on the North are a certainty in the wake of International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Director General Hans Blix's 4 June report, President Kim has instructed the cabinet to operate a crisis-managing system. The instructions President Kim gave from Moscow intensified the alert posture at the front; stabilizing public sentiment; strengthening international alliance; and setting up strategy for the UN Security Council. Based on this, the government is operating the Unification and Security Coordinating Committee chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the National Unification Board [NUB] Yi Hong-ku and the working ad hoc committee led by NUB Vice Minister Song Yong-tae. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae has begun checking ROK-U.S. combat readiness with U.S. Defense Secretary Perry via a hotline. The NUB says that North Korea has not shown any specific signs of change in its moves. However, once the resolution on sanctions against the North is presented before the UN Security Council, North and South Korea are sure to engage in a fierce propaganda offensive against each other. The South Will Counter the North in a Full-Fledged Manner. In this connection, the government issued a refuting statement to the North on 5 June in the name of Yi Sung-kon, chairman of the North-South Nuclear Control Committee. In the statement, he criticized that "The statement dated 4 June by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] was prompted by an extremely dangerous idea mocking at the expectations of the international community and the entire nation." This deviates from the previous position of the government avoiding directly countering North Korean challenges as best as possible. Concerning this change, a responsible government official said, "We have taken this position anticipating that the North and the South will exchange a fierce war of statements for a couple of months to come when the UN Security Council's economic sanctions against the North will become a reality." The noteworthy moves North Korea has shown for the last 24 hours were the two contrasting reactions, one dovish and the other hawkish, namely, the remark by Chu Chang-chun, North Korean ambassador to China, that "North Korea will permit all inspections if the third round of talks with the United States are realized," and the statement of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland that "North Korea is prepared for both dialogue and war. The government regards Ambassador Chu's remark as an trial balloon designed to test the political will of the ROK and the United States. In the meantime, the sense of crisis resulting from the UN Security Council's discussion of sanctions is beginning to be felt conspicuously in the civilian sector. On 5 June, when there was news about the Security Council pushing ahead with the resolution for sanctions against the North, the composite stock market index plummeted by 12.17 point to 930.26. In view of the fact that the stock market index fell only about nine points when North Korea mentioned the "sea of fire" on 19 March, the stock market is considered to be watching the crisis resulting from the moves for sanctions against the North more seriously. Meanwhile, a contrasting phenomenon is observed overseas. The ROK's Korea Fund (KF) and the convertible bond (CB), which temporarily fell in New York and London in March when North Korea mentioned the "sea of fire, are maintaining a stable market. For instance, the Samsung Electronic Company's CB No. 2, the ROK's typical blue-chip convertible bond, remains at the $22 level in the New York market despite the moves of the Security Council. However, the Korean people enjoyed the golden Memorial Day weekend in the first week of June, going out to the Seoul-Pusan and Yongdong highways in 187,500 cars--60 percent more than ordinary weekends--thus revealing a double state of mind, feeling no immediate crisis. The experts, commenting on this phenomenon, say, "It is true that the pitch of crisis is high on the Korean peninsula, but the majority of the people must be feeling that the North Korean nuclear issue will somehow find a clue to a solution through the heightening of crisis." A reliable research worker from the National Unification Research Institute noted, "North Korea must be trying to maximize the utility of the nuclear card by replacing fuel rods on its own despite the fact that it could hold the third round of talks with the United States only if it acceded to additional inspections." He added, "There is a possibility of North Korea's staging a surprise show when the crisis on the Korean peninsula is at its peak in order to bring about a dramatic reversal in the crisis."
