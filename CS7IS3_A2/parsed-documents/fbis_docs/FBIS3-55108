[Horyn] The Supreme Council resolution ratifying the START I treaty and Lisbon Protocol was an historic moment in helping address the issue of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. Ukraine has earnestly been preparing for the adoption of this important document. However, following the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from Ukraine, this step has not been properly understood by other countries. I want to stress that the Supreme Council resolution of 18 November has several important points. Ukraine, being one of the inheritors to the USSR, ratified the treaty with provisos made for the USSR, which obliged the latter to reduce 36 percent of warhead carriers and 42 percent of all warheads. Ukraine became a party to the treaty after the disintegration of the USSR; it signed the Lisbon Protocol with one particular item: Article 5 has put Ukraine within a framework that would have been very tight if the protocol had been ratified in its original version. Therefore, the resolution states that the Lisbon Protocol has been ratified with the exclusion of Article 5. Article 5 provides for Ukraine joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty with the status of a nonnuclear state. Taking into account that Ukraine keeps nuclear weapons on its territory and that they are Ukrainian property, Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state, while at the same time retaining its nuclear weapons, would be an illogical step and cause a misunderstanding in the world community. Reassuring the world that Ukraine joined the treaty as a nonnuclear state, while keeping nuclear weapons on its territory, we would not quite be in line with logic. Therefore, according to the Constitution, the final say had to come from the Supreme Council. The Lisbon Protocol cannot be a binding document unless ratified. I believe the assertions of individual officials that Ukraine will destroy all its nuclear weapons without condition are a little premature. Such assertions are unfounded. There were two opinions during the preparations for ratifying START I. The deputies who prepared the resolution pressed for determining the percentage ratio of nuclear reduction as a next step toward nonnuclear status. The executive structures expressed the opinion that the percentages should not be fixed because this may complicate the understanding of Ukraine's position by other states. The stance of individual representatives of executive power has been dictated by promises and assertions that they made during numerous interviews and meetings with high-ranking foreign officials. This obliged them to defend their position during the preparation of the Supreme Council draft resolution. [Levytskyy] The last word was left for the Supreme Council, so why were diplomats in such a hurry to make promises? [Horyn] Diplomacy is often put in a complicated position of choice. Since Ukraine has unceasingly been pressed by certain countries, particularly by Russia, executive branch representatives were forced to make promises under pressure. [Levytskyy] Still, at one news conference, Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk stated that, within the START I framework, all nuclear weapons are subject to destruction. [Horyn] I think that the deputy minister misspoke. The START I agreement was signed by the United States and USSR. Ukraine has joined it after the downfall of the Soviet Union. Consequently, the norms of reduction were in the competence of the Supreme Council. Taking into account that there were some mistakes made in the initial stage of Ukraine's path to nonnuclear status, this act has not been legalized by appropriate documents. In the second stage, as I believe, previous mistakes were noted and the possibility of implementation was examined. We have a grounded document with all the complexities taken into account. These documents give witness to the maturity of political thinking and the new level of caution exercised by the deputy body when adopting important political resolutions. [Levytskyy] What was the position of the manager body [dyrektorskyy korpus] with regard to this question? [Horyn] The so-called deputy majority has undergone many changes in its attitude toward nuclear weapons. While adopting the Declaration of State Sovereignty, the managers said that Ukraine should not give away its nuclear weapons to Russia because these weapons are of great material value and constitute a reliable guarantee of our security. [Levytskyy] However, along with this assessment of the problem, the Supreme Council has put forth declarations on our status as a nonnuclear state? [Horyn] The declarations on Ukraine's nonnuclear status have exerted great influence on quickening the international recognition of Ukraine. It seems to me that if we had chosen a different path, the making of our statehood would have met with many more difficulties. However, the Declaration of State Sovereignty and the Supreme Soviet resolutions were the very documents which expressed Ukraine's willingness to become a nonnuclear state in the future. These documents cannot be interpreted as obligations. Ukraine's first international obligation to reduce nuclear weapons was a Supreme Council resolution of 18 November 1993. [Levytskyy] This question is assessed by the world in its own way. Nuclear states have a negative view of the Supreme Council resolution. [Horyn] The first reaction was voiced by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. He argued that Ukraine had declared itself a nuclear state. I will try to explain his position. Russia, during the first stage of Ukraine's path to nonnuclear status, behaved like a state that has full control over foreign territory. Tactical nuclear weapons were stolen from Ukraine by strategic units, which at that time were under the control of the CIS Supreme Headquarters. Ukraine had no chance to counteract Russia's unceremonious behavior on Ukrainian territory. Taking this into account, Ukraine put strategic nuclear weapons under administrative control. Russia has lost an opportunity to withdraw strategic nuclear weapons from Ukraine without Ukraine's consent. Moreover, despite the fact that the possessions of the former USSR on Ukrainian territory were declared to be Ukrainian property, Russia did not recognize that the tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn from Ukraine were Ukrainian property. It was done without regard to the fact that Russia has also adopted a zero option. Nonrecognition of property implies a denial of compensation for material goods, for enriched uranium and plutonium. There is also a third reason for the harsh Russian reaction. Politicians in Moscow understand pretty well that strategic nuclear weapons are a stimulating factor. Even despite the fact that Ukraine does not exercise operational control over strategic nuclear weapons, their presence plays an important and stimulating role. Therefore, Ukraine cannot be approached unceremoniously, as was done with Moldova, Georgia, and Tajikistan. [Levytskyy] How will the ratification of START I and, subsequently, the destruction of nuclear missiles affect the economic situation in Ukraine? [Horyn] The reservations in the ratification document state that Ukraine will be able to implement the adopted obligations providing it receive appropriate financial and material assistance from Western countries, as well as security guarantees. I would like to stress that the international community should be interested in Ukraine's movement toward nonnuclear status. The reduction of nuclear weapons is a matter of great interest for Ukraine as well, which has suffered from Chernobyl. This is a matter of interest for the United States, at which those rockets are aimed. The United States should take the most active part in liquidating nuclear weapons, because this question directly affects U.S. national security. [Levytskyy] Thank you for the interview.
