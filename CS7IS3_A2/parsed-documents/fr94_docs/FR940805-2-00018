FR940805-2-00018 FR940805-2-00012 Kansas City Support Office; Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award; Kansas State University, Engineering Extension Service AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Kansas City Support Office announces that, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award to Kansas State University, Engineering Extension Service (KSU/EES), for technical assistance in the DOE/HUD Base System Analysis Maintenance Program. PROJECT PERIOD: The project period for the grant award is extended 12 months to September 30, 1995. Total funding for the FY94 portion of the project is expected to be approximately $15,000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kirk M. Bond, Program Engineer, (816) 426&hyph;7054 or JoAnn Timm, Contracting Officer, (816) 426&hyph;3116 at U.S. Department of Energy, Kansas City Regional Support Office, 911 Walnut St., Suite 1411, Kansas City, MO 64106&hyph;2024 FAX: (816) 426&hyph;6860. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: KSU/EES provided technical, computer, and software support for the DOE/HUD Initiative in FY91, FY92 and FY93. That effort will be continued and evolve in the FY94 project effort. KSU/EES will: (1) secure needed modifications to the utility record system software (ENACT&hyph;2) developed by the Washington State Energy Office; (2) assist in institutionalizing the revised software into the HUD/PHA management process; (3) develop a summary report on the efficacy of the ENACT&hyph;2 program for HUD and PHAs energy management, and make recommendations on additional software enhancements, how to facilitate its national replication in the HUD/PHA management system/interface. Due to their prior involvement, and associated experience, their staff is uniquely qualified to continue the efforts associated with their assigned tasks. KSU/EES has expended much time and effort in helping analyze the extensive engineering and facility management relationships and complexities that are associated with the program. It would not be cost effective to sever that base of knowledge in either time or funds because competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity and completion of the project in the time frame approved by DOE Washington.
