"We declare that the problem of Zionism will only be solved through armed struggle against Israel until the cancerous tumor disappears from the map of the world," said a statement from deputies, read out in parliament. The deputies condemned the February 25 massacre of Moslem worshipers by a Jewish settler in the West Bank town of Hebron, and warned against using the "painful tragedy" as a catalyst for progress in the Arab-Israeli peace talks. They also slammed the international community's "treacherous silence" over the "shocking crime." Palestinian doctors say 52 Arabs were killed in the shooting, while the Israeli army has put the toll at 30. On Friday Iranian spiritual guide Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i called for a massive uprising against Israel, with the backing of the Islamic world. Fathi al-Shiqaqi, head of the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad in Palestine group, vowed here Saturday that Palestinian militants would soon launch revenge attacks against Israel in retaliation for the Hebron massacre.
