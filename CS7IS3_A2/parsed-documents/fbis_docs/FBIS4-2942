In his meeting with a Japanese economic delegation, he said that the investment conditions in Guangdong have been greatly improved and the market enlarged. "Guangdong looks forward to expanding economic and technological cooperation with Japanese counterparts," the secretary said, adding that the prospect for future cooperation is bright. The top party official of the province noted that since China adopted the policies of reform and opening up, Guangdong's gross domestic product (GDP) has increased by 13 percent annually over the past 15 years, with the GDP in 1993 up 21 percent over 1992. Guangdong now has three special economic zones, four state-approved economic development zones, six new- and high-technology development districts and four free trade zones. There are eight airports and a dozen express highways, including those under construction, in the province. Xie Fei said that in 1992, foreign investment in Guangdong amounted to 4.8 billion U.S. dollars, and in 1993, investment was 9.6 billion U.S. dollars. The two years' total is almost equal to that in the previous 13 years. More overseas investment would help tackle Guangdong's newly emerged problems in its efforts to link up the local economy with the world's, Xie said, noting that overseas management experience and skills are also needed.
