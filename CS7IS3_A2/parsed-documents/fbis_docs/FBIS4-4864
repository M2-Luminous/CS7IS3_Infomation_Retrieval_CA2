Co., Japan's top electric furnace steelmaker, announced plans this week to lower prices of H-beam steel for construction firms. Nippon Steel Corp., the world's largest steel manufacturer, and other major blast furnace steelmakers have joined Tokyo Steel in cutting prices of H-beam steel for construction firms to make up for slumping demand from automobile and electric appliance industries. Tokyo Steel's decision was regarded as a challenge to blast furnace steelmakers in anticipation of growth in demand for H-beam steel for public works projects, industry sources said. The company earlier said it will join four major blast furnace steelmakers in marketing steel sheet piles for the construction industry. Tokyo steel said it will slash prices of H-beam steel to 33,000 yen per ton from 40,000 yen. It also said it plans to sell steel sheet-pyles at 55,000 yen per ton, far below the present average price of around 100,000 yen. The company has opened new branches in Nagoya, Fukuoka, Hiroshima and Takamatsu to step up sales of steel products for the construction industry.
