Captain (Van du Toit), who in the 1980's was a prisoner in the hands of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] in Cabinda, traveled to Cabo Ledo to supervise military training of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA], MPLA troops. This is a paradox since it is known that Nelson Mandela intends to assist in ending the Angolan conflict. Will the mercenaries contribute to peace in Angola? This is the big question placed before Nelson Mandela's good offices.
