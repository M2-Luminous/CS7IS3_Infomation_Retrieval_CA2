Today I.I. Indinok, chief of the administration of Novosibirsk Oblast, having brought the message to Moscow, will have handed it over to its addressees. The essence of the letter is a cry of despair of the leaders of the thousands-strong outfits of the "capital of Siberia," where, as we know, the majority of enterprises and also research institutions represents the interests of the country's military-industrial complex, which have found themselves on the brink of ruin and, accordingly, stoppage as a result of the policy of market reforms in general and the conversion of "defense" in particular chosen by the leadership of Russia. The exorbitant taxes, the artificially inflated price of energy and transport services, the general nonpayments, where the principal debtor is the state--this typical misfortune of product manufacturers of all forms of ownership has proven to be a genuine catastrophe for the defense enterprises, where the decline in production, in recent months in particular, is becoming an irreversible process. "No state in the world has allowed this to happen...," the directors exclaim, demanding the adoption of urgent, special measures. It is surprising that such a message was born after the "Strategy for the Region's Economic Stabilization: Problems and Solutions" workshop, which had only just been held in Novosibirsk and in which Deputy Prime Minister S.M. Shakhray and S.Yu. Glazyev, chairman of the Committee for Economic Policy of the State Duma, took part. Whether the workshop "platform" was not high enough. Whether the statesmen were of the wrong "caliber." Whether at this time our economy together with our wooden ruble has fallen several points further.... In any event, Novosibirsk's "defense" will "celebrate" May Day until 11 May. What then? Just wait, you defenders of the fatherland, for the response.
