During the visit, I will brief my honorable brother, Shaykh Zayid, on the developments of the situation in our country in light of the signing of the pledge and accord document and the efforts being exerted to begin implementing it on the basis of reviving the Constitutional and executive institutions and cooperation among all parties to the government coalition -- the General Peoples's Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping.

In this regard, we cannot do without the efforts and role of the brothers in the UAE, led by His Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who has taken honorable pan-Arab stands in support of Yemeni unity, which is a pan-Arab gain for the Arab nation and a significant factor for bolstering regional security, stability, and peace. We are also looking forward to a greater UAE role at the current stage in view of the his Highness Shaykh Zayid's special status in the hearts of the sons of Yemen and for his known wisdom and pan-Arab concern to serve the Arab nation's objectives and supreme interests. Undoubtedly, our talks in the UAE will deal with ways of clearing the Arab atmosphere of all impurities that have stuck to it as a result of the regrettable Gulf crisis. We will also be discussing ways of restoring Arab solidarity, especially since His Highness Shaykh Zayid initiated the call for healing the rift, closing Arab ranks, and restoring Arab solidarity. We in the Republic of Yemen have supported this pan-Arab initiative. We will do our best along with our brothers to achieve this objective.
