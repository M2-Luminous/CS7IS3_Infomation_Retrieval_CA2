The official national news agency said the mission led by a presidency member of the second largest political party in the Federal Republic of Germany will meet with top authorities of the Santiago de Cuba Province, located some 950 km east of Havana. Tappae, who is also a member of the German Bundestag (parliament), told the media that during his one-week visit to Cuba, he will seek to obtain firsthand knowledge of the Cuban situation after changes in the world. He pointed out that he is especially interested in exploring the possibility of increasing political ties between northern Hessen and Santiago de Cuba. According to Tappae, although northern Hessen and Santiago de Cuba are physically distant from each other, they share some similarities in their historic backgrounds and various economic activities. The agenda includes touring production, cultural, scientific, and recreative centers, a visit to the mining community of El Cobre, which is one of the oldest in Cuba, as well as meetings with government and political authorities.
