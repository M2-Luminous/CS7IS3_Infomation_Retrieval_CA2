The problem has grown at the same time as there has been an explosive increase in the number of asylum-seekers from the African continent. African drug gangs are wreaking havoc on the Danish drug market, where their smoking heroin is creating thousands of new drug addicts. They follow a very definite pattern when they come here--often exploiting our asylum regulations--and the hard drugs are concealed in their bodies. This development is causing growing concern among both the Danish police and Interpol. In recent years Africans from Ghana, Gambia, and Nigeria in particular have dominated the picture of a growing African drug market in this country. At the same time the number of asylum-seekers from several African countries has risen sharply. If refugees from the former Yugoslavia are excluded, almost one out of every two asylum-seekers in 1993 was from Africa. In 1992 Africans represented just under 30 percent, while in 1990 their share was as low as 15 percent. This should be seen in relation to the fact that by and large only refugees from the devastating civil war in Somalia are granted asylum. "New people come here all the time, and they do not come out of a clear blue sky. Someone organizes their trip here," Detective Superintendent Mogens Lundh, head of the National Police Commissioner's drug information division, told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. The pattern is that the future asylum-seeker gets a ticket and receives money from his "brothers" in Denmark and then -- after registering at an asylum center -- he partially moves in with his friends/contacts. By seeking asylum, foreigners acquire a better status in comparison with ordinary tourists if they are arrested in connection with criminal activities. In contrast to tourists, asylum-seekers can demand to stay in Denmark while their cases are being processed. And Africans' asylum cases are especially likely to take a long time. It is difficult to establish an individual's identity because he often has passports from several countries. In this way he can change his nationality if the first one does not entitle him to asylum. And then the case begins all over again. According to Lundh, a corresponding procedure is used in attempts to enter Denmark so that a person expelled on drug charges simply returns with a new nationality. Swallow Drug-Filled Condoms Eleven Africans were arrested in Denmark in connection with drug smuggling in 1993, according to Interpol. But as no statistics are kept on the status of arrested foreigners it is impossible for the police to say how many of the Africans charged with drug offenses came here as asylum-seekers. According to Lundh they typically come with 50-200 grams of pure heroin concealed in their bodies. The drug is swallowed in a package -- condoms, for example -- that protects it on its passage through the intestinal system. Later it is cut so that 1 gram represents a value of around 4,000 kroner on the street. The method used to smuggle the drugs in is the reason why there are large quantities of heroin in circulation in Denmark in spite of the efforts at the borders. Detecting drugs in a suspect's stomach is difficult and requires detaining him until nature brings the substance out in the open. The African heroin is sold all over the country -- with a preponderance in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen where it is sold quite openly. "The Africans have developed a special technique that enables them to remove the evidence at any time. They simply swallow it. And when we are out of the way they stick a finger down their throat and get the goods back intact," said a vice squad spokesman. The police are now trying to stop this practice by simply taking suspects along to Vestre Prison's infirmary where they are left to sit on the can until the drugs show up. This has already paid off on several occasions in January. In one case two Gambians swallowed 26 small packets containing a total of 3.62 grams of very high quality heroin. It had a street value of almost 15,000 kroner. One was deported while the other, who has a Danish spouse, was imprisoned. High Price for Danish Brides The police cannot disclose the status of the marriage. But in their experience it is common for passionate love between an African and a Dane to spring up when all avenues of appeal in an asylum case are on the point of being exhausted. Among Africans the price of a marriage is said to be 15-20,000 kroner. Some bride prices have reportedly been around 50,000 kroner. Marriage to a Dane automatically ensures foreigners of a residence permit and this occurs "fairly often," as Jorgen Cemnitz, the leader of the Danish Red Cross asylum division, said. If such a marriage occurs they automatically drop out of the asylum system. "Formerly Africans acted as couriers, especially for Pakistani drug dealers. But that time is past. Today we have two independent drug gangs that cover all aspects after the drugs are produced in Thailand and Pakistan. This means purchasing, distribution, and sales," said Lundh. The gangs are based in West and East Africa respectively. The eastern gang members come from Uganda, Somalia, and Tanzania and the western ones from Ghana, Gambia, and Nigeria. And while the western organization is strongest in Denmark, the other Nordic countries notice the eastern gang more. It also operates in this country -- but on a smaller scale than the western one. The money earned from the drug trade is spent partly on lavish consumption in Denmark and partly on non-drug-related investments in their homelands. "In contrast to drug dealers from Turkey and Pakistan, for example, the Africans are well educated. Many have a heavy academic ballast," said Mogens Lundh, who thinks the connection between Denmark and Africa has its roots in earlier charter trips. Interpol estimates that a total of around 10 percent of all the world's money comes from drugs -- through production, sales, or consumption. This tells almost the whole story about the battle the police and customs agents are up against. It is estimated that illegal cocaine sales alone amount to 2.5 trillion kroner worldwide. Nordic Lands of Special Interest Heroin and cocaine are regarded as the means of payment of the downtrodden. Drug money can be used to buy arms for the struggle for liberation and independence. The hunger and widespread poverty in Africa also cause an increase in the supply of hard drugs. Therefore countries like Denmark are flooded with the deadly narcotics. We have the opposite commodities -- peace, money, and the coveted standard of living. The Nordic region is also interesting because of the many daily connections with places like Russia, Poland, and the Baltic states. "This provides many opportunities to get the desired goods inside the EU [European Union] community," they say at Interpol's European headquarters in Lyon, France. As a countermeasure, the Nordic countries have set up several working groups that try to obtain as much information from the individual cultures as possible about such things as behavior, bases, smuggling techniques, and networks. "This makes it a little easier for us to know what special things we should look for when they come through customs," said Lundh. In the last two years 50 Africans carrying large quantities of heroin have been arrested at various Nordic borders. "And that is a large number," Lundh added. In numerical terms Africans involved in heroin cases make up over half of all those arrested. When it comes to the quantity of drugs, Turks, Iranians, and Pakistanis are still in the lead because, unlike the Africans, they dispatch whole truckloads. On the other hand it, can be harder to unmask the Africans if the market share rises in proportion to the number of couriers. Five years ago there were practically no Africans among those arrested in the Nordic countries in connection with drugs. In Denmark around 20 different nationalities that operate on the drug market have been recorded, but there are no statistics on the percentage of asylum-seekers. However several asylum centers confirm that the behavior of many of the Africans is strikingly different from that of other asylum-seekers. They do not live at the centers, but come in only when they have to pick up pocket money -- or they are reported missing and drop out of the system. And their consumption of luxury items--including the use of taxis -- is extremely high. Deputy director Henrik Dahl Sorensen of the Directorate of Alien Affairs confirmed that there is a widespread tendency -- also among Africans -- to "take advantage of the system," as he put it. However very few Africans are granted asylum. Broadly speaking it is granted only to people who come here from Somalia, a country ravaged by civil war. In the two other big groups -- from Gambia and Togo -- only a few (from Togo) have been granted asylum to date. But Sorensen also acknowledged that "there are very big problems in establishing the correct identity." There were around 2,000 African asylum-seekers in 1993, half of whom came from Somalia and around 300 from Gambia, while over 150 came from Togo and around 120 from Uganda. The introduction of compulsory visas from several African countries has apparently not moderated the interest in Denmark.
