The session participants -- foreign ministers of the countries of the alliance -- focused attention on relations with Russia. The lively debate resulted in agreement that closer ties must be established with the Russian Federation. The session participants confirmed the expediency of Moscow's joining the partnership program. At the same time they acknowledged readiness to hold special consultations with the Russian leadership outside the framework of this program, if necessary, on questions such as the Bosnian crisis, the actions of peacemaking forces in Europe, and nuclear arms control. The NATO countries' ministers unanimously rejected the possibility of granting Russia the right to veto decisions of the North Atlantic Alliance. As is known, however, Russia does not aspire to such a right. But nor does it want to be presented with "surprises" in the future, as was the case recently with the Atlanticists' unilateral ultimatum in Bosnia. Other questions were also discussed at the Istanbul session in addition to the problems of relations with Russia. Its participants reinforced with their authority the recent attempt to impose a solution of the territorial problem on the opposing sides in Bosnia and once again stated their readiness to send a peacekeeping force to Bosnia as soon as the opposing sides sign a final agreement.
