The Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug Gmbh company had indicated in October that this initial flight was not likely to take place before the beginning of 1994. The first test flight was to have occurred over one year ago but the program schedule, upset by the decision to build a simplified and less costly version of the ACE, had been set back to last fall, then delayed once more when the British firm CEC Marconi Avionics encountered problems with flight control software. The 3 January issue of the magazine DER SPIEGEL announced that financing for the Eurofighter is short one billion deutschemarks (about 3.5 billion francs). It also stated that DASA, subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, billed an additional 940 million marks to the Ministry of Defense and 740 million marks to NEFMA, the company managing the Eurofighter project. But the 1994 defense budget only allows 520 million marks for the Eurofighter. The Defense spokesman confirmed DASA's additional request, asserting however that it only amounts to 650 million marks. He also indicated that the amount for which the company is responsible has to be determined.
