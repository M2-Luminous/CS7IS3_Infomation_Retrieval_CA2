The source said that most members of the delegation, which was headed by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, differ in practice with the present PLO position on the negotiations, and are openly opposed to the declaration of principles agreement reached following the secret negotiations in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, away from the Washington negotiations and without the negotiators' knowledge. This position has been confirmed in an exclusive statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi himself. He said: "Actually I believe that the task of the declaration of principles agreement reached in Oslo ended the responsibility of the negotiating delegation in Washington. Yes, the delegation's mission ended the moment the Oslo agreement was signed, as our first task was to negotiate the transitional phase." 'Abd-al-Shafi went on: "I did not participate in the Oslo negotiations, nor was I consulted on the Oslo agreement. I personally criticized the agreement and believe it is bad. Because it did not tackle Israel's claims regarding the occupied territories, on the basis of which Israel built the settlements. The outcome of the failure to tackle this issue is clear in the current negotiations in Cairo. The current situation is worrying. And as long as the settlement building process is continuing, the possibility of achieving a just peace is out of the question." [passage omitted] Asked about his position -- as a former delegate -- on the current negotiations in Cairo between the PLO and Israel and the agreements they have achieved, Ghassan al-Khatib said: First of all, we are not informed officially -- neither as a delegation nor as political forces -- of what is happening in Cairo. However, I believe that Israel is retrieving in Cairo what it offered in Oslo. What is happening there is a victory for the Israeli methods which they tried to impose in Washington but failed, such as fragmenting the topics under negotiation into parts isolated from one another. [passage omitted] Al-Khatib warned that "if the Cairo agreement is implemented, it contains very dangerous time bombs. This is because of the agreement to keep thousands of armed and aggressive settlers, allowing them to move freely in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. This is in addition to the presence of thousands of Palestinian policemen, who will be in an unenviable position in the event of any attack on Palestinian by a settler. Because it will be difficult for them to take a neutral position, and it will also be difficult for them to punish the settlers. Hence the danger of another Bosnia in the Gaza Strip." Answering the same questions, Dr. [Hanan] 'Ashrawi said over the telephone from her home in Ramallah: "There is no longer a thing called the delegation to the Washington negotiations, because the negotiations are now direct between the PLO and Israel." [passage omitted] On the way the negotiations are run at present, 'Ashrawi said: "There is Israeli diktat in the negotiations. In my view, the peace process is consolidating Israeli terms and priorities, including the method of separating the people from the land, the employment method instead of geographical jurisdiction, and the continued political blackmail. In brief, the peace process has lost the foundation on which it was launched." 'Ashrawi stressed that she is in favor of correcting the course of the process and intervening in a manner that prevents sliding into discussing the fine details while ignoring the essence. She said that the "form has become more important than the substance." She urged reexamining the entire process and the way it is run. 'Ashrawi attributed the deterioration to world pressures and internal Palestinian political considerations, the political contradictions produced by the peace process at the Palestinian public opinion level, and political orientations in the PLO.
