Introduction and Summary A. Price Transparency During the past year, the Commission has initiated efforts to further improve the efficiency of, and to protect investors in, the municipal securities and other debt markets. In September 1993, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation published the Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market (``Staff Report''), 1 which contained several recommendations to improve the municipal securities market. The Staff Report recommended, among other things, riskless principal mark-up disclosure as a means of providing greater information to investors purchasing municipal securities. 2 The Staff Report noted that, unlike the equity markets where mark-ups and mark-downs 3 are disclosed to investors in non-market maker riskless principal transactions and principal transactions in ``reported securities,'' 4 mark-ups are not disclosed in any principal transaction in municipal securities. 5 Thus, investors of municipal securities are constrained in their ability to compare transaction costs among broker-dealers and across markets. The Staff Report identified this ability as one of the benefits of mark-up disclosure. 6 1 Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market (September 1993). 2 Staff Report, at 16 and 18. 3 For purposes of this release, references to mark-ups also will apply to mark-downs or commission equivalents. 4 See infra note 71 for a discussion of ``reported securities.'' 5 Staff Report, at 15&hyph;16. 6 Id. at 16.
