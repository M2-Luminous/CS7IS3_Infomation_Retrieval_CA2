[Milewski] We should feel that our duty is well performed because the recent political campaign headed by Foreign Minister Olechowski and Lech Walesa made the American-devised "Partnership for Peace" proposal, approved by the summit, more far-reaching than was expected several months ago. [Woyciechowski] In other words, we have won at least something. Does this not mean that the previous governments could do more than they actually did? [Milewski] No, they couldn't do anything more. Now we can see what caused our major problems and where the main resistance was. The 16 states that make up the bloc should be convinced that the expansion will be beneficial for them in the first place, and not just for somebody in Central Europe. In addition to government leaders, this also applies to governments, legislatures, and societies of those countries. [Woyciechowski] So where was the highest resistance? [Milewski] I think all 16 members lacked a full understanding as to why NATO should be expanded at all. However, the main opposition was mounted by the southern countries because they receive NATO aid in the form of weapons. They know that with new members entering the bloc, the assistance provided to them will be substantially slashed. Another source of resistance came from political circles in the United States that have basically Russia in the focus of their attention and are preoccupied with a dialog with Moscow politicians. The most understanding was exhibited by our neighbors -- Germany, Denmark, and Norway. [Woyciechowski] What you are saying about the southern states receiving substantial assistance is very interesting. You probably have in mind Spain, Portugal, and Greece. [Milewski] Yes. On the other hand, Turkey, which is located in the eastern direction, absolutely supports us. Obviously, with Russia within a stone's throw, it knows very well what it means to be on the edge. [Woyciechowski] As a matter of fact, we don't know what this "Partnership for Peace" is all about. Could you tell us exactly what it means? [Milewski] The "Partnership for Peace" is a program intended to make possible cooperation and rapprochement of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council members with NATO countries in military, political, and other spheres, such as environmental protection and economic matters. [Woyciechowski] If I understand correctly, the Partnership is a very broad formula that will be implemented only after subsequent conclusions of bilateral agreements on military and political cooperation. Is that correct? [Milewski] To the best of our knowledge... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And we don't know all the details yet, right? [Milewski] Yes... [Woyciechowski] When will we know all the details? [Milewski] Probably tomorrow. [Woyciechowski] In Prague. [Milewski] Yes, in Prague or in Warsaw when we know the full contents of the document approved by the NATO summit yesterday. This is a complex program providing for many types of cooperation among countries seeking integration with NATO. And the scope of this cooperation is to be determined by the target countries and not by the plan's authors. It's a strange proposal, but this is what it looks like. [Woyciechowski] Does this mean that those bilateral agreements on military and political cooperation will be different depending on which country signs them? [Milewski] The framework cooperation agreement should be the same. Western leaders declare that there will be no differentiation among post-communist countries, including Russia, and neutral states -- Austria, Finland, and Sweden. On the other hand, specific implementation of those agreements may be different for each state. Some of them, for example, might choose between looser or closer military cooperation with NATO countries. [Woyciechowski] What kind of cooperation will Poland propose? [Milewski] I believe we would opt for the broadest possible cooperation as long as our budget will sustain it. [Woyciechowski] One of the Partnership's provisions speaks about cooperation in drafting the defense budget. How will NATO cooperate with Poland whose military spendings account for 2.1 percent of the budget? Is it possible at all? [Milewski] That provision is about technical assistance in crafting the budget in order to meet Western standards with regard to the so-called budget transparence. The budget transparence is regarded throughout the world as proof of the openness of the country it belongs to. This makes it impossible for a country to conceal preparations for a possible attack against its neighbors. This provision is not about financial assistance that NATO could offer us. We count more on technological openness and access to modern armaments available in the West. We also anticipate closer contacts among our servicemen starting from highest staff officers and finishing with rank and file soldiers. [Woyciechowski] In other words, joint military exercises? [Milewski] Both theoretical military exercises involving only maps and the teamwork of our detachments in the field. [Woyciechowski] If everything goes well and Poland signs a military cooperation agreement, when do you think the first U.S.-Polish exercise could take place? [Milewski] General Shalikashvili said that it may -- and it should -- happen already in 1994. Should these exercise take place on our territory and the Western troops cover the costs of their arrival and stationing here, the scope of our teamwork could be even broader. We can't move our troops there solely because of financial problems, which may become a major setback in developing such cooperation. [Woyciechowski] When do you think Poland can become a full NATO member? In 2000, 2010..? When will we eventually get what we want? [Milewski] I would not like to tell fortunes here. However, there are two things that I can tell you. First, the Polish strategic plan is to achieve NATO membership in the 1990's. Given the present situation in those countries, the waiting time could be from two to four years. Two years because that is the time left until the next summit of the bloc. Assuming that NATO countries accept our membership, the process of formal admission and approval by their governments and parliaments might take quite a long time yet. [Woyciechowski] You, however, seem to be optimistic about the NATO issue? [Milewski] Well, as far back as two years ago, it didn't seem the right thing to even mention our intention of joining the bloc as the West perceived the idea as being provocative toward Russia. The West has always been very anxious not to anger Russia. Since we are neighbors, we don't want to provoke Russia, either. We seek to establish good-neighborly relations with that country. On the other hand, we are absolutely convinced that Russia should not be provoked by saber-rattling and weakness as well. And leaving Poland and other Central and East European countries in the gray zone means exactly what we call provoking Russia with our weakness and exposing us as a potential target for Russia's expansionist policies, still popular among many Russian politicians. [Woyciechowski] Is it essential to Polish interests that there still be some Russian troops on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic? Does this fact have any significance for us? [Milewski] Russian troops in Germany as well as those heavily concentrated in the Kaliningrad zone are of great significance to us; we would like these troops to be deconcentrated. However, the most important thing for us is the policy pursued by Moscow, because we do not think that there is a threat of putting these units into action by their local commanders without authorization. The disintegration of Russian state structures has not reached that stage when such events may be expected. [Woyciechowski] There are different rumors about the Russian concentration in Kaliningrad... What are those troops doing there? [Milewski] For the time being, those troops are just stationing there since their withdrawal from Germany and Poland. We can only approve the fact that these troops are withdrawn and deployed on Russian territory. However, in the long run, we think it is absolutely improper and unnecessary for Russia to maintain such a big concentration of its military force... [Woyciechowski] How heavy is this concentration? [Milewski] Well, comparable to the military force of entire Poland. The Russian Navy concentrated in the port of Baltiysk near Kaliningrad is larger than the entire Polish Navy. The air forces are comparable, too. As for the ground forces, I guess they are smaller... [Woyciechowski] ... on this small scrap of land? [Milewski] Yes, on this small scrap. It is, perhaps, the strongest fortress in the world, not only in Europe. [Woyciechowski] Is the Polish Defense Ministry preparing new offices for new coalition deputy ministers? [Milewski] I do not know anything about it. I have not seen any special groups of painters busy at the ministry. The concept approved by President Walesa and Prime Minister Pawlak some time ago called for reducing the hired civilian personnel of the Defense Ministry. It also provided for the reduction of three deputy minister offices to two. [Woyciechowski] Thus, there are two deputy ministers by now? [Milewski] This is correct. [Woyciechowski] Is there any need for more? Do you feel overworked? [Milewski] In my opinion, we do not need more. Those changes in the organizational structure, which we hope to implement soon, can be controlled by two deputy ministers alone. It will do, especially now that the General Staff has its own head in the position of a deputy minister or even higher. De facto, the minister of national defense has three close aides, two of whom are civilians.
