In his first State of the Union address given on 25 January before a joint session of Congress and televised nationwide, the President emphasized domestic issues. However, he stressed that the change in the former socialist bloc into a market economy is a guarantee for Washington. Clinton urged Congress to approve this year his health reform bill, threatening to veto any legislation that does not guarantee private health insurance for every American that can never be taken away. Clinton praised the participation of U.S. troops in missions such as Somalia, although he made no reference to the military failure endured in that country. President Clinton's address to the Congress made use of an over-confident language which with he praised his program to reduce the budget deficit and the approval of NAFTA. In reference to the nationwide problem of crime, he solidly supported legislation to put another 100,000 policemen in the streets, permanently jail criminals after their third felony, and ban assault weapons. Clinton also turned down reducing the U.S. military budget despite the fact that many people had asked him to reduce it in order to pay for other government programs. In his address Clinton did not give figures for military expenses next year, although he stressed that the current budget guarantees the capabilities of the Armed Forces.
