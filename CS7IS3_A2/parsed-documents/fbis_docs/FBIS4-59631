[Makki] The departure of the Israeli occupation from Gaza or, to be more precise, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas ended a nightmare for the Palestinian people and spread rapture among Palestinians everywhere. A step has been taken toward building a foundation on which our Palestinian people may stand until they move toward establishing their free Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital. The situation in the West Bank and Gaza is one of great jubilation. Most people were thrilled by the departure of the Israeli troops, who used to kill children, women, and youths and throw them in prison. Now Palestinian flags flutter over every house and children rejoice. But there is sadness for those heroic martyrs who fell during the eight years of the intifadah. We say to them: You died to give us a new lease of life. It is a new beginning and we hope it will be auspicious, God willing. [Riyad] We certainly hope so. The self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho has considerable responsibility. Would you like to tell us about the situation in Gaza concerning the economy, education, and the infrastructure? [Makki] For 27 years, Israel has been trying to link the occupied territories with Israel in the hope of integrating these areas into the Israeli territories. This policy left quite a scar on the infrastructure and the economy of Gaza and the West Bank. We need to rebuild the infrastructure in Gaza from scratch. This applies to electricity, water, sewage, and all public services. The Israelis left us with another serious problem. Over 70,000 Palestinians are jobless. The economy in the occupied territories is very bad and we need to think of a way to improve it. [Riyad] During the signing ceremony of the Gaza-Jericho accord, President Mubarak called for political and financial support to promote the step. What is required now from all the parties concerned with this accord--the Arab states, European states, the cosponsors of the conference, and the United Nations? [Makki] President Mubarak and the Egyptian people have always strongly supported the Palestinian people. We say that it is the duty of the brothers everywhere, be they Egyptians or Palestinians, to cooperate with each other. We focus on a very important thing, namely, that the states that support this peace must entrench it on the ground by strengthening the Palestinian economy. The European Union, the United States, the IMF, Russia, and the United Nations must support the Palestinian people, who need the prerequisites for establishing this authority on strong bases. Without a strong economy, the Palestinian people will face great problems. The Palestinian authority will face economic problems. It cannot solve these problems alone; it needs the help of the Arab countries. I appeal to all the Arab states and especially to all the Gulf states, the European states, and the United States to support the Palestinian people in their hardship and during this critical interim period. [Riyad] What is the stance of the opponents of the self-rule accord in Gaza and Jericho and what is their reaction to the entry of the Palestinian police force to these two areas? [Makki] The Palestinian people are very intelligent. The Palestinian opposition is a healthy and intelligent opposition. According to reliable information, they will receive the Palestinian police force with amity and appreciation. Palestinians might differ among each other ideologically but this does not conflict with the entry of the Palestinian force from among our sons, who will protect us and safeguard the property of the Palestinian people, individuals, and their lives. I believe that the opposition, in light of the statements it has issued, will not oppose; on the contrary, it will receive the Palestinian police force with an open heart. [Riyad] Do you wish to address the Palestinian people on the birth of the first Palestinian entity? [Makki] We tell our brothers the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that it is the duty of the Palestinians to unite in these difficult conditions and to support each other so that we can move from this step to build our independent Palestinian state. God willing, the capital of this state will be Jerusalem.
