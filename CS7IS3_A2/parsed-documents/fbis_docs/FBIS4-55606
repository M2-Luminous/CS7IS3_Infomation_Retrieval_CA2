Over the same period, prices for output sold in industry rose by 1 percent, which was mainly the result of an increase in the cost of industrial activity (by 1.7 percent) and of increases in the cost of supplying electricity and water (by 1.1 percent). Inflation in January, February, and March was 1.8 percent, 1.1 percent, and 2 percent, respectively. In the first 10 days of May, prices for merchandise and consumer services rose by 1 percent. In April, compared with March, prices on services rose the most--that is, by 4.3 percent. In the same period, prices on food products rose by 2.8 percent, on nonfood products by 2 percent, and on alcohol by 1.7 percent. According to GUS, the increase in prices on services was influenced mainly by the April increases in prices for central heating and hot water and also by increases in prices for Polish State Railroads monthly passes, prices for one-time tickets on the State Motor Transport system, and an increase in fees for stays in convalescent houses, which tripled. On the other hand, the increase in food prices was influenced by seasonal price rises with regard to potatoes, vegetables, and fruit (by 9.2 percent) and by an increase in prices for meat and similar products, which were higher than in the preceding months (by 1.6 percent). Throughout the first four months of this year, prices rose by 30.9 percent compared with the same period last year. Over the time period, prices on services rose the most (32.7 percent), followed by nonfood products (31.7 percent). Prices on food rose by 30.1 percent and on alcohol by 22.5 percent. As GUS reports, the biggest impact on the price changes in the production sector came from a price increase in those sectors that have a high value of sold output (products made from nonmetal raw materials, chemicals, chemical products, and artificial fibers). The average monthly salary in the enterprise sector was 5,319,900 zlotys [Z] in April, which represents a drop of 1.8 percent from March, while the average salary computed without payments from profits and without a balance surplus in cooperatives, was Z5,088,700, which is an increase of 1.9 percent from March.
