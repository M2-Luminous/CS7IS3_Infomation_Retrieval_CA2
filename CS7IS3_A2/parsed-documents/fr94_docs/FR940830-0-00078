FR940830-0-00078 FR940830-0-00013 §§905.684 and 968.340␣HA Performance and Evaluation Report Comment and Response: Several comments were raised regarding this report and have been responded to in other sections. See e.g. , Contingency accounts, Obligation of Formula Funding, Public Notice, Summaries, Five-Year Fungibility, Level of Detail in Five-Year Action Plan vs. P&E Report, Annual Submission of Activities and Expenditures, and HUD Discretion. §§905.687 and 968.345␣HUD review of HA Performance Comment: As previously mentioned in other comments, it was suggested that this section should also clarify timeliness. When referring to the obligation of funds, it was suggested that it should make reference to legitimate self-executed time extensions and also take into consideration any other delays that were outside of the HA's control. Response: Timeliness includes meeting HUD-approved implementation schedules, or HA-executed time extensions which are the result of delays beyond the control of the HA. HUD annually reviews these schedules and may review these schedules more frequently as needed. Comment: One commenter supported the proposal which continues the reduction of paperwork by requiring only an annual report, but did not support the creation of a Section 3 Annual Report. Response: Comments on Section 3 related issues are also found under the Miscellaneous Issues heading below.
