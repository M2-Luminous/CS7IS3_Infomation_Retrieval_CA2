He stressed that this is a type of crime that only Israel commits. He did not rule out the possibility that the perpetrators may be Lebanese Christians, Maronites, or Muslims, adding: We exonerate no one; the crime happened and its perpetrators are at large in our society. And Israel has tools and agents in Lebanon. He went on to call on the government to uncover the criminals because we want to learn the identity of these tools of Israel.
