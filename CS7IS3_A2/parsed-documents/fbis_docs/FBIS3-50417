[Olechowski] Poland has signed friendship and good-neighbor relations treaties with all its neighbors except Lithuania. Therefore, if real life were seen in terms of treaty-signing, we would have good guarantees of continued national security. [Urbanski] So can we feel secure? [Olechowski] We believe, to quote a priceless formula used once by the president, that it is not guarantees that are a fact but that hard facts constitute guarantees. At present, cooperation within the framework of a broader community remains the only form of ensuring that we have both national security and development. Polish people would like to be members of a community of Western states--hence our endeavors to be accepted into organizations that bind West European states together: the European Union [EU] and NATO. We will be associated with the EU as soon as February of this year. That association will give us a definitive status; also, on the one hand, it sets the timetable for our entry into other European institutions, and, on the other, it creates premises for the belief that we will in the future become members of the EU. However, it must be stated that we still have no detailed timetable for the stages of our entry into Union membership. As regards NATO, following the Brussels summit we know that it is not a closed organization. One of the criteria of acceptance of new members will be the latters' active participation in the Partnership for Peace program, but it will not be the only criterion with which we will have to comply. Unfortunately, no definitive conditions which will determine our membership have been set as yet, although we had asked for them to be set. To recapitulate, we are already, as it were, in the vestibule of the EU, whereas as regards NATO, the door leading to the vestibule has already been opened. [Urbanski] The process of our rapprochement with West European organizations began in 1989 with the great "fall of the peoples," but its first formal effects are beginning to appear only today. [Olechowski] We Poles are naturally impatient. In addition, we have a "demanding" attitude to the world, which stems from our sense of having been instrumental in spreading peace in Europe; it is enough to mention Solidarity, Lech Walesa, and so on. Nevertheless, we must remember that we want to join an existing community which has forged a mutually satisfying coexistence as a result of a series of difficult compromises. In addition, we must remember the problem of the actual organizational and decision-related capabilities: It is not without significance whether there are a dozen or twenty countries in any given community. Finally, the people of the countries belonging to the European Community must first approve our accession to the Community: They must become accustomed to the idea of cooperation with us and the possibility of the need to defend our borders. When we view all these things in the light of the need for mutual integration, four years do not appear to be too long at all. It took much longer for Spain to be accepted into NATO and the EEC. [Urbanski] How should we demonstrate our active involvement in Partnership for Peace? [Olechowski] The role played by a partner state is fairly well defined in that program. A partner is a state which has adopted NATO's values and principles concerning the behavior of a member in matters of military and foreign policies and which is ready to take an active part in all operations designed to uphold or restore peace and in emergency rescue actions in Europe. Participation in such operations will require the assignment, training, and equipment of military units so that they are compatible with NATO requirements. At the same time, that will constitute a test designed to show whether the given country is capable--in military terms--of NATO membership. The carrying out of such adjustment operations will require financial outlays. Some countries, including Poland, will strive for integration with NATO. On the other hand, those countries which decide to choose a different model of political development or else decide not to cooperate militarily with NATO, can still be passive members of Partnership for Peace or they can opt for taking no part in the program. [Urbanski] How much truth is there in the assertion that it was pressure exerted by Poland that was responsible for Partnership for Peace assuming its final shape? [Olechowski] We do not know that for sure because some of the talks were held behind closed doors. We are convinced that other participants beside us spoke about those points in which the final version of Partnership for Peace differs from the original draft. Nevertheless, it was certainly we who raised the level of the public debate as high as it was as we articulated clearly what we were striving for. Those negotiations, in any case, should have been held out in the open, because they touch on issues that are of principal importance for the state. Therefore it would be most important for politicians to get to know the public's opinions and reactions. Of course, such a manner of conducting negotiations involves its own price. It is a method similar to the manner of our negotiations concerning debt reduction, which we also held out in the open. The point of departure for those was a targeted 80-percent reduction; in the end, we obtained 50 percent, and that was a great success. Even so, some people still considered it a failure. This time also a part of the population might regard the outcome of our negotiations over Partnership for Peace as a failure. We consider the absence of a precise timetable of events designed to bring us closer to NATO a highly disappointing and frustrating circumstance. However, we should view it from a more general perspective of transformations in the global politics and from the viewpoint of the other side, which has no precisely defined vision. That is why it is difficult for us to obtain such concrete details. [Urbanski] What allies do we have in our attempts to secure these details? [Olechowski] All the countries of the Visegrad group which have identical chances of entering NATO. The Baltic states, on the other hand, are less well prepared for such a move, and for them the absence of such a prospect is at present a more advantageous solution. We have allies in Germany, and I also sense that there is a compatibility with our interests on the part of the United States. We have heard a most categorical assurance that the security of the United States as well as European NATO members depends directly on our own security. Anyone who views the issue of security in global terms will also think about Poland's security, whereas those who think of it as a regional concern will tend to forget about us. [Urbanski] In recent weeks we witnessed a diplomatic offensive on the part of our biggest Eastern neighbor, who opposed the idea of a speedy expansion of NATO membership. Should we fear Russia? [Olechowski] We need not fear Russia in the immediate future, because it has no designs on us. On the other hand, we should be afraid of the failure and collapse of democracy in Russia. Fortunately, the results of the recent election show that the enemies of democracy there are in the minority--albeit a vocal minority. A democratic, strong, and prosperous Russia would be an ideal dream neighbor for us. [Urbanski] In addition to strong criticism of our concept of European security, statements made by Russian politicians nowadays contain two additional, highly menacing elements: an attempt to invoke the right of veto against NATO's decisions, and assertions that Poland still lies within the Russian sphere of influence. [Olechowski] These signals suggest that many people in Russia still think in terms of the historical past. However, there is a certain attenuating circumstance. Russia is simply too big ever to become a rank-and-file element of any system. If I were the Russian foreign minister, I would also set out to oppose any final decisions concerning a new security system until a definitive vision of Russia's place and role in the world is formulated--a vision that will successfully match both Russia's power and its needs. On the other hand, we are deeply concerned about the fact that Russian politicians have been trying to dictate their neighbors' moves and behavior. That is inadmissible. [Urbanski] A new opinion was recently voiced in the American press: that Partnership for Peace also represents a chance for Ukraine.... [Olechowski] The inclusion of Ukraine in the program is a most important question from our viewpoint. I would not even imagine a situation in which Partnership for Peace could embrace only East European countries. In such an event the "frontier line" would be moved to our Eastern border, and that is not at all in our interest. We would than become a "frontier state." [Urbanski] Have our political forces in Poland reached a consensus on the question of how to ensure security for our state? [Olechowski] It is enough to scan the news announcements carried by newspapers of all political orientations. It seems to me that there is total agreement as to the principal direction of our foreign policy. Many prominent and influential politicians representing individual groups support our current line in foreign policy. It is true that in that respect I am a particularly lucky minister. [Urbanski] Over the past months I noted several opinions by our politicians at home in which they set out proposals for foreign regional cooperation--for example, linking Bonn with Warsaw and Moscow. What do you think of such proposals? [Olechowski] We could carry out a brief analysis of these alternative concepts. One of them claims that we should declare neutrality. However, we would be too weak on our own to be able to repulse a possible threat to our security. Nor could we really consider disarmament, either, because all too quickly someone would take a lively interest in claiming our piece of "unguarded property." It would only be possible to set up regional cooperation with our neighbors in the south; however, these countries are militarily just as weak. Again, it would not be feasible to to set up regional cooperation based on one of our Western neighbors--for example, Germany--because in order to do that we would have had to make an earlier active effort to break up NATO, and that would be an act of patent insanity. Such an action would be to the detriment of European as well as world interests, and it would directly contravene the idea of integration. Consequently, what remains is the Eastern option, that is, building a community of states around Russia. However, as things are today, we would have to beg Russia on our knees to consider such an idea, because we are not a serious partner for it either in terms of political or economic interest. As far as Russia is concerned, a serious economic partner would be one that could offer it financial credits; in a certain sense, then, such a position could be bought. Therefore, if we were to secure enough money to finance such a scheme, we could strengthen our position quite considerably. An additional argument against that option is that Russia is not as yet a democratic state. Each of the above solutions would be unattractive from the perspective of our civilizational development. Poles have always shown a marked leaning toward the West: our culture, our civilization, and our religion all have their roots there. [Urbanski] Do you agree with the thesis that Poland has chosen the Westward path also in order to bring its economic relations with Russia to a higher level? [Olechowski] I do. I believe that we should act as a coorganizer of economic cooperation between Europe and Russia. If Poland approaches the Western level of economic development while Russia, Ukraine, and other countries to the east of our borders remain at the stage of having no market economy owing to the lack of support from the outside and the world's reluctance to make room for them in the global markets, then the increasing difference in our potentials could create great tensions that might eventually threaten an explosion. Polish economic interests oblige us to take an active part in the process of building a democratic and wealthy Russia. The eastern markets are a natural opening for us. Many Polish cities grew and developed through trading with Russia. We should strive even today to ensure that Polish suppliers have the optimum chances of reaching Russian markets, so that in the future we can set up well-functioning channels of economic cooperation. [Urbanski] Where can we find the funds to finance such a scheme? [Olechowski] All programs stipulating development of commercial exchange with Russia should receive favorable bank loans. We have been pressing for this for a number of years, but somehow the finance minister's hand would always tremble before he made the decision to sign such an agreement. However, I will keep insisting that it is a mistake not do do that. We should protect ourselves against the possibility of dropping out of the Russian market, and we must act with a view to establishing the best possible contacts there. [Urbanski] Do you expect that the government will reach a consensus in this matter? [Olechowski] We must explain the ins and outs of the whole issue carefully in order to preclude the possibility of misconceptions. For the time being we are preparing ourselves calmly and carefully to present the integrated picture of the premises of our policy as regards our Eastern neighbors. We want to breathe a new spirit into our relations with them, but for the time being we must wait until the present state of tension eases a little. There is no doubt that my recent statements did not quite match the declarations made by Mr. Kozyrev and other Russian politicians. [Urbanski] What dreams do you cherish as foreign minister? [Olechowski] I hope that during 1994 or 1995 we will see a clearly mapped-out route to NATO. However, I would not like to see Poland become a NATO member as a result of an emergency because of a destabilization of the situation in Russia. It is a dream of mine that by the year 2000 we are, alongside Russia, democratic partners within NATO.
