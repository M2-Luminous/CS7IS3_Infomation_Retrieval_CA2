Pak Pom-chin as its new spokesman on Saturday. The party accepted resignations handed in by Spokesman Ha Sun-pong and three deputy spokesmen -- Cho Yong-chik, O Chang-sop and Son Hak-kyu earlier in the day. New deputy spokesmen are expected to be named on Monday. Explaining the background of the change, DLP Secretary-General Mun Chong-su said, "Spokesman Ha expressed his intention to resign and the party accepted the resignations of Ha and the three deputy spokesmen to change the atmosphere in the spokesman's office." Ha reportedly resigned assuming responsibility for the tension between the DLP and the Democratic Party created by his recent remarks that retired opposition leader Kim Tae-chung had covertly encouraged the opposition Democratic Party to adopt a hard-line stance toward the ruling party. New DLP Spokesman Pak, 54, was born in Chechon-kun, North Chungchong Province, and graduated from the political science department at Seoul National University. He worked at the CHOSON ILBO and served as editorial writer for the SEOUL SINMUN.
