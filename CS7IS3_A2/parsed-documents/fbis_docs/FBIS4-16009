FBIS4-16009 "drsov071_p_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 CAUCASUS Armenia Official Condemnation of Bombing Official Condemnation of Bombing NC1204202194 Yerevan Radio Yerevan in Azeri 1330 GMT 12 Apr 94 NC1204202194 Yerevan Radio Yerevan Azeri BFN ["Text" of Armenian Government statement on 9 April] [Text] Azerbaijan's military aircraft infiltrated the airspace of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and bombed several residential areas, including Stepanakert, on 10 April. The bombed areas are far away from the front line. The densely populated market-place area in Stepanakert was selected as a target. Significant damage was caused and many people, mainly women and children, were killed. Regrettably, the international community has failed to properly assess the policy of bombarding peaceful residential areas, which has been maintained since 1992. That has created an opportunity for Azerbaijan to continue to bomb residential areas without being penalized for such operations. Azerbaijan's savage operations have reconfirmed that the republic has not relinquished its policy of state terrorism against NKR's people. The objective of that policy is to kill peaceful residents. However, that is a gross violation of international law and the Geneva Convention. Obviously, it is aimed at further expanding the confrontation and undermining the recent initiatives that have been made to restore peace in the region. The Armenian Supreme Council declares that Azerbaijan will be held fully responsible for similar activities in the future. It also appeals to the UN secretary general, the CSCE, the CIS, the European Parliament, and the parliaments of individual countries to consider the military operations against peaceful people, take practical and urgent measures as called for by international law, prevent the bombing of residential areas, and obstruct Azerbaijan's unacceptable activities. Terrorist activity took place in Georgia's Marneuli Rayon on the night between 8 and 9 April. One of the passenger cars of the train on the Tbilisi-Yerevan track was destroyed by an explosion. Three passengers were killed and 15 others were wounded in the incident. Five passenger cars were completely destroyed by the fire caused by the explosion. The engineering installations and passenger cars on the Tbilisi-Yerevan track have been damaged by explosions 20 times and the natural-gas pipeline in the region has been sabotaged 12 times since the beginning of 1993. The fact that acts of sabotage against Armenia have taken place in an area populated by Azerbaijani people in Georgia leaves no doubt about who is responsible for terrorist activities. Obviously, Azerbaijan, in contravention of all international norms, has selected Georgia's territory as the venue of the operations it wishes to carry out to realize its objectives. That is an indication of the effort it has been making to involve Armenia and Georgia in the confrontation. There must be an end to that kind of international terrorism, which has assumed violent proportions. The Armenian Government states that all necessary measures will be taken to guarantee the security of Armenia's citizens and safeguard Armenia's interests. Azerbaijan's leaders will be fully responsible for the worsening of the situation in the future. The Armenian Government hopes that Georgia's leaders will take practical measures to guarantee security of transportation between Georgia and Armenia. Dated: Yerevan City, 9 April 1994.
