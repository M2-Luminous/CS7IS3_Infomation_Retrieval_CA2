FBIS TRENDS-06APR94-JORDAN New TV News Program, Broadcasting Chief New TV News Program, Broadcasting Chief In an apparent effort to modernize and expand its Arabic-language news programming, state-run Jordan TV recently inaugurated a weekly news magazine entitled "60 Minutes," which replaces the station's 30-minute nightly newscast on Fridays. According to an official announcement, the new program is intended "to develop the ordinary newscast into a comprehensive, objective, and accurate news magazine to keep up with media technology, which is progressing continuously" (Jordan TV, 25 March). To date, programs aired have included a "special news report" on Jordanian-Arab relations in the wake of King Husayn's recent visits to Oman and Qatar; reports on the impact of the UN inspection of ships bound for al-'Aqaba port; segments on domestic issues, including features on crime and human rights; and a general mix of economic, regional, and international news (Jordan TV, 25 March, l April). In an apparently unrelated development, Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani announced the retirement of Jordan Radio and Television Corporation Director General Radi Alkhas--without further comment or explanation--and named Ibrahim Shahzadah as acting head. Shahzadah, previously director of Jordan Television, has been associated with Jordan radio and television since 1957 (Jordan Times, 22 March). (AUTHOR: MURRAY.
