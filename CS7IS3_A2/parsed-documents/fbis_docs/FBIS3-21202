Figure 1 shows the changes in the design rule, wafer size, and ion implantation technology used with each generation of DRAMs. In recent years, oblique rotation implantation equipment has been put to practical use with medium-current machines, and parallel-beam equipment has also been developed. With large-current machines, the electron shower has been improved to reduce charge-up and a high-performance plasma flood gun has been developed. High-energy (up to MeV) ion implanters have passed the R&D stage and are now starting to be used in mass production. In addition to the above, 256M DRAMs with more advanced microminiaturization require the improvement of low-energy implantation performance for the fabrication of shallow junctions. Previous technological trends -- that is the requirements to reduce the particles, contamination and charge-up, and improve implantation accuracy -- will become more severe following the microminiaturization of devices and the increase in wafer size. On the other hand, in actual equipment operation, improvements in the basic performance of production facilities such as automation, higher operating ratios, and easy maintenance will also be important. Figure 1. Different DRAM Generations and Changes in Ion This report describes the requirements of these items from the user perspective for the ion implantation equipment to be used with 256M DRAMs. Low-Energy Implantation Technology for the fabrication of shallow junctions is important for 256M DRAMs with a junction depth of about 0.1 �m. Formation of junctions in the particularly shallow p[.sup]+[/] layer is difficult and has been dealt with by BF[.sup]2[/] implantation[.sup]1[/] or pre-amorphizing implantation.[.sup]2,3[/] The BF[.sup]2[/] implantation is advantageous with its possibilities of lowering the virtual acceleration energy and increasing the beam current. However, its use in processes is restricted due to such problems as the roughness of high-melting-point metal surfaces due to fluorine[.sup]4[/] or the segregation of fluorine, which was redistributed during annealing, in residual defects near the interface between the amorphous layer and single crystals.[.sup]5[/] Pre-amorphizing can be achieved by a method using Si or Ge[.sup]2[/] or a method using N[.sup]3[/] but in any case B[.sup]3[/] should be implanted at no more than 10 keV to obtain shallow junctions. However, if implantation energy is decreased using a conventional, electrostatic-scanning-type medium-current machine, the in-plane uniformity deteriorates as shown in Figure 2(a). This is thought to be because the in-beam charge density becomes non-uniform as the beam expands during beam travel. In addition, medium-current machines with parallel-beam implantation are also required to maintain beam parallelism at low energy. On the other hand, large-current machines also have problems in the decrease of beam current and drop of throughput when the implantation energy is decreased as shown in Figure 2(b). With large-current machines, it is desirable to develop equipment which allows uniform implantation and high throughput even at low energy. Figure 2. Implantation Energy Dependence of Ion Charge-Up Electrostatic breakdown due to charge-up is dependent on the device structure, manufacturing flow, and ion-implantation conditions. Increase in integration scale makes the gate-oxide film thinner and gate area smaller, and the increase in wafer size requires implantation with a larger beam current to assure the required throughput. These factors are intensifying the problem of electrostatic breakdown. To reduce electrostatic breakdown, attempts have been made to reduce the charge density of the ion beam in ion implantation equipment by neutralizing charges with an electron shower and enlarging the ion beam diameter. The first electron showers developed irradiated the target with primary electrons and supplied the generated secondary electrons to the wafer. However, problems have been found with the re-entry of primary electrons with high energy, and in the response of the feedback control of the amount of irradiation. To deal with these problems, methods are being studied for preventing the arrival of high-energy electrons at the wafer by applying a magnetic or electric field[.sup]6,7[/] and a plasma-flood method which produces plasma near the wafer to prevent its charge-up with electrons. The plasma-flood method is attractive in principle because it allows neutralization using low-energy electrons alone, and can assure a wide process margin without complicated condition setting. Conversely, additional study is required on the influence of generating a plasma near the wafer. Figure 3 shows an example of reduction of electrostatic breakdown using a plasma flood gun,[.sup]8[/] which has provided favorable results. Figure 3. Reduction of Electrostatic Breakdown Using Enlarging the beam diameter is also effective for reducing electrostatic breakdown, and equipment should be designed considering contamination due to sputtering in the beam line. Particles and Contamination About 80 to 90 percent of defects in DRAMs from 64M to 256M are due to particles on the wafer or its contamination by metals. It is also said that 95 percent of all particles at the 256M DRAM level may be derived from the manufacturing equipment. Every equipment manufacturer has expended special efforts to ensure clean manufacturing, but as microminiaturization advances, particle control should involve smaller particle sizes and the equipment to meet this requirement. Figure 4 illustrates changes over time of the particles of specific implantation equipment. Particle control, considering particle diameters of 0.3 �m or more, may not identify any abnormality because it does not find a variation in the number of particles, but an increase in the number of particles due to an abnormality in a certain period can be identified by monitoring particles with diameters of 0.17 �m or more. As seen here, without due control and reduction by monitoring even very fine particles, the yield could drop while the cause would not be identified. The measurement of the number of particles gets difficult as the particle size decreases but, as it has been reported based on experience, even particles of around one-tenth the minimum size of the device can cause an adverse effect.[.sup]9[/] Figure 4. Changes in Number of Particles of Ion It is well known that contamination by metals such as Fe, Cr, Ni, and Al in general increases the junction leakage current. The advancement of microminiaturization toward the 256M DRAM will increase the sensitivity to contamination due to shallower junctions and a smaller peripheral length reduction ratio.[.sup]10[/] This problem will increase if low-temperature annealing, which can reduce impurity diffusion, is used to form shallow junctions. Figure 5 shows an example in which metal contamination is reduced by covering with Si the part that would be sputtered by the ion beam. It achieved a low leakage current of 10[.sup]-7[/] A/cm[.sup]2[/] even with low-temperature annealing at 500�C.[.sup]11[/] Figure 5. Reverse Current Density at n[.sup]+[/]p Device microminiaturization will continue to drive the battle against particle and metal contamination. Wafer Size Increase Wafers with 8-inch or larger diameters will be used in the age of 256M DRAMs and it is highly probable that 12-inch wafers will be used in mass production.[.sup]12[/] To maintain the in-plane uniformities of the implantation quantity and depth even with large-size wafers, technology for aligning the ion beam incident angle in the wafer plane is essential for medium-current machines using ion-beam scanning. Reducing the in-plane variations in incident angle by using a longer beam line is advantageous in terms of its lower price but, when equipment size and performance are taken into consideration, the predominant equipment used in the future will be parallel-beam equipment. Basic Performance of Production Facilities Apart from the requirements for 256M DRAM-compatible ion implantation equipment from the viewpoint of process technology as described above, it is also important to improve the basic performance of ion implantation equipment by recognizing that it is a production facility. To improve the operating ratio, what is required is to reduce the failure frequency and to extend the service life of the ion source. Reduction of the failure frequency may not need any explanation. Extension of the service life of the ion source has been attempted by extending filament life, but the implantation capability of recent equipment is often affected by discharges due to contamination inside the ion source as well as the filament life. Future improvements should take this into consideration. While equipment automation has progressed, the error rate in the auto mode is so high that the reliability is not sufficient for use in automated fabrication in the age of the 256M DRAMs. This is not only due to software; errors also occur due to matching errors between software and hardware resulting from deviations in hardware adjustment. A reliable automated hardware/software system is necessary if the industry is to move forward. As for the processing capacity, while the equipment is operating the processing capacity is determined by such factors as wafer transportation, beam set-up, implantation operation and beam shut-down. Of these, the operation which presently takes the most time is automatic beam set-up. This is especially true in the R&D line where continuous processing of several lots using the same implantation condition is rather rare, and much time is required for auto set-up every time the implantation condition is to be changed. Also, as the source condition varies gradually during use, there are cases in which the beam will not start smoothly with the initially set parameters. To allow quick auto-beam start-up regardless of source condition changes in time, a measure such as the provision of learning functions may be necessary. Obviously, there is much room for automation improvement. It is almost needless to mention that for size reduction, operability and equipment safety are important. Recent equipment features better operability in the stationary state thanks to touch-screen input and various monitoring systems; operability and safety in non-stationary states such as during maintenance should also be considered. The equipment must be made user-friendly, for example, by designating the points where periodical maintenance is required to relieve operators of that concern. Conclusion We described above the performance required for 256M DRAM-compatible ion implantation equipment from the user standpoint. From the viewpoint of process technology, the important topic is to improve the low-energy implantation performance as well as the extensions of previous technological trends such as dust generation reduction, contamination reduction, charge-up reduction and implantation accuracy improvement. From the production viewpoint, the pursuit of improved reliability including reduced failure rate and ion source-life extension, automation, improved operability and greater safety is desirable.
