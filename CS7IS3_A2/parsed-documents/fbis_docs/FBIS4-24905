The American journalists and their Chinese driver were taken to a police station for an identity check and questioning after filming on the square ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 4, 1989 crushing of the pro-democracy movement. All their videotape was confiscated, the journalist told AFP, adding that police had accused the CBS team of working without authorization and having filmed the heavy security deployments on the square. Fearing incidents commemorating the massacre, the government has stepped up police surveillance around the Chinese capital.
