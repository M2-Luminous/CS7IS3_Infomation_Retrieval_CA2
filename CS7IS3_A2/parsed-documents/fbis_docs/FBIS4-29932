Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening, Kantor said he expects his discussion with Kakizawa to cover all aspects of the so-called framework trade talks with Japan. But Kantor did not give a precise date for the planned meeting, saying it depends on Kakizawa's schedule. Under the framework negotiations designed to rectify the chronic trade imbalance between the two countries, the U.S. is pressing Japan to set "objective criteria" to measure progress in market-opening. But Tokyo rejects binding criteria, saying they could lead to managed trade.
