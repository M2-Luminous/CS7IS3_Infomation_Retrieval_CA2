Qian Qichen said this in a speech to the Second Plenary Meeting of the Executive Council of the Overseas Exchanges Association of China. Qian Qichen said: "In the four years since the founding of the Overseas Exchange Association of China, it has played a positive role in giving publicity to China's achievements in its reform, opening, and economic construction, in promoting unity and friendship with Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese descent, and in developing cooperation and exchanges with overseas Chinese communities and foreign citizens of Chinese origin. I hope that the association will continue to play a better role in these aspects in the future." Qian Qichen held: The new situation requires further expansion of China's overseas exchanges so that China may better understand the world and the world may also better understand China. This will thus set higher requirements for the work of the Overseas Exchange Association of China and will also create a broader scope of activity for the association. When talking about the concrete hopes pinned on the Overseas Exchange Association, Qian Qichen said: Economic construction is the central task of the CPC and the Chinese Government. Our work in all trades should be closely tied to this central task. The work of the Overseas Exchange Association and its local branches at all levels should also be conducted closely around the central task. Only thus will they play an effective role as they should. After analyzing China's economic situation in the last two years, he said: When the world economy remained in a recession, there was sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in China. The 1.2 billion Chinese people display broad market prospects, which have aroused interest and attention from more and more countries in the world and are greatly attractive to overseas investors and entrepreneurs, including overseas Chinese investors and entrepreneurs. This provides a favorable environment for the Overseas Exchange Association to conduct its work in order to serve our country's economic construction. Qian Qichen said: In the development of foreign relations, mass organizations involved in foreign activities constitute an indispensable force, and their role should be brought into full play. Such organizations may have different characters and perform different functions, but they share one common point. That is, they are doing the work of making friends, building up friendship, promoting communication, increasing exchanges, and seeking common ground. The Overseas Exchange Association is oriented to Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese origin. It has a large number of contacts among overseas Chinese in various social strata and has built up a rather profound friendship with some of them. Being mass organizations in some specific communities, the local branches of the Overseas Exchanges Association at all levels keep natural blood relations and fellow countryman fraternity with overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese origin. With these favorable conditions, they may more naturally and more flexibly make friends in a broad scope. At the same time, Qian Qichen also hoped that overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese origin will settle down and take root in the foreign countries where they are living, and will get along in good terms with local people and make contributions to local economic development. When talking about the role of the Overseas Exchanges Association of China in promoting the motherland's peaceful reunification, Qian Qichen said: To resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and to realize "peaceful reunification" between the two sides of the straits, we not only need cooperation between the Chinese and British Governments and between the Chinese and Portuguese Governments and pin hopes on the Taiwan authorities, but also need to rely on an increasing patriotic and reunification-upholding force among the compatriots in all social strata in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan and rely on the joint efforts of all Chinese people and people of Chinese origin at home and abroad who support China's reunification. Because the local branches of the Overseas Exchange Association have broad and close connections with overseas Chinese, foreign citizens of Chinese origin, and the business communities and people in all social strata of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, they should actively give publicity to the policy of "one country, two systems" and other guidelines, principles, and policies for realizing China's peaceful reunification through their connections among Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese origin. This will certainly be conducive to increasing exchanges, understanding, and common ground between the mainland on the one side and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan on the other side, thus promoting the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao and speeding up the process of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait. Today's plenary meeting of the Second Executive Council of the Overseas Exchange Association of China was chaired by Qian Weichang, chairman of the association. Liao Hui, vice chairman of the association, delivered a work report in which he reviewed the association's work in 1993 and outlined the 1994 work plan. At today's meeting, 46 new members headed by Chen Ziying were added to the Executive Council, and 16 new members were added to the Standing Committee of the Executive Council. Zhu Youjun, director of ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE, was appointed to be new secretary general for the association.
