Training Is Continuing"] [Text] As reported earlier, Ukrainian Air Force command staff exercises were conducted from 29 to 31 March. After these were completed, Col. Gen. Ivan Bizhan conducted a detailed analysis of the exercises and summed up their results at the Main Headquarters of the Air Force, which is located in Vinnytsya. In his speech to the Air Force leadership, he noted, first and foremost, that although the global threat of war breaking out in the world no longer exists, there is an increased threat of local regional conflicts flaring up. To prevent this, it is necessary not only to have Armed Forces, but also to maintain them in a combat ready state. This is why it is essential to conduct a wide variety of exercises and training. The main goal of the unilateral two-stage command staff exercises that were conducted on the base of the Directorate of the Air Force of Ukraine, the air army, and the groups of long-distance and transport aviation was to hone the professional skills of commanders at all levels, as well as to improve coordination of action among the organs of the directorate and with the Anti-Aircraft Defense Forces [PPO] and the aviation [component] of the Naval Forces. Col. Gen. Ivan Bizhan made a point of stressing that no neighboring state was imagined in the role of the enemy during the exercises. The enemy forces were called "Western" and "Southwestern." These were imaginary states and their armed forces. Standing against them were the "Eastern" forces -- i.e., Ukraine and her Armed Forces. The "legend" or condition underlying the command staff exercise was one possible variant of the eruption of an armed conflict and the launching of military actions against our state. The exercise anticipated military action on a rather wide front, up to five massive air strikes, amphibious landings, etc. The "Eastern" forces developed plans for committing the Air Force to action and conducting a defensive air operation in three phases. How well did they succeed? In his speech, the deputy minister of defense noted that, on the whole, the exercise had been performed according to the established guidelines. The plan for the conduct of the military actions, which had been presented to the chief of training, General of the Army Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, by the commander of the Air Force, Lt. Gen. Volodymyr Antonets, generally met the standards of the task that had been set. The solutions implemented by the commanders of the air armies and aviation groups were also well-considered and appropriate to the simulated war conditions. However, a number of shortcomings were noted in the performance of the command structures. The higher the command or staff, the more clearly defined and coordinated must be their activities. This was not always the case, noted Col. Gen. Ivan Bizhan. He pointed out the shortcomings in the performance of specific officers. At the same time, he named the officers who perform their military duties conscientiously. Col. Leonid Podnosov, chief of intelligence of the 14th Air Army, exhibited a particularly high standard of professionalism and the ability to organize activity during the exercise in a timely and productive manner. These exercises demonstrated that problems can crop up where there should be no problems whatsoever -- in the system of relaying commands, battle plan instructions, and orders. These were sometimes late in reaching those who had to execute them. It was also noted that in planning such exercises, it is necessary to take into account the real state of affairs in the forces and the possible options for action in the event of a military threat. This will force commanders to prepare their subordinates with greater clarity of purpose in their everyday military training. And to create military structures in peacetime that in the face of a military threat will require the least number of structural changes, basing redeployment, and changes in stationing locations. It is necessary to create universal air bases at military airfields to service all types of aircraft, both in peacetime and in wartime. Other conclusions were also drawn on the basis of these exercises. The most important of these for future work, as the deputy defense minister noted, is that the training of staff officers must be significantly improved. This requires implementing the principle whereby a superior trains his subordinates. In conclusion, Col. Gen. Bizhan stated that he was confident that the military aviators would succeed in overcoming all the difficulties of this transitional period now that Lt. Gen. Volodymyr Antonets had assumed command over them, because their new commander has a great deal of experience, energy, ability, and all the other qualities necessary for working selflessly and productively.
