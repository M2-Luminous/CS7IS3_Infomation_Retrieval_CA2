FBIS4-51510 "dreas084__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-084-A Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Shinseito, Komeito Dominate New Cabinet Seats Shinseito, Komeito Dominate New Cabinet Seats OW2904131294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2904131294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito obtained eight and six ministerial seats respectively in the Hata cabinet formed on 28 April. The two parties hold almost three-quarters of the posts in the new cabinet. The "Ichi-Ichi line" between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa took the lead in managing the political situation during the Hosokawa administration. However, following the secession of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger] from the coalition administration, Shinseito and Komeito will play a leadership role in the Hata administration as well. Giving consideration to possible criticism regarding zoku Dietmen [influential Diet members concerned with specific issues], in the past such posts as transportation and construction minister, whose tasks are linked to the interests of private companies, have mainly been given to the SDPJ. However, these posts as well as the minister of posts and telecommunications have been given mostly to Komeito because Shinseito hesitated to accept them. Of the seven posts that had been given to the SDPJ and Sakigake during the Hosokawa administration, three went to Shinseito, two to Komeito, and one to the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. The remaining post, plus one other, which had previously been given to the Japan New Party [JNP], went to the "former reform group" and the Liberal Party, which joined the coalition after last August. Since it did not have suitable candidates, when the Hosokawa cabinet was formed the JNP gave three ministerial posts which had originally been allocated to the same party to ordinary citizens who were not politicians, and two posts to the United Social Democratic Party. Although the number of ministerial posts the JNP had was reduced to two, Yoshio Terasawa became the party's first minister. Since the Hata administration, which is a minority government, is expected to face difficulties in managing state affairs, and since some Shinseito members, mainly young members, feel uneasy about the future, Shinseito will give priority to "strengthening the party structure." The party decided to allow the retention of their party posts to Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general who assists Ichiro Ozawa; Hajime Funada, standing board member; and Keisuke Nakanishi, standing board member who is in charge of elections and organization. Regarding the selection of a chief cabinet secretary, which was a focal point of the recent cabinet lineup, Shinseito studied the possibility of appointing to the post Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP, in order to strengthen cooperative ties. However, Prime Minister Hata wanted to choose a person who could act as liaison between Hata and Ozawa. Therefore, an agreement was reached to give the post to Hiroshi Kumagai, former international trade and industry minister and a close associate of Ozawa. Kumagai is the one who began forming the new group called "Kaishin." However, some senior Shinseito members who are critical of the hasty formation of "Kaishin" are coolly assessing the selection of Kumagai, saying: "It is a selection designed to make the organizer of `Kaishin' assume responsibility for the blunder until the end." Regarding a proposal to appoint Mutsuki Kato to the post of finance minister, Shinseito members strongly opposed it, saying that "he joined the party only six months ago." Instead he became agriculture, forestry, and fisheries minister. Keeping an eye on the second reorganization of the political world, Komeito brought back to the party former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki, who is a candidate to be the next Komeito secretary general. Wakako Hironaka, former director general of the Environment Agency, was initially scheduled to remain in her post. However, since Minister of Construction Koji Morimoto and Mikio Oomi, director general of the Science and Technology Agency, were elected from the Kinki bloc, Komeito gave consideration to the need to maintain a regional balance. Because of this, Toshiko Hamayotsu, a member of both the Komeito executive committee and the House of Representatives who was elected from the Tokyo electoral district, was chosen among Komeito female lawmakers to be director general of the Environment Agency. Hata wanted to appoint a member of the group which recently joined the coalition to a ministerial post, hoping it will encourage LDP members to secede from their party. Accordingly Koji Kakizawa, who once was parliamentary vice minister of foreign affairs, was appointed to the post of foreign minister whose visit to the Middle East is drawing near.
