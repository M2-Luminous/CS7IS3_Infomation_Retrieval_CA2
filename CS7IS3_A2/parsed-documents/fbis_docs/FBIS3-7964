This senseless act has struck a fierce blow to the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement and added that it was in the interest of the people of Palestine and Israel to do everything in order to avoid that this incident leads to the increase of tension and escalation of the conflict. Consistent to the principles of the peaceful resolution of conflicts as the only way to effectively solve problems in the international community, the F.R.Y. underscores the importance of continuing peace talks between Israel and the PLO with the aim of establishing a just and stable peace in the Middle East, the statement said.
