He said he will fight "for social justice in Congress so that veterans no longer receive a miserable salary from miserable people." Oviedo yesterday made a speech at the Cerro Cora of Campo Grande Club during an homage paid to Chaco war veterans on the day Paraguayans commemorate the "Chaco Peace." Some 2,000 people attended the meeting, including a great number of politicians working for different Colorado Party factions. The political tone of his speech was noticeable. Oviedo said in Guarani: "Everyone can speak, but no one can go around doing just anything he wants to. We will respect and see to it that others respect our Constitution. We will make laws that are in accordance with the Constitution." To stress his position he said: "The military will continue to exist, despite those who do not like it, as the green uniform was born with the Paraguayan fatherland. We will not allow our flag to be used for personal purposes or for the subjugation of the people for the benefit of the few." Oviedo said: "The military are the pillar and support for this incipient democracy." The military chief came out in defense of veterans, stressing that "we will struggle with you for justice in Congress, so that you no longer receive a miserable salary from miserable people." This was a direct reference to opposition legislators. He added: "If we are really human, we must be grateful." He promised to struggle in Congress "to achieve justice for our just and honorable veterans within the shortest possible period of time." "If this Congress really represents the people, here (referring to Chaco war veterans) are the people's most deserving and meritorious members." Oviedo also mentioned Juan Carlos Wasmosy, because he, too, is the son of a veteran. Oviedo characterized the opposition as "a bunch of cowards," adding that they are the ones who probably do not like the military. Oviedo regretted the fact that "we are traveling among people who sow discord," and questioned the attitude of those who criticize his work and speak of a civilian and a military society. "Yes, we are traveling among people who sow discord, hate, animosity, and slander. We are doing little for our country in this way," Oviedo said. The military chief once again reiterated the need for social justice and unity "to overcome ignorance, health problems, and poverty."
