In this respect, the critics usually give first place to the land reform. Precisely for this reason, it is necessary to know the true situation with the land reform. In contrast to the restitution of property, from which a few percent of the town population obtained benefit, the agrarian reform affects the overwhelming majority of the Bulgarian people, inasmuch as just before and immediately after World War II three-quarters of the population obtained their subsistence from agriculture, and for this reason were connected either directly or through relatives with the ownership of a larger or smaller amount of land. It emerges from a special public opinion poll commissioned with the National Center for Investigating Public Opinion that 69 percent of the population expected to regain possession of agricultural land. In rural areas, the figure was 92 percent. Information gathered under the Agricultural Land Act also indicates a similar picture. Up to November 1993, on the basis of applications submitted for the return of land, the land commissions issued 1.93 million decisions recognizing ownership titles under Article 18, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Agricultural Land Act, relating to a total of 51.06 million decares of land. However, many of the decisions made concerned land claimed by two or more heirs, because of which a total of over 3 million land claims were received. This means that over half of the adult population submitted claims. In its program, the government initially announced that it would return 80 percent of the agricultural land to which claims had been laid by the end of 1993, but as early as in April 1993 this commitment was adjusted to 55-60 percent, following a careful assessment of the real possibilities in this direction. The latter figure remains "enshrined" in all the official statements issued from the spring until now. These are the results of the government's work in this direction to the end of 1993. Up to the end of November 1993, ownership titles to agricultural land were restored as follows: -- ownership within existing or restored real boundaries: 6.59 million decares; -- ownership through a land division plan: 11.73 million decares, making a total of 18.32 million decares. To this amount one has to add 11.65 million decares for which temporary ownership certificates have been issued (in respect to claims covering about 70 percent of the recognized land), making a grand total of 29.97 million decares. To these figures one has to add the results achieved in December 1993, which have still not been properly recorded statistically. The probable figure for land restored to its owners in December will be around 3.2 million decares, plus about 0.3 million decares in respect of which temporary ownership has been granted. Thus, in the final analysis, by the end of 1993 about 33.5 million decares of land was returned to its owners, representing 65 percent of the land for which claims had been submitted. This shows that in general terms the government has fulfilled its commitment to restore ownership of "60-65 percent of the land." True, the issue of temporary ownership certificates does not legally constitute full restoration of land ownership within specific (actual) boundaries, but in practice, thanks to the work of the land division companies, the owner can already cultivate land almost equivalent to the land he claimed and for which his claim has been recognized by the appropriate land commission. It is true that during the first half of the year the implementation of the agrarian reform did not proceed at a sufficiently fast rate. Because of this, from July this year radical measures were taken to speed up the process. The results are self-evident from the chart showing a monthly breakdown of the total amounts of land handed over to its owners. [A graphic is appended to the article showing the cumulative amounts of land restored to its owners, expressed in millions of decares for each month of 1993; the chart shows the approximate amounts of land restored in the form of temporary ownership certificates, actually restored within real boundaries, and granted to the owners under the land division plan. According to the chart, in January 1993 approximately 5 million decares had been returned in all; by July, approximately 20 million decares, and by December over 40 million decares.] This trend indicates that by the summer of 1994 the process of returning ownership titles to agricultural land will be largely completed. It will still be necessary to complete the work in a limited number of villages with specific juridical or other problems that are holding up the work, for example due to procrastination in adopting court decisions on land boundary disputes between villages. A public opinion poll has shown that two-thirds of the population approves extending the deadline for returning land to June 1994. There are a number of basic causes that delay and hinder the process of farmland restoration, including the following: First, one should point out the false sworn declarations on land owned prior to the so-called collectivization (making up more than half of the false declarations made under oath.) These claims relate to more than 3 million decares of land that in fact does not exist. For this reason, the claims for restoration of land have turned out to cover a greater amount of land than actually existed in the land holdings prior to collectivization. This especially applies to Burgas, Lovech, and Khaskovo Oblasts. The Council of Ministers has submitted a bill to the National Assembly to resolve the problem, but parliament has yet to debate it. In many populated centers one encounters an organized (albeit secret) resistance to the land division plans on the part of various political forces. Often, this is a result of the desires of individual owners to obtain the land due to them in a particular locality and no other, desires that cannot be reconciled. A further major obstacle that one should mention is the fact that in many cases no documentary evidence of title is available because the old notarial acts have been lost, because documents were deliberately burnt when the owners entered the labor collective farms, and so forth. In many populated centers the process is hindered because the boundaries between the agricultural and forest lands have not been established. In many cases concerning the return of ecologically polluted lands, the work of the land commissions is hampered by the absence of a concrete assessment by other organs of the form and extent of the pollution (which governs what crops may be sown and the conditions under which the land in question may be restored to the owners). Major obstacles are being encountered in connection with the granting of state lands as compensation for other land or to landless peasants, as the law prescribes. The state land amounts only to 2.27 million decares (0.5 million decares of which is uncultivated land or pasture) and is extremely unevenly distributed, mainly in northeast Bulgaria, Plovdiv and Khaskovo districts, and elsewhere. Most of this land has been left for the liquidation councils to dispose of. The problem of the liquidation councils and the completion of their work is still unresolved. Of a total of 2,067 liquidation councils throughout the country, only 257 will complete their work by 31 December. Of the remaining 1,810 councils, 1,322 have already finished defining the land shares under Article 27, Paragraph 1 of the act, but only 195 have finished apportioning the land and property in real terms. Among the major objective reasons delaying the liquidation process, one should mention unresolved property lawsuits involving the former labor collective farms or the liquidation councils, the failure to complete financial audits, dues uncollected from various natural or juridical persons amounting to a total of 1.58 billion leva, the existence of stores of unusable plant protection agents and stocks of animals suffering from tuberculosis and leucosis, the failure of municipal land commissions to supply necessary information, and so on. In the case of 291 councils, the title holders do not want to receive the shares of property that are their due. Difficulties also arise from the fact that almost three- quarters of the liquidation councils have to continue production activities (spring sowing, harvesting) on a smaller or larger part of their land holdings. The coin of the agrarian reform also has a reverse side. This is the extensive fragmentation of land ownership and agricultural production that will ensue in the initial period and will hamper the competitiveness of our new agriculture (especially in the production of grain and certain industrial crops). Available data on land already returned to its owners confirm that most holdings range between 15 and 20 decares. Few holdings are more than 50 decares in area, and very few above 100 decares. One-fourth of the title holders are receiving back less than 10 decares, and many of these are receiving only one or two decares. On a plot of 5-10 decares one can, for example, cultivate a decent vegetable garden, but it is impossible to develop competitive production of wheat, sugar beet, sunflowers, and so on. Several ways of overcoming the fragmentation of land ownership and agrarian production are possible. The first is related to the sporadic concentration of ownership along the purchases-sales line. The historical practice in our state shows that we cannot rely on this (at least as far as the rapid and radical solution of the issue is possible). During the period of 1897-1911 the degree of concentration of the land ownership in Bulgaria preserved an almost constant level. During the period of 1920-1945 a clear process related to a significant fragmentation of the agrarian property and production emerged. Now we restore this fragmentation. The second possible way is related to leasing the land. This is especially important when one takes into consideration that about 45 percent of the new owners (mostly inheritors) are living in the cities and do not intend to cultivate the land they are entitled to by themselves. Major leased farms, cultivating up to several thousand decares of land, could emerge under those conditions. So far about 10 such farms have been created, but they are not a mass phenomenon and will not become such a phenomenon, because of the temporary and unstable character of their basis. In addition, it is very difficult to merge a large number of scattered agrarian plots into a single mechanical service bloc, among other things, because those plots must have a common border. The third way involves the establishments of owners' cooperatives, but the aforementioned difficulty (lack of a common border) applies also to this category. In addition, the owners who unite in a cooperative often do not posses the necessary ownership documents in which the precise borders of their plots are listed. A draft bill on the cadastre has been submitted to the parliament. This draft bill will help those who want to cultivate their plots together, to receive neighboring plots when the agrarian land is divided, within specific and real borders. However, this still is a matter of the future. So far in the country 1,200 cooperatives have been registered. They have a total of 7.2 million decares of land and 268,000 participants. Their total share of cultivated land is substantially higher than the 13 percent they formally own, because often those cooperatives cultivate more land than they own. This is a typical phenomenon in Burgas Oblast. However, the cooperatives issue is a rather politicized matter, and this hampers the correct solution of the issue from the view point of economic efficiency.
