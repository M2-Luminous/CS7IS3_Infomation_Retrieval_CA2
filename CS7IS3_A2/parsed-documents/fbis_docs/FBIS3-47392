Dr Suphachai said he expects the next ministerial-level meeting of the Growth Triangle -- Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia -- to formulate policies to enhance cooperation in cost saving, trade, investment, industry, energy, tourism and farming. He said longer opening hours at border checkpoints and lower tariffs would be a first step towards better Thai-Malaysia trade. Malaysia wants to shift some of its electronic industry to Chalung Industrial Estate in Thailand. But some Malaysian businesses say the estate is too small and land prices are too high, Dr Suphachai said. Some Malaysian companies have been buying land in Sungai Kolok to build a parts factory, he said. Turning to Indonesia, Dr Suphachai said he expected joint development in power plants, air services and joint fishing ventures.
