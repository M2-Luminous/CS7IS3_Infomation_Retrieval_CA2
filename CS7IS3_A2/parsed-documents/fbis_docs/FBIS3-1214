The news was conveyed to them shortly after 8PM by South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei, Mr Piet Goosen. Mr Goosen was escorted to a hall at the Bisho police college, where the strikers have been for most of the day, by members of the Border Regional Peace Committee. He read them a statement issued earlier by Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha. "The administration of Ciskei shall henceforth from tomorrow be by an administrator." He could not divulge the name but "I assure you that you know the gentleman in question...you will have faith in his ability to ensure a clean administration". He said it was in their interests and that of every citizen of Ciskei in South Africa that they did their best not to contribute to the "very volatile situation that exists". He pleaded for them to go back to work and asked them to "please" release two seconded South African policemen they were holding hostage. The hall erupted in jeers and boos. The appeal for the release was echoed by co-chairman of the peace committee Rev Godfrey Leeuw. Speakers from the floor said angrily that "no-one will leave this door until Brig Oupa Gqozo comes to address us". A speaker gave the ambassador the assurance the officers would not be harmed. Another speaker said "the ambassador must go put pressure on Gqozo to come address us tonight if the hostages are to be released here". Mr Goosen then left for nearby King William's Town saying he would telephone the Ciskei leader and put the proposal to him. The rest of Bisho was calm. The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday night decided that Brig Gqozo should be replaced by two administrators appointed by the TEC and the South African Government. African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said a TEC team should be sent to Ciskei immediately to relieve Brig Gqozo of his post. Government TEC representative Roelf Meyer said a South Africa's Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans should be dispatched to the homeland. The Ciskei's Mickey Webb said it was not a hostile takeover. He said Brig Gqozo was in agreement with the move because he wanted to save lives and prevent destruction of property.
