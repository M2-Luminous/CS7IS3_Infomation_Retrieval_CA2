Drafting Information The principal person involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Commander Don M. Wrye, Project Manager, and C.G. Green, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Background and Purpose On November 15, 1993, the Coast Guard published a final rule in the Federal Register (58 FR 60256) which revised 46 CFR Part 67 to implement a number of statutory initiatives to simplify and streamline the documentation process, to implement user fees for vessel documentation services, and to clarify the regulations and present them in a more orderly fashion. The final rule was the subject to two correction documents which appeared in the Federal Register on December 13, 1993, at 58 FR 65130 and 58 FR 65243. The final rule became effective on January 1, 1994. This rulemaking, among other things, corrects certain errors and omissions in the final rule. It also clarifies the citizenship requirements for a trust arrangement as a vessel-owning entity, and states the endorsements required for dredges and towing vessels.
