SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This interim final rule is issued under the Potato Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) [7 CFR Part 1207]. The Plan is authorized by the Potato Research and Promotion Act, as amended [7 U.S.C. 2611&hyph;2627], hereinafter referred to as the Act. This rule is exempt from Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 311 of the Act, a person subject to a plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such plan, any provision of such plan or any obligation imposed in connection with such plan is not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification of the plan or an exemption from the plan. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided that a complaint is filed within 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. There are an estimated 2,000 handlers, 6,000 producers, 80 importers of potatoes and potato products for human consumption, and 25 importers of seed potatoes who are subject to the provisions of the Plan. The majority of these persons may be classified as small agricultural producers and small agricultural service firms. Small agricultural producers are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5 million. The majority of potato handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
