Par. 28. Immediately following §25.2518&hyph;3 an undesignated center heading and §25.2512&hyph;5A are added to read as follows: Actuarial Tables Applicable Before May 1, 1989 §25.2512&hyph;5A Valuation of annuities, unitrust interests, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred before May 1, 1989. (a) Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred before January 1, 1952. Except as otherwise provided in §25.2512&hyph;5(b), if the transfer was made before January 1, 1952, the present value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions is their present value determined under this section. If the valuation of the interest involved is dependent upon the continuation or termination of one or more lives or upon a term certain concurrent with one or more lives, the factor for the present value is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 4 percent a year, compounded annually, and life contingencies for each life involved from values that are based upon the ``Actuaries' or Combined Experience Table of Mortality, as extended.'' This table and many additional factors are described in former §86.19 (as contained in the 26 CFR Part 81 edition revised as of April 1, 1958). The present value of an interest measured by a term of years is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 4 percent a year. (b) Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971. Except as otherwise provided in §25.2512&hyph;5(b), the present value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions transferred after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971, is the present value of such interests determined under this section. If the value of the interest involved is dependent upon the continuation or termination of one or more lives, the factor for the present value is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 31/2 percent a year, compounded annually, and life contingencies for each life involved from U.S. Life Table 38. This table and many accompanying factors are set forth in former §25.2512&hyph;5 (as contained in the 26 CFR Part 25 edition revised as of April 1, 1984). Special factors involving one and two lives may be found in or computed with the use of tables contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication Number 11, ``Actuarial Values for Estate and Gift Tax,'' (Rev. 5&hyph;59). This publication is no longer available for purchase from the Superintendent of Documents. However, it may be obtained by requesting a copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS Publication 11), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. The present value of an interest measured by a term of years is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 31/2 percent a year.
