FR941122-1-00013 FR941122-1-00001 The Department is proposing that this longstanding practice be codified in the Food Stamp Program Regulations. The Department proposes to amend §277.9(b) to provide that the incremental cost of certifying AFDC cases for food stamp benefits would be an allowable cost for FNS reimbursement at the standard Federal reimbursement rate. This proposed provision modifies program regulations so that they conform to current policy and practice. Effective Dates and Implementation Requirements The Department is proposing that all the provisions in §277.11 regarding time limits for State agencies to file claims to amend a prior expenditure report to request retroactive funding for costs previously incurred will be effective the first day of the first calendar quarter occurring not less than 60 days following publication of the final rule. The Department proposes that the provision at §277.9(b) on the charging of food stamp certifications of AFDC households become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule since it does not require any special implementation efforts on the part of State agencies since the change merely conforms the regulations to current practice. Pursuant to Section 13971 of the Leland Act, the reduction in FFP rates mandated by Section 13961 of the Leland Act was effective on April 1, 1994, unless the Department grants a delay in certain limited circumstances, as specified in this proposed rule. In the last week of October and the first week of November 1993, the Department briefed State agencies administering the Food Stamp Program on how to implement the new Federal funding rates for FNS&hyph;366A, Budget Projection, and SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report, actual cost reporting and payment purposes effective April 1, 1994. The prompt implementation was necessary prior to rulemaking to comply timely with the Leland Act's mandate to reduce the Department's share of State agency administrative costs to the mandated rate as of April 1, 1994, and to minimize the need for revised reporting by State agencies related to budget projections for FY 1994 and actual cost reporting on or after April 1, 1994. It also gave lead time to State agencies opting to seek from their State legislatures additional State funds to offset the reduction in the rate of Federal funding. State agency budget projections for FY 1994 should take into account the new funding rate as of April 1, 1994. Beginning April 1, 1994, State agencies began drawing down Federal funds for expenditures based on the new funding rate for these activities. Effective with the third quarter Fiscal Year 1994 SF&hyph;269 report, State agencies will begin reporting costs using the new funding rate for these activities. Costs incurred by the State or local agency on or after April 1, 1994 will be claimed at the regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement rate. State agencies currently report the amount of Federal funds requested on the FNS&hyph;366A, Budget Projection, and actual costs on the SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report. For reporting purposes, the Department is proposing to require State agencies to begin reporting budget and cost information using the new lower Federal reimbursement rate for costs incurred for periods beginning on or after April 1, 1994. Section 13961 of the Leland Act, which reduces the enhanced funding for fraud control, ADP development, and SAVE costs, applies, by its terms, to costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994. The deadline for submitting a request to delay the effective date for the reduction in enhanced funding is December 31, 1993 as specified in letters sent by FNS regional offices to State agencies in the last week of October and the first week of November 1993. However, the Department will consider requests submitted after that date. The conforming amendments to Food Stamp Program regulations in §§272.2, 272.11, 272.13, 274.12, 277.4, 277.15, 277.18, and 277.19 will be effective 30 days following publication of the final rule. Public Comments This rule proposes to bring the regulations into conformity with the Leland Act. Publication of the rule does not change the implementation guidance which was issued by the Department beginning in late October 1993. The Department is merely proposing to incorporate the new Federal reimbursement rate for these activities into the regulations. Although the Department has taken action to ensure prompt implementation of the new reimbursement rate effective April 1, 1994, this rulemaking is still necessary in order to conform the regulations to the new rate. The Department requests public comments because they may be beneficial to the rulemaking. However, commenters should note that the new Federal reimbursement rate and the implementation date for the reduction in the Federal reimbursement rate were mandated in the Act and are not items involving Departmental discretion. Only the decision of whether a State agency has demonstrated that it meets the criteria for a delay of the effective date involves some degree of Departmental discretion. Any comments received by the deadline stated above for comments will be considered prior to publication of a final rulemaking.
