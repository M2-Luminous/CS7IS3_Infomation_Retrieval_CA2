The Russian and Belorussian prime ministers, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich, have agreed in Moscow to step up Belorussia's "ruble Anschluss," while Stanislav Bogdankevich, Belorussian National Bank chairman, told a briefing in Minsk yesterday that the bilateral treaty on the unification of money systems was "stillborn." The clash between the prime minister and Belorussia's chief banker over the republic's "rublization" cannot be called a sensation. While Vyacheslav Kebich, as a high-ranking Minsk official put it, is ready "to lie under a roller" for the sake of the Republic's joining the Russian Central Bank's zone of responsibility, Bogdankevich has always been skeptical about attempts to solve Belorussia's monetary problems at the expense of the Russian ruble (which has been an open secret for all). In particular, a bill on the introduction of a national currency, drawn up at the Belorussian National Bank, has been sitting at the Belorussian parliament for nearly a year now. It is symptomatic, however, that the National Bank chairman has for the first time made public his flatly negative attitude to a ruble union with Russia. Stanislav Bogdankevich's demarche may be attributed at least to two reasons: the corporate and the national ones. First, Belorussia's "ruble Anschluss" is possible only by lowering the status of the Belorussian National Bank to a branch of the Russian Central Bank, which will remain the sole money creation center of the two states. If Belorussia opts for its own currency, however, and summons up the courage to launch economic reform, the role of its National Bank in shaping its economic policy is bound to grow. Hence, a clear conclusion for Bogdankevich -- it is better to be a Belorussian Gerashchenko than an assistant of Gerashchenko from Moscow. Second, Bogdankevich's statement that the ruble union with Russia is unwelcome may boost the presidential bids of Vyacheslav Kebich's rivals, primarily former Belorussian parliament speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, who hold a negative view on the Republic's accession to the ruble zone. To all appearances, the Russian Government will not react officially to Stanislav Bogdankevich's latest statement. However, if in the end the currency unification of Russia and Belorussia fails to materialize, benefits granted to Belorussia, first of all the lifting of Russian export tariffs on commodities destined for the Republic starting 1 May, may be cancelled.
