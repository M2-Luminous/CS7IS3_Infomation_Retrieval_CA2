The conclusion follows: The aircraft's mission was to carry out actions to support our land forces on the outskirts of Waku Kungo, a distance of 40 to 50 kms. The aircraft showed a misreading in its course indicator. This, added to the existence of thick fog in the area experienced during this time of the year, hindered visual observation. Thus, the pilot carried out maneuvers taking the aircraft to the District of Waku Kungo. Thinking that he was above his specific target, the pilot carried out the stipulated actions, hitting a school in the district. As a result of this involuntary incident, we lament the death of 89 pupils and the destruction of the school. The General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] deepely regrets this very serious incident. It would like once again to present to the bereaved families its deepest condolences and promises to do everything in its power to minimize the damage caused. [Issued] Office of the Chief of the FAA's General Staff, Luanda, 9 June 1994. [Signed] Army General Joao Baptista de Matos, chief of the FAA General Staff.
