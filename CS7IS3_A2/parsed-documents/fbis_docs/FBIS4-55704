This is a key document of the Convention, which, among other things, stipulates the rights of citizens to turn directly to the Court for Human Rights -- obviously, only after all rights to appeal in the national legal courts have been exhausted. The court in Strasbourg has the right to cancel their decisions. On behalf of Romania the document was signed by Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu. Immediately after signing the document, the minister gave the following interview to the daily ADEVARUL: [Trepcea] Minister Melescanu, what does the signing of this protocol mean for Romania? [Melescanu] The signing of Protocol 11 for us fortunately coincides with the ratification by the Romanian Parliament of the European Convention on Human Rights. The signing of the protocol completes an effort that started on the day when Romania was admitted to the Council of Europe, an effort aimed at connecting Romania to a system not only of international standards on the issue of human rights, but also of verification of the way in which these standards are being observed. For us, there will be certain advantages in starting to apply the convention -- after a very short period of adaptation -- to the new system with a single and permanent European Court and with a much simpler mechanism to solve all cases that refer to Romania. It will also be a very interesting challenge because, as the rule demands it, first of all, one should exhaust all means of internal appeal and thus, we, as citizens, will have to resist the temptation to bring every difficulty or problem to Strasbourg. I hope that once this system comes into effect, we will receive the necessary assistance in order to make known all the advantages for us and beneficial conditions of this system. For us, this is an extremely important step on the road of connecting Romania to the European democratic standards. [Trepcea] Protocol 11 is considered to be the most important protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights and it is a complex instrument that controls the respect of individuals' rights. How will this instrument function in Romania and when do you believe that it will be ratified? [Melescanu] As a first stage, I would like us still to be able to use the old system in two stages. If the government accepts it, in the near future we will try to adapt to the requirements of the convention, from the viewpoint of the internal legislation as quickly as possible. Then, I believe that it will be two years before Protocol 11 comes into effect. My recommendation would be that, in this first period, we should make preparations so that we can be among the first countries that will ratify the protocol. There is no point in making a gratuitous gesture, such as ratifying it before it comes into effect. Let us concentrate on the fastest possible integration of the current system and of the Romanian legislation in the provisions of the convention, as it is today. [Trepcea] Here one gets the impression that the officials in Strasbourg would like the period that separates us from the coming into effect of the protocol to be as short as possible, because of the presence of the Russian Federation at the gates of the Council of Europe. [Melescanu] Yes, this is true that there is this political desire. There are also practical reasons, because the current difficult mechanism lessens the credibility of the system for protecting human rights.
