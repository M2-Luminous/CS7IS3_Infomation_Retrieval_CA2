At the same time, in most cases it was an attempt to replace the names adopted in the Russian language with the names in the languages of these states, republics, and cities. However, in any language any borrowed word is always subordinated to new grammar and pronunciation laws and, in practice, never retains its original form. Therefore Russian language speakers have as many rights to pronounce Ashkhabad, Kushka, Kirgizia, and Belorussia, as speakers of other languages, for example, have every right to use Russian names in the form adopted in their languages. In this particular case it is correspondence to linguistic laws that is under discussion. The Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences supports the intention to go back to old names. From 15 March, Russian television and radio will begin using them consistently so that from now on Almaty will again become Alma-Ata, Bashkortostan -- Bashkiria. Our congratulations to you. It would be interesting to know what will be the reaction at the Ostankino TV and Radio Company since this initiative comes from the Russian TV and Radio Company.
