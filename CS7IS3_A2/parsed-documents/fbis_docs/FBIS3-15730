The republic's Constitution says relations with the federal centre must be built on the basis of agreements between federal authorities and the local government. The republic is to have its own president at the head of the executive power and the popular Hural (parliament) as the main body of representative authority. The first presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in March 1994.
