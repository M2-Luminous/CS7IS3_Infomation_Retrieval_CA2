FR940817-2-00226 FR940817-2-00113 The duration of neurotransmitter action is primarily a function of the length of time it remains in the synaptic cleft. This duration is very short due to specialized enzymes that quickly remove the transmitter either by degrading it or by reuptake systems that transport it back into the synaptic bouton. A toxic substance may disrupt this process in several different ways. It is important that the duration of the effect of synaptically released chemical messengers be limited. Some neurotoxicants, e.g., cholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphorous pesticides, inhibit the enzyme (AChE), which serves to terminate the effect of the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) on its target. The result is an overstimulation of the target cell. Other substances, particularly biological toxins, are able to interact with the receptor molecule and mimic the action of the neurotransmitter. Some toxic substances, like neuroactive pharmaceuticals, may interfere with the synthesis of a particular neurotransmitter, while others may block the neurotransmitter's access to its receptor molecule. 2.4. Types of Effects on the Nervous System The normal activity of the nervous system can be altered by many toxic substances. A variety of adverse health effects can be seen ranging from impairment of muscular movement to disruption of vision and hearing to memory loss and hallucinations (WHO, 1986; Anger, 1984, 1990). Toxic substances can alter both the structure and the function of cells in the nervous system. Structural alterations include changes in the morphology of the cell and its subcellular structures. In some cases, agents produce neuropathic conditions that resemble naturally occurring neurodegenerative disorders in humans (Calne et al., 1986). Cellular alterations can include the accumulation, proliferation, or rearrangement of structural elements (e.g., intermediate filaments, microtubules) or organelles (mitochondria) as well as the breakdown of cells. By affecting the biochemistry and/or physiology of a cell, a toxic substance can alter the internal environment of any neural cell. Intracellular changes can result from oxygen deprivation (anoxia) because neurons require relatively large quantities of oxygen due to their high metabolic rate. Many times the response of the nervous system to a toxic substance can be a slow degeneration of the nerve cell body or axon that may result in permanent neuronal damage. Substances can act as a cytotoxicant after having been transported into the nerve terminal. A complete loss of nerve cells can occur following exposure to a number of toxic substances. Sensory nerve cells may be lost following treatment with megavitamin doses of vitamin B6; hippocampal neurons undergo degeneration with trimethyltin and trimethyl lead poisoning; motor nerve cells are affected in cycad toxicity, which has been loosely linked to Guam-ALS-Parkinsonism dementia. Acute carbon monoxide poisoning can produce a delayed, progressive deterioration over a period of weeks of portions of the nervous system that may lead to psychosis and death. Substances such as mercury and lead can cause central nervous system dysfunction. In children, mercury intoxication can cause degeneration of neurons in the cerebellum and can lead to tremors, difficulty in walking, visual impairment, and even blindness. Lead affects the cortex of the immature brain, resulting in mental retardation.
