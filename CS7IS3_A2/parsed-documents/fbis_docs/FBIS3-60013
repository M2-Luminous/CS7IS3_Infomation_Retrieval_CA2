The governor said that Villegas' complaint was offensive. The controversy between the two ranking officials began as a result of a letter that Holguin sent to Police Director General Octavio Vargas rejecting the way in which an operation against alleged drug traffickers was executed in Cali. Villegas responded to the criticism and said that the delivery of suspected drug-trafficking criminals cannot lead to a decrease in operations. In addition the minister said that in this type of operation one cannot judge about any inconveniences caused, and he added that he does not understand the motive of any official who criticizes the authorities involved in these operations. In another letter Governor Holguin has said that the complaint was offensive and that he rejected any attempt to disregard him, because he was not questioning the operation as such, rather, the way in which it was executed, a way, Holguin said, that only guaranteed the failure of the operation.
