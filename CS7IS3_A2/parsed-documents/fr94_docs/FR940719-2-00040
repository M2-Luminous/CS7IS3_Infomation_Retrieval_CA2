FR940719-2-00040 FR940719-2-00016 COMMITTEE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TEXTILE AGREEMENTS Request for Public Comments on the Integration of the Textiles and Clothing Sector into the GATT 1994 May 13, 1994. AGENCY: Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA). ACTION: Request for comment. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Keith Daly, Office of Textiles and Apparel, U.S. Department of Commerce, (202) 482&hyph;3400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Authority: Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854). The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing provides for the eventual integration of the textiles and clothing sector into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. The integration of the textiles and clothing sector into the GATT 1994 will commence upon implementation of the Uruguay Round. Paragraph 6 of Article 2 of the Agreement states that ``On the date of entry into force of this Agreement, each Member shall integrate into GATT 1994 products which, in 1990, accounted for not less than 16 percent of the total volume of imports in 1990 of the products in the Annex, in terms of HS lines or categories. The products to be integrated shall encompass products from each of the following four groups: tops and yarns, fabrics, made-up textile products, and clothing.'' Integration into GATT 1994 would imply removal of all quotas on these products, if any exist. A total of 2.7 billion square meters equivalent will be integrated during the first phase of the integration process. In anticipation of the passing of the terms of the Agreement by Congress, and even though the final process for determining which products are to be integrated as yet has not been decided upon, the Chairman of the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) is requesting interested parties to submit comments on paragraph 6 of Article 2 of the Agreement. This action is being taken pursuant to an international agreement and thus relates to a foreign affairs function of the United States. Comments must be received on or before July 18, 1994. Comments may be mailed to the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, room 3001, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12259 Filed 5&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;F
