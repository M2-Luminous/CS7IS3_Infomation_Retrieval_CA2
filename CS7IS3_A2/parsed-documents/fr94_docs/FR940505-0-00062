FR940505-0-00062 FR940505-0-00017 The final regulations continue the approach of the proposed regulations in that they provide the same relief as that advocated above except in those cases where the retained interest declines in value between the date of the initial transfer and the date of the subsequent transfer. Because a reduction in the value of the entity may occur as the result of indirect (hard to detect) transfers to younger generations, the IRS and the Treasury believe that adoption of the purge method is inconsistent with the purpose of section 2701 and would perpetuate the abuses Congress sought to eliminate. Split Gifts The proposed regulations provide that the effects of section 2513 (pertaining to gift splitting between spouses) are to be ignored in making the adjustment under section 2701(e)(6). One commentator argued that part of the adjustment could be lost depending upon which spouse died first. In response to this comment, the final regulations provide adjustments for split gifts that are generally consistent with the principles of section 2001(d) and (e) (pertaining to the treatment of split gifts in the computation of the estate tax). Transfers to Spouse Under the proposed regulations, the transfer of an applicable retained interest to the transferor's spouse results in the automatic assignment of the adjustment to the spouse. One commentator argued that this automatic assignment will result in loss of the adjustment if the spouse has not made sufficient prior gifts. Under the final regulations, the adjustment is not assigned to the spouse but, instead, is generally available to the transferor or the executor of the transferor's estate. Effect on Prior Section 2701 Transfers The final regulations are effective with respect to section 2701 interests transferred after May 4, 1994. For section 2701 transfers occurring on or before May 4, 1994, taxpayers may rely on the final regulations, the previously proposed regulations or any other reasonable interpretation of the statute. Final Regulations Under Section 2702 The final regulations contain a technical amendment to the regulations under section 2702 pertaining to the governing instrument requirements for qualified interests under section 2702. The amendment, pertaining to the treatment of short taxable years, simplifies the valuation of an annuity or unitrust interest by eliminating the need to pro-rate the first year's payment in the case of a short taxable year. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Fred E. Grundeman, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS. Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.
