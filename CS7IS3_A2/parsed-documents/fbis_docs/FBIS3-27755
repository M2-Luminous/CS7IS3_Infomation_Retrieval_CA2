The economic revolution is only beginning in Vietnam, however. Although it has only relatively recently opened up its markets, that country, with its 70 million inhabitants, has already achieved considerable successes. [passage omitted] Financial institutions are responding to these prospects. Their interest in this geographic area was confirmed with the launch of a capital investment fund called "Vietnam Vest." This is a first in France. However, the Luxembourg fund does not seek to attract private investors; it is open only to institutional investors within the framework of a private placement. Moreover, it will not involve the constitution of a portfolio including companies quoted on the stock exchange. The fund seeks to help French, European, and Asian companies to penetrate the Vietnamese market by providing capital stock, either directly of through joint ventures. It targets companies operating in sectors with strong growth potential, such as the agro-food, light industry, corporate services, health, communications, and tourist sectors. The fund's role will not remain limited to that of capital supplier. The Saigon-based team managing the fund will also help companies exploring the market, providing assistance with their search for partners, their contacts with the Vietnamese authorities, and their actual establishment. The fund seeks to collect Fr30 million by June. Initially, 60 percent of its investments will go to joint ventures. In the second phase, it intends to acquire interests in recently created Vietnamese private companies, and to participate in the privatizations planned for the end of this year.
