I am going to visit Gorazde to find out as to how we can help the Muslim civilians in a most effective way since NATO is bombing both sides, Karadzic said as he was setting off for Gorazde. The president of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina met Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy minister for foreign affairs late last night following the latter's visit to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command in Sarajevo. The talks continued this morning, although no major success has been achieved. Churkin's idea was to organize a meeting of Karadzic, Yasushi Akashi, and Charles Redman, the U.S. President's special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, but this initiative was met with no enthusiasm on the part of the leadership of the Srpska republic, TANJUG has learned from reliable sources. The question of what to discuss, and how, with those officials who had taken an active part in taking the decision to bomb Serb territories remains the main obstacle.
