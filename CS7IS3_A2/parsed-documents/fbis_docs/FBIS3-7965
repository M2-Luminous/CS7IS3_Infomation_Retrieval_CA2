The figure does not include the losses incurred to the neighbouring and other European countries, which had to by-pass Yugoslavia's shortest and cheapest roads and railway lines leading to western Europe and the Middle East. "By sealing the Yugoslav borders, the architects of the (U.N.) resolutions have also sealed Europe," said Katic. A series of unilateral traffic suspensions was initiated by Germany in December 1991, when it discontinued its air traffic with Yugoslavia, disregarding all international norms. Yugoslavia has been placed under a total traffic isolation on the basis of United Nations Security Council resolutions in May 1992 and April 1993. Yugoslavia was forced to compensate a part of the losses through road and navigation tolls, said Katic. Most branches of transport and communications faced a total collapse. Vessels of the shipping companies Jugooceanija and Prekookeanska Plovidba - which, in cooperation with the port of Bar, had secured one fourth of the foreign currency earnings of the Republic of Montenegro before the sanctions - are currently blocked in ports throughout the world. Another example is the Yugoslav railways, which in 1993 cancelled 46 passenger and 30 cargo trains daily at the average. The restrictions were ofter caused by problems in obtaining fuel and spare parts, whose imports are banned.
