To put it differently, if we are successful in the economic sphere, we will be successful in the other spheres, too. Such is the "package" of responsibilities of the new minister of economy, Peter Magvasi. At the beginning of our interview, we were interested in his first impressions as minister. [Magvasi] This ministry has been administered by industrialists. They are used to making rational decisions, without unnecessary emotions. In the interests of this sector, this continuity should be preserved even after the personnel changes. This is what is really happening, thanks to the correct course of action taken by my predecessor, Mr. Ducky. We have projects and tasks that go beyond the time horizon of one government. I will pass on to my successor many of the things I inherited recently. This is the nature of the sector I have taken over while searching for as much information as possible. [Bohunicky] What are your priorities? [Magvasi] From the viewpoint of the overall concept of the activity of the ministry, I will focus, above all, on foreign trade. Foreign trade as an "institution" did not exist in Slovakia for well-known reasons. Of course, we have several starting points here, but the process of gradually establishing foreign trade must become much more intensive. This is what I want to focus on as much as possible. In the past, this ministry's main task was to administer industrial sectors. This trend will be replaced with trading activity. In the final effect, this will essentially influence the activity of said sectors and make them more efficient, I believe. [Bohunicky] What are your problems? [Magvasi] One of our greatest problems is trade with the Russian Federation. This is the cardinal problem of the Slovak Republic's trade balance because the deficit we have is mainly caused by trade with Russia. I consider a solution to this problem to be a strategic condition for economic efficiency of the Slovak Republic. At the same time, I am aware of our need for permanent and advantageous raw-material resources from Russia. [Bohunicky] Are these problems as serious as the problem of the Customs Union [with the Czech Republic]? [Magvasi] Certainly. This is another sphere that is exceptionally important for the Slovak economy. Personally, I am extremely interested in its better functioning. I have to say, however, that the Customs Union is (or should be) a two-way street. We need Czech partners, and the Czechs need Slovak partners. Unlike other European countries that can boast of a high degree of mutual cooperation, we have a unique advantage: Our technological standards are absolutely identical, which represents a high degree of integration. A technical drawing is as readable in Cheb [Czech Republic] as in Svidnik [Slovak Republic]. This gives us very valuable technological links that we should not fail to make use of.
