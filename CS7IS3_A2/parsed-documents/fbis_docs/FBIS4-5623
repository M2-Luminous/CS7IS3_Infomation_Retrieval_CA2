FBIS4-5623 "dreas071__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-071-A Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Parties Maneuver Toward New Alliances Parties Maneuver Toward New Alliances OW1204201094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1204201094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, which have been considering plans for a recombination of parties in the coalition alliance on the condition of fielding the Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and former foreign minister, for the prime ministership, are now being pressed to reconsider their strategies. Watanabe has shown a willingness to join hands with Shinseito and Komeito, but in such a case, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger] are certain to withdraw from the coalition alliance. Even if Watanabe were to bolt from the LDP, it would not be easy to fill the hole that would be left in the coalition alliance should the SDPJ and other groups leave the alliance. Shinseito and Komeito would then find themselves barred from carrying out their crucial task of forming a majority group. Apparently, the two parties have thus taken a "two-pronged approach": considering plans to maintain the framework of the current alliance with the SDPJ and other groups while flashing the "Watanabe negotiating card." Initially, Shinseito planned to join "Reform" [Kaikaku], a new lower house parliamentary group formed by the Japan New Party [JNP] together with Komeito; the "Kaikaku-no-Kai" [parliamentary group formed by Takeo Nishioka and others who recently broke away from the LDP], and a group of lower house members from the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan [DSP] who are close to DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa. Shinseito then planned to form a grand parliamentary alliance of 170-180 members, making it the largest ruling coalition parliamentary bloc. It then planned to use this as a backdrop in a strategy to join hands with Watanabe and his supporters. However, plans to form a majority group among the ruling coalition parties have not been proceeding as well as expected because, among other reasons, the formation of the "Kaikaku" has triggered a split in Hosokawa's own front yard, the JNP. On top of this, the assumption that "the SDPJ would never form an alliance with the LDP" (as stated by a senior Komeito official) turned out to be incorrect. With the emergence of a possible alliance between Sakigake, the SDPJ, and the LDP, from which Watanabe is expected to have defected, there has emerged the possibility that the Shinseito-led group may fall back into a minority. On the afternoon of 10 April, rumors of an "LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake" alliance caused mixed reactions among Shinseito members. Some senior party officials suggested that the party place priority on maintaining the current coalition alliance and attend a party leadership meeting proposed by SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama in order to ease resistance against the so-called "Ichi-Ichi line" formed by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. Ozawa, however, rejected the leadership meeting, in insisting on launching a frontal assault. As for the meeting between Murayama and three other party leaders, Ozawa openly demonstrated his displeasure, saying: "Only half (of the ruling coalition party leaders) will be there. It will be nothing more than a private gathering." Another senior party official feels that should the "LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake" alliance plan proceed further, "there eventually will be a split in both the LDP and the SDPJ." A group of Shinseito members close to Ozawa has been contacting Watanabe behind the scenes, while a group of junior party members has been contacting the LDP's proelectoral-reformists who are close to former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. While such maneuverings are going on, Shinseito is also considering plans to maintain the framework of the current coalition alliance and to successfully field "Tsutomu Hata as the new prime minister." The party considers this as the "last point of compromise." In this case, however, it is certain that the SDPJ and other groups will demand that there be no more instances of "Ichi- Ichi line"-initiated steering of the government. A top DSP official has even insisted, "Ozawa and Ichikawa should be placed on their good behavior." In case agreement cannot be reached among the ruling coalition parties to choose Hata as Hosokawa's successor, there also remains the possibility that Murayama and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura may be fielded for the prime minister's post. Thus, Shinseito is on the verge of having to choose between going ahead with its plan to form a majority group or succumbing to a "compromise."
