Yugoslavia has already appointed a charge d'affaires in Kiev, (Milos Jovanovic), a full-time diplomat. A high-ranking Ukrainian diplomat who asked not to be identified said the decision to establish diplomatic relations with Serbia and Montenegro, against which the United Nations had introduced sanctions, had to do with the enlargement of Ukraine's peace-keeping forces in the vicinity of Gorazde and the possible conflicts this may involve. "Ukraine's consulate general in Belgrade headed by Vadym Prymachenko will hardly be able to solve all the possible problems without representative powers at a senior level," he said. The same diplomat believes that serious diplomatic work will be required in the region following a political decision to compensate the countries of the Danube area for their losses incurred as a a result of the UN sanctions against Serbia. Ukraine suffered huge losses because of the sanctions.
