It consisted of the corresponding model of a BRDM [armored radiation patrol vehicle] or Uazik. The new chemical reconnaissance vehicle (RKhM-4) is based on the BTR-80. The RKhM-4 is capable of conducting radiation and chemical reconnaissance in difficult topographical and meteorological conditions day or night. It is adapted for surmounting natural and artificial obstacles and water barriers. It performs reconnaissance effectively in temperatures of -40 to +40 degrees C and at altitudes of up to 3,000 meters. The equipment on the RKhM-4 makes it possible to measure the gamma-radiation level in an area and the degree of radioactive contamination of various objects and to perform constant, automatic monitoring of the air. It can also perform a large number of other missions to provide a complete and comprehensive assessment of the radiation and chemical situation. In peacetime the RKhM-4 can be used for reconnoitering the situation along main pipelines and for mopping up following the dumping of radioactive or chemical substances. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Technical Specifications of RKhM-4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Speed at which reconnaissance can be | | |carried out (km per hour) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |radiation |30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |chemical |10 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Length of continuous operation withou-|24 | |t replenishment of expandable supplie-| | |s (hours) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crew size |3 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
