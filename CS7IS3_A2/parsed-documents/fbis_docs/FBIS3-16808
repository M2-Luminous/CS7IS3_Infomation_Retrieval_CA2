"We do not consider it necessary to publicly respond to such provocative actions by anonymous authors. But speaking about the Russian diplomat concerned, he received the agreement from the Estonian government for being accredited in the Republic of Estonia in his capacity as military, air force and naval attache with the Russian embassy in Tallinn," said Andrey Yakushev, press attache at the embassy. Estonia's Eesti Aeg weekly newspaper in its Wednesday's [16 March] edition published an unsigned paper saying that Anatoliy Chizhikov is the "chief Russian spy in Estonia." Anonymous authors of the note claim the diplomat "coordinates the activity of the Russian spying center operating in Estonia," as well as of a "special intelligence group" which includes employees from the Estonian Defense Ministry, the Central Staff, the Interior and Foreign ministries, as well as other government departments.
