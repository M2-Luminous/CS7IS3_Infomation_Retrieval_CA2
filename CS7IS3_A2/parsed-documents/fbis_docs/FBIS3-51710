We can gather this from a study by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, ECLA. In contrast, the study, which was made public this past weekend, notes that the poorest decile (10 percent) of the country's households received just 1.5 percent of total income; this figure remained practically the same as the 1990's began. The rest of the income pie is divided up among the other eight deciles. From top to bottom, the ninth has 14.8 percent; the eighth 10 percent; the seventh 7.7 percent; the sixth 6 percent; the fifth 5 percent; the fourth 4 percent; the third 3.4 percent, and the second 2.3 percent. The numbers in Greater Santiago are very similar to the nationwide totals. According to the ECLA data, the wealthiest decile of households account for 43.1 percent of the total, while the poorest decile commands 1.8 percent. There is greater inequity, however, in rural areas. Here, the wealthiest decile of households accounts for almost 60 percent (59.8 percent) of total income, while the poorest decile accounts for just 1.1 percent. There is hardly a surplus of studies on income distribution in Latin America. They became particularly scarce in the early 1980's when the circumstances of the poorest groups grew markedly worse, after which the recovery benefited the richest segments of the population first. This trend was especially marked in Chile, where the military government and its technocrats chose a macroeconomic policy of belt-tightening rather than seeking to distribute more equitably the wealth generated by the country. Very few studies were conducted on the issue. Afterwards, under the current administration the Planning Ministry (Mideplan) undertook several studies in this regard, also covering the issue of poverty and indigence levels. They showed that although the trend towards income concentration that Chile saw in the 1980's is being reversed, there have not been major improvements in the early 1990's. In spite of the serious efforts undertaken, which can be evaluated only after the current administration's term is over, Chile is still one of the Latin American countries with the worst income distribution according to World Bank figures. For example, the numbers in the ECLA study show that although Mexico underwent a macroeconomic belt-tightening just as severe as Chile's or even more so, its income distribution is better than ours at present. In Mexico, the wealthiest 10 percent of households accounted for 33.4 percent of total income in 1990, that is to say, about a third, compared to more than 45 percent in Chile. The status of the poorest households is only slightly better in Mexico than in Chile, however; they receive 2 percent of national income, compared to 1.5 percent in Chile. UN data from 1992 show that the situation in Chile is comparable to that in Brazil and Peru, two of the countries in the region that are doing the worst in this regard, and is worse than in Argentina and Venezuela at present. For comparison purposes we might note that in the G-7 countries (the seven most developed countries in the world) the richest 20 percent of the population accounts for just 38.7 percent of total income and the poorest 20 percent 6.8 percent. If we use the same yardsticks in Chile, the numbers are 60.1 and 3.8 percent in 1990 (this does not take into account the subsequent mild improvement). Another yardstick shows that the income of the wealthiest 20 percent was 12.45 times greater than the income of the poorest 20 percent in Chile in 1987, 13.19 times greater in 1990, and back down to 12.31 times greater in 1992, a positive trend. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Income Distribution in Chile | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Decile |1989 (percent) |1990 (percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1 (poorest) |1.5 |1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2 |2.4 |2.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3 |3.1 |3.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |4 |4.0 |4.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |5 |4.7 |5.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |6 |6.0 |6.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |7 |7.4 |7.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |8 |9.5 |10.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |9 |13.9 |14.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |10 (richest) |47.5 |45.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: ECLA, households | | | |categorized by total inc-| | | |ome | | | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
