In the course of the preceding years, they have repeatedly demonstrated that their idea of coexistence are permanent concessions by the Slovaks and the implementation of their own escalating demands. This has found its expression in the massive renaming of streets according to "personalities" from the time of the Hungarian empire, in tough Magyarization, and in incessant demands for the renaming of towns and villages. Cases of job applicants being turned down because they are Slovaks and do not speak Hungarian are multiplying. The Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement has not abandoned its efforts to divide Catholics along ethnic lines by setting up a bishopric in Komarno exclusively for Hungarian believers. The Hungarian language is pushing Slovak out of schools. We therefore appeal to the Government of the Slovak Republic and deputies to the National Council of the Slovak Republic to ensure that politicians of Hungarian parties and movements in Slovakia meet the needs and requirements of the Slovak part of the population. We demand that all competent representatives of the demands of the Slovak Heritage Foundation Committee [as published], as well as demands formulated in the Memorandum of Slovaks from Southern Slovakia be considered during the discussion of laws dealing with the so-called problem of bilingual signs, the problem of birth and marriage registers, and the problem of the Slovak state language. In conclusion, the Slovak Heritage Foundation District Committee writes that many Slovaks see their prospects in southern Slovakia endangered, also due to the disregard for the demands of Slovaks by some contemporary highest representatives.
