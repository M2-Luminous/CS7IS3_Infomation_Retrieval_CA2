"The German Government has to abandon the illusion that President Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Kozyrev are true angels of peace," a Baltic top diplomat told DIE WELT. On the contrary, the Russian Government is using right-wing extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's success in the election to again pursue aggressive world power policies. "As far as contents and mental attitudes are concerned, there are no longer any major differences between the things that Zhirinovskiy wants and the policy of the government," the diplomat said. The Western thesis that one must help Yeltsin in order to prevent Zhirinovskiy starts from false assumptions. In the consultations with Kinkel, the Balts want to press Germany to extend its "role as a lawyer, which is has played with great responsibility" so far, to "some kind of protection guarantee," and at the same time to bring Germany's influence on Russia to bear, in order to achieve security guarantees for the Baltics. Kinkel will have a good opportunity for this as early as during his visit to Moscow that is planned for this month, it was stated. The diplomats were disappointed at the NATO failure to admit the Balts. The Partnership for Peace is too noncommittal, it was stated.
