He said the PCN will only contest the legislative elections. He said opposition parties should unite to find a single presidential candidate because "we are about 16 officially registered parties, and if each one of us submits its candidate we will risk splitting the votes and encouraging war." [passage omitted] Turning to the system of government that would eventually be in place in the country, he is for the "establishment of a government of national unity." He noted that "this country has gone through many years of war and people do not know each other well. Hence, it would be advisable for whoever wins the presidential election, not to consider only his party, but other people with potential, if he wants to guarantee peace." [passage omitted]
