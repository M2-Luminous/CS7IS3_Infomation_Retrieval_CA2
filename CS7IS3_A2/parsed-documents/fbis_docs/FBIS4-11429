Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 16 April report that Alexis Duque Velazquez, the manager of a consignment store in Havana, was arrested for embezzling the profits from three months' work. The crime was detected when an unscheduled audit was performed after employees of the store reported the manager to the local council. Although previous audits had not detected fraudulent activities, on this occasion auditors found that Duque Velazquez had forged contracts to cover up for the 33,000 pesos that he had pocketed. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 22 April report that three employees of a post office in San Miguel del Padron Municipality, Havana City Province, stole over 126,000 pesos from the state by falsifying money orders, until caught by the Ministry of Communications and the Police, working together. In 1993, they cashed 364 false money orders, each for approximately 300 pesos. They got away with this for a while because of inefficiencies in the postal system. They were also able to operate because other people failed to comply fully and properly with the procedures for paying out and monitoring money orders. "To reconcile 2.5 million in money orders in one year is not an easy task, even if those which are false will be discovered in the end. However, the delay in this reconciliation was causing the state to lose money." "Communications now has a modern system that allows them to detect false money orders quickly."
