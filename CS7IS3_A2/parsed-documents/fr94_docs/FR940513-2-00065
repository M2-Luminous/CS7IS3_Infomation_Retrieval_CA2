SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Part I. Background A. The Challenges of an Aging Society According to the National Center for Health Statistics, life expectancy at birth for Americans in 1991 rose to a record 75.5 years. The Census Bureau predicts that by the year 2020 the average life expectancy will be 82 years for women and 74.2 years for men. At the turn of the century, only 4 percent of the American population was 65 and over. By 1990, it was 12 percent. Beginning in approximately 15 years, the percentage is projected to increase rapidly to 20 percent and then to increase slowly to about 21% by 2050 and 22% by 2060. By the year 2030, there will be more people age 65 and older than young people under age 15 in the population.
