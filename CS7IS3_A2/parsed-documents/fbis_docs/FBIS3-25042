DP Western Cape leader Mr Hennie Bester said in a statement on Monday [7 February] his party was deeply distressed by the ongoing reports of "total shambles" in these camps. "The appointment of Major-General Ramushwana and his acknowledgement that the force will not be ready for election day has done nothing to calm these fears." The Western Cape DP demanded that impartial observers and the media be allowed to visit the camps and make a full public report. "Should these reports prove to be correct, the Democratic Party will do everything in its power to resist the deployment of the peace-keeping force in the Western Cape. Intimidators cannot be used to combat intimidation," Mr Bester said. Two alternative possiblities were: - that a force be drawn from citizens in the Western Cape and be trained in the region; and, - that international peace-keepers be asked to do the job.
