Hidayat 'Abd-al-Nabi, UN information official in Cairo, said Dr. Butrus-Ghali will not address the conference, adding that his name was associated with a conference with which he has no connection. In a statement to MENA, 'Abd-al-Nabi said this conference is one among thousands of conferences held by nongovernment organizations and research centers. She added that the conference will be held under the joint auspices of the Ibn-Khaldun Center for Studies in Cairo and a London-based nongovernment organization that specializes in minority affairs. 'Abd-al-Nabi said the conference's name gives the impression that the United Nations is involved. She said that "the United Nations has no connection with the conference despite the title, which refers to the UN declaration on minority rights." She added: To clarify the uproar that exploded in the media recently when an invitation was sent to the UN secretary general, the invitation did not mention the Copts of Egypt. She stressed that on 12 April the UN Secretary General's Office declined the invitation on behalf of Butrus-Ghali.
