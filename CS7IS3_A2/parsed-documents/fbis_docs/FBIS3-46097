By 1995 the capacity of power supply from Inner Mongolia is to rise to 1.50 million kw, and by 2000 that figure will climb to five million kw, according to the power department of the region. Beijing gets one seventh of its electric power from Inner Mongolia, which is rich in coal resources. Since 1990 a total of four billion kwh of electricity have been transmitted to Beijing from the region. In the past, most of the herdsmen in the region had to rely on cow dung for heat and light, and as late as the 1950s there were only seven small power plants with a total capacity of 1,750 kw in the autonomous region. But by 1987 the total electricity production capacity in the autonomous region had surpassed 800,000 kw. Officials said that since 1988 a group of large thermoelectric power plants have been built. So far, the generating capacity has topped 2.40 million kw -- more than enough to meet the local demand. At present, several large power plants are still under construction. Upon their completion in 1995 they will increase the total capacity to eight million kw.
