Viswam: "N-Proliferation Can't Be Stopped--PM"] [Text]London, March 15--Nuclear proliferation could not be stopped nor clandestine activity prevented without a global non-discriminatory regime, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, said here on Tuesday. In an exchange of views with the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Mr Paddy Ashdown, who called on him in the morning, the Prime Minister took the view that the basic issue in regard to proliferation was whether or not measures to prevent it was discriminatory or universal. The nuclear proliferation theme, which figures for the first time in his talks with British leaders during the Prime Minister's current visit, was referred to by Mr Ashdown who enquired whether it was possible to have non-proliferation on a regional basis. Mr Rao's response was that it all depended on how a particular region was defined. In India's case, for example, both China and Russia had to be included. This was patently because the impact of certain countries extended far beyond their regions. Significantly, apart from Mr Ashdown, none of the British leaders with whom Mr Rao has had discussions so far has referred to the subject of nuclear proliferation and India's approach to that question. The better part of the discussions with Mr Ashdown was devoted to India-Pakistan relations in the specific context of their normalisation and India's ongoing economic reforms. Mr Rao explained to Mr Ashdown that while India's efforts to restore the political process in Kashmir continued, so also did Pakistan's efforts to sustain terrorism in the Valley continue. However, despite this, India acknowledged that Kashmir was its responsibility and consistent with that responsibility, India would do whatever was possible and necessary to normalise the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Mr Rao recalled that immediately after elections in Pakistan, he had suggested to the Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, that a dialogue between the two countries should take place. If the issue relating to Kashmir proved intractable, India had made it clear that constructive dialogue could be undertaken on other bilateral aspects. The picture, however, was not good right now. Pakistan's response to India's six proposals as basis for a dialogue also had not been favourable. It seemed as if Pakistan wanted to close the doors whereas India wanted to and was trying to open them. From Pakistan's side, everything seemed to be done to cause rifts, the Prime Minister said. Mr Rao made a similar assessment in his interview to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) here, in which, in an obvious reference to Pakistan, he said that terrorism was being thrust upon India. "Both the gravity and intensity of the situation are worsening," he felt. The Prime Minister elaborated in the interview upon the theme of preparing for the restoration of the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir which he had referred to in his talks with the British Premier, Mr John Major, on Monday. He said that the government was in touch with everyone who was interested in peace in Kashmir. Consultations were being held both at the national as well as the local level in Kashmir, he said. Mr Rao added that it was not a question of contacting the right people alone. The foremost question was of alleviating the situation. There was no dearth of democratic buffers in Kashmir. New alliances and parties would come up in the State once elections are held under the provisions of the Indian Constitution. He did not rule out the participation of the old democratic leadership in the political initiative. There were parties and leaders who had run governments in the past and are capable of running them in the future. The Prime Minister, however, ruled out the possibility of early elections in the State. "We would go for it fully prepared as the consequences of hasty election can be disastrous," he said. Mr Rao cited the example of Punjab where an abrupt decision of holding elections in 1991 had led to the killings of as many as 27 candidates. Things could not be set right by pushing a button. In his talks with Mr Ashdown, the Prime Minister said that the government wanted the economic reforms' benefits to percolate to the village level and not just stay in some localities spread over some parts of the country. India had embarked on a large programme of rural development. He felt that his government had struck the correct balance between fiscal prudence and social priorities. Mr Rao emphasised the importance of striking such a balance in his address to scholars and India specialists later at the Nehru Centre. He said that it was a cause for satisfaction that the desire for peace, harmony and socio-economic development among the Indian people had prevailed over false religious slogans and tactics. But this had to be consolidated. In the final analysis what needed to be done was to tackle the causes of social unrest, most of which were quite unrelated to religion. "We want rapid industrialisation, full employment, meaningful induction of science and technology to subserve our social goals, and a general raising of the living standards, in which I insist on, including the imbibing of the country's immanent value system and cultural moors. The economic reforms we have undertaken are tailored to those objectives and are irreversible," he said. In the process of change and adjustment, which India has undertaken, three postulates constituted the essential ingredients. First, that the economies of all nations needed to be globalised. Second, that the market was the best available instrument for achievement of the most efficient allocation of resources and that market forces should be generally relied upon to impart dynamism to the economy. And third, the role of the State needed to be reconsidered. Every society had to determine its own set of ends and means. Today, the issue of the means has been largely settled in favour of market forces and freer trade. But the issues regarding the ends, in other words, the determination of the core content of development, remained. In India's conditions, an equilibrium had to be achieved among three factors. First, that level of material benefit which is necessary for a human being to achieve his full creative potential, second, the level of exploitation of nature that would be consistent with the needs of nature to replenish itself, and third, the need to ensure a comparable benefit to the vast masses of people in countries where there are no welfare doles possible. To achieve and maintain such an equilibrium should not be considered stagnation. This level would depend upon and be pre-determined by the natural resources and the technology available at any point of time. To maintain economic activity at such a level, till technological progress achieved by the country raises the level itself, should not be considered a curtailment of the free play of market forces. This should be our considered approach--"the approach, if I may so, of variable constants." Striking a realistic note, Mr Rao reminded his audience that there could never be a restful moment for India. "We are condemned and privileged to hard toil perpetually." The Prime Minister was the guest of honour at a luncheon for him by the Indo-British Parliamentary Group, addressing whom he said that the courageous and right-thinking people, whether in Britain or in India were ranged against the challenges of the modern quick changing world. There was poverty and underdevelopment, the inescapable spectre of conflict in many parts of the world. International terrorism, drug trafficking, epidemics like the AIDS and the worldwide threat that religious fundamentalism and fanaticism posed. Through their elected Assemblies, India and Britain stood against the tides that threatened to flow over our hearths and homes. India and Britain could together be a positive force for international peace and stability. Together India and Britain could be a greater force in the areas of global trade, industry and advanced technologies.
