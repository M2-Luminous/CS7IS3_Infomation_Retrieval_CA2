Of this land, 58,000 square miles are under India's control and have been, since 1948, when India forcibly occupied it. India has made the people there its slaves. But they are not willing to accept Indian slavery at any cost, and they have proved this from India's partition through India's conspiracy (1971). In every war, the people here helped the Pakistani military against India. In every war, India faces awful embarrassment here. Still, after its military successes, the Kashmiris were unsuccessful. Be it the Gurdaspura crisis of 1947, the UN interference drama of 1948, the Tashkent Pact after the 1965 war, or the Shimla Pact after the 1971 war, whenever the Kashmiris were at the door of independence, they were forced again to wear the shackles of slavery for one reason or another. This time around, they took advantage of the Afghanistan jihad and started a similar struggle with similar feelings and zeal. It seems that, along with winning their freedom, they will also succeed in the disintegration of India, in the same way the Soviet Union was disintegrated. The freedom struggle of the Kashmiris is very old. Many times the harvest of their freedom struggle was ready; however, the "farmers who lacked strategy" were unable to reap this harvest appropriately, and they ruined it severely. After the fall of the Moguls in 1846, the region of Kashmir was sold to an atrocious Dogra king, Ghulab Singh, for 7.5 million rupees. The Kashmiri Muslims, fed up with Ghulab Singh's atrocities, began a struggle for independence in the beginning of the 20th century, one that is still going on. It has arrived at a point where hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris have been martyred and the perfume emanating from their sacrifice is spread all over the world. The mutilated bodies of the martyrs traveled through the River Jhelum and the Sindh and shook up the people living on the shores of the Arabian Sea. These scenes were broadcast on satellite TV to the whole world, exposing the wicked, scary face of India. The whole world has heard the echoes of the slogans of the Kashmiri people and understands the relationship of the Kashmiri people with Pakistan. May Allah grant the Kashmiri people freedom from India this time, so they do not become the victims of another devilish decision. Amin! It appears that as Kashmir's struggle for freedom gains momentum, "political harvest quails," which actually are instrumental in the hands of enemies of Islam, are suggesting all kinds of solutions to the Kashmir problem. They will never benefit Pakistan, Kashmiris, or the Islamic world. What do the Kashmiris want? One may learn by seeing documentary films about Kashmir. The open eyes of the martyred people, the green flag in the hands of the martyrs, and the slogans of joining Pakistan that are on their lips all appear to be waiting for a victor coming from Pakistan. *
