A Crimean parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker, Sergey Tsekov, is expected to meet with a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation in Kiev on Tuesday. As we already reported, on Friday Ukraine's parliament urged the Crimean parliament to cancel its Thursday's resolution issued to revert to the Crimean Constitution adopted on 6 May 1992. Besides, Ukraine's parliament suspended the bill adopted to restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992. Under that Constitution all relations between the Crimea and Ukraine are built on the basis of agreement, and the people of the Crimea are entitled to "dual citizenship." Ukraine's parliament adopted a resolution suggesting that the Crimean parliament should annul its decision within 10 days.
