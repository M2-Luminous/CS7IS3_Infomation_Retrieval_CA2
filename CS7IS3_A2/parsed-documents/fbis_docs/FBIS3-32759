Of that amount, 27.5 billion pesos correspond to public institutions and the central government sector and the rest to government-private capital enterprises and to state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises. The comptroller also indicated that his office will do everything possible to seize the assets of 1,100 officials who committed irregularities in handling funds.
