Merton] [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- The South African Police [SAP] are to investigate the Independent Electoral Commission's [IEC] ballot paper distribution system to see if it has been interfered with, IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said on Wednesday [27 April]. The IEC has been criticised by various political parties for inadequate or non-existant supply of ballot papers at voting stations. The IEC also announced at a media briefing at Gallagher Estates, midrand that it had started printing an additional 9.3 million ballot papers. Mr Justice Kriegler said it was possible the statistics of the last census on which the initial ballot paper requirement had been based had been too low. Mr Justice Kriegler however said "there was no evidence of any kind indicating a possible crime". The police investigation was sparked by an inference made by the IEC in view of the large-scale lack of ballot papers, he added. Another possible reason for the problem was a greater rate of urbanisation than calulated from the basis of the last census. Too many ballot papers were supplied to rural areas, while urban areas experienced shortages, he said. Another reason could be that millions of black South Africans did not register under the apartheid regime, Mr Justice Kriegler said. The supply of ballot papers was also complicated as more voters than expected arrived at voting stations. The IEC had calculated that about 60 to 70 per cent would vote on Wednesday. Now it seemed as if most voters had arrived at the stations on the first day of South Africa's all-race elections, Mr Justice Kriegler said. Mr Justice Kriegler also declared that Thursday would be a public holiday. Additional ballot papers were already being printed in Johannesburg, the Eastern Cape and at SA Defence Force [SADF] premises. Mr Justice Kriegler said he did not know how secure these premises were. The new ballots would be distributed with the help of the SADF, he added. The new ballot papers would have the Inkatha Freedom Party's entry printed on them, he said. About two million papers were allocated to Natal, the Eastern Cape and the [Orange] Free State. The Western Transvaal would receive 1.5 million papers each, the Western Cape 600,000, the Eastern Transvaal 700,000 and the North Western and PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions 500,000 each.
