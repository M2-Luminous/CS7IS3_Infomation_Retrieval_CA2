In a speech reasserting his own political authority in the cabinet, Mr Hurd publicly derided those who thought Britain could turn its back on Europe. The comments contrasted sharply with the anti-Brussels remarks earlier this week of Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Hurd's speech to Tory activists at the party's spring conference in Plymouth, left the impression he was delivering an implicit warning to the prime minister not to cede ground to the party's right-wing Eurosceptics. Later in the day, the foreign secretary coupled his strong words with a clear signal that Britain could compromise on the voting issue as long as its European partners give ground. As he flew to a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece last night, he said the dispute would sooner or later be resolved: "At the end of the day there is agreement. That's the way the Community works. That's the way it will work this time." Mr Hurd's Plymouth speech appeared to deliver a thinly veiled rebuke to those in the cabinet who have turned the present votes row between Britain and its partners into a broader onslaught against the European Union. The traditionally sceptical tone of right-wing cabinet ministers like Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley has more recently been echoed by similar sentiments from Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine -- both self-avowed pro-Europeans, but also potential successors to Mr Major in any leadership contest. But the foreign secretary told party workers to call a halt to the "lunatic" discussion of whether they were pro or anti-European. Instead they had to grasp the central message: "The future of Britain rests in Europe." Mr Hurd's untypically tough language in Plymouth appeared to reflect his growing frustration at the way in which the dispute over majority voting once the Union is enlarged next year has shifted the centre of gravity among Tory MPs towards the Eurosceptics. He insisted he was as determined as anyone to fight for Britain's interests in Europe but the Conservatives must reject a "sour, defensive attitude which concentrates exclusively on the negative things about the European Union." Speaking after his address, Mr Hurd said the cabinet had agreed on Thursday that it must fight a positive, pro-European campaign in the critical elections to the Strasbourg parliament on June 9. Mr Major, who is to address the closing session of the Plymouth conference later today, is now expected to tone down attacks on Brussels. He will be joined on the platform by both Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke. It also emerged yesterday that the cabinet agreed this week that all future ministerial pronouncements on Europe must in future be cleared through 10 Downing Street in order to minimise the appearance of divisions. Mr Hurd told his colleagues on Thursday of the need to maintain a positive and consistent line if the Conservatives are not to suffer heavy losses in the June Euro-elections. The foreign secretary offered a detailed assessment of the economic and security realities which meant that Britain could not detach itself from Europe. He concluded: "Unless we can lift our sights we shall put at risk Britain's position." Mr Hurd stressed that this did not mean that Britain could not argue its case strongly in Europe.
