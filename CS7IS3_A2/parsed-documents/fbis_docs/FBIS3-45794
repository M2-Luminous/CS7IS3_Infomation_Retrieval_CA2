These markets trade in oil, coal, automobiles, grain and edible oil, machinery and electronic products, as well as chemicals and building and farming materials. Together with the existing stock and metal exchanges, the ten markets scored a transaction volume totalling 1,000 billion yuan (115 billion U.S. dollars) last year, equal to two-fifths of China's gross national product in 1992. Experts said that the markets, covering pillar sectors such as industry, agriculture, energy, finance and technology, will have an impact on the whole economy of the country. The stock trading volume of the Shanghai exchange totalled nearly 500 billion yuan (57.5 U.S. dollars) in 1993, eight times the figure for the previous year. China now has two state-approved bourses, one in Shanghai and the other in Shenzhen. Last year 21 million tons of non-ferrous metals changed hands on the Shanghai market, the second-biggest such trading volume in the world. The exchange, opened in May 1991, had a transaction volume of almost 400 billion yuan (46 billion U.S. dollars) last year. These markets have not only adopted the membership and sound money systems, but have also taken to modern trading methods, such as public bidding and central clearing. Meanwhile, these bourses are trying to develop futures trading in line with international conventions by drawing up regulations, training qualified brokers and employing computerization. To serve the markets, various intermediary offices have sprouted up, covering accounting, auditing, consultancy and law.
