The China Real Estate Appraisers' Association (CREAA) was set up yesterday in Beijing to bring together professionals and control the country's fledgling land and real estate trade. Government regulations governing the land have been flouted recently, with many State-owned plots being sold at a discount. The State has had to bear these costs, complained the State Land Administration (SLA). "Such problems cannot be solved completely by the government only, but have to be settled by relying on the co-ordination of qualified professionals," said Zou Yuchuan, top SLA official. CREAA chairman, Wang Xianjin pledged that, with government support, his association "will evaluate land to be sold on market independently by using regulated professional methods that are in line with international practices today." "Not only will CREAA evaluate urban land on the market according to the relevant regulations and laws, it will also introduce fair and practical evaluation methods that have proved successful in other parts of the world." Evaluation will be supervised by the SLA, Wang said. More than 1,000 professional land appraisers from across the country, including top valuers from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, have already joined the newly-established association, according to former SLA director Wang. The setting up of the CREAA represents a major government move to control the State-owned urban land market and stamp out the illegal land deals and speculation, which led to the real estate profiteering of the last two years.
