Speaking in an interview for the ITN television news network, Germany's ARD, and the UPI press agency, President Walesa claimed that in failing to admit former communist countries into the European communities, "the West betrays itself, and has scored an own goal." The West has achieved nothing since the fall of communism, he asserted. Walesa was critical of the U.S. "partnership for peace" proposals. "We cannot talk about partnership, since there is no partnership visible yet. There is Russia, which threatens the West, which is frightened, and us in the middle, saying there is no need to be afraid, all you must do is to increase, physically, technically, the resources of Western Europe," he said. "We have got by, we will get by, and we face no threat. Russia is not about to invade Poland -- it is too small a matter for Russia. If the dangers of which the West speaks exist, then they threaten, not Poland, but Europe," President Walesa said.
