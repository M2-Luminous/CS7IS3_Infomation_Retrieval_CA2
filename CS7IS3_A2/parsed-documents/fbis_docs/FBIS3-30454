The space between Germany and Russia is to a large extent unclear and it is up to Central Europe to settle this, Payne said. Russia has also a solution for Central Europe, but we do not want to accept it and we are not about to deal with it again, Payne stated. In his words, the Czech Republic has a special relationship to NATO. None of the post-communist countries can be admitted into NATO without the Czechs, Payne said, adding that there was no variant whereby the Czech Republic could be ruled out. Russia says it does not want to divide Europe, but its policy is dividing it, and it is creating spheres of interest by defining "close abroad." The Czech Republic, Austria and Slovenia are not parts of Russia's "close abroad." This is the weightiest argument which singles us out from the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary), Payne stated. We are cooperating with Slovakia, Poland and Hungary as much as possible but we cannot afford to wait for anybody, he added.
