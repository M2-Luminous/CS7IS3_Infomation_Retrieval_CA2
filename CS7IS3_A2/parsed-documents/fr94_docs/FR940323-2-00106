FR940323-2-00106 FR940323-2-00078 [Investigation No. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;148/169] Commission Determination to Apply a Modified Procedure for Considering Two Petitions for Modification of Exclusion Order and Request for Order Compelling Full Accounting In the Matter of Certain Processes for the Manufacture of Skinless Sausage Casings and Resulting Product. AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined, pursuant to rule 201.4(b), to waive in part the interim rules normally applicable to consideration by the Commission of petitions for modification of an exclusion order, and to follow instead a modified procedure for considering the petitions filed by counsel on behalf of Viskase Corporation and Teepak, Inc. in the above-captioned investigation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith M. Czako, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3093. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 18, 1994, counsel for Viskase Corporation, successor in interest to complainant in the above-captioned investigation, filed a petition requesting, inter alia, modification of the exclusion order issued at the conclusion of the investigation. On February 24, 1994, counsel for Teepak, Inc., also filed a petition requesting, inter alia, modification of that exclusion order. Commission interim rule 211.57 sets forth procedures for processing such petitions. In this investigation, however, the Commission determined to waive in part the application of that interim rule and instead to apply a revised procedure. The revised procedure is similar to the procedure set forth in proposed final rule 210.76, published in the Federal Register on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52830, 52883). Interim rule 211.57 is waived for this investigation to the extent that it conflicts with the procedure set forth below. Commission rule 201.4(b) provides for waiver of rules when in the judgment of the Commission there is good and sufficient reason therefor. The Commission determined that these criteria are met here. Accordingly, consideration of the petitions for modification of the exclusion order in this investigation will be according to the following procedure: 1. Any person may file an opposition to the petitions within 21 days of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . 2. The Commission may thereafter institute a proceeding to modify the exclusion order by publishing notice of the proceeding in the Federal Register . Such notice will establish deadlines for submissions by interested persons. The Commission may hold a public hearing and afford interested persons the opportunity to appear and be heard. The Commission may delegate any hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge for designation of a presiding administrative law judge, who shall certify a recommended determination to the Commission. 3. After consideration of the petitions, any responses thereto, any information placed on the record at a public hearing or otherwise, and any recommended determination, the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337, 19 U.S.C. 1335), and ยง201.4(b) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 201.4(b)). Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. By order of the Commission. Issued: March 15, 1994. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6814 Filed 3&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
