FR940525-2-00106 FR940525-2-00064 The changes being proposed are administrative in nature and do not alter the bases for assurance that safety-related activities are performed correctly or the basis for any Technical Specification that is related to the establishment of or maintenance of a safety margin. Any reliefs from the approved ASME Section XI code requirements will require a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation to ensure no Technical Specification changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Florida Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;250 and 50&hyph;251, Turkey Point Plant Units 3 and 4, Dade County, Florida Date of amendment request: April 19, 1994. Description of amendment request: The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications by increasing the surveillance interval specified for air or smoke flow test through the containment spray header from ``at least once per 5 years'' to ``at least once per 10 years.'' The licensee stated that the proposed surveillance interval is consistent with both Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation'' and NUREG&hyph;1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: (1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendments extend the surveillance interval required for performing a qualitative smoke or air flow test on the containment spray headers. This surveillance test is not designed to track degradation of equipment by monitoring or trending performance. The air and smoke flow test is a test of the passive design of the containment spray nozzles, i.e., the testing demonstrates whether or not the nozzles are clogged. A single failure rendering a significant number of nozzles inoperable as a result of clogging is considered not credible. The changes being proposed do not affect assumptions contained in plant safety analyses, the physical design and/or operation of the plant, nor do they affect Technical Specifications that preserve safety analysis assumptions. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. (2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendments extend the surveillance interval required for performing a qualitative smoke or air flow test on the containment spray headers. The changes being proposed will not change the physical plant or the modes of plant operation defined in the Facility License. The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it alter the design or operation of plant systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The revised surveillance interval proposed by this submittal will not change or otherwise influence the degree of operability assumed for the containment spray system in the plant safety analyses. The changes being proposed do not alter the bases for assurance that safety-related activities are performed correctly or the basis for any Technical Specification that is related to the establishment of or maintenance of a safety margin. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
