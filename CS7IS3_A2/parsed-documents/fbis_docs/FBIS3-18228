Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl described the results as alarming and warned the Social Democratic Party [SPD] against entering into a coalition with that party. A coalition between the SPD and the Greens at the federal level would have "devastating effects on Germany, both in terms of domestic and foreign policy." With their radical slogans and positions the party would destroy any hopes for economic upswing if it were to participate in the government. "Foreign investors would be deterred and internal security no longer be guaranteed," Kohl said in his statement. Thus, for the first time directly commenting on the results of a Greens Congress. In terms of foreign and security policy, the radical course of Alliance 90/The Greens would "drive Germany into isolation and constitute the end of the political union of Europe and of our alliance with the United States," Kohl said. Kohl called on the SPD "to answer with absolute clarity the question whether it was seeking a coalition with the Greens at the federal level, too." The CDU will force the SPD "to finally answer the coalition question." In Stuttgart, CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze made a similar statement: "Alliance 90/The Greens are a danger for Germany." The spokeswoman for Alliance 90/The Greens, Anne Nilges, commented on Kohl's statement in the following way: "The more enemies, the greater the honor." That Kohl, for the first time, personally discussed the results of a Greens Congress shows how serious the party is now taken even in the opponent's camp. "Kohl is afraid of a change in the government," Nilges said. Before, the spokeswoman for executive committee of the Alliance 90/The Greens, Marianne Birthler, rejected the criticism especially of the security-policy resolutions adopted by the congress in Mannheim. "Nobody demanded that NATO disintegrate into thin air immediately," she said on Deutschlandradio on Monday. The Greens are interested in the creation of structures of joint security, for the benefit of which NATO should be gradually dissolved. "Our program is anything else but hostile to responsibility or politics," Birthler said. With its resolutions, the party has created a good starting position for the election campaign and for coalition talks. Even if the SPD was not distancing itself from the offer in public, it was now clear that "the cards will be reshuffled in the night following the election." Thomas Westphal, chairman of the Young Social Democrats, clearly came out in favor of an SPD-Greens coalition at the federal level. "Only with them is a true social-ecological policy of reform possible," he said on Saarland Radio.
