We have a report from Amalia Pando on the testimony of Gonzalo Torrico. [Begin recording] [Torrico, in progress] ...as far as I can remember about Isaac Chavarria, I did not get any information. I don't exactly remember how many prosecutors I had. [Pando] Gonzalo Torrico, who headed the struggle against drug trafficking during the four years of [former President] Jaime Paz Zamora's administration, has showed his memory is not as good as that of former dictator Luis Garcia Meza. Torrico, who was an ADN [National Democratic Action] senator in 1988 when another ADN senator published the narcophoto showing Paz Zamora with alleged drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria. He said he never told President Paz Zamora or Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco that Isaac Chavarria, who was shown in the picture with Paz Zamora, was the most wanted drug trafficker in Bolivia at that time. [Torrico] Mr. President, I have clearly stated that the reception of the drug reports was not an exclusive privilege of the Social Defense Under Secretariat or the Interior Ministry: The reports went to both organizations. My relationship with the president was via the interior minister. When I met with the minister we did not talk about specific issues, we talked about overall policies. [Deputy Juan del Granado] Did you not consider it necessary to tell the interior minister about this case in particular? Did you ever think of doing that? This is what I want to know. [Torrico] No, because that kind of relationship did not exist. [del Granado] Thank you. [Pando] Between 1989 and 1991 Chavarria rose in the ranking of the most wanted drug traffickers. He first appeared on a list of the 28 most wanted traffickers, which was the first list Gonzalo Torrico saw. Some months later Chavarria rose to ninth place. [Unidentified deputy] Then a list of the nine most wanted drug traffickers was publicly released. Not only was the list released, it is explained how it was established. The report says: As a result of thorough intelligence analysis and a comparison study of the people suspected by the FELCN, the Social Defense Under Secretariat -- which was your organization Mr. Torrico -- and the DEA, a list of nine drug traffickers considered the national kingpins was compiled. This list shows Isaac Chavarria in first place. [Pando] In November 1991, the list was reduced to just the three most wanted drug traffickers. The deadline for repented drug traffickers to surrender had passed and the FELCN commander in Santa Cruz said that just three kingpins did not take advantage of the repentance law. The most important of the three was Isaac Chavarria. Despite all this evidence, Gonzalo Torrico never concerned himself with Chavarria's arrest. [Torrico] I remember, let me reiterate, I remember Chavarria's name just as I remember the name Techo de Paja from the reports. But when I saw a list, I had no interest in any particular name because that was not my job. I already clearly pointed out that there was a specialized organization to do that. [Pando] It was also established that in 1990 an ex-member of the FELCN, Retamozo, was murdered after formally accusing Isaac Chavarria. [Unidentified deputy] The prosecutor was the official who interrogated Eduardo Adolfo Retamozo Rosas on 26 September 1990. Retamozo, a former FELCN official, was then released, then he was arrested, and then murdered. The case of Eduardo Adolfo Retamozo was well-known. The interrogation was handled by a prosecutor who worked for you, or who was assigned to the Social Defense Under Secretariat. Did this prosecutor -- who worked for you -- not inform you in detail, at least after Retamozo was shot dead, about his testimony. [Torrico] Mr. President, prosecutors were not obliged to report to me directly or through their coordinators of these events. [Pando] According to Torrico, he knew Isaac Chavarria was a wanted drug trafficker. He did not order his arrest because that is the task of the FELCN intelligence. He did not warn the president because it was not his duty and because the reports from the FELCN with the list of the most wanted drug traffickers were also sent to Minister Capobianco. Let us recall that, before this committee, Capobianco has denied being informed about links between Chavarria and drug trafficking. In the last part of his testimony, Torrico clarified that he did not work for the DEA or receive money from the U.S. Embassy. He also reiterated that no one ever asked him to protect Chavarria, neither Jaime Paz Zamora or Guillermo Capobianco. [end recording] [passage omitted]
