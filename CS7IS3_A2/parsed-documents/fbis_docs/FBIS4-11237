It goes without saying that the government cannot publicly acknowledge that its economic policy would unavoidably lead to social upheaval. Therefore, it inverted the terms of the progressive theory asserting that only an "adjustment" would eliminate the risk of a debacle. If there is a virtue that is said to characterize every statesman, it is constant self-criticism, a periodic assessment of his actions. [President Juan Carlos] Wasmosy does not excel in this quality. Whether it was scared or not, by the change of the social sectors' tune in the face of the negligence shown by those who wield power, the government had recourse to an old scheme that is as threadbare as it is hardly believable -- it claimed that demonstrations were fostered by professional agitators. For lack of socialist governments that support subversion in the interior of the country (communist regimes barely survive amidst their misfortunes), it began to point accusingly at the press. It assured time and again that there are no social problems. A well-known face looms up in this climate pregnant with pressures -- violence from above. The signs are clear. [Public Works and Communications] Minister Carlos Facceti himself took the liberty of adopting, to everybody's dismay, the "guerrilla" fashion when stating that tire busters and all sorts of barriers were going to be used because there were indications of impending dangers in the peasants' march. It is obvious that the intelligence service's game is fanning the flames of this whole affair. Otherwise, it would be impossible to account for the similar remarks uttered by nearly all the men close to the president. They cannot or do not want to believe that starving peasants can actually get organized. The same underestimation of peasants was and is a good justification for the government to postpone the solution of social problems. The same prejudgment leads the government to lend more credit to the existence of professional incognito agitators behind the disturbance. We should then reflect that here, as well as in many other countries, there are individuals who would hail the replacement of democracy with other systems that are more "thrilling." There is no reason to believe they will be able to do so if the rest refuse to collaborate. For the time being, the danger is in the possibility that key sectors of the ruling class will let themselves be persuaded that violent conflicts are unavoidable and that appropriate repressive "precautions" against this should be taken. The murder of a peasant leader is a clear symptom of this.
