Next week, U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is to ask the Security Council to extend the mandate of the U.N. protection force in former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), which is due to expire on March 31, for another year. Speaking at a session held behind closed doors, Tudjman said that the argument that a framework for a comprehensive political solution to the problem of this UNPA [UN protected area] has yet to be found no longer stands. He said that the political framework had been precisely set through the international recognition of the Republic of Croatia and its outside borders. The argument which no longer stands is one of the points of the plan made by international mediator Cyrus Vance, under which Krajina was proclaimed an UNPA in the spring of 1992 and according to which peace-keepers have been deployed there. The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by Serbs in their ethnic and historical territories in Croatia in answer to the forcible secession of this former Yugoslav Republic from the former Yugoslavia and the degradation of their civil and national rights by the Croatian authorities. Despite the fact that Krajina is an UNPA, Croatia attacked it four times, as Butrus-Ghali himself said in a report for the Security Council, in attempts to reinstate its authority there by force. Tudjman said that Croatia was suffering huge economic losses because of the current situation in the UNPA and that it could not tolerate the "inefficiency" of the UNPROFOR indefinitely. Tudjman set out that the only matter that could be discussed was the degreee of autonomy for the Serb population in areas where they were the majority before 1992. He said that this meant only the districts of Knin and Glina. The Krajina population has held two referendums so far and opted against reintegration into Croatia? Krajina President Milan Martic on Sunday said that Krajina Serbs would not yield their right to self-determination. Tudjman urged the quick return of refugees to the UNPA and said, in threatening tones, that Croatia would not be able to prevent thousands of refugees from trying to return to their homes if they could no longer control their desperation. Croatia fears that this could have undesired consequences on the peace process which is underway, Tudjman said, in an evident desire to find an alibi for possible future Croatian attacks on the republic of Serb Krajina.
