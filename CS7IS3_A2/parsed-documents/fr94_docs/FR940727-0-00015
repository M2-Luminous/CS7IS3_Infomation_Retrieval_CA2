FR940727-0-00015 FR940727-0-00005 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule establishes the quantity of Florida celery (at 6,712,910 crates or 100 percent of producers' base quantities) which handlers may ship to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing season which covers the period August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately seven producers of celery in the production area and seven handlers of celery grown in Florida subject to regulation under the celery marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of celery producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. This rule is based upon a recommendation and information submitted by the Committee and upon other available information. The Committee met on June 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended a marketable quantity of 6,712,910 crates of fresh celery for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing season beginning August 1, 1994. Additionally, a uniform percentage of 100 percent was recommended which will allow each producer, registered pursuant to section 967.37(f) of the order, to market 100 percent of such producer's base quantity. These recommendations were based on an appraisal of expected 1994&hyph;95 supply and demand. As required by section 967.37(d)(1) of the order, a reserve of 6 percent (402,775 crates) of the 1993&hyph;94 total base quantities was made available to new producers and for increases for existing producers. The deadline for requesting changes in base quantities was May 1, 1994. No applications for additional base quantities were received. The interim final rule will limit the quantity of Florida celery which handlers may purchase from producers and ship to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing season to 6,712,910 crates. This marketable quantity is the same as the 1993&hyph;94 marketable quantity, and is more than the average number of crates marketed fresh during the 1987&hyph;88 through 1992&hyph;93 seasons. It is expected that such quantity will be more than actual shipments for the 1994&hyph;95 season. Thus, the 6,712,910 crate marketable quantity is not expected to restrict the amount of Florida celery which growers produce or the amount of celery which handlers ship. For these reasons, the interim final rule should lend stability to the industry, and, thus, help provide consumers with an adequate supply of the product. Based on these considerations, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available information, is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impractical, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) This action was recommended at a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportunity to express their views and provide input; (2) it is desirable to have this action in place as soon as possible because celery planting begins in July and the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 crop year is August 1, 1994; and (3) this rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.
