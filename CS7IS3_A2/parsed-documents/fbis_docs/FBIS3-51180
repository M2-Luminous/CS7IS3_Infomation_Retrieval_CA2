A group of 20 deputies thinks that this fuel, designated humanitarian, must be put at the service of the people only and must not constitute a weapon for manipulation by foreigners. The group accuses the international community of exacerbating the situation by wanting to deliver humanitarian products to nongovernmental organizations who would be the only beneficiaries, at the expense of the people.
