FR940418-2-00023 FR940418-2-00005 DOC Comment We note that the Bank of Italy's reference rate is the highest average long-term fixed interest rate on the record of this investigation. Because section 355.44(b)(6)(iv)(A) of the Proposed Regulations lists short-term interest rates as the least preferred choice for an uncreditworthy long-term interest rate benchmark, we cannot use the IMF ``lending rate'' as suggested by petitioners. Accordingly, the Department has continued to use the reference rate plus 12 percent of the ABI prime rate for purposes of constructing benchmark and discount rates. Comment 6 Respondents argue that in cases involving companies experiencing a major restructuring or expansion, the Department recognizes that a reasonable private investor's analysis may depend on the company's prospects, rather than its past financial experience. Respondents cite to Certain Carbon Steel Products from Sweden, 58 FR 37385 (July 9, 1993) in support of their argument. According to respondents, the ECSC Treaty permits government investment in a state-owned steel company only in cases where the EC determines that such investment is provided ``under circumstances acceptable to a private investor operating under normal market economy conditions.'' Because of this requirement, a team of independent experts examined the GOI's proposed restructuring plan and concluded that the implementation of the plan afforded ILVA reasonable chances of achieving financial viability under normal market conditions. Respondents further argue that the Department has considered the EC's approval of government equity investments as evidence that the transaction confers no countervailable benefits. Respondents cite to the administrative review of Industrial Nitrocellulose from France, 52 FR 833 (January 9, 1987), which involved the French nitrocellulose industry. Petitioners argue that ILVA's claim of equityworthiness in 1988 is without merit. ILVA's predecessor companies, including Terni, incurred losses in every year examined by the Department. In addition, petitioners argue that nothing on the record suggests that ILVA's prospects after 1988 were so optimistic as to overcome years of poor financial performance and justify commercial investment by a private investment company. DOC Position We agree with respondents that where a major restructuring or expansion occurs, it may be appropriate to place greater reliance on the future prospects of the company than would be the case where an equity investment is made in an established enterprise (see GIA at 37244). For example, in the Swedish Steel case cited by respondents, we considered such factors as: (1) The anticipated rate of return on equity; (2) the extended length of time before the company was projected to be profitable; (3) the prospects of the world steel industry; (4) the cost structure of the company. In this instance, the 1988 equity investment was made in ILVA, a company which would differ from the operating companies that went into it principally because of the substantial debt forgiveness that occurred as part of the 1988&hyph;90 restructuring. Relieved of this debt, ILVA's balance sheet, when it began operations in 1989, would be much improved over that of its predecessor, Finsider. Beyond this, however, we have little indication of ILVA's future prospects. There is no information on expected rates of return, the time frame for achieving profitability, or developments in the steel market that would allow us to reach a conclusion that ILVA would yield a reasonable rate of return in a reasonable period of time. Respondents have discussed two indicators of the future prospects of ILVA, the independent study undertaken by the EC and the EC's decision allowing the investment. With respect to the study, it was not placed on the record and we have had no opportunity to analyze it. Without such analysis, we cannot simply accept respondents' characterization of the study's conclusion. We also disagree with respondents that the EC's finding on this investment is dispositive. Our determinations of equityworthiness are made in accordance with the Department's standards, not the EC's. In Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products from France, 58 FR 6221, 6232 (January 27, 1993), we explicitly rejected the EC approval of the investment as not relevant. In Industrial Nitrocellulose from France, cited by respondents, the Department performed its own analysis and, contrary to respondents' assertion, did not rely on an EC finding. Respondents' reliance on ``principles of comity'' (citing the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States (ALI) section 481, is also inapposite, because comity involves respecting foreign judgments regarding the disposition of property and the status of persons.
