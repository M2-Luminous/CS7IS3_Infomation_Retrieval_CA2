He said he is still committed to the National Front and to the CP Executive Committee's decision not to participate in the election.

One of them was that 85 percent of his fatherland will fall under an ANC [African National Congress] government. Another development is that CP MP for Lydenburg, Mr. Dries Bruwer, has announced his resignation from politics. He had been the CP's spokesman on agriculture.
