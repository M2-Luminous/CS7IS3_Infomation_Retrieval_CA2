However, the Nordic area's smallest country has been almost completely forgotten in this context. And yet Iceland is being greatly affected by the end of the Cold War and by European integration. For many years the Icelanders were deeply divided over their NATO membership and particularly over their U.S. base at Keflavik. However, throughout the Cold War the majority were clearly behind Iceland's West-oriented foreign policy, and despite considerable opposition to the Keflavik base, those advocating neutrality were few in number. The fact that Iceland did not participate more actively in EC integration than did Finland, for example, had nothing to do with security policy. It was instead because of fishing and fish exports that are of crucial importance to the island state's national economy. The so-called Cod War with Britain is still fresh in people's memories as are Iceland's difficulties on the European market. Iceland's strategic position during the Cold War was due both to the transatlantic links between North America and Europe and to Soviet naval and air force movements in the north. At the same time the Keflavik base was not to be sniffed at as a direct and indirect employer. It is interesting therefore that it was the Icelandic side that applied the brake when in the many years of negotiations with Iceland the United States was in favor of reducing activities at the base. In 1994 an agreement was reached that clearly reduces the military force at the base, even though this reduction is not as drastic as first planned. New negotiations will begin in two years' time. But not only the situation in the field of military policy has meant changes. The trend toward integration in Europe has also left its mark on Icelandic political life. Despite an unmistakable skepticism, Iceland took part in the European Economic Area [EEA] negotiations and a majority in the Althing approved the results of these negotiations. When the question of the European Union [EU] then raised its head, Iceland put itself out in the cold after it had "threatened," as early as the EEA negotiations, closer trading links with North America, and chiefly with the United States, if the results of the negotiations in the European direction were unsatisfactory. Until very recently the only openings toward the EU were Prime Minister David Oddsson's mildly positive general statements made in the context of international meetings of the leaders of conservative parties. At home in Iceland the consensus that the EU is not on the agenda has up to now been the prevailing view. Instead the Icelanders have been kept busy thinking about what will happen to the EEA and European Free Trade Association [EFTA] if Iceland is left alone in the former and only has the company of Switzerland in the latter organization. The solution that has been settled on is a proposal for a bilateral agreement with the EU, and to this end, Oddsson has given advance warning of a visit to Brussels. When, around a week ago, Norway concluded its fisheries agreement with the EU, this gave rise to turbulence in Icelandic politics. A part of the picture here is that Norway did not succeed in keeping its own fisheries under national control but was given a promise that once the EU has taken over, fisheries policy will follow Norwegian principles. In the Norwegian debate at present views are deeply divided on whether this is to be seen as a major success or a relinquishment of self-determination in the fisheries field. Iceland's social democratic foreign minister, Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, recently raised the question from the Icelandic perpsective and joined the group of those who view the results of the Norwegian negotiations as a great success. He even went so far as to say that the Norwegian result gives grounds for looking again at the the foundation for the Icelandic stance and to warn that Iceland could otherwise find itself marginalized. The foreign minister did not go as far as to directly propose Icelandic membership negotiations with the EU, but his message was crystal clear and provoked some violent reactions. Fisheries Minister Thorsteinn Palsson, who represents the conservative Independence Party, protested and claimed that Norway had abandoned its control over its marine resources. He received the immediate support of the center and left-wing opposition and of the fishing industry, while employers, the industry confederation, and a number of trade organizations voiced their sympathy with the foreign minister's view and called for an investigation into the necessary preconditions for negotiations with the EU. The prime minister tried to bring the discussion to an end when he backed his colleague, the fisheries minister, but it is already clear that such a stance is an impossibility. It is possible that a new trade initiative backed by both the government and opposition could direct attention elsewhere for a while. There are proposals, for example, of negotiations with NAFTA, the North American free trade agreement, but this does of course throw the eternal Icelandic west-or-east dilemma into sharp relief.
