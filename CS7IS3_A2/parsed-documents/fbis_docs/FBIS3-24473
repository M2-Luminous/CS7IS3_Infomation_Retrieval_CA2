The possibilities of partially replacing the silver halide in these emulsions by sodium tungstate was also studied. It was discovered that when 80 percent of the silver halide in the photographic material was replaced by sodium tungstate (i.e., when the material's silver halide content was reduced from 9 to 1.5 g/m[.sup]2[/]), its photographic properties (specifically, its light sensitivity) actually improved. Similarly, type MR nuclear photographic material also became more sensitive after 60 percent of its silver halide was replaced by sodium tungstate and was not otherwise adversely affected by the substitution. The sodium tungstate-containing photographic materials remained stable after thermostatted aging at 50�C and 65 percent humidity for 3 days. The sodium tungstate-containing silver halide photographic materials also manifested a significant increase in optical density when their temperature was increased at the moment of exposure. This increase in optical density was observed throughout the entire light wave interval from 225 to 525 nm. When a light-sensitive layer containing sodium tungstate was heated to 115�C, its optical density increased in comparison with that recorded at 20�C. For radiation at wavelengths of 325, 350, 375, 400, and 475 nm, the ratio of the two optical densities measured at 115 and 20�C (i.e., D[.sup]115[/]/D[.sub]20[/]) amounted to 50, 11, 15.5, 15, and 20, respectively. The amount of fog in the photographic materials with and without sodium tungstate was about the same. After protracted storage of 6-12 months or more, however, more fog developed on the sodium tungstate-containing photographic materials than on the films without sodium tungstate. It was concluded that sodium tungstate acts as a catalyst of the silver compounds' decomposition process. When an antifogging agent was used or when the films were stored at reduced temperatures, however, the amount of fog in the sodium tungstate-containing photographic materials remained about equal to that in the films with no sodium tungstate.
