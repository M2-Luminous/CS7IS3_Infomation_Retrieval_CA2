Not satisfied with lying to our people, they are using the same approach with the regional and international organizations. Their forces continue to wage their barbaric and immoral aggression in all the battle zones which shows that people like this neither respect themselves nor the world. Their word cannot be trusted. We once again ask the international community, with its different bodies and organizations, as well as the fraternal and friendly countries, to work with us to compel that regime to adhere to legitimacy and the basis of reality, or else to admit that it has no control. Consequently, they should leave the governing of the north to those who can establish self-respect and respect for the international community. We shall courageously resist this aggression supported by all the sons of our people. We expect a decisive stand from the international community to put an end to the arrogance, vanity, and aggression directed against us from more than one state. Iraq's involvement has been confirmed, as well as others in this aggression, in a desperate attempt to occupy our territory and destroy our people's vital interests and violate what we hold sacred. We call on the international community to witness that any continuation of this aggression against our people and our territory and our vital interests will compel us to destroy the vital interests in the north even though we have been careful to avoid that, because such interests are owned by the people of Yemen jointly with friends, and we are concerned to protect their interests and maintain our good relations with them. But the Sanaa regime is exploiting this concern of ours and every day attacks our vital interests with its missiles and aircraft.
