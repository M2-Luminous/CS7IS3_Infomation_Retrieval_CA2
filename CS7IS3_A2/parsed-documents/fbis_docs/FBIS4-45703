Mr. Cowen called for the EU to set up a nuclear inspectorate to verify the safety of power plants within the EU. According to the Irish Minister, the "lack of political will" to create such an inspection system in Europe "weakens the moral authority of the European Union." "Ireland attaches the greatest possible importance to nuclear safety matters. We should look to developments within the European Union as well as voicing concern about stations in Eastern Europe and notably in former Soviet Union. I have a deep concern about installations closer to home and particularly at Sellafield. Concern about Chernobyl should not blind us to the problem of Sellafield", said Mr. Cowen.
