The ruling party leader emphasized that the Colorado Party cannot "take credit" for the administration's positive actions alone, but rather "accept the good along with the bad." Following the official ceremony marking the anniversary of ANR founder General Bernardino Caballero's death at the Heroes' Memorial in Asuncion, Sanabria Cantero was asked about the repression of peasants. He answered: "As the ruling party we cannot take credit for just the positive aspects of the administration's performance, but rather accept the good along with the bad." The Colorado Party president stated that he justifies everything the administration may do to prevent violations of the principles and laws in effect. Sanabria Cantero asked the journalists: "Do you believe it is proper for the peasants to block the highways?" He added that repression cannot be treated separately from the peasant problem, the attitude of the peasants should be taken into account. The Colorado Party leader emphasized that citizens who voice just demands will always have the party's support, provided they do so within the framework of the law. It appears, however, that Sanabria Cantero contradicted himself on the subject of Colorado Party support for the peasants. After the confidential session of the Colorado Party Executive Board on 23 February, he reported that the leadership of the Colorado Party had decided to come out in support of the peasants who are having land problems and are demanding better prices for their products, namely, cotton.
