Foreign Minister Qian appraised positively the fact that the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopted the chairman's mildly worded statement rather than hinting at the possibility of imposing sanctions on the DPRK in the future. He said, "It helped to ease tension on the Korean peninsula and gave (the people concerned some leeway in terms of time to settle the issue peacefully)." Foreign Minister Qian also touched on China's influence on North Korea and pointed out, "Like Japan, China is not a party [directly] concerned." In this way, he reminded the delegation's members not to expect too much. As has been said before, he insisted on a settlement through dialogue between the four parties: the United States, the DPRK, the ROK, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
