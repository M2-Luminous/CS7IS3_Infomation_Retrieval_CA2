A total of five million pounds will be provided now and seven million pounds later, Major said. The Bosnian Government has estimated the cost of reconstructing Sarajevo at 3.1 billion dollars. Major, in Sarajevo Friday for talks with Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic and the British commander of UN troops in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, briefly toured a water pumping station in the city and visited a position held by a Scottish contingent of UN troops. On his arrival in Sarajevo from the central Bosnian town of Vitez, the headquarters of the British contingent in the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), Major vaunted the "chance for peace" in the region and said more UN troops would be needed soon to monitor the emerging ceasefires. He later left the city by helicopter to return to the southern Croatian port of Split, before returning to London.
