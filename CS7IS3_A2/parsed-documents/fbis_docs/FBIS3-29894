He enjoyed strong backing at home and abroad as the country's first civilian leader in over three decades, but was plagued by events such as the Uruguay Round [UR] and North Korean nuclear issue over which he had little control. Kim started his foreign policy with a loud bang. "New diplomacy," he called it, essentially asking his country to look beyond to the regional and international communities, to consider trade diplomacy and not just political affairs. Hardly stirring from home, Kim received heads of state from 11 countries during the year including France, Germany, Singapore, the Philippines, India and Australia. Summits included two highly strategic meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and weekend talks with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa outside the capital city. Certain events coincidentally helped Kim. The first-ever summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) opened up a new regional horizon and gave Seoul a role in linking two separated continents. The timely emergence of a member of the post-war generation, Prime Minister Hosokawa, helped in clearing up Korea and Japan's unhappy past at a weekend summit last November. The new Japanese leader enumerated his country's crimes during the 35-year colonial rule early this century as none of his predecessors had ever done. While touching bases with South Korea's traditional allies, Kim kept alive ties with China, meeting President Jiang Zemin during the APEC summit. Seoul-Beijing ties have steadily grown strong over the past year to the point where the two sides agreed to exchange military attaches, a symbolic event considering China's staunch alliance with South Korea's rival, North Korea. At the same time, Kim mended relations broken by his predecessor by establishing non-official links with Taipei through the exchange of missions. But when it came to major diplomatic items, Kim was not so lucky. The conclusion of the Uruguay Round fell into his lap. Keeping South Korea's rice market closed had been one of Kim's presidential campaign pledges, but he was forced to break the promise at the last minute: Seoul bowed to the principle of tariffication without exception, including its agricultural market. Negotiators managed to earn a 10-year grace period before opening the market to rice imports, but side effects from the UR hailstorm remain to this day with farmers and students taking to the streets. His agriculture minister, Ho Sin-haeng, was made a scapegoat and fired immediately after returning from the UR negotiations. But the real misfortune came in the form of the North Korean nuclear dispute. Barely one month in office, Kim's administration was hit by Pyongyang's thunderous announcement of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The majority of Kim's foreign policy since then has been geared toward getting North Korea to allow international nuclear inspections. Roughly one year after the bombshell announcement, the nuclear situation has returned to where it was last March, but only after a series of resolutions by the international community and sanctions threats by the U.N. Security Council. Like the silver lining to a cloud, North Korea said last week that it would allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to resume at a scope and scale demanded by the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Kim's diplomacy had to incline heavier toward the United States because of the nuclear problem, especially since North Korea demanded negotiations with, and only with, Washington. Despite outward claims that the two countries were in unison on how to handle the problem, the reality sometimes saw an imbalance between hard-line and progressive stands. The latest crack came over stationing Patriot missiles in South Korea. U.S. chief commander in South Korea Gary Luck asked for the Patriot deployment and the Clinton Administration virtually approved it. But South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu convinced them otherwise, advising delay at least while North Korea starts talking with the IAEA. Kim's government experienced smooth sailing in regional and international diplomacy during the past year. He begins 1994 with state visits to Japan and China and will likely go to Russia to round out a tour of superpower neighbors. During the visits, the president will not only discuss bilateral political and economic relations but close coordination on the North Korean nuclear situation. But contrary to Kim's progress in diplomacy at the regional and international levels, ironically enough, inter-Korean diplomacy turned out to be a wild goose chase. The president bears no greater burden entering his second year in office. Inter-Korean talks will most likely resume since they are a precondition to improving North Korea-U.S. relations. But exactly how the talks proceed and whether the substance is satisfactory are entirely different matters.
