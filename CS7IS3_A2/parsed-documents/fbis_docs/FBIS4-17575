The Democratic Russia leaders justified their position by referring to an article published by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the liberal daily paper IZVESTIYA. They said the nationalist leader's article contained expansionist desires and anti-constitutional appeals. Expressing their opposition to "civic accord" with Zhirinovskiy, the Democratic Russia leaders said he should either publicly renounce the anti-constitutional appeals or not be allowed to sign the treaty.
