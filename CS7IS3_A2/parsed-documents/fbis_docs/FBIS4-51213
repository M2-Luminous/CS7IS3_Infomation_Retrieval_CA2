While urging cadres at all localities to cooperate with foreign investors, he told them not to be too calculating. They should allow foreign investors to make a profit and increase investment returns. Secretary Xie said: If you want to find a latent market with a population of 110 million in the world today, besides Sichuan, there is no other choice. This is the reason large overseas groups have focused their attention on Sichuan. Sichuan must seize this golden opportunity and change its ideological concepts. Some localities always think too much about their own interests, leaving little for foreign investors. This will make it difficult for us to attain the goal of attracting foreign investors. Xie stated: Emancipation of mind is substantial and opening up wider is specific. There were no transactions in the auction sales of state enterprises in Hong Kong. Some people want to cast off their burdens. If foreign investors cannot make any profit, they prefer running new enterprises to buying old ones. We will continue to sell enterprises this year, turn fixed assets into movable ones, and invest money in new fields. A reporter asked about the race-course and gambling city in Wenjiang county, which were banned. Xie Shijie explained that there is no gambling city in Wenjiang. Instead, there is a "lucky city," with a few slot machines. A handful of people there want to develop gambling. But state regulations do not allow unplanned development of gambling. If it has started, it should be improved under leadership and in an organized way. It should be well under control and be run well. Efforts are being made in this regard, applications are submitted to relevant state departments, and measures are adopted to that they will function well. There is now a motorcycle race in Wenjiang, and it will not affect Taiwan investment there. Except Wuhan, Wenjiang has attracted the largest amount of Taiwan investment. The state will soon approve a state- level investment zone in Wenjiang for Taiwan investors. Because of inflation, Xie Shijie also disclosed, some 10 to 15 percent of the university and college students have financial difficulties. The Mianyang Changhong Television Factory has donated 10 million yuan and Hong Kong's Jialing Company has donated 4 million yuan to help students resolve their financial difficulties. Xie also disclosed that Thailand's Bank of Bangkok and Singapore's Union Bank have set up offices in Chengdu.
