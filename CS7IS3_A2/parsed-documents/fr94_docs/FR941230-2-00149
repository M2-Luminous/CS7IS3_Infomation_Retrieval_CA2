The Clearinghouse maintains a toll-free number for information requests. It also reviews reports, data and standards relating to the juvenile justice system in the United States and develops specialized resource products for the juvenile justice community. The Clearinghouse serves as a center for acquiring and disseminating information on juvenile delinquency, including State and local juvenile delinquency prevention and treatment programs and plans; availability of resources; training and educational programs; statistics; and other pertinent data and information. It also serves as an information bank for the collection and synthesis of data and knowledge obtained from research and evaluation conducted by public and private agencies, institutions, or individuals concerning all aspects of juvenile delinquency. Recognizing the critical need to inform juvenile justice practitioners and other policymakers on program approaches that hold promise, the Clearinghouse continually develops and recommends new strategies to communicate the research findings and program activities of OJJDP to the practitioner community. The entire NCJRS, of which the Juvenile Justice Clearinghouse is a part, is administered by the National Institute of Justice under a competitively awarded contract.
