Speaking before the members of the European Movement, who were meeting for a working day devoted to Europe's foreign and security policy, he said that "it is difficult to develop a common European vision in defense matters" because "the endorsement of the highest political level is missing," he said. The minister feels that the boost can only come from the heads of state and government. Consequently, he came down in favor of holding a WEU summit which "would symbolically and concretely manifest the political vitality of this security instrument of the European Union and the European pillar of the alliance." It would also provide an occasion to give the WEU "a strong sense of legitimacy." Mr. Leotard also proposed pushing further the logic which led to the creation of the Franco-German Eurocorps (joined by the Belgians). He would like to see the establishment of European intervention forces to be placed under the command of a European multinational and joint services general staff. He also expressed his desire to give concrete form to the European desire to take defense in hand through a "White Paper on Defense in Europe," along the lines of the white paper on defense, which has just been submitted in France. Jennone R. Walker, Bill Clinton's adviser on the National Security Council, also attended the meeting. Listening attentively to the minister's speech, she no doubt appreciated that it was accompanied by a warning against any desire to create a European defense structure that runs counter to U.S. interests. "There is a European dimension and a Euro-American dimension to NATO. Nobody would dream of building up a Europe that was against the United States," he said.
