FBIS4-26869 "drchi124_a_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General `Round-Up' on Revival of World Aviation Industry `Round-Up' on Revival of World Aviation Industry OW2706202594 Beijing XINHUA in English 1935 GMT 27 Jun 94 OW2706202594 Beijing XINHUA English BFN ["Round-up" by Wang Nan: "World Airline and Aircraft Industry Turns Upbeat"] [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- After four years of losses, the prospects for the world airlines and aircraft making industry are turning upbeat. Optimism was at first seen in increased plane orders, such as the five billion dollars order from Saudi Arabia, 10 billion dollars order from Singapore Airlines, and possible purchases from China. The world's 224 airlines are expected to garner a profit of one billion dollars this year, representing one percent of total sales, after losing 15.6 billion dollars since 1990, according to the latest forecast. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), based in Geneva, reported that in the first quarter of this year, world passenger traffic grew nine percent, and freight traffic grew 12 percent. IATA saw a 7.4 percent growth in scheduled passenger and freight traffic service in 1993, and expected 8.9 percent growth this year. Every one billion profit of the world airlines, as is the case this year, observers said, translates into a cash flow of three billion dollars, the down payment for 30 billion dollars of plane orders. Worldwide deliveries of commercial passenger jets of 100 seats or more, which plummeted to less than 600 in 1993, is expected to reach more than 700 in the late 1990s, boeing said in its latest forecast. The European Airbus Industrie, with worldwide market share at 25 percent, predicted that the world's new orders of passenger planes, which were less than 100 in 1993, will reach 200 this year. The reasons for the cautious optimism, according to observers, included the recent restructuring drive by many airlines, which have significantly reduced their unit costs and improved productivity. The spate of alliances among major carriers, meanwhile, have enabled them to knock down old-time government barriers and expand routes into foreign territories. Other reasons, observers said, range from more privatization of government-owned airlines across the world, to moderate economic growth in the industrial world, and declining fuel prices and interest rates.
