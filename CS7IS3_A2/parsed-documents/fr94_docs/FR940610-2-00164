FR940610-2-00164 FR940610-2-00082 [Release No. 34&hyph;34154; File No. SR&hyph;PTCV&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Eligibility of Certain Securities Guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association June 3, 1994. On April 4 1994, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;94&hyph;01) pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 The proposed rule change allows PTC to designate certain securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA'') 2 as ``eligible securities'' as permitted by PTC's Rules. The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the Federal Register on April 26, 1994. 3 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 GNMA is a wholly-owned corporate instrumentality of the United States within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (``HUD''). Through its single-class GNMA I and GNMA II mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'') programs, GNMA guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by private institutions and backed by pools of federally insured or guaranteed mortgage loans. The GNMA guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33927 (April 19, 1994), 59 FR 21794. I. Description The proposed rule change allows PTC to designate certain securities guaranteed by GNMA and eligible securities as permitted by Article I, Rule 2 of PTC's Rules. PTC currently acts as depository for single-class GNMA I and GNMA II MBS and REMIC securities 4 guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA''). 5 4 REMIC is an acronym for ``real estate mortgage investment conduit,'' as pass-through vehicle created under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to issue multiclass mortgage-backed securities. 5 As of December 31, 1993, PTC had approximately 260,000 pools of GNMA single-class securities on deposit, representing $850 billion in par value (95% of total GNMA single-class securities par value outstanding), and 71 tranches of VA REMIC securities, representing $4.6 billion in par value, from a total of 5 REMIC transactions (100% of all VA REMIC par value outstanding). For a more detailed description of PTC's VA REMIC program, see Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 30792 (June 10, 1992), 57 FR 27495, and 31914 (February 24, 1993), 58 FR 12295. GNMA is now establishing a GNMA REMIC program under which GNMA will guarantee multi-class securities issued by REMIC trusts. The GNMA REMIC securities will be issued through single-purpose trusts created by GNMA-approved sponsors which will assemble GNMA-guaranteed single-class mortgage-backed securities to constitute the corpus of the REMIC trust. The sponsors will be private-sector entities such as investment bankers. Upon issuance, the General Counsel of HUD will render an opinion that GNMA's obligations under the GNMA guarantee of its REMIC securities will constitute absolute and unconditional general obligations of the United States, for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged. The authorizing Federal statute 6 provides that the GNMA REMIC program be implemented by GNMA's publication of a notice in the Federal Register , and that GNMA subsequently publish regulations within twelve moths of the publication of the initial notice, based upon the comments received and the experience of GNMA in carrying out the program. 6 Section 306(g) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1721(g), as amended by sec. 3004 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 339. GNMA will implement its REMIC program in two stages. During the initial stage, GNMA will restrict participation in the REMIC program to a small number of participants (consisting of sponsors, co-sponsors, trustees, trust counsel, and accounting firms) and a limited number of REMIC issuances. The initial stage will commence upon the closing of the first transaction, after publication of the notice in the Federal Register , and is expected to last several months, during which time GNMA will establish standard documentation, and guidelines and procedures applicable to the full implementation of the REMIC program. 7 7 GNMA has not yet announced the date on which the initial stage of the REMIC program will commence. While GNMA has not yet determined the characteristics of the GNMA REMIC tranches, for processing purposes it is assumed that the GNMA REMIC classes will have the same basic processing requirements as the VA REMICs, which PTC has had on deposit for approximately the last two years. It is assumed that, as in the case with the VA REMIC securities, all classes of the GNMA REMIC securities except the residual class will be established and maintained in book-entry form through the facilities of PRTC, although holders will have the right to request certificated securities. II. Discussion The Commission believes that PTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act, 8 and in particular, section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that PTC's proposal to designate certain securities guaranteed by GNMA as eligible securities for deposit with PTC is consistent with this goal. 8 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). As previously stated, REMIC issuances will be limited during the initial stage of the program. Once the REMIC program is fully established, however, GNMA anticipates that a substantial percentage of its annual production of GNMA single-class securities will be securitized in GNMA REMICs. GNMA has stated they anticipate approximately $75 billion is the average deal size, this will result in approximately 150 REMIC deals issued each year.
