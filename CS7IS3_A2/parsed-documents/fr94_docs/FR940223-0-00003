FR940223-0-00003 FR940223-0-00001 The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 20 handlers of dried prunes who are subject to regulation under the dried prune marketing order and approximately 1,360 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California dried prunes may be classified as small entities. This interim final rule realigns the boundaries of the seven districts established for independent producer representation on the Committee. To be consistent with current industry demographics, this interim rule ensures that, insofar as practicable, each district represents an equal number of independent producers and an equal volume of prunes grown by such producers. The change will not impose any additional regulatory, informational, or cost requirements on handlers or producers. This action revises §993.128 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information. Section 993.24 of the order provides that the Committee shall consist of 22 members, of which 14 shall represent producers, 7 shall represent handlers, and 1 shall represent the public. The 14 producer member positions are apportioned between cooperative producers and independent producers in the same proportion, insofar as is practicable, as the percentage of the total prune tonnage handled by the cooperative and independent handlers during the year preceding the year in which nominations are made is to the total handled by all handlers. In recent years and currently, cooperative producers and independent producers each have been eligible to nominate seven members. Section 993.28 of the order provides that, for independent producers, the Committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, divide the production area into districts, giving, insofar as practicable, equal representation throughout the production area by numbers of independent producers and production of prune tonnage by such producers. When revisions are required, the Committee must make its recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture to change the district boundaries prior to January 31 of any year in which nominations are to be made. Nominations are made in all even-numbered years, including 1994. The Committee recommended this change at its December 8, 1993, meeting. Since the last redistricting in 1990, the number of producers and volume of production in most districts has changed, causing imbalances among some districts. Thus, redistricting is needed to bring the districts in line with order requirements and current California prune industry demographics. This interim final rule establishes Colusa and Glenn counties as District 1 and adds Tehama and Shasta counties to District 4. It also moves the boundary between the central Sutter and southern Sutter districts north from Oswald Road to Bogue Road, and makes the central Sutter County area a part of District 2. This rule also designates the portion of District 4, which includes the San Joaquin Valley counties, as District 7. This rule also adds northern Sutter County to Butte County to become a new District 5. District 6 will continue to be Yuba County. The Committee calculated the percentage of total independent prune growers and the percentage of total independent grower prune tonnage for each proposed new district. The two percentages were averaged for each district to determine a representation factor for each district. The optimal representation factor is determined to be 14.29 percent (100 percent divided by 7 districts). The representation factors for the seven old and the seven new districts are shown below, based on the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. ␣ 1District 1Representation factor 2Old districts (percent) 2New districts (percent) 1 7.52 12.81 2 21.02 14.89 3 11.07 15.09 4 14.27 12.78 5 9.15 16.67 6 16.10 16.10 7 20.88 11.67 The redistricting recommendation is desirable because it allows each district to approximate the optimal representation factor, while maintaining a continuous geographic boundary for each district. In addition, several of the districts whose representation factors are below the optimum are expected to experience production increases in the next few years which are likely to be above the industry average. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation and other available information, it is found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The order requires that independent producer nomination meetings be held for each of the seven districts prior to March 8, 1994, for the term of office beginning June 1, 1994 and this action should be in place before those meetings; (2) this action does not impose additional regulatory requirements on handlers or producers and, therefore, neither handlers nor producers need additional time to comply; (3) the industry is aware of this action, which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at an open meeting; and (4) this rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.
