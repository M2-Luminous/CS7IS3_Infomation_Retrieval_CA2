Wang Jiaqi, who fled to Hong Kong on April 17, arrived in New York City on Sunday after spending time in another Western country. In his first interview since leaving China, Mr Wang, a graduate law student at Beijing University, alleged that his arrest and subsequent incarceration was illegal. The dissident's detention on March 2 is believed to be linked to the role he played in the formation of a League for the Protection of the Rights for Workers. "I was arrested in Beijing by seven security agents who wore no uniforms," said Mr Wang, himself a Public security Bureau (PSB) officer in Tangshan before his enrolment at Beijing University. "They refused to identify themselves, put a hood over my face, and practically abducted me." The PSB held him prisoner in a hostel belonging to an electricity company in Changping district, Beijing, but rarely spoke to him. After six days Mr Wang was handed over to PSB officials in his home town, Tangshan, 200 kilometres east of the capital, but even there he was held not in an official prison but in a semi-legal lock-up belonging to the local steel works. After he staged a three-day hunger strike he was shifted to the barracks of the People's Armed Police in Tangshan, where he was kept in a room under 24 hour watch by three police. PSB officials there made no attempt to question him, because, they told him, they had not been told why he had been arrested. On the evening of March 27, helped by quick thinking, Mr Wang managed to dupe his guards and to escape while he was being escorted across a courtyard to a toilet. "Three guards are supposed to be watching me all the time," Mr Wang said. "One of them got drunk and the other was cramming for an examination in an adjacent room." As a result, only one guard was with him as he made a quick dash out of the open gates of the barracks. Mr Wang said his escape was only successful because a truck passed the entrance of the barracks just as he ran out past the sentry. He threw himself on to the vehicle and was able to get away into the centre of Tangshan before the guards could react. "The barracks is not designed to hold prisoners," Mr Wang said. "And the sentries are on the look out for intruders from outside instead of preventing people from getting out." The dissident also indicated he tried to make friends with the three guards, and the night of the escape, he succeeded in persuading the senior PSB officer to start drinking. Within an hour of his escape every exit from Tangshan was sealed by police, and searches were carried out throughout the city. But after a few days police, convinced that Mr Wang had fled in the hour before the checkpoints were in place, lifted the restrictions, and he was able to escape undetected to Beijing. Planning or carrying out a prison escape is a capital offence in China, but Mr Wang said he was not frightened. In Beijing, Mr Wang contacted the "underground railway", a network of dissidents which arranged for him to get to Hong Kong. He waited eight weeks before U.S. immigration authorities were able to complete entry procedures. Mr Wang, who was doing post-graduate study in criminal procedure law at Beijing University, has gone to the U.S. as a visiting academic and has no intention of applying for asylum, he said. He is on a one-year research programme at Columbia University, New York, where he will continue research into Chinese law. Two other legal experts Yuan Hongbing and Zhou Guoqiang, disappeared within a day of Mr Wang's arrest and have not been seen since. The three men had drawn up a five-point petition on labour rights which they had intended to present to China's National People's Congress. They had also planned to formally register the League, for which Mr Wang had written the constitution. Mr Wang and legal experts he has talked to in the West said his virtual kidnap by unidentified security agents represented a disturbing new trend in Beijing's campaign against dissident intellectuals. The use of unofficial or semi-legal lock-ups to hold political dissidents is also a new development, they said, and raised the possibility that dissidents could be held in any of the thousands of small prisons within state factories and police barracks to which no one outside China, and probably few locals, had access. Mr Wang said that although he had worked in Tangshan as a police official for several years, he had never heard of the steel corporation prison in which he was held in March. He said that official showed him a faxed copy of a detention order which appeared to justify his arrest, but it gave no legally recognisable description of the charge for which he was held. "On the detention order they showed me the offence for which I was held was described as tuanhuo, a non-legal term with no precise definition and roughly corresponding to `forming a conspiratorial group'," said Mr Wang, who had refused to countersign the order. In a message to China's leaders, Mr Wang said that since the Chinese Communist Party "represents the country on the international stage it should make great efforts to observe the rule of international law". "The Party should have enough confidence to reform itself," said Mr Wang who remains strongly committed to non-violent reform in China and consider his work to be non-political.
