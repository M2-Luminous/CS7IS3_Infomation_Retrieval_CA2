"The strikes in Gorazde were made without consulting Moscow, but Moscow is again expected to display activity to bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table", NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA says today. "This means that no one counted on the success of the airstrikes. The question is: What was the objective. In the military context the entire result of the operation is a couple or two smashed tanks and APC's (armoured personnel carriers)", the newspaper says. "Can the fragments of the Bosnian settlement be collected?" ROSSIISKIYE VESTI queries. It publishes a survey of views on the NATO operation by officials of the Russian foreign and defence ministries, a parliament member and a scholar. State Duma subcommittee chairman Vyacheslav Nikonov said that "as a result of NATO unilateral military action Russian found itself practically excluded from the process of decision-making about the settlement of Bosnian crisis. This can exert a negative influence on the development of relations between Russia and the West and strengthen the position of those political forces in Russia which are against Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace programme and the nationalist forces within Russia who criticise the present government's foreign policy". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA recalls that "53 years ago today, several hundreds of German planes dropped 360 tonnes of bombs on Belgrade. Airstrikes continue today. The Balkans, where the First World War began, are being bombed. Prominent historians utter fearful but just words: "The Balkans are a convenient place for unleashing world wars". "Bosnia: Fewer Chances for Peace" is a title in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. "The situation in Bosnia has once again demonstrated two approaches to the settlement," the newspaper says. "Russia is committed to reason, to difficult, albeit slow negotiations. The United States and NATO relay on military force." PRAVDA carries an article by its special correspondent Nikolay Krivomazov from the area of NATO combat activities in the Balkans, "where for the first time after the Second World War foreign planes are bombing slav lands. Here in Sarajevo one becomes particularly aware that the First World War began in this place. Will the fuse in the Balkans set aflame by the Kremlin perestroyka set off a bomb that will shake the world?". TRUD singles out the view of Sergey Shakhray, vice premier and the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord: "The airstrikes hit not only Serb targets but also the internal political situation in the Russian Federation: Nationalists are the only force that stands to gain from them in Russia". An interview with Belarussian parliament chairman Mecheslav Grib is published by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Asked whether the republic's sole orientation towards Russia threatens its sovereignty, Grib said: "It is a question of an economic alliance, of which there are many in the world. As concerns the alleged threat to our sovereignty from a political alliance, I must say that no talks on this subject have been or are being conductive. Russia does not encroach on Belarus's independence -- I am saying this with full confidence. The item on the agenda now is economic alliance between our countries. The unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus must be the first step towards it. Unfortunately, the process has been drawn out for too long.
