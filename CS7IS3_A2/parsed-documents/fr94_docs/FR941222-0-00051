FR941222-0-00051 FR941222-0-00005 The FAA does not concur. The intent of this AD is that operators incorporate maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, and that all brakes be inspected once for wear and replaced, if necessary. Once an operator has complied with the requirements of this AD, the FAA does not intend that operators subsequently record the accomplishment of this AD each time a brake is inspected or overhauled in accordance with that operator's FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. ``NOTE 2'' has been added to paragraph (a) of the final rule to clarify this intent. Operators should coordinate recordkeeping for accomplishment of the actions required by this AD with the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI). One ATA member requests that carbon brakes be excluded from the applicability of the proposed rule. Airbus adds its concurrence with the ATA member's request, and has advised the ATA that all carbon brakes installed on airplanes manufactured by Airbus are capable of sustaining a maximum energy rejected takeoff (RTO) in a 100 percent worn brake configuration. Airbus also states that no unsafe condition has been identified for airplanes having carbon brakes. Airbus also indicates that issuance of an AD to require implementation of existing CMM limits would impose unnecessary inspections (with associated costs) and would create an unnecessary paperwork burden on operators. Airbus states that, if the proposed rule is adopted, then an inspection would be required for all airplanes, not just the 28 airplanes specified in the economic impact information of the proposal. The FAA does not concur. As discussed in the preamble of the proposal, this AD, as well as other previously issued AD's to mandate specific maximum brake wear limits on transport category airplanes, was prompted by an accident in 1988 involving worn brakes on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplane. During the process of promulgating those AD's, the FAA became aware that not all operators were following the manufacturer's recommended brake wear limits. The FAA acknowledges that the wear limits for carbon brakes have not changed. However, the purpose of this AD is simply to establish the correct brake wear limits for the affected airplanes, including those on which carbon brakes having unchanged brake wear limits, are installed. The FAA acknowledges that operators of airplanes having carbon brakes will be required to confirm that inspections are being accomplished and to record compliance with this AD. However, if an operator already operates in accordance with the wear limits specified in this AD, as implied by ATA and Airbus, then only the costs associated with confirming compliance with the AD and recording such compliance are necessary. The economic impact information specified below addresses 46 airplanes that will be required to accomplish the inspection specified in this AD. (This number, 46, has been revised from the 28 airplanes specified in the proposal; the FAA's latest information is that 46 airplanes will be affected by the inspection requirement.) However, carbon brakes may be installed on some of those airplanes; therefore, some of the 46 airplanes addressed in this AD already may be operated in accordance with its provisions. Therefore, the actual total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators may be less than the cost reflected in the cost estimate information, below. One commenter requests that the brake wear limit specified in the proposed rule for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4 should be revised to read 2.68 ’ ’ (68 mm), rather than 1.97 ’ ’ (50 mm). The commenter indicates that the maximum brake wear limit of 1.97 ’ ’ (50 mm) is already standard for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;1 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;2, whereas a wear limit of 2.68 ’ ’ (68 mm) is specified in the CMM for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4 due to a different configuration that allows greater wear pin length and still maintains RTO performance at the maximum wear limit. The FAA finds that no change to the final rule is necessary in this regard. The proposed rule, as published in the Federal Register on February 15, 1994, specified the correct brake wear limit of 2.68 ’ ’ (68 mm) for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4. That same brake wear limit is contained in this final rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour. The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate. In addition to the number of affected airplanes of U.S. registry that will be required to accomplish the inspection (as discussed previously), the FAA has updated the total number of airplanes of U.S. registry and the number of affected U.S. operators to reflect the latest information available. The FAA estimates that 165 Model A300, A300&hyph;600, A310, and A320 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 7 U.S. operators will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20 work hours per operator, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the revision of its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,400, or $1,200 per operator. The FAA also estimates that it will take 15 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour, to accomplish the required inspection. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change in wear limits for these airplanes (that is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they are worn to their previously approved limits for a one-time change) will be approximately $2,236 per airplane. The FAA estimates that 46 of the 165 affected airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish the inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators of these airplanes is estimated to be $144,256, or $3,136 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no affected operator has accomplished all of the requirements of this AD action, and that no affected operator would accomplish all of those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
