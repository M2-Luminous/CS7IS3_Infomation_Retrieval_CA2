PLO quarters here, however, were surprised by the convening of a meeting for the Revolutionary Council. The Palestinian leaders who are still in the Tunisian capital, the headquarters of the Palestinian leadership, took part in the meeting. AKHIR KHABAR has learned from sources in Fatah that President Yasir 'Arafat told the attendees, only 30 members, that he had met yesterday afternoon with a delegation from the World Bank. He said the delegation offered $10 million out of $42 million that were originally agreed upon at a meeting in Paris last week. 'Arafat said he turned down the offer. 'Arafat also asked the members of the National Authority Council to return to the homeland as soon as possible, stressing the need for the leaders to be among the masses. He praised Council member Furayh Abu-Middayn, saying Abu-Middayn was quick and positive in settling some important issues. 'Arafat stressed that the Fatah movement should remain united so that it can correct anything that could obstruct the activity of the National Authority agencies. He, however, emphasized the need to practice democracy as much as possible under pluralism. Talking about other factions within the PLO, the Palestinian president said some of these factions have started to abandon their hard-line approach that opposes the peace process and are asking to participate in the National Authority Council. According to some quarters within the largest PLO faction, 'Arafat had asked that the committees formed by the Revolutionary Council in its recent session begin working. Three committees will indeed begin working as of today, Saturday, in his presence personally. These committees are concerned with standardizing organizational principles, choosing qualified personnel, and popular committees.
