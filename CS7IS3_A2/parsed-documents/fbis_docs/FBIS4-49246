The development of coal resources in Guizhou would form a rational distribution of energy in the country. It is estimated that Guizhou's coal reserves rank third in the country and more than the total coal resources in ten or more of the southern provinces. Guizhou's coal industry has been speeded up in recent years with newly-built and renovated projects going into production this year and next year and a batch of large-scale coal mines with a yearly output of three to four million tonnes will be built. Some power plants in coal mining areas will be built to realize the conversion of coal into electric power. Experts from the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Coal Industry have concluded, however, after a joint investigation into Guizhou's coal resources that coal development in Guizhou was impractical and failed to meet the demand for quality anthracite and coking coal in the south. Guizhou, in response, decided to jointly develop its coal resources with relevant departments and other provinces short of coal as well as with foreign investors to speed up the development of the coal industry there.
