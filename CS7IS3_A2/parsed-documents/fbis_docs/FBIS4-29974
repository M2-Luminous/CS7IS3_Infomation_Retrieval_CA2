The situation in Cambodia remains serious, despite the fact that the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] spent $2 billion to remedy it. War has continued, and nothing has been resolved. More aggressor Vietnamese forces have continued to flow into Cambodia. Meanwhile, the government with two prime ministers has continued to provoke the war, attacking the people and patriotic forces. The meager sum of foreign financial aid has been spent on the military and war operations. Therefore, no efforts for national reconstruction have been made. Even roads in Phnom Penh have not been repaired. The economy does not exist because all the money has been drained by the war. The people are displaced, thus they have no chance to be productive. Some areas that could produce a small amount could hardly meet their own need. This is why there are no products for export in exchange for foreign currency. The officials in the government with two prime ministers are very corrupt. This diplomat added that there are currently internal rifts within the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]. They oppose Prince Ranariddh, who has pursued a dictatorial policy and associated himself with the Cambodian People's Party [CPC] and especially with Hun Sen. Ranariddh does not listen to anyone. He listens only to the orders of the United States, France, Australia, and particularly the communist Vietnamese through Hun Sen, Sar Kheng, and Chea Sim. This is why, although the communist Vietnamese have moved the border markers 20 to 30 kilometers inside Cambodia, Ranariddh has said nothing. Due to these national and social problems, the people of all circles are very worried about the fate of the nation and people. Therefore, there have been demands that power be given to King Norodom Sihanouk for a few years so that he can settle national problems by forming a national salvation government with the king as the prime minister and four deputy prime ministers, namely, Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen, (?Sam Rangsi), and Khieu Samphan. Only by so doing can the serious national and social problems be resolved.
