David Messman, Branch Chief, at (202) 272&hyph;3018 (Office of Investment Company Regulation, Division of Investment Management). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is an open-end diversified management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On September 13, 1984, applicant filed a notification of registration on Form N&hyph;8A. 1 On September 16, 1985, applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement became effective on November 29, 1985, and applicant's initial public offering commenced immediately thereafter. 1 Applicant formerly was named Integrated Insured Tax Free Fund. 2. At a joint meeting held on March 31, 1993, the boards of trustees of applicant and SunAmerica Income Funds (the ``Acquiring Company''), a series company organized as a Massachusetts business trust, approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Agreement'') between applicant and the Acquiring Company. The Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are collectively referred to as the ``Reorganization.'' The Agreement provided for the transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of applicant's series, SunAmerica Tax Exempt Insured Fund (the ``Fund'') 2 in exchange for shares of SunAmerica Tax Exempt Insured Fund (the ``Acquiring Fund''). The Acquiring Company is a series company organized as a Massachusetts business trust, 3 and the Acquiring Fund is a series of the Acquiring Company. 2 The Fund was named Selected Tax-exempt Real Estate Income Pooled Shares prior to the Reorganization, and originally was named Selected Term Real Estate Income Pooled Share. 3 The Acquiring Company was named SunAmerica Income Portfolios prior to the Reorganization. 3. Applicant stated in proxy materials filed in connection with the Reorganization that the purpose of the Reorganization was to provide additional flexibility in purchasing shares of the SunAmerica mutual funds, eliminate duplication of administrative and management tasks, and provide applicant's shareholders with a wider range of investment options. 4. Applicant, the Acquiring company, and the Acquiring Fund are ``affiliated persons'' of each other, as that term is defined in the Act, solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common trustees, and common officers. Applicant and the Acquiring Company relied on rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act in order to exempt the transaction from the affiliated transaction prohibition of section 17(a) of the Act. To avail itself of the rule 17a&hyph;8 exemption, each of the boards of directors of applicant and the Acquiring Company determined that the Reorganization was in the best interest of the shareholders and that the interests of existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization. 5. Preliminary proxy materials were filed on June 17, 1993, as part of the Acquiring Company's registration statement on Form N&hyph;14. Definitive proxy materials relating to the Reorganization were filed on July 29, 1993, and mailed to applicant's shareholders on or about that date. Applicant's shareholders voted to approve the Agreement on September 23, 1993. 6. As of October 1, 1993, applicant had 14,839,217.351 shares outstanding, having an aggregate net asset value of $190,683,942.96, and a per share net asset value of $12.85. On October 1, 1993, pursuant to the Agreement, applicant transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund. The aggregate net asset value of Acquiring Fund shares received was equal to the net asset value of the Fund's shares held. Applicant then distributed the Acquiring Fund's shares it received pro rata to its shareholders, in complete liquidation of applicant. 7. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the Reorganization. Pursuant to the Agreement, the expenses for effecting the Reorganization were borne by the participating funds, including applicant and the Acquiring Company. Such expenses, which are not expected to exceed $50,000 for applicant, include preparation of proxy materials, printing expenses, and legal and accounting fees. 8. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. 9. On March 23, 1994, applicant filed a certificate of Termination of Trust with the Massachusetts Secretary of State. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8928 Filed 4&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
