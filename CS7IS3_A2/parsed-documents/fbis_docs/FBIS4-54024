FBIS4-54024 "dreas101__a94032" FBIS-EAS-94-101-A Daily Report 13 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Trading Firms Expand Presence Throughout Asia Trading Firms Expand Presence Throughout Asia 942A0235A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 May 94 p 12--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0235A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Major Japanese trading companies are increasing personnel assigned to Asia. The objective is to promote a rapidly growing market. Sales handled in the region by trading firms represent about one-third of worldwide figures, but underlying growth potential is huge and the trading firms have reached the assessment that "they have no choice but to boost their revenue in Asia." Such moves by trading firms are likely to continue into the future despite a trend to otherwise reduce overseas personnel assignments as a cost-reduction measure. As of April, Nissho Iwai had 280 personnel assigned to the Asia, reflecting an increase of 34 (14 percent) in a one-year period. Total personnel assigned overseas is 548, a reduction of 21 in the same period. The company has adopted a "strategic personnel" system under which it assigns individuals for a two-year extended temporary duty period as a means of handling the need to increase personnel in Asia. Overseas assignment expenses were normally absorbed by the respective divisions such as steel and machinery in the past, but since such an approach would not allow for major increases in overseas assignments, the expenses are now accounted for in the company overhead category. Increases are noticeable in China, where the staff has been increased by 13 to 49. Staffing in Vietnam has been roughly doubled to 21, the largest for an integrated trading company. The company has opened an office staffed with local personnel at the Pun Tao oil transmission station in southern Vietnam which is engaged in the development of energy resources. Personnel have also been assigned to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyztan. Sumitomo increased Asia region staffing to 209 (20 percent) in one year. Increased staffing included 13 for China, five each for Thailand and Indonesia, and three each for Hong Kong and Vietnam. The additional personnel were noticeable in the industrial infrastructure area and handle items such as plants, communications, electronics, and aircraft. Half of the overseas assignment expenses were charged to headquarters in order to alleviate the burden on each of the operating divisions. A vice president was placed in charge of the Asia region to strengthen control over regional activities. Marubeni increased Asian regional staffing to 266 or by 10. Staffing in Vietnam was roughly doubled to 6 in Ho Chi Minh city and 5 in Hanoi. Further, the senior individual assigned to Vietnam and India was raised in rank to that of representative director. Other trading firms are making similar moves. Profits being reaped by the trading firms are sizeable in Asia, rendering the situation such that they will equal or exceed those being realized in Europe and the United States, where business has been declining.
