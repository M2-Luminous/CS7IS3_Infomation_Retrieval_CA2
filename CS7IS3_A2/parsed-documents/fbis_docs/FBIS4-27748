The policy is aimed at establishing security in the South, which has been plagued by Muslim separatist attacks and bombings. According to the sources, the policy will aim at: -- Social psychology: The building of understanding and the decreasing of suspicion to increase cooperation at all levels of society. -- Economic development: Ensuring that development plans can yield results. While there will be no more special investment privileges than in the other three investment zones, it is necessary to develop other facilities to attract investors, since the South is far from the centre of government. These include basic infrastructure, such as communications and transportation. -- Administration: Improve the political and administrative methods, in particular the efficiency of civil servants so that they do not become a cause for dissatisfaction among the people. Increase the participation of the people through local administration bodies, and improve the efficiency of agencies responsible for realising policies at the national and local levels. -- Law and order: Continue to use politics before military action, in conjunction with covert operations, to pressure armed rebels. Separatist movements are still capable of terrorist and sabotage acts, and resources will have to be put into security work in the police and military. -- Foreign affairs: Continue to forge good relations with neighbours so that cooperation can bring mutual benefit. Cooperation will have to be sought from Muslim countries while increasing economic links, trade and investment. -- Policy administration: Though there is a special form of administration under the Fourth Army Region Commander, there is disunity and inefficiency, which lead to difficulties in solving problems. Better coordination will be needed and resources provided, and the frame of reference for any work will have to be made more clear.
