A comprehensive, pragmatic, and highly manipulative "government work report" will produce a positive impact on China's reform, opening up, stability, and development this year. The "government work report" delivered by Li Peng at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress today was drafted after extensively heeding opinions of various sectors and collecting information from various quarters. On 13 January this year, the "government work report" drafting group was officially set up, composed of 12 members from seven comprehensive departments comprising the State Council's Research Center, the CPC Central Policy Research Center, the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, the State Economic and Trade Commission, the State Planning Commission, the People's Bank of China, and the State Statistical Bureau. In a small, quiet building on picturesque Yuquanshan, located in the western suburbs of Beijing, the drafting group worked painstakingly for more than 20 days. At first, they set to writing separately, and afterward worked together to have the draft report completed in mid-February. What is worth mentioning is that all the members of the drafting group are from authoritative comprehensive departments, and most of them have outstanding theoretical achievements and practical work experience. They have active minds and are of relatively high quality. Owing to their day-to-day work, they are more familiar with the overall conditions of China's society and some problems that temporarily exist. These drafters are: Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the State Council's Research Center; Huang Jian, deputy head of the Comprehensive Group of the above center; Shen Bonian, head of the Financial and Economic Group of the above center; Guo Zhenying, head of the Industrial and Communications Group of the above center; Huang Shouhong, research fellow of the Agricultural Group of the above center; Zou Ping, deputy head of the Cultural and Educational Work Group of the above center; Li Jiange, deputy director of the Policy and Legislation Department of the State Economic and Trade Commission; Lin Zhaomu, deputy director of the Research Center of the State Planning Commission; Peng Sen, deputy director of the Comprehensive Department of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy; Wu Xiaoling, deputy director of the Structural Reform Department of the People's Bank of China; Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the State Statistical Bureau; and Zheng Xinbiao, deputy head of the Cultural and Educational Work Group of the Central Policy Research Center. During the drafting process, the draft "government work report" was repeatedly discussed and revised at the State Council's executive meetings, as well as at meetings of the CPC Politburo and its Standing Committee. In addition, the drafting group extensively solicited the opinions of various localities, departments, democratic parties, personalities without party affiliation, and representatives from various grass-roots units. Premier Li Peng called discussions five times to listen to the revised proposals from various sectors. Therefore, the report read by the premier today should be said to have fully represented the will of all strata, quarters, and personalities from various circles. It has defined the keynotes and charted the course for China's reform this year. An authoritative source said: The themes of Premier Li Peng's "government work report" are to deepen reform and maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. What attracts people's attention is that he particularly stressed the necessity of handling the relationships among reform, development, and stability. Development is the only way for China to attain a lasting good order, and is the ultimate goal that comes up to the expectations of the people. Reform is the motive force for achieving rapid development, and stability is a guarantee for reform and a prerequisite for development. The three aspects are closely related to one another. Careful people may have discovered that this year's "government work report" is concise, to the point, relatively short, and unadorned. A person in charge of the drafting group said that one of the reasons for the shortness of this year's report is that major policies and principles have been defined. The drafting group strove to be concise in writing and focused on the major tasks to be grasped by the State Council this year. Hence, the report does not list in detail all achievements scored by various departments last year and the tasks to be performed this year.
