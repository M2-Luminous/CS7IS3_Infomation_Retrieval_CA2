The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean carries on page 5 a 1,600-world article by Washington-based correspondent Yang Sung-hyon summing up Foreign Minister Han's visit to the United States. Recalling that North Korea begins to show signs of change through its 12 February Foreign Ministry statement while Foreign Minister Han's U.S. visit was close to an end, the article analyzes that Foreign Minister Han attempted to deliver three different messages to North Korea through his U.S. visit. The article says the first message is "the invariable efforts to settle the nuclear matter through dialogue." The article notes that the ROK and the United States, through in-depth discussions, were able to tug out an agreement to "open a dialogue channel to the last moment for the solution of nuclear problem." The second message, the article maintains, is connected with "the reports on a crisis on the Korean peninsula and the United States preparing stern measures against North Korea." The article interprets Han's expression of mild gestures as a move to avoid the current situation on the Korean peninsula being termed as a crisis. Citing the ROK-U.S. agreement that if the North Korean issue was referred to the Security Council, UN action against Pyongyang should be taken in stages rather than through immediate sanctions, the article says Han made clear that "the ROK and the United States have no intention of driving North Korea to an extreme situation." The third message, the article notes, is "an expression of firm will to use a stick if North Korea continues to hold out to the end." The article says that the ROK and U.S. Governments try to deliver a warning to North Korea that unless North Korea accepts inspections by the end of February, sanctions by the international community against North Korea will be "out of our hands." The article sees that North Korea reacted to Han's such messages through its 12 February Foreign Ministry statement and concludes that "in this perspective, Han's visit can be evaluated as successful." The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,400-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Pyong-chin on Foreign Minister Han's achievements during his U.S. visit. Citing press reports focusing on possible military scenarios in case of war on the Korean peninsula, the article says Han, in connection with this, has calmed down the U.S. media's aggravated reports by pointing out detailed points. The article continues that "the purpose of Han's U.S. visit is to narrow the differences in opinions for the solution of the nuclear problem and to make correct diagnosis of the reports on a crisis on the Korean peninsula by going into the epicenter of the reports." The article then adds that "President Kim's personal letter to President Clinton also firmly reaffirmed ROK-U.S. cooperation over the nuclear issue and expressed "concern and unpleasantness" over the U.S. media's reports on a crisis on the Korean peninsula. The article concludes by saying that Han reassured the U.S. media that the current military movements on the Korean peninsula--including the recent reports on concentration of North Korean troops near the DMZ, deployment of the Patriot missiles, and resumption of Team Spirit exercise--are not something new aimed at preparing steps to countermeasure a possible crisis.
