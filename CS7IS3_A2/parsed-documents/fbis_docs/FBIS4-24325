FBIS4-24325 "drafr126_e_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-126 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia AFL Said Covering for Officials Involved in Massacres AFL Said Covering for Officials Involved in Massacres AB2906175994 Gbarnga Radio ELRL in English 1400 GMT 29 Jun 94 AB2906175994 Gbarnga Radio ELRL English BFN [Excerpts] In their attempt to escape justice for involvement in massacres at the Lutheran Church and the United Nations compound in Monrovia and the Harbel massacre in Marguibi County, the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL] and the Monrovia-based politicians of the former IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] have embarked on a cover-up for AFL officials and certain ministers of the dissolved Sawyer government. The officials allegedly connected -- especially to the Harbel massacre -- include State Councilman Phillip Banks and former IGNU Information Minister Lamine Waritay, for presenting false evidence on the Harbel massacre. Former IGNU Foreign Minister Bacchus Matthews will also face trial for attaching a cover letter to the communications sent to the American State Department and Amnesty International on the Harbel massacres. Former President Amos Sawyer, as the then AFL commander in chief, is to also have his share of the war crimes trial. As for the United Nations compound and the Lutheran Church massacres, Armed Forces of Liberia Chief of Staff Hezekiah Bowen, Charles Julue, (Edward Slanger), (Moses Wright), and several other key elements within the Monrovia AFL and security network will be the ones to face trial. These massacres against innocent Liberian civilians by the Armed Forces of Liberia and the dissolved interim government of Amos Sawyer were reportedly carried out outside actual combat, which warrants their trial. Two former Nigerian ECOMOG commanders, Generals Joshua Dogonyaro and Adetunji Olurin, also form part of the massacre case in Liberia during the war crimes trial. Meanwhile, the NPFL leader, Former President Taylor, has spelled out how ECOMOG, an alien military force, has been assisting the AFL and the Monrovia group in murdering Liberians in large numbers. [Begin Taylor recording] [Word indistinct] ECOMOG (?without) ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] sent a murderous government here, and they must bear the full responsibility for the murder of our people. They must bear the responsibility for the murder of our people. [repeats sentence] We are not talking about recrimination. Acts, wrongful acts, have been committed by all sides throughout the crisis. We are not talking about witch-hunting, paying back, but we have known for several years individuals that are walking the streets of Monrovia that individual Liberians can identify as having slain their mothers, their fathers, their brothers -- beheaded them. Why should these people continue to walk? These are sick minds and must be extracted from society. They must be. People can identify who murdered Van Richards, people can identify who beheaded [name indistinct], people can identify who shot at the Lutheran Church. We are not talking about witch-hunting here. We are talking about blatant, calculated, premeditated murder. [end recording] The NPFL leader said that various atrocities in Liberia were carried out with the pre-disposition of blaming them on the NPFL. He spoke of the need for action against those involved in the wailful murders of Liberians. [Begin Taylor recording] [passage omitted] All of those that are responsible must present themselves to be arrested, and we are calling upon the United Nations to set up a special court to try these people. [end recording]
