The Social Democrat (SPD) former mayor of Bremen, Hans Kochnick, has been named by the European Union in agreement with the German government, SPD foreign affairs official Karsten Voigt told AFP. Voigt said it had been envisaged for some time to send Kochnick to the town as its administrator, and this was set to materialise "as peace slowly comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina". DER SPIEGEL magazine reported a month ago that a German civil administrator was to be sent to Mostar, and would be assisted in restoring public services by German police and civil servants. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Wednesday that he favoured Germany taking a role in reconstruction efforts in former Yugoslavia.
