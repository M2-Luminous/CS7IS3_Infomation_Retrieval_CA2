The amnesty "puts a constructive dialogue (between the president and the parliament) under big doubt", Pain told TASS on Wednesday adding that it would not promote stability in society either. However, he stressed that the Duma decision should not postpone the presidential address as it is a message "not only to the Federal Assembly, but to the whole society". On Wednesday the Duma overwhelmingly voted to declare an amnesty to organisers of the 1991 Soviet coup, of the armed opposition revolt in Moscow last year and of the hard-line demonstration in May 1993. All the three events resulted in bloodshed. Pain, who is a member of the Presidential Council, regretted that the faction headed by Sergey Shakhray also voted to pardon the rebels. "It is regretful that the amnesty for political adventurists was supported by the faction with the name of "Russian Unity and Accord".
