FBIS4-48654 "drafr100_c_94025" FBIS-AFR-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 24 May South African Press Review for 24 May MB2405123994 MB2405123994 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Action Urged Against Drug-Trafficking -- In a somber editorial the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 May on page 16 writes that "one of the darker consequencies of South Africa's return to world respectability is the danger already being posed by the import of hard drugs. Huge increases over recent years in the confiscated amounts of LSD, heroin and cocaine attest to this." The editorial further warns of some of the social characteristics in South Africa that may encourage those who peddle in the drug trade. "Our fragile new democracy, with its vast numbers of unemployed on the streets and an entrenched tradition of lawlessness, must look particularly fruitful to them." BUSINESS DAY KwaZulu Land Deal Viewed -- "The transfer of 1.2 million hectares of land to a trust controlled by King Goodwill Zwelithini does not appear to be, in itself, cause for concern, which in some circles is reaching almost hysterical proportions," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 May in a page 14 editorial. "The affected rural areas of KwaZulu/Natal are among the country's most overpopulated and overfarmed and could hardly be redistributed to newcomers." "What is disturbing, though, is the way the measure was furtively pushed through, and the implications this has for peace in KwaZulu/Natal." "The last thing the country needed on the eve of the opening of the new Parliament was questions about the good faith of De Klerk and Buthelezi, representing the non-ANC sectors of the new government." SUNDAY NATION SDU's Criticized -- "Self-Defence Units [SDU] have played a sterling role in the protection of our communities in the past three to four years," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 22 May in a page 6 editorial. "They succeeded where the formal enforcement agencies failed." After commending the SDU's, however, the editorial states that "what is amply apparent is that the SDUs have, in some cases, decayed into bands of criminals masquerading as defenders of our communities." To remedy this situation, 2 courses of action need to be followed: first, "the element of transperancy" in community policing needs to be established; second, "we must disarm the SDUs. Neither of this will be easy. There is still a great deal of suspicion, and justifiably so." The editorial thens floats the possibility of integrating the SDU's into the police force: "Incorporating members of the SDUs into a new police force must not be rejected out of hand."
