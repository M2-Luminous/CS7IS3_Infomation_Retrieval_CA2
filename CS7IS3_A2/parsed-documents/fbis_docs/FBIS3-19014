But on what bases could an agreement between the League and the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] be formed? At the very most, after the elections, if the progressive forces fail to win, there would be an agreement with Martinazzoli's Popular Party [PPI]." Franco Bassanini swore that for the present the PDS is not thinking about a constituent government at all, "because we do not want it and because the conditions for forming one do not exist. In any case, there is no question of our joining with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi." So the PDS is rejecting the solicitations from the League which, behind its official statements, seems prepared to govern "with the devil himself" as long as it can get rid of Berlusconi and have its hands free again. Thus the League's harsh voice became mellifluous when [League ideologist] Miglio addressed [PDS Secretary] Occhetto on the subject of federalism, when the mayor of Varese said in Strasbourg that "the League is willing to engage in dialogue with the left if it embraces the idea of local government," when [League lower house floor leader] Maroni spoke about an "institutional government" in the event of none of the alignments gaining a victory on 27 March -- that is, a government that will enable parliament to further modify the ground rules, to complete the "restyling" of the Constitution, and to restore decisionmaking power to the country. In fact, the League is not alone in thinking this way. [Pact for Italy leader] Segni too believes that "unless a majority capable of producing an executive is formed after the elections, the only remaining path will be an institutional government." This is perfectly consistent with Martinazzoli's thinking (he introduced the idea within the context of the political debate) and with [Senate speaker] Spadolini (who originated the idea). But Occhetto does not seem to be allowing himself to be led astray by the sirens, is attacking "the brokers of the old politics" who "have set to work recently," and said that he does not like such formulas as the "institutional government" or the "constituent government." The PDS secretary expressed his "amazement" that there are those who are aiming to "dispossess" people of their votes and thus to recycle the old way of conducting politics. Let the voters decide, Occhetto is saying, though he too has his own "formulas" and his own kind of government, which he calls the government "of national reconstruction" or the "caretaker" government. On what kind of majority would it rest if the progressive pole fails to achieve an absolute majority? The PDS secretary did not explain this openly, but when he says that the left will never join "with the three cronies of the right" -- Berlusconi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, and Bossi -- that leaves only the Pact and the PPI. To protect himself against charges of consociationism, Occhetto specified that "to rebuild is a national necessity, not the same old sham of the old politics of consociation." Of course, in an election campaign every alignment will say that it is sure of victory: The Left is doing so, the Right is doing so, and even the center is trying to do so. But it is equally clear that some major maneuverings are being planned. And while the League is doing so brazenly, the PDS and the center are trying to avoid making it explicit, while on the Right only the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] still professes its faith in Berlusconi.
