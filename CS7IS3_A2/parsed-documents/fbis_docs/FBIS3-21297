Reports about the selection of the F-15I made banner headlines in most of the Israeli media as "the plane that can fly to Iran and back without refueling." If they had just wanted to tout the virtues of the plane and justify its astronomical price (more than $100 million per aircraft), they could have noted that it has the range to reach London and Moscow. Most likely, however, neither the British nor the Russians would have appreciated Israel's pointed gesture. All the more so, indications that Iran is the target of the F-15I are neither unappreciated nor taken as a joke in Tehran. If I were Iran's chief of staff, I would see the headlines coming out of Israel, and the fact that they emanate from Israel's top brass, as a serious military threat. The ability of the F-15 to reach Iran without refueling reduces the value of continuous operations there. So, if I were the Iranian chief of staff, I would pay attention to the timing of the publication of a book on Israel's nuclear might and conclude that these planes are intended for nothing other than to be the means of delivering nuclear weapons. This threat, which we have gone to such lengths to make public, provides Iran a legitimate reason for taking drastic "defensive measures" and arming itself with a deterrent. Is that what was intended when we specified the target? Israel this week named Iran as our foremost enemy in the future. The troubling question is, how do we reach such fateful decisions? Who decides, and how and where is it decided, who is Israel's future enemy? Did the general staff come to this decision after probing discussion? I doubt that. Indeed, both the chief of staff and the chief of Army Intelligence last year refused to identify Iran as the enemy. Did the government sit in one of its famous marathon sessions and decide that it needs to prepare for war against Iran? To the best of my information, no real decision of that nature was made. So who has decided who the enemy is? Yitzhaq Rabin's initial comments regarding Iran were made in the Knesset on 20 January 1993, in answer to a question posed by Knesset member Efra'im Sheh. Rabin said then that: "We are following with concern Iran's nuclear activities and its attempts to develop a long-range ground-to-ground missile." The practical conclusion he expressed then was that: "We must speed up the peace process and create an international system that provides an answer to the Iranian threat." Over the past year, Rabin frequently has stated his concern about the Iranian threat. The administration's decision to make the advanced technologies of the F-15 available to Israel surely comes from Clinton's appreciation of Israel's fears about Iran. Sneh, who has led in sounding the alarm against the Iranian threat, both in Israel and in mobilizing world public opinion, does not believe that 20 F-15I aircraft are the answer to the Khumeyni ideology. In fact, we have not yet found a military answer to the danger of what Rabin has called "Khomeynism without Khomeyni." The only thing we have done, not without a little success, has been to arouse international attention and to point out that a missile that can reach Israel also can reach Riyadh, Tokyo and New Delhi, a fact that explains American pressure on North Korea not to sell long-range missiles to Iran. Iran potentially is a future strategic threat to Israel. As a matter of priorities, however, Israel does not head Iran's list of strategic targets. Iran is working at this stage on three tracks: 1) systematic exploitation of oil exports; 2) undermining the current Arab regimes--Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and, of course, subordination of the Palestinian entity through Hamas; and 3) the final goal, which is to marshal the 900 million Muslims of the world into its service under a single theological roof. In the long term, if Iran realizes its dream of building a Khomeynian empire in all the Muslim nations, from Algeria to Turkmenistan, Israel would have good reason for concern. But by identifying it now as an enemy target, we force Iran to move Israel to the top of its list of objectives. By making clear that we are receiving "an airplane that can reach Iran and return without refueling," we are showing off more than we are showing wisdom.
