What gave rise to this document, and what has it changed in the life of our soldiers? Vladislav Shunevich, chief of staff and first deputy commander of Turkmenistan's border troops, speaks: "Turkmenia's state border has always been complex. It is 2,472.1 km long. It extends over mountains and desert sands, along rivers, and across the Caspian. In the old union it was `covered' by the Central Asia Border District. As of 11 August 1992 the guarding of the border passed entirely into the hands of Turkmenistan. I will not say that these changes caused a disaster. But the `green caps' encountered serious problems. Owing to the rupture of ties with Russia, it became difficult to maintain in `combat readiness' the various obstacles in the path of possible violators. "In previous years it was mainly Slav officers and soldiers who were sent to the USSR's southern border. It was thought that they stood up better to the heat here and, moreover, any contact with Iranians and Afghans was ruled out on ethnic grounds. After Ukraine and Belarus demanded the return of their servicemen before 31 [date as published] November, and the Russian Supreme Soviet of its troops before 31 December 1993, a mass exodus began. Incidentally, the last six compulsory-service Russian soldiers left the border literally one month ago. Here I will emphasize that there was not a single case of desertion! As a rule, officers were transferred back home only after they had trained a replacement. Nevertheless, we have run into an acute shortage of professionals. "A partial solution has been found. A school for junior officers `forges' lieutenants and ensigns in the space of three months. Students drafted from higher educational institutions have closed up the breaches among specialists in communications and in motor vehicle and aviation hardware. University graduates have become deputy commanders for work with personnel, henceforth made up entirely of residents of Turkmenia. "Today one-half of the officers are already Turkmens. But we risked losing the Russian servicemen who had stayed -- the backbone of the commander corps. The first talks began under Russian Security Minister Barannikov. They soon reached impasse. The deadlock was overcome when Andrey Nikolayev came to head the Russian Federation's border troops. Much was resolved by his talks with President Saparmurad Niyazov of Turkmenistan -- knots of problems were `unraveled.' "A joint command has been set up, headed by the commander of Turkmenistan's border troops. He has two deputies. I, the chief of staff, am one, and the other is the chief of the Russian Border Troops Operations Group, to whom all the Russian servicemen are subordinate. The Russian Federation has taken on their funding, while Turkmenistan will pay for the supply of hardware, ammunition, and arms. The most important thing is that the Russian officer can continue to serve calmly. He retains all rights and privileges indefinitely. You know, some officers who had tendered requests for a transfer have now withdrawn them. "What is service like for the Russian officer in Turkmenia? There are no problems with housing or children's schooling. All school graduates whose fathers are serving in the Border Troops Directorate entered institutes or universities last year. Wages are paid at the officer's request either in manats or in rubles. There is no question of discrimination along ethnic lines. All the border detachment chiefs of staff are Russian officers. Yes, language problems do arise. But the Turkmens speak Russian, and all orders are given in it. Office work is also done in Russian. "The signed agreement is also advantageous to Russia. Afghanistan remains a zone of heightened tension. The Turkmen leadership maintains close, good relations with the leaders of the northwestern provinces -- Turan Ismail Khan and Rashid Dostam -- but this does not remove all problems. Mass poverty is pushing Afghans into robbery and theft and the seizure of pastures and lands. The drugs business has assumed dangerous proportions in Afghanistan and is literally breaching the border. It is possible to speak purely hypothetically about a border service on the Afghan side, but many servicemen there, moreover, are light-fingered and live by smuggling. "The Iranian border is a little quieter. A pass regime has been introduced there. But all kinds of things happen. A subunit under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lopushko recently tracked down some smugglers who were using three horses to carry a 150 kg consignment of drugs from Afghanistan across Turkmenia into Iran. The servicemen pursued them across snow-covered mountains for more than 30 km, caught up with them, and disarmed them after a fight. "If Russia quits the Turkmen border, a muddy wave of crime and terrorism and a wave of drugs will swamp the Commonwealth countries. There have been proposals to move the border further north, but that is unrealistic. It would cost a colossal amount of money to equip."
