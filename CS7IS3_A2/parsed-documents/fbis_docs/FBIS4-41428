This decision was made following the criticism President Nursultan Nazarbayev leveled at the program. He told the government to update it in the light of proposals made by every government member. Every minister will have to sign the program and then bear responsibility for its implementation. Nazarbayev was confident that the anti-crisis program had to dictate the government's tactics for the coming 12 to 15 months. The goal is to cut the monthly inflation rate to below 10 percent. He thought that the production decline could not be overcome unless Kazakhstan's own producers and entrepreneurs were encouraged. The government decided to discuss the anti-crisis program again next week. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko presented to parliament a memorandum on the government's socio-economic policy. He said that Kazakhstan had exhausted the domestic sources of financing for reforming its economy. Therefore, he thought, the country needs foreign credits. Preparations for them will take 15 months, he explained. Tereshchenko said that the government would act in three stages during that period. At the first stage, from June to December 1994, the government will rely chiefly on domestic resources for budget financing. Within that time inflation will be reduced to below 10 percent and the tenge, the national currency, would be stabilized to some extent. At the second stage, from January to September 1995, the government expects an agreement on medium-term credits to be signed, an accelerated integration with Russia and CIS member nations and investments by the G7 group. The third stage will be the beginning of a new economic policy. The government intends to lay the foundation for an improvement of living standards and a production growth. Tereshchenko emphasized that the government would pursue an unswerving anti-inflation policy, reduce taxes, carry out a bank reform and step up privatization. He insisted that reforms could not be carried out without properly financing the social sphere, because otherwise society would reject them. He wanted parliament to support the budget and said that if the country stood by it, foreign loans would be easier to obtain. Answering questions, Tereshchenko said he did not think the country could return to the ruble zone because of the significant differences between the Russian and Kazakh economies. He called for introduction of a transnational CIS currency, the altyn, and added that this idea had been initially put forward by Nazarbayev in his draft plan of setting up a Eurasian Union. Tereshchenko recalled that Kazakhstan had had to leave the ruble zone and introduce its own currency because, in his words, Russia had demanded a gift of nearly $1.5 billion. He said that the talks between Moscow and Minsk on the setting up of a ruble zone had been futile for nearly six months. Tereshchenko thought, however, that a joint economic space and lifting customs duties inside the CIS would facilitate integration of CIS member nations.
