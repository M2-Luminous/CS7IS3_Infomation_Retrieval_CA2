The budget allocation for national defense was one of the fundamental complications in the ratification of this annual financial plan. May we remind you that at the first reading of the draft budget, the State Duma, by a majority of votes, adopted the government proposal and ratified the military budget in the amount of 37 trillion rubles [R]. The Duma's decision was turned down by the Federation Council, which deemed that the expenditure for military needs should be R56 trillion, and the draft was returned to the lower house for further examination. The State Duma, in considering this issue again, came to the conclusion that it could allocate no more than an additional R4 trillion for all military expenditures. Thus, the maximum figure the military can count on in 1994 is R41 trillion. It is important to note that the shortfall in the amount requested by the Defense Ministry will most probably be the substantial reason for not satisfying social needs of servicemen in the current year, primarily in respect to their housing needs, daily life, and medical services. The most unexpected thing in this whole affair was that Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, president of Russia, the person on whose backing the Ministry of Defense counted most of all, supported the Duma's initiative in limiting the 1994 military budget.
