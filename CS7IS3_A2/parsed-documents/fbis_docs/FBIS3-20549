So-called nonstructural corruption refers to the exploitation by some of their job conveniences and authority to engage in corrupt actions that directly encroach on and damage the interests of others or of society, such as graft, bribe-taking, and fraud. As such corrupt behavior directly violates the law, it can be punished by law and, as long as the party and government pay it great attention and control it strongly, it is very easy to root out. But so-called structural corruption refers to the exploitation by certain people of their regular job conveniences and authority in particular social, political, and economic structures, due to management systems and regulations being imperfect and unsound, and premised on not affecting their own organizational interests and ensuring that their own organizations operate normally according to practice, to engage in certain behavior for private gain, such as trading power for profit, exchanging power for money, trading power for material, using public monies for entertaining and gift-giving, traveling abroad at public expense, using public vehicles for private purposes, using public office for private gain, and indulging in extravagance and waste. Such corrupt behavior is necessarily much more covert than nonstructural corruption. It may apparently not be a direct violation of laws and regulations, or be a violation that is very hard to expose, as long as "only a few know about it." Due to this feature of structural corruption, it is very hard to investigate and punish, as well as being very liable to spreading quickly once the climate eases. And it is only when it abets the growth of nonstructural corruption, or corrupts overall social values, or has a significant impact on overall public interests, that it arouses great attention by the general public. As China's political and economic management systems are still not perfect and sound in many areas, structural corruption occupies a key position in corrupt behavior. This is precisely why the phenomenon of corruption has always been hard to curb. Having investigated the case records of a certain province for 1991, I have discovered that most of the cases handled were nonstructural corruption (direct violations), mostly graft, while there were very few cases of structural corruption, showing that structural corruption is very covert and hard to investigate and punish. China's current structural corruption can be roughly divided again into the following four situations. 1. Corruption caused by shortages. Shortages in the field of economics show up as demand exceeding supply for certain goods (funds) with designated prices. When the macroeconomy is not controlled or uncontrollable, the choice of clients by functional departments of enterprises, commodity departments, or officials in charge of certain commodities or fund distribution becomes a kind of power which, under existing conditions, easily turns into a certain individual's power. As the choice of client does not in any case affect the department's normal operations, the individual exploitation of such power for private gain falls within the normal range of responsibililty, with very little likelihood of severe censure, so that quite naturally, the choice of whoever makes the most gifts is also logical. Shortages in the field of social organization are also widespread, showing up mainly as demand exceeding supply for officials, cadres, and workers, or limited positions with many wishing to become officials, cadres, and workers. This gives great power to organizational, personnel, and labor departments, or certain other departments and individuals with jurisdiction over personnel, which power, without democracy, openness, or effective restraint, is very easily exploited for private purposes. As whoever is chosen does not directly impact the organization per se, being part of the organization's normal work responsibility, such conduct for private purposes is hard to uncover. And while it might be condemned by outsiders (which condemnation is very dangerous), it is very difficult for it to be genuinely investigated and punished. So shortages obviously create power. Since the individual exploitation of such power does not directly endanger normal organizational activities, as long as democracy is imperfect and individual power is not effectively restrained by organizations, it will be widely exploited for private gain, leaving such corruption to spread. It needs to be pointed out that under our traditional system before 1979, while shortages were more severe than at present, the pheonomenon of corruption was certainly not as serious. This was because the state exercised strict control over areas, such as personnel, wages, prices, and markets, putting more limits on such corruption. 2. Corruption caused by irregular competition. Competition was the product of our development of a commodity economy, being an inevitable social development. Reasonable competition can make excellence even better, and transform inferiority into excellence, contributing to economic development, the display of pent-up talent, and social progress. But when rational competition mechanisms are still imperfect, certain people will actively draw or depend on certain powers to give themselves an advantageous position in competition, while also granting certain benefits to powerholders. This power in turn helps them to further strengthen their advantageous position in competition, forming the logical equation of power plus competition equals success. On the other hand, competitors who have not found any patronage are left in a disadvantageous position, finding it either impossible or difficult to go on. The current dual-pricing system's "official" and "private" corruption are typical examples of power combined with competition. Most of the economic entities now being run by certain government organs or functional departments are also suspect due to this. 3. Corruption caused by imperfect power-oversight mechanisms per se. Perfect power-oversight mechanisms should include internal oversight mechanisms, external oversight mechanisms, and oversight mechanisms for the overseers themselves. But China's current power-oversight mechanisms are very imperfect. 1) We have neither internal or extenal oversight mechanisms, not to speak of any oversight of the overseers. While there are certain written prohibitions and regulations at times, there are no genuine oversight organs or personnel. For instance, bank credit officers have the three powers of investigation, examination, and approval concentrated in one post, with certainly no oversight or restraint organs. 2) Even when there are internal and external oversight mechanisms, there is certainly no oversight of the overseers. In addition, the poor quality of certain overseers saps the oversight function, which can be seen in certain public servants violating the law in its enforcement, not acting in accordance with the law, and not enforcing the law strictly. 3) When there is only internal oversight but no external oversight or oversight of the overseers, certain organs of power become the enforcers as well as the overseers of power. [passage omitted] For instance, while government departments have internal supervision bureaus and party committees have discipline-inspection commissions, their external oversight is generally only through written prohibitions and regulations by upper-level governments or party committees without any substantive oversight-enforcement organs. With such imperfect oversight mechanisms, it is actually very hard to stop the exploitation of public power for private gain and striving for small-group interests, and neglecting current activities, such as the private use of public vehicles, the use of public office for private gain, the use of power for private purposes, and light punishments for serious crimes, not at all surprising. Certain powerholders also dare to state recklessly that: "I will not act without advantage, I will act with advantage, and I will do anything for more advantage," the crux of which is "orders that are not followed, and prohibitions that do not work." Not only are oversight mechanisms imperfect, but party and government organs are bloated and overstaffed. So certain departments overstep their jurisdictions, exploiting their power actively, by looking for matters to handle where there are none, seeking for power to exploit where there is none, and artificially setting up obstacles in political and economic activities to create shortages and power to exploit for private gain. For instance, actions, such as inspecting, evaluating, setting up blocks, and issuing documents to restrict X, or exerting invisible pressure on certain sectors, are precisely the root of the spread of "arbitrary charges, fines, and apportionments" and other unhealthy tendencies. 4. Corruption caused by dependency connections among powerholders. China's current cadre-appointment system-model is mainly one of "connections" and appointments by superiors, with the appointments and powers of lower-level officials controlled not by the people, but rather by the superior pertinent leaders, with certain subordinate interests also controlled by certain upper-level departments and leaders. So subordinate officials, in order to protect their powers or partial interests, often do no hesitate to entertain or make gifts to their superiors at public expense, in order to harmonize upper and lower connections, consolidate their own positions, or gain local benefits. This is probably one of the causes of the much-prohibited yet unstoppable entertaining and gift-giving at public expense. [passage omitted]
