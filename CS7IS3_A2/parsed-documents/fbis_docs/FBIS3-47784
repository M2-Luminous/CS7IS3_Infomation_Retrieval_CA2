Japan wanted to ask Australia to the summit as a way to ease criticism from the United States and Europe that exports from Asia are responsible for growing unemployment in their countries. Washington strongly opposed the proposal, though the reasons were not known, the sources said. The summit, to be held in the suburbs of Washington on March 14 and 15, will be attended by cabinet ministers in charge of labor affairs from the G-7 members -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. The meeting was originally proposed by Japan in 1991, but failed to materialize earlier because of a lukewarm response from the administration of then President George Bush. The U.S. changed its stance, however, after President Bill Clinton came to power, they said. The summit has been scaled down from Clinton's idea of gathering of prime ministers and presidents of the G-7 countries. Employment will also be a major item on the agenda at the annual G-7 summit to be held in July in Naples, Italy, they said.
