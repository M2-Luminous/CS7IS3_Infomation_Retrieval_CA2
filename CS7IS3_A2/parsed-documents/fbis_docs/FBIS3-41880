They managed to track down and catch red-handed a group of ``businessmen'' attempting to export abroad 260 capsules containing uranium-235 and uranium-238. This element is the fuel for nuclear electric power stations. According to the operations data, the leak of the nuclear raw material occurred at a Kazakhstani enterprise. The cargo was first conveyed to Chisinau in a homemade lead container. And only when the definite date of the handover of the uranium to the purchaser became known was it delivered to Odessa. The smugglers prepared the operation thoroughly. They agreed with members of the crew of a Black Sea Steamship Company vessel that the container would be delivered on board shortly before the vessel's departure for foreign parts. It was there, in the port, that one of the ``businessmen'' was to meet the purchaser. This member of the gang was detained on his way to meet his client. He was found to be carrying uranium samples in an ordinary coffee jar. A search revealed that this courier was carrying the genuine certification of an Afghan war veteran and, no less, a Hero of the Soviet Union. As of today six people have already been detained. Two are Moldovan citizens, four Ukrainian. Most of them are scientific research assistants. A search of one apartment uncovered a further 100 kilograms of mercury and a few kilograms of rare-earth metals. While this search was going on, the owner of all these riches was holding a live grenade in his pocket. Fortunately, he did not decide to use it. The investigation established that they wanted to sell the uranium for U.S. $200,000 (according to rough estimates, the price of this consignment of uranium on the world market is around $20 million). The purchaser himself was from Siberia. But where he planned to deliver the cargo is not yet known. There are hopes that criminal investigation officers will detain the purchaser too. The ease with which the uranium was delivered in its container to the airplane steps [as published] proves that it is not for nothing that the West is worried over the illegal export from CIS territory not only of the ``brains''--the nuclear physicists--but also the raw materials of the nuclear industry.
