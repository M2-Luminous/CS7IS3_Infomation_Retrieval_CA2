Minister of State for Prime Ministry Affairs and Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani said the new on-land inspection regime will save Jordan millions of dollars in losses. He told Jordan Television that Jordan has received a message from the U.S. Administration confirming the agreement on the new regime. [Begin al-'Anani recording in Arabic with English subtitles] A message was received from the U.S. Administration via the U.S. State Department confirming what has been agreed upon; that the U.S. Government has accepted to replace the inspection which was carried out by multilateral forces, particularly the U.S. vessels, in the Straits of Tiran for the vessels heading toward al-'Aqabah with an on-land inspection in al-'Aqabah. Therefore, this arrangement will answer the United Nations' desire to maintain the inspection in implementation of the economic sanctions against Iraq, and, at the same time, directly affect the Jordanian economy in the sense that it will save large expenses. We know that since Resolution 661 was issued in 1990 and until now, Jordan lost some $1.2 billion in expenses. [end recording]
