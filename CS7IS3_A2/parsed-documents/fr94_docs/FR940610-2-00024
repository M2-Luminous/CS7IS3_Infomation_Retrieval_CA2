FR940610-2-00024 FR940610-2-00020 Golden Field Office; Grant Award to Minnesota Department of Public Service AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: DOE Golden Field Office, through the Chicago Support Office, announces that, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2) it intends to award a grant to the Minnesota Department of Public Service (DPS) to continue to support a renewable energy resource assessment program by expanding data collection and analysis of potential wind energy in the southwestern part of Minnesota. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Chicago Support Office, 9800 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, Illinois 60439, Attention: Mark Burger, Energy Conservation Programs Specialist, at 708/252&hyph;2193. The Contracting Officer is Diane Rowe. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: DPS is the designated State Energy Office responsible for conducting activities under the State Energy Conservation Program. DPS has been extensively involved in efforts to facilitate the use of renewable energy electricity generation, which is an initiative encouraged by DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. This award will further the aim of renewable energy electricity generation by the continued monitoring of designated sites in southwestern Minnesota where wind energy data is being gathered. This will permit a more accurate way to determine the energy potential that large numbers of wind electric conversion systems (WECS) have on the present electricity supply in Minnesota. This work is being conducted in cooperation with Northern States Power Company, which presently has WECS installed and operating in the region. Therefore, the grant application is being accepted because DOE knows of no other organization that is conducting or planning to conduct this type of effort. The project period for the grant award is 24 months, with the second year expected to begin on July 1, 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $15,000 for this budget period. Christine A. Phoebe, Director, Administrative Division, Golden Field Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14191 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
