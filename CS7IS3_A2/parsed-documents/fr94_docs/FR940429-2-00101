FR940429-2-00101 FR940429-2-00075 Federal Aviation Administration Noise Exposure Map Notice; Receipt of Noise Compatibility Program and Request for Review, Laredo International Airport, Laredo, TX AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by the City of Laredo, Texas for Laredo International Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;193) and 14 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) part 150 are in compliance with applicable requirements. The FAA also announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program that was submitted for Laredo International Airport under part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure map, and that this program will be approved or disapproved on or before October 15, 1994 EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of the FAA's determination on the noise exposure maps and of the start of its review of the associated noise compatibility program is April 18, 1994. The public comment period ends June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald C. Harris, DOT/FAA, Texas Airport Development office, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0651, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5651. Comments on the proposed noise compatibility program should also be submitted to the above office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Laredo International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective April 18, 1994. Further, FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before October 15, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment. Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport. An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses. The City of Laredo, Texas, submitted to the FAA on March 15, 1994, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation which were produced from 1992 to February 1994 during the development of the Laredo International Airport FAR part 150 Airport Noise Compatibility Plan. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by City of Laredo, Texas. The specific maps under consideration are Figures 6A, 6B, and 10A in the submission. The FAA has determined that these maps for Laredo International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective on April 18, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps.
