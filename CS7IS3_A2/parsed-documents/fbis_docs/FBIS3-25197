At a media conference today the students' movement said that it would use violence if other means failed. Mike Proctor-Sims reports: [Begin recording] [Proctor-Sims] Port Elizabeth township schools have been the most affected by Azasm's campaign, possibly because Azasm's national president, Phumzile Msutu, lives here. Mr. Msutu claimed this week's removal of white principal Chris de Wet from the (Tilulwazi) Secondary School in Zwide as a victory for affirmative action and Azasm. A visit to the school by television news today showed another story. Teachers, both black and white, had downed chalk, and pupils had gone home early. About 1.5 percent of the 12,000 teachers at Department of Education and Training-run schools in the region are white. Fifteen of the white teachers teach at Khwezi Lomso in Zwide. This school had a 62.6 percent matric pass rate last year, more than 25 percent better than the average in the second worst year ever. Parents have demanded their retention. Headmasters and teachers at black schools would not talk on camera today, fearing for their careers and lives. The majority of township residents seem against the indiscriminate removal of white teachers. [Unidentified parent] I would like them to be there, because at the end of the day it is how my child is best equipped at high school, so that child will be able to stand a chance when it comes to university. [Unidentified student] We don't believe in the removal of white teachers. We believe in a nonracial struggle, and we want the expertise of those teachers. [end recording]
