FR940916-0-00047 FR940916-0-00016 Paragraph (b) prescribes the type of information an applicant is expected to provide about its identity and ownership, depending on the structure of the organization. The example (``Gmbh'') cited by the commenter is the term used to denote a German limited liability company, generally comparable to a U.S. corporation. Such a company would file under paragraph (b)(1) of the regulations. To accommodate all possible applicants, MARAD has added a new paragraph (b)(4) stating that MARAD will inform any entity that does not fit the other descriptions in paragraph (b) concerning the information it should submit about its identity and ownership. MARAD will consider the comments it has received with regard to information required by paragraph (b)(1)(v) and (b)(1)(vi), regarding ownership of capital shares, when preparing the subsequent rulemaking concerning the administration of the entire Title XI program. MARAD sees no reason to change the present wording of paragraph (c)(4) requiring business data for small firms. The proposal that MARAD limit the information it receives on defaults to defaults on financial instruments that give rise to accelerated payments is far too limited. MARAD collects this information in order to discover needed information about the applicant's creditworthiness and its business experience and status. Information about its defaults, such as defaults on overdue tax liability or even on technical security defaults, can give MARAD valuable information on which to make a decision. For similar reasons, MARAD rejects the suggestion that it amend paragraph (h) to exempt the ``smaller'' applicant from describing its structure, activities, and management. The requested information is necessary for making a proper evaluation and assessment of the applicant regardless of its financial and organizational size. MARAD does agree with the comment proposing that the information sought by paragraph (f)(2) concerning management personnel of an Eligible Shipyard is too broad. Accordingly, MARAD has amended the provision to limit the information to that concerning senior supervisory personnel in the yard. Section 298.13‚ê£Financial Requirements A commenter stated with respect to paragraph (a)(2)(i), which was not amended by the interim final rule, that the exclusion from the cost of the project (Actual Cost) of foreign equipment and services, unless a waiver is specifically granted, should be deleted, along with the section 298.32(a)(6) required provision in the documentation for use of articles, materials, and supplies of U.S. growth production or manufacture, because these are Buy American provisions that are obsolete (by virtue of a 1986 amendment to section 298.11(a)). With respect to Eligible Export Vessels, comments in behalf of U.S. shipyards cited many reasons militating against exclusion of non-U.S. components from Actual Cost, e.g., few U.S. suppliers have the approval of classification societies other than ABS, and obtaining an equivalent certificate could be expensive ( i.e., a 5&hyph;10 percent differential), and could result in undesirable exceptions to the ship's class that would put the U.S. shipyard in an unfavorable position vis-a-vis its foreign competitors; foreign shipowners want local components for ease of replacement and repair; foreign shipowners and designers designate the use of specific components which the shipbuilder cannot reject; many advanced ship types require components that are not available from U.S. sources but are from foreign sources; and many components of AST/MST are not available on the U.S. market. Based on these assessments, it was recommended that MARAD delete the third sentence in paragraph (a)(2)(i), which requires the exclusion of all foreign-made components from Actual Cost, as well as an obsolete Buy American provision remaining in section 298.32(a)(6), which requires only articles, materials or supplies of U.S. growth or origin to be used in a Title XI Vessel. A commenter also objected to the requirement in paragraph (a)(2)(i) for the applicant to submit supporting data, suggesting that MARAD add a provision stating that where a contract is competitively bid, the applicant is not required to submit supporting data, such as the cost of materials or worker hours, regarding the contract price, since the competitive bidding process should satisfy MARAD that the contract price is fair and reasonable. It is asserted that many shipyards do not bid a contract on such a basis and the requirement to supply such information to MARAD adds unnecessary administrative costs to the shipyard. A commenter stated that paragraph (a)(3), Financing, should be harmonized with paragraph (g) with respect to the treatment of subordinated debt and equity since the latter provides that subordinated debt may be included in equity, while the former disallows its inclusion.
