"We're not just grandstanding for international investors and the IMF (International Monetary Fund). Stable prices are fundamental to this government achieving its objectives," he told the SA Chamber of Business budget seminar. Inflation would erode the government's Reconstruction and Development Programme and impinge more heavily on the people it was targetted at, the poor. In addition, industrial restructuring, to improve future economic growth, could only be successful in a regime of stable prices. "We all know key industries will have to restructure. It's not just because we're a member of GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) but because the economy is just not going to grow," he said. He believed the budget presented on Wednesday by Finance Minister Derek Keys had illustrated the government's commitment to fiscal discipline and a non-inflationary environment. In re-ordering government's spending priorities, the government had succeeded in restraining the overall expenditure level. "It would have been a fatal mistake to increase our expenditure. It's much easier to increase your expenditure to meet your objectives. It's a lot more difficult to re-organise your current expenditure... But we're not going to spend our way out of restructuring." Mr Erwin urged business to now take the lead in boosting investment within the disciplined fiscal framework. "If we wait for government to do nicer and nicer things, the economy will stagnate," he said. You (business) can influence government decisions by taking your own decisions. This country is going to have to grow and you have to take the lead."
