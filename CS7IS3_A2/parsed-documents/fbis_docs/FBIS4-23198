The combat, sporadic but at times heavy, forced the United Nations to suspend its evacuation of civilians from Kigali, a UN spokesman said. In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said some 400,000 Rwandans had fled the fighting in the capital: "They have nothing to eat and nothing to drink. It is a very grave situation," said ICRC spokesman Tony Burgener. UN spokesman Abdul Kabia, contacted by telephone from Nairobi, said: "Our information is that a substantial number of government officials have left Gitarama for Kibuye (west) and Butare (south), but some are still there." It was not immediately clear whether the interim Prime Minister Jean Kambanda was among the officials who reportedly fled. The self-declared interim government fled Kigali on April 12, and established its base near Gitarama, 50 kilometres, (35 miles) southwest of the capital, after Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels launched an offensive on the city. The rebels have been tightening their grip on Kigali over the past couple of weeks and are reported to have advanced within seven kilometres (five miles) of Gitarama. There was also heavy fighting around the northern town of Ruhengeri, Kabia said. [passage omitted]
