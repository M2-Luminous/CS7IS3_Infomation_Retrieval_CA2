This trend is even typical of the General Staff apparatus. The military department leadership is looking for ways to stabilize the situation. One of the methods being planned is to carry out a major reshuffle of the Russian Federation Armed Forces leadership and appoint to key positions military commanders of proven loyalty. Among the candidates slated for replacement are a number of generals ranging from commanders in chief of branches of the services to Ground Forces Aviation Commander Vitaliy Pavlov, who refused to execute an order to open rocket fire on the White House. The presidential administration is in turn formulating plans to establish a special structure to ensure more effective control over the state of cadre work in the Army -- a kind of CPSU Central Committee Administrative Organs Department. Special efforts are being made by the defense minister to bring about the transfer to Moscow of Western Group of Forces Commander M.P. Burlakov, nicknamed by his subordinates the infantry fighting vehicle. It is expected that Burlakov will give a considerable boost to the Army's "reformist wing." It is not being ruled out that he will be considered as a candidate either for chief of the General Staff (together with Andrey Nikolayev, current commander in chief of the Border Guards, who is less acceptable to Grachev) or commander of the key Moscow Military District. Our sources in the General Staff claim that the firm opinion has formed at the highest level that, following the events of 3-4 October, current Chief of the General Staff M. Kolesnikov and Moscow Military District Commander L. Kuznetsov cannot be completely relied on. Burlakov's uncommon political flexibility works in his favor, of course: He was one of the first to support the State Committee for the State of Emergency, but shortly afterward he roundly condemned D. Yazov and his supporters. However, it cannot be ruled out that this flexibility could give rise to doubts among the president's more sober-minded supporters: The fact that Burlakov was the only commander at P. Grachev's October conference who enthusiastically approved the results of the storming of the White House counts for nothing. There is also some perplexity surrounding the actions of the Western Group of Forces commander (including the fact that Burlakov flew to the wedding of Defense Minister Grachev's son and presented the newlyweds with the keys to a new Mercedes), not to mention the overall situation in the Western Group of Forces. In the opinion of military men, the favorable reports brought back by a group of journalists sent out to Germany on P. Grachev's instructions were bound to be convincing, but in order to be absolutely sure it might also be useful to publish the results of an investigation into the Western Group of Forces and Burlakov personally that was conducted before last October by the military prosecutor's office and military counterintelligence.
