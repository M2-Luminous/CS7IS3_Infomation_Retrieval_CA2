At a luncheon given by the president of the Hamburg Parliament Ute Pape, Qiao said Hamburg has been playing an important role in boosting Sino-German relations. He said a great proportion of commodities traded between the two countries are shipped via the Port of Hamburg. He added that the number of Chinese companies in Hamburg has risen from one in 1979 to more than 100 today, pointing out that the first Chinese general consulate to Germany is also located there. Qiao said Hamburg established its partnership with China's largest industrial city Shanghai as early as in 1986. He said Germans from all walks of life are welcome to China to work in cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.
