Asked about the activities of the Mekong Working Group which was established in accordance with the joint communique, Mr Pham Sy Ky said: "The four countries of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam signed a joint communique on Mekong cooperation on Feb. 5, 1996 [date as received] in Hanoi. In this communique, they committed to continue cooperation in exploitation of the Mekong River and establish a Mekong Working Group with the task of drafting a framework agreement for the future Mekong cooperation. [passage omitted] On the outstanding problems, Mr Ky said: "The most important one is on the equitable and reasonable utilization in detail of water in the main stream of the Mekong River during dry season. Though four countries have agreed in principle the equitable and reasonable utilization of water, but have not yet agreed on detailed stipulations for that issue. "With a view to respecting the legitimate right of the countries in the basin, taking into consideration of the needs of each country and with cooperative goodwill in utilization of water in the Mekong River, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have flexibly applied international laws and good experiences from some international river, i.e. the utilization of water in the mainstream of Mekong River during dry season shall be subject to prior consultation in the committee aiming at arriving an agreement before any proposed use by any riparians. However, Thailand has not yet agreed to the principle of prior consultation for agreement before using water. Hopefully, with goodwill for cooperation the deadlock will be overcome at the forthcoming meetings and the agreement on Mekong cooperation will be concluded." Asked about some Thai newspaper reports saying that Thailand is preparing a plan to divert water from the Mekong River to the Chao Phraya River basin, Mr. Ky said: "THE NATION newspaper of Thailand issued on 3 January 1993 carried out an article citing the words of the minister of Prime Minister's Office of Thailand on the diversion of Mekong water to the Chao Phraya River basin. Nevertheless, the Vietnam National Mekong Committee is not yet informed by the Thai side. We think that with goodwill for cooperation if Thailand plans to build some structures to take water from the Mekong mainstream, especially in the dry season, Thailand should inform, consult with other countries in the lower Mekong basin in order to assess the impact of its move to other countries, and cooperate with the latter to find out measures to solve problems if any with a view to arriving at unanimity among the riparian countries before construction. The consultation should begin at the stage of feasibility study. Such consultations are very important for the Mekong cooperation, regional cooperation and construction of mutual trust." Vietnam, upholding its respect for interests of other countries and with its goodwill for cooperation, is ready to discuss with other countries in the Mekong basin to find satisfactory measures for the reasonable use of the river water in order to meet the need of each country. We are sure that the international community interested in the Mekong programme will support such useful discussions, especially in the increasingly improved situation in the region, Mr Ky said in conclusion.
