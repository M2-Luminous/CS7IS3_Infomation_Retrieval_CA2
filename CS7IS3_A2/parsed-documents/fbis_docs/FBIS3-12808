Al-Azhar Students Denounce Hebron Massacre, Demand Israeli Ambassador's Expulsion 4. Grand Imam Urges Youth To Seek Knowledge 5. Seminar Discusses Extremism, Conflict With West WRITERS REACT TO IBRAHIMI MOSQUE MASSACRE The 1 March edition of the state-owned religious weekly 'AQIDATI features several articles, commentaries, and reports that react to the "Ibrahimi Mosque massacre" and its repercussions. In his 350-word column on page 1, Chairman of the Board Samir Rajab says he refuses to believe that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was committed by an individual or group of individuals. "It is an entangled conspiracy that involves several powers, including Israel's Army in its entirety as well as its government, because, unfortunately, they do not want this nation to advance or flourish," he argues. Noting that U.S. and NATO threats were heard only after everything was lost in Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rajab affirms that the same thing will happen to the Palestinians, "unless positive international protection is provided for them through firm, effective, and rigid measures." He suggests that the lack of Arab and Islamic solidarity will further aggravate things and, admitting that "peace is essential," emphasizes that this peace must be based on justice. He warns that "any aggression against Islam will lead to a very severe and violent reaction." Basyuni al-Halwani's 400-word column on page 6 contends that the massacre proves to the world that "God's chosen people are the most deceptive and treacherous and they break promises." He hopes the states that defend Israeli terrorism and back their crimes would "review their biased policy, abandon their support for injustice and aggression, and turn over a new leaf on Muslim issues" by dealing fairly with them. Al-Halwani believes it is unlikely that the culprits will get their fair share of punishment, despite the growing world anger. Citing the Bosnian example in this context, he remarks: "The world tolerates and encourages Jews to commit their crimes, as long as these crimes are being committed against Muslims." He wonders whether Muslims will suffice themselves with condemnation and denunciation after the massacre or will "wake up, quit their differences and imaginative battles," and adopt firmer decisions. He appeals to Muslims to "wake up before it is too late," contending that Muslim blood has become "the cheapest on earth." Majdi Salim's 400-word article on page 10 views the issue in another perspective, picturing the world as a "chessboard" controlled by "a single, very skillful player"--the United States. Simplifying his idea, Salim writes: The "first act of the world farce" opened with the "Serbian barbarians'" bombardment of the market place in Sarajevo. The West threatened, the Islamic world denounced and condemned, and NATO addressed an ultimatum to the Serbs, he says. The "second act" was opened by Russia, "which is now begging from America." Redeploying the Serbian troops, Russia compelled the West not to launch an air strike against Serbs, he says. Still in the second act, Salim writes that a Jewish terrorist committed a heinous crime in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. The writer states: "The chess player who moves the pieces wants to close the second act of the farce without harming genuine world terrorism and its architect, the state with the six-sided star," he writes. "The skillful player begins the third act of the farce by offering a toy to Muslims to play with, forget the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, and hail the civilized West, which carried out its threat and shot down four Serbian planes as they were bombarding Muslims in Sarajevo," Salim concludes. In a 150-word commentary on page 20, 'Adil Dayf writes that the massacre came as no surprise to those who follow "the Israelis' criminal history." Emphasizing that "these criminals must be isolated completely, surrounded, abandoned, and punished severely," he stresses that "sanctions must involve the Israeli Government, which encourages such crimes against Muslims." He warns that failure to punish the criminals will encourage the recurrence of crimes. Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl's 300-word article on page 20 contends that "no matter how many decisions are taken to disarm the extremist settlers, the Israeli Government will be unable to stop Zionist massacres, since it is very easy for the crazy murderers who believe in the supremacy of the Jewish race to conceal weapons." Recalling that the intifadah ensued following a similar massacre by the settlers in Gaza in December 1987, Abu-al-Hawl states: "There will be no peace between the Palestinians and Israelis unless the Zionist settlements are totally removed." A 250-word commentary by Ibrahim Nasr on page 23 claims the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is only "a link in the chain of notorious massacres committed once in a while--after accurate calculations and at set times--to determine the extent to which the cold parts of the Arab nation's body will heat up." He remarks that it is "no longer acceptable to hear the phrase `land for peace' with Israel, since Israel owns the land through occupation and controls its people." What war does Israel fear now that it has made real peace with the heart of the Arab nation and its long arm?, he asks. Doubting that the intifadah can shake Israel, he notes that Israeli media try to present the issue in this light to justify the criminal acts. Al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf opens his 500-word column on page 24 with the remark: "How cheap Muslim blood has become." Claiming inaction by the "new world order" over the killing of dozens of Muslims in Sarajevo by "the Serbian pigs," he refers to a "new crime in the long chain of Zionist crimes against Arabs in general and Palestinians in particular." He contends that the principles and strategies that govern the Israeli mentality have not changed since the state of Israel was established almost 50 ago. "Unless this mentality is changed, the reality will not change, the bloody incidents will not stop, the file of violence and terrorism will not be closed, and real peace will not be established for either Arabs or Israelis," he says. He adds that the Israeli mentality will not change unless Arabs develop the ability to refuse and to act. "Until this happens, Muslim blood will remain cheap," he concludes. ENLIGHTENMENT CONVOY DISCUSSES HEBRON MASSACRE, SATELLITE DISH Muhammad al-Abnudi reports on the "enlightenment convoy" that the Awqaf minister leads around the Republic. In a 700-word report on page 2, al-Abnudi writes that scholars and lecturers affirmed in their meeting with the masses in al-Sharqiyah Governorate that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is "a mark of disgrace on the forehead of the Islamic nation and proof to everyone that terrorist operations are not launched by Muslims as the West claims." The report adds that the masses denounced this vicious aggression and stressed the need to support Jerusalem's Muslims and give top priority to finding solutions for the problems. The report adds that the meeting discussed other issues, including Egypt's stance on the massacres to which Bosnian Muslims are being subjected. Asked about Egypt's role in this connection, Cairo University President Dr. Mufid Shihab highlights that "Egypt needs domestic stability to play its role best." The meeting raised the issue of the Western media and receiving programs by satellite dish. Asked about this, Amin Basyuni, Radio and Television Union chairman, remarks: "The problem does not lie in the dish but in how we handle it, since we cannot isolate ourselves from the world." He believes that there is no alternative for building "a strong, Muslim, Egyptian man" who can distinguish right from wrong. AL-AZHAR STUDENTS DENOUNCE MASSACRE, DEMAND ISRAELI AMBASSADOR'S EXPULSION A 100-word report on page 3 says that over 10,000 students in al- Azhar University staged "a peaceful demonstration" on 27 February to denounce the Hebron massacre. The report adds that "a statement by the student union condemned the incident and demanded the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador." GRAND IMAM URGES YOUTH TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE In the 3d of a series of articles, al-Azhar Grand Imam Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq urges youth to seek knowledge and use it to enhance their nation's strength and lead it to progress. In his 1,000-word article on page 3, he cites examples from Islamic history to show that the Islamic nation has always respected its knowledgeable and pious youth. SEMINAR DISCUSSES EXTREMISM, CONFLICT WITH THE WEST A 3,000-word report on page 4 gives an account of a seminar 'AQIDATI organized in the Flying Institute in al-Sharqiyah under the banner "Ramadan, the Month of Mercy and Sympathy." Speaking at the seminar, Chief Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf is cited affirming that Egypt is "in good shape" and that "extremism is an exception." Al-Azhar Professor Dr. Muhammad Fayid Haykal replied to a question on "how to restore the Islamic nation's lost glory amid imported currents." He is quoted as saying that this can only be achieved by "raising our children according to sound Islamic principles." Noting that the conflict between the Islamic nation and the West is a cultural and intellectual one, he called for "directing the youth to the intellectual and cultural sides of Islam" so that they can read and understand Islam properly and help their nation to assume its rightful place in the world. The seminar also discusses fasting and its effect on Muslims.
