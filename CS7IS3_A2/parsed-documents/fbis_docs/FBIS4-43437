Thus began our interview with Shmu'el Hadas, the new Israeli ambassador to the Vatican. [Giovannangeli] What significance does the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican have for Israel? [Hadas] The conclusion of a long-drawn, difficult process which began with the birth of the state of Israel 46 years ago, as well as the beginning of a new relationship, based on solidarity and tolerance, between the Catholic and the Jewish worlds. [Giovannangeli] Therefore, this agreement does not only have diplomatic significance. [Hadas] Unquestionably. The agreement which has been reached can favor the development of a common initiative against the reemergence of racism and anti-Semitism. We have now launched a message of hope, underlying the very meaning of religious faith. Religions must unite people, not divide them. Israel and the Vatican did not merely decide to exchange diplomatic representations. If anything, this step is the logical outcome of a common process of rethinking many centuries of history which were often marked by divisions and hate. Today we have decided to put and end, together, to this sad chapter by going back to our origins, that is to say, rediscovering that common heritage of social solidarity and respect for diversity which lies at the heart of both the Jewish and the Catholic faith. The greatness of this diplomatic event lies, in the first place, in its ethical value. [Giovannangeli] What is your opinion of the self-critical review currently undertaken by the German Catholic church on the responsibility incurred by Catholic theology in providing "religious pretexts" to those who persecuted the Jews? [Hadas] The document in question represents an important act of courage which helps restore the historical, albeit bitter, truth. It has certainly promoted dialogue between Catholics and Jews, making possible further rapprochement. Admitting one's share of responsibility for such an enormous tragedy as the Holocaust is not only a gesture of respect for the millions of Jews who were exterminated by the Nazis. It is also a moral lesson offered to younger generations, who must be in the position to fully understand -- with no "gray areas" -- one of the most tragic periods in the history of mankind. [Giovannangeli] In what ways can the understanding between Israel and the Vatican influence the development of the peace process in the Middle East? [Hadas] The exchange of diplomatic representatives must be seen in the context of the new climate of dialogue which has come about in the Middle East with the peace agreements signed between Israel and the PLO. Thanks to his considerable moral authority, the pope has played and can still play a major role in permanently establishing peace in this troubled region of the world, where religions have always carried much weight, and not always in a positive sense. In the Middle East, hatred has been nurtured and wars have been fought "in God's name" for far too long. The "basic agreement" reached between Israel and the Vatican can help build a culture based on "listening to each other" among Israelis and Arabs, Jews and Muslims; a culture centered on man as an entity whose rights are "inviolable," independently of individuals' religious faith. [Giovannangeli] However, Jerusalem is not included in the agreement. In your opinion, when will it finally become possible to tackle the question of the "holy city's" status? [Hadas] Israel and the PLO have shown great political wisdom by deciding to postpone a rather difficult debate -- considering what Jerusalem means to everyone concerned -- until a second stage in the negotiations. A gradual approach has proven the best means of enabling a first agreement to be reached. This also applies to relations between Israel and the Vatican. As far as we are concerned, we will do everything in our power to ensure complete freedom of worship in a city which is sacred to Jews, Catholics, and Muslims alike. Jerusalem's historical, spiritual, and archaeological value belongs to everybody. As such, it must be safeguarded. Ensuring that the city's holy places can be "enjoyed" by everybody is a first, important step toward subsequently discussing the town's status.
