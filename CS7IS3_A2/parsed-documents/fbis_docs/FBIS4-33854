Endara said that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, to take place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on 14 and 15 June, "will not address the Cuban situation." According to Endara, the chiefs of state "have met with Castro at other summit meetings, to seek ways to democratize the island" and have been unsuccessful for the last 30 years. Whenever the issue is addressed, Endara said, "Castro always approaches the discussion in a rational and open way, as the dignified and responsible person that he is." The Panamanian leader said he has spoken many times with the Cuban statesman, whom he finds to be "an exceptional individual, despite the political differences" that separate the two presidents.
