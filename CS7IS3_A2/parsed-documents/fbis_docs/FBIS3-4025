Average pay will rise an unprecedented 60 percent in 1994 for the about 1 million workers in government offices and publicly-funded bodies in the city. Average annual pay would rise from 2,500 renminbi (about HK$2,200) in 1993 to Rmb4,000 this year, sources in the municipal government said. China's cabinet, the State Council, ordered all local governments to raise public sector pay in a January circular that has not been made public in order to avoid arousing resentment from workers in state enterprises and the private sector. Average public sector pay is expected to rise about 35 percent this year. The Tianjin party secretary, Gao Dezhan, told delegates at a recent municipal people's congress that public sector pay in the city, including so-called "grey income", would be raised to Beijing levels. "We are so close to Beijing that if we don't pay better, the brain drain will worsen," Gao said. Skilled administrators and professionals in the city's public sector have flocked to Beijing and Guangdong in recent years as income gaps widened. An internal study done by the Tianjin government last month found that average public sector pay in Tianjin, including year-end bonuses as well as various other cash hand-outs, fell well below other cities. Taking Tianjin as 1.0, the study rated public service pay in Beijing at 1.5, Shanghai 2.0 and Guangzhou 3.0. More than half of the economics department at Nankai University had left for other parts of the country in the last two years, sources said. To finance the increase in expenditure, the Tianjin city government is apparently planning to double the amount of land sold this year in the bonded zone near the port and economic development zone compared to 1993. "Land prices here are low compared to elsewhere, so we'll have to sell a lot of land to finance this," Gao said. In addition, Progressive pay rises would be made steeper, with top civil servants and professors able to earn Rmb700 a month compared with Rmb400-500 for the previous level.
