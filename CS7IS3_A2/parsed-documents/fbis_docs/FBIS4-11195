We Salvadorans have expressed our absolute respect for the law, and those who have not done so are now suffering the consequences of their negative attitude. In that respect, we can tell you that on my instructions and by virtue of the legal authority I possess as TSE president, the National Civilian Police arrested Jose Antonio Ramirez in Jucuapa Municipality, Usulutan Department. Ramirez was arrested when members of voting table boards No. 4,205 and 4,214 in Jucuapa confirmed that he committed fraud by voting twice. The elections have taken place in an orderly fashion. The other TSE magistrates will now give you further details. [TSE Magistrate Jaime Romero Ventura] The logistical measures taken by the TSE to ensure the success of this electoral event are as follows: There was free movement of individuals and vehicles. There were selective checks of individuals entering polling stations. Thus there was security but voters were able to move about unimpeded. We increased the number of polling stations at a national level, especially in the capital. The number of voting table boards per polling station was reduced, thus allowing the elections to be held in an easy, rapid manner. The voters were able to move about with greater flexibility. In conclusion, we had an effective sign system that helped voters find their voting tables quickly. [Unidentified magistrate] In addition to the measures to which Magistrate Romero Ventura has referred, the TSE worked to assist voters by issuing the necessary publications to locate and identify polling centers by number and letter to help voters find them more quickly. We published a list for each polling station with the first and last names of all voters to help them find their voting table. We set up a telephone information line so citizen could call and ask questions about the voting process. We arranged free urban and rural transportation. We also obtained the cooperation of the transportation organizations, which allowed the normal flow of traffic on election day. We also tried to create an information system through information centers at principal polling stations and with the cooperation of the participating political parties to help voters find their tables so they could exercise their sacred right to vote. These are some of the measures that contributed to the success of today's elections. [Zaldivar] As we begin this initial report issued by the TSE, we must first recognize the efforts of all our personnel, who have unselfishly gone out to complete the many tasks this election day has required. It is an honor to state that TSE personnel did their work enthusiastically both during the first election and now during this run-off election. The TSE would also like to recognize the National Civilian Police, which, in conjunction with the TSE, provided security for the election process. They also provided security in those places where the National Police had no personnel for the elections. We must also recognize the cooperation of other government agencies, such as the Education Ministry. Without their help we would not have been able to improve the distribution of the polling stations across the country. In this same vein, we received assistance from the Agricultural Development Bank and the Association of Architects of El Salvador, who helped us with the signs and distribution at the voting stations as well as with posters, shelves, and so on. We must also recognize that we have had the assistance of the Salvadoran Air Force, which will make it easier to bring you the results. We also give special recognition to the assistance we have had from international organizations such as USAID, the Electoral Advice and Promotion Center [CAPEL], several UN organizations, and the group of friends of El Salvador, who have all made enormous contributions to the success of this process. [Romero] People of El Salvador, I will now address that pertaining to the preliminary and final tallying process. Regarding the preliminary results, we would like to state that the TSE is ready to gather and process the information and announce the results quite quickly. We have set up an entire logistical structure for that purpose. Just as in the 20 March elections, we have TSE representatives in each of the 262 municipalities throughout the country who will gather the tallying sheets immediately. We will gather the information via fax from 220 of the 262 municipalities that have less than 36 voting stations. This information must be sent to us by the municipal electoral board, which groups all the voting stations in the municipality. We will receive the information immediately. The information can be here in a minute. We will collect each of the other 42 municipalities' voting station tally sheets and bring them to the Hotel Presidente by land or by air, thanks to the assistance of the Air Force helicopter. The Agricultural Promotion Bank's fleet of vehicles has been very useful in this task. We have the computer equipment to tally and immediately process all the vote count certificates we receive. It is up to the voting table boards and the Municipal Election Boards made up of the representatives of the participating political party and coalition to provide us with that information. Once we receive that information, we will be able to immediately report the results. I must inform you that at this hour, at 1900, we are already receiving some vote count certificates via fax. The time to begin transmitting news briefs as well as the amount of information we may provide will depend on the Municipal Election Board and the voting table boards. We are prepared and trained to provide such information immediately. Moreover, we have drafted the instructions for the final vote count, which basically state the following: The TSE, in agreement with ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] and the CD-FMLN [Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] coalition, has decided that the TSE will be responsible for conducting the final vote count as stated in the electoral code. The final vote count will be based on vote count certificates from the voting table boards and the Municipal Election Boards. The figures we receive during the preliminary vote count will serve as a guide. The objective we have for the final vote count is to inform the people of the results of the presidential and vice presidential elections in an accurate and timely manner. To achieve this, we have a procedure for how the final vote count will take place. Three members of the Departmental Election Board, two ARENA representatives, two CD-FMLN coalition representatives, a delegate from the Attorney General's Office, an Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] observer, a table executive appointed by the TSE, a visiting technician appointed by the TSE, and, in San Salvador Department, two technicians and a secretary appointed by the TSE will participate in the final vote count. The table executive will be a member of the TSE and will be appointed from among our personnel. They will be in charge of managing and coordinating the working tables. These working tables will begin work on Tuesday, 26 April, from 0800 to 1200, from 1400 to 1800, and from 2000 to 2400 every day. The procedure will be to make an inventory, municipality by municipality, of the original vote count certificates from the voting table boards and the Departmental Election Board as well as from those in the hands of ARENA, the CD-FMLN coalition, and the Attorney General's Office. This will allow us to have an accurate knowledge of all the information. We are going to initiate the vote count, municipality by municipality, in order. We are going to draft a form for the data received from the voting table boards. This form must be signed by the table members and the representatives of the Attorney General's Office. Once this form is signed, we will conduct the appropriate [word indistinct] and if the table members want a partial copy of the results, they can have it. Once the data received from the voting table boards is processed, we will release the information received from each voting table board and the total for each municipality. A copy in diskette of the municipal figures will be entered into a computer that will give us the national total. Once the vote count per department is completed, we are going to release the departmental total. The TSE will learn about the totals of the various municipalities and of the departments once the results are approved by the Departmental Election Board. The results will be turned over to the table executive, a member of the TSE. Requests for recounts of ballot boxes as approved by the Departmental Election Board will be turned over to the TSE, which will initiate the steps to review the situation and determine if the review is valid or not. That is how we will do the final vote count. [Zaldivar] The TSE wishes to express its recognition of the civic spirit and democratic calling demonstrated by our dear Salvadoran people. We also want to recognize the work done by participating political parties, both in the first round and in these run-off elections. We also call on the media to respect the law and refrain from giving election results before the TSE gives its results [three-second break in reception]. Finally, we want to make an urgent call to members of the Municipal Election Boards and members of the voting table boards to allow our TSE delegates to pick up copies of the vote count certificates and send them to us through the previously established channels. When this is done we will be able to inform the national and international community of the results of this historic event in our dear country. Salvadoran people, good evening.
