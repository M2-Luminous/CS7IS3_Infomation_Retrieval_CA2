Robbie Terreblanche reports: Azapo [Azanian People's Organization], the local ANC [African National Congress], student organizations, and the Lawyers for Human Rights organization are in the forefront of a campaign to oust Dr. van der Walt from his post. Azapo says it rejects Dr. van der Walt's appointment. A spokesman, Mr. Philip Kepadisa, said that they will make Bophuthatswana ungovernable through stayaway action and strikes. The ANC says Dr. van der Walt is a companion of Mr. Mangope and has worked with Mr. Mangope to oppose free political movement in Bophuthatswana. Lawyers for Human Rights say they are drawing up a report of complaints against Dr. van der Walt. This will be handed over to the Transitional Executive Council later this week.
