[passage omitted] How hopeful are you on the eve of the introduction of peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia? [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] The Russian president and I welcome the fact that this operation is carried out under UN supervision and with the UNHCR's [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] active participation. UN supervision and an active involvement and assistance of one of its structures, the UNHCR, combined with the participation of Armed Forces from Russia and the CIS, which is an interregional organization, create a fairly promising atmosphere. This should answer your question about the level of my expectations. There is always some doubt before any such operation. I may have certain doubts too, especially if our bitter experience and the serious lesson we have been given are taken into account. But we had to make a choice. I think that the decision that we made was the only possible option at this stage. Moreover, as I told you, the peace-keeping operation will to a certain extent be supervised by international organizations. Returning to your question about whether or not I am hopeful, I would say that yes, I am hopeful and I believe that this operation will certainly be a success. Tens of thousands of people will return to their homes. This problem, which is a matter of concern in Georgia and elsewhere, is now closer than ever to its solution. This is my opinion and my answer. [Oniani] As regards the choice, the opposition has a different opinion. They believe that there was an alternative solution, which is something that Azerbaijan has opted for. Although Azerbaijan faces the threat of losing Ganja, it nevertheless would not agree to the introduction of Russian troops. Parliament heard today [14 June] that Russian peace-keeping forces had already shown their true colors in Samachablo [South Ossetia] and Tajikistan. There was also dissatisfaction with the planned participation in the operation of the parachute battalion regiment stationed in Gudauta, which, to put it mildly, was giving us a lot of trouble during the war in Abkhazia. It was also said that Georgia was losing whatever was left of its sovereignty. [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] It would not be right to draw a parallel between us and Azerbaijan just because it has lost a fifth of its territory but is still holding its ground. Such comparisons are not right because Azerbaijan has its own distinctive qualities, resources, reserves, and perhaps even some countries behind its back. All this requires a deeper analysis and serious consideration. A lot has to be taken into consideration before an accusation is made, especially when it is made in parliament. I am not in disagreement with the Azerbaijan leadership at all. We have excellent relations and we often confer with each other. I have nothing to say that would be critical of Heydar Aliyev's position. But we in our position had either to take the current course of action or that of war.
