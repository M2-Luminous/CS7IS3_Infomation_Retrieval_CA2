Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-09MAR94-POLAND POLAND: Walesa Fires TV, Radio Council Chairman In an apparent effort to gain more influence over Polish TV and Radio, President Lech Walesa fired Marek Markiewicz, the chairman of the Polish Radio and TV Council whom he had selected a year ago, after Markiewicz disregarded Walesa's objections to the Council's candidate for exclusive national broadcasting rights. Despite Walesa's repeated assertions that Zygmunt Solorz, an emigre businessman and head of Polsat satellite television network, was not a "suitable" candidate for an exclusive license to broadcast nationally (26 February, Warsaw TV), the Council formalized its agreement with Solorz on 1 March. In stating his objections, Walesa pointed to press reports raising questions about what Rzeczpospolita called a Solorz biography "full of mystery and insinuation" (Rzeczpospolita, 25 February). Apparently referring to reports of Polsat employees' connections with the former communist government, Walesa responded to the Council's 27 January declaration that Polsat won the broadcasting license by accusing the Council of placing private television "into communist hands" (Gazeta Wyborcza, 29-30 January). Gazeta Wyborcza also cited a London Financial Times report asserting that Polsat was heavily backed by British press mogul Rupert Murdoch, contradicting Solorz's claim that his bid was "purely Polish." During a news conference following the signing of Solorz's license, Markiewicz said that his conversation with the president over the license had been "unpleasant" and that Walesa had accused the Council of "accepting a bribe" (PAP, 1 March). Walesa has often expressed his dissatisfaction with Markiewicz and the the Council since the fall of 1993 and may be using the selection of Solorz as an opportunity to create a Council more disposed to accept his advice. Walesa, who has the right by law to appoint three members to the nine-member council, selected Markiewicz, a leading member of the Solidarity trade union, last March when the president was attempting to improve his relations with the trade union (Rzeczpospolita, 10 March 1993). However, as his relations with Solidarity grew increasingly sour (Rzeczpospolita, 28 June 1993) and after the Council had apparently ignored Walesa's advice, Walesa began to criticize Markiewicz and the Council. For example, Walesa objected to Markiewicz's announcement in June that the Council would crack down on private stations that were broadcasting without the Council's authority (PAP, 18 June 1993). He became even more critical of the Council in November, when the Council appointed a former director of Solorz's Polsat to replace Walesa stalwart and current presidential adviser Janusz Zaorski as head of public television. Walesa called the appointment a "major mistake" (Rzeczpospolita, 16 November 1993) and, shortly thereafter, forced the Council out of its office in the Belweder (Rzeczpospolita, 16 December 1993), demanding that the three members whom he had selected resign their posts immediately (PAP, 8 December 1993). As yet, none of the three has complied. (AUTHOR: MIHAILOVICH. QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF ANALYST/ELAG (703) 733-6120) ELAG/GILISON/CL 9/1952Z MAR
