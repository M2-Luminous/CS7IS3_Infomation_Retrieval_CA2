He suggested that the nuclear issue be resolved through bilateral negotiations or within the framework of the UN Security Council. If both failed to work, then the possibility of an international conference should be explored, he said. He added that China, Japan and South Korea did not oppose Russia's proposal for holding an international conference to guarantee the security and non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at present favors holding talks with the United States to find a solution to the nuclear issue. Panov said that the DPRK nuclear issue should not be considered as only a bilateral question as it affects the international community, especially the neighboring nations of the Korean peninsula.
