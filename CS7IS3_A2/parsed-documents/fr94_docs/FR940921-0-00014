FR940921-0-00014 FR940921-0-00009 The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) requested that Preble County be redesignated to attainment in a letter dated May 23, 1986; and that Jefferson and Columbiana Counties be redesignated to attainment in a letter dated July 14, 1986. On December 20, 1993, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposed to disapprove the requested redesignations (see 58 FR 66334). The public comment period was from December 20, 1993, to January 19, 1994. In a January 18, 1994, letter, the State of Ohio requested a 90-day extension of the comment period. On February 18, 1994, the USEPA extended the comment period until April 19, 1994 (see 59 FR 8150). The OEPA submitted maintenance and contingency plans for the counties in a submittal dated April 14, 1994, and requested parallel processing of the submittal. The results of OEPA's public hearing and resulting revision to the maintenance and contingency plan was submitted in a letter dated August 10, 1994. Notwithstanding these submittals, no public comments specifically commenting on the proposed rulemaking were received during the extended comment period. I. Review of the Requests The State's May 23, 1986, and July 14, 1986, requests were previously reviewed in a proposed rulemaking published on December 20, 1993, (see 58 FR 66334) in which USEPA proposed to disapprove the requests due to a lack of maintenance and contingency plans and enforceability deficiencies in their Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) regulations. Since that time the State has submitted additional information to address the basis of the proposed disapproval. The review of the previous submittal and the basic redesignation requirements are not summarized in this notice, but the reader is referred to the December 20, 1993, notice referenced above for a summary of the requirements and the previous submittal. The April 14, 1994, and August 10, 1994, submittals are summarized below and the requirements that were not met in the original submittal are addressed below. Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required the USEPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of the final USEPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the implementation of Title I informed States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date. See 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992). The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of Ohio is required to submit SIP revisions containing transportation and general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25 and 30, 1994, respectively. Because the deadline for such submittals has not yet come due, it is not an applicable requirement, under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v), for approval of this redesignation request. A. Preble County The maintenance plan provided for this county consists of an emissions and air quality summary; a mobile, area, and point source emissions inventory; and Permits-to-Install for all subject sources in Preble County. The emissions summary for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) are provided below: Table 1._ VOC Emissions in Tons Per Summer Day 1Year 1Point sources 1Area sources 1Mobile sources 1Totals 1990 0.24 41.13 4.16 45.52 1995 0.27 41.33 2.53 44.12 2005 0.34 41.64 1.93 43.92 Table 2._ NO X Emissions in Tons Per Summer Day 1Year 1Point sources 1Area sources 1Mobile sources 1Totals 1990 0.00 5.91 4.80 10.71 1995 0.00 6.16 3.96 10.12 2005 0.00 6.29 2.81 9.10 The total emissions are projected to decrease in the county, and, as a result, the county is expected to maintain the ozone air quality standard for the next ten (10) years. The mobile source NO X and VOC emissions projections for the year 2005 will be the ``budget'' for transportation conformity purposes. The air quality monitoring data submitted by the State shows that the area is still in attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. Preble County, which was designated nonattainment prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, must correct existing RACT rules for enforceability deficiencies. See 57 FR 13562. The State submitted copies of Permits-to-Install for all subject sources in the county. These permits indicate that no sources in the county are affected by a Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rule that has an enforceability deficiency. The one source that would have been affected (degreaser) was permanently shut down. This satisfies the requirement for correcting enforceability deficiencies in the county. The maintenance plan also includes a contingency measure that the State will use to ensure maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone. The State has committed to lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) gasoline as the contingency measure. This would be implemented in the case of a violation in the area. In order for the State to use lower RVP gasoline, a finding of necessity must first be made by USEPA under Section 211(c)(4)(C). If this finding of necessity is not provided, Ohio EPA has committed to choose an alternative unspecified emission control measure deemed appropriate based upon a consideration of cost-effectiveness, VOC reduction potential, economic and social considerations, or other factors that the State judges to be appropriate. This decision would be made and implemented within 12 months from the official notification by USEPA that a waiver would not be granted. OEPA also provided the following schedule for implementing the lower RVP measure: Table 3._ Schedule for Implementing Lower RVP 1Date 1Action/event March 15, 1994 Submit draft rules to USEPA. October 15, 1994 Submit final rules to USEPA. Trigger event Monitored violation. 1 month from trigger Ohio EPA finding of violation announced. ␣ Ohio EPA submits request for program budget. ␣ Ohio EPA hires additional staff for program. 2 months from trigger Ohio EPA secures lab contracts. 3 months from trigger Ohio EPA purchases needed equipment. 4 months from trigger Ohio EPA initiates public awareness program. ␣ Ohio EPA secures lab equipment. Six months from trigger Gasoline Dispensing Facilities achieve final compliance. B. Jefferson County The maintenance plan provided for this county consists of emissions, and air quality summaries; and mobile, area, and point source emissions inventories.
