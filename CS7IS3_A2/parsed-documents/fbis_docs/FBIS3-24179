The reason for this is mainly the complexity and arduousness of this matter and, in addition, the errors of politicians, both former and current. The most significant error on this path, in my opinion, was the signing of the Belovezha agreement by the leaders of three republics on 8 December 1991 without the concurrence and even against the will of the people who in March of that same year had expressed themselves for the preservation of the USSR. The Belovezha act was an error, because it disrupted the process of the reformation of the USSR and its transformation from a unitary state, if not into a genuinely federative one, then at least into a confederative state. As a result, instead of a directed, objectively necessary, and extremely important process of reformation, we got an unmanageable, chaotic process of a hasty, in many ways senseless, "parade of sovereignties" and the collapse of both the former USSR and also of its component parts. This could not help but have a negative effect on all aspects of life of the former Union: on the economy, politics, culture, humanitarian relations, etc. The politicians who signed the agreement on the creation of the CIS justified their decision by the fact that attempts to reform the Union failed one after the other, that it would not have been possible to preserve it under any circumstances, and that, therefore, nothing remained except to agree to a new form of mutual relations--the Commonwealth of Independent States. Explanations such as this (or, more accurately, justifications) seem to me, to put it mildly, incorrect. Mainly because the process of reformation, albeit with great difficulty, was moving forward, and I am confident: It would have been crowned with success sooner or later. In justifying the signing of the Belovezha agreement, reference is also made to the categorical nonconcurrence and lack of desire of Ukraine to enter into any kind of new union, which without it allegedly would be inconceivable. From my standpoint, this is also an incorrect position. I think that even if Ukraine did not agree to join the new union, it would have to be created without it. The situation sooner or later would have forced the most zealous Ukrainian separatists and nationalists to join the new union. Especially because in its essence it really would be new. What is happening now confirms such a conclusion. Getting to the point, present-day Ukraine already agrees to join an economic union, and it is hardly worth doubting that with time it will also agree to join other unions within the scope of the CIS. The realization is sinking deeper and deeper into the consciousness of the masses, and into the consciousness of the politicians, that abstract freedom, or freedom in itself, is not worth a lot if it does not have an appropriate material or other base, if it cannot be used for the welfare of a majority of the population, and if it only brings grief and difficulties for millions of ordinary people. After three years, bitter experience has now proved that which in March 1991 in the all-Union referendum prompted common sense and a healthy instinct. It was the rapid and reckless collapse that was the main source of a majority of today's troubles of the inhabitants of the CIS, and especially of their economic difficulties. It follows from this that in order to correct the situation, it is necessary for the post-Soviet state, without putting it off, to join in union relationships. But at the same time, it must be clearly understood that there can be no question of the former Union relationships. Only a new type of union can be at issue. In creating it, in my opinion, it is necessary to take into account several fundamental facts. And the following most of all. 1. A majority of the former Soviet republics, and most of all those that were not federations, judging by everything, will become federations. For example, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Ukraine, however absurd and undesirable it would seem now to some politicians. The development of events could lead to this even in some post-Soviet Asiatic countries in which the national liberation struggle of small nations is already flaring up. 2. The Soviet Union cannot objectively be restored to its own previous form. But in the course of centuries (and especially during the decades of the Soviet period), the component parts of the former USSR, their economies and other spheres of social life became so knitted and intertwined, that as a matter of fact a single organism was formed which, of course, cannot and will not function normally in a torn-apart condition no matter how much this would be forced. But this organism was developed inharmoniously and disproportionately. We already knew very well, for example, that the VPK [military-industrial complex] and certain other spheres enjoyed excessive privileges and resources. It follows from this that in creating a new union it was necessary to get rid of these defects, first and foremost owing to the structural restructuring of the economy. 3. The unequal and nonequivalent relations among the republics that manifested themselves, on the one hand, in the fact that the center (Kremlin) dictated and, on the other hand, in the fact that by order of this same center, Russia gave the outskirts much of what it vitally needed itself, must remain in the past forever, no matter how much someone from Moscow or on the periphery would like the reverse. It follows from all of this that the problem of changing the essence of the relations among the former parts of the USSR is very complicated, but it became even more complicated when in December 1991 the process of the reformation of the Union was disrupted and the broken-up parts started to get farther and farther away from each other, each creating its special socioeconomic system. Today, it is already more difficult than a year or two years ago to unite these parts, although centripetal forces are also building up. Of course, the question can also be put in a different way: Why is it absolutely necessary to unite? Perhaps to create a genuine commonwealth of independent states? In my opinion, in the case of the former republics of the USSR, such a form as a commonwealth is obviously inadequate (in contrast, for example, to that commonwealth of nations that Great Britain created in its time). Not so much because it does not allow the reformation of the former Union as fast as possible and more effectively, and (which is most important of all) with the least costs for everyone, especially for the population of the CIS, but because the process of reformation could be disrupted completely. In failing to bear the burdens of reorganization of the totalitarian system, the people of the former Union republics can express themselves simply for a return to the old and bring forces to power that will come out in support of this. This will mean that the historical mission that was entrusted to all former Soviet republics and that consists of imperative changes in the socioeconomic system will not be fulfilled. But this chance, which history gave us, will be missed once again. Another variant of the negative development of events--the construction of wild capitalism (it is this variant that is being conducted now before our eyes)--also will not bring us closer to the desired objective--a civilized, modern society. 4. Rather intensive processes are developing not only in the republics of the near abroad, but also in Russia itself, that are leading to its reorganization into either a genuine federation or into a federation with elements of a confederation. The recent example of the signing of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan is a graphic illustration of this. If we do not forget that other autonomous republics, krays, and oblasts are also not only dreaming of something like this, but are persistently pressing for their own, then it can be asserted with confidence that "the process has started." (What is more, I think that in signing the treaty with Tatarstan, Russia set a good example for other countries of the CIS, in particular the states of the Transcaucasus.) And this is not a process of dissolution, as many claim, but a process of reformation. It should not be feared, nor should attempts be made to turn it backwards. Not so much because such efforts will be fruitless, but because they obviously will lead to opposite results. Therefore, as it seems to me, it is necessary to meet this process halfway deliberately, directing it and not allowing it to turn into one that is rapid and out of control, and with all our strength to prevent a repetition of the errors of the collapse of the Union in 1991. If this is not done, then an enormous tragedy, which will be the consequence of the breakup of Russia, cannot be avoided. The dissolution of Russia is possible now only by reforming the mutual relations between the subjects of the Federation in Russia itself, and by reducing the role of the center and increasing the independence of the regions. In other words, under current conditions, the power of Russia should begin not in the center, but in the regions that comprise it. The center should behave like a wise and capable regulator of the basic social processes in the country, and not like a monster that is feared by everyone and that everyone is striving to get rid of. What is the general conclusion? The present CIS is an ineffective formation, and it is generally not very viable. It is necessary to acknowledge this honestly and, boldly abandoning it, to shift to the creation of a confederative union of Eurasian states, keeping in mind that with time it could develop into a more durable national-state formation.
