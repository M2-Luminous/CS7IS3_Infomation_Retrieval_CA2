I saw a helicopter with Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, land close to your cottage. It occurred to me that the subject of your talks was probably urgent when you received your guest at the time of your convalescence, and, on top of it, your meeting was longer than originally expected. [Havel] I am very grateful to Mr. Scharping that, in spite of his very full program, he came all the way here. I admit that I quite like to talk about certain things with certain politicians in this type of total privacy. It contributes to the talks being more confidential, more open-minded, and also more sincere. The talks made a very good impression on me. Rudolf Scharping is a man belonging to a younger generation. He is 11 years younger than I, and he seems to be a dynamic politician. Of course, we talked about general matters related to Europe, to the European security arrangements, Russia, the European Union, and so on. However, great attention was also paid to bilateral questions, especially to the two rather sensitive subjects--the Sudeten German question and the matter of compensation. To inform him, I summarized all the developments around all the negotiations that have taken place up until now. I do not want to be specific. It would be premature. However, I can definitely say that I found in Rudolf Scharping a very sensitive partner in these matters, a very understanding partner, and we understood each other very well. [passage omitted] [Tamchyna] A very interesting and important meeting of six European presidents is awaiting you at Litomysl next week [15-16 April]. Among other things, you are expected unofficially to thank German President Richard von Weizsacker. Is it only my impression that you have been very close to each other also outside the scope of politics? [Havel] I hold President Weizsacker in very high esteem. I think we are bound by good friendship. I had some contact with him long before I became president and before the fall of communism. It was understandably only written contact. We often talked about a great variety of things, and I am also thankful for his help because, in the early stages of my presidency, he managed to give me good advice in some difficult moments. I think he is a great politician who has substantially contributed to Germany's trustworthiness precisely in the crucial period of the fall of communism, of the beginnings of German unification, when fears started to appear about great Germany. We know well enough that many people and many politicians--secretly and even openly, by public statements--did not really wish for unification of Germany. They feared that Germany would be too great, too powerful, and too dominant on the European scene. Although as president, Weizsacker's power is limited, he has proved a lot by his words, by the stature of his pronouncements and deeds. He has really done a lot for Germany's credibility precisely in this crucial period. I think he really deserves a thank you from the presidents of the neighboring countries for everything he has done for the good relations between Germany and its neighbors. [Tamchyna] What are you going to take to Litomysl? It was announced that substantial political talks were not expected. Is it possible to move on at a summit of this kind? [Havel] It depends on our understanding of substantial political talks. None of us thinks that this meeting is going to be a founding meeting of some new international group, nor do we expect that some international initiative or declaration will be issued or treaties and pacts signed. Nothing of the sort. The intention is to discuss some matters of principle but to discuss them within the context of unofficial presidential debate. I said in Salzburg that it was the duty of governments and executives to debate all everyday, specific political matters related to interstate relations, but the duty of presidents, which stems also from their constitutional position, is something different.
