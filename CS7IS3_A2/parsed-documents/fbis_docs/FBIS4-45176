Renteria decided to surrender because he has "accounts pending" with justice officials and which link him to drug trafficking, according to sources at the Valle Regional Prosecutor's Office. The repentant drug trafficker appeared before this office in the company of his lawyer. He is now waiting to be assigned to the prison where he will stay until his legal situation is defined. Renteria's action came several days after the suspension of the gradual surrenders of alleged members of drug trafficking gangs in Valle and Cali. The top leaders of this country's drug trafficking gangs, brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, as well as others, announced some months ago their willingness to turn themselves in, but they have not done so even though their lawyers have contacted judicial authorities on several occasions. Renteria and other drug traffickers who have surrendered have agreed to accept the government's surrender policy, which offers them legal advantages and sentence reductions.
