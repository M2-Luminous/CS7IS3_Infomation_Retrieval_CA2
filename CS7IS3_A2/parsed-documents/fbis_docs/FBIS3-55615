Currently, special committees are preparing and drafting special interstate agreements. Stanislav Shushkevich emphasized that an array of important agreements is to be signed during the visit. In his opinion, the main goal of the visit is to clarify positions on the main strategic objectives of our policy and, in particular, the issue of Belarus' security. We would like to obtain guarantees for the protection of our neutrality -- such as Finland once received from the United States and the USSR -- when Belarus implements its constitutional law on neutrality and nonnuclear status, stressed Stanislav Shushkevich. Additionally, the Belarusian Supreme Soviet chairman noted that he does not expect that such a statement can be voiced by the United States already on 16 January, however certain steps will undoubtedly be made. Commenting on Bill Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative, Stanislav Shushkevich stated that he considers it expedient to examine Belarus' official strategy in establishing in Central Europe a belt of neutral states with certain guarantees from great states of the world. Additionally, Stanislav Shushkevich believes that Bill Clinton's visit to Minsk will contribute to Belarus' international image and encourage U.S. investment in its economy.
