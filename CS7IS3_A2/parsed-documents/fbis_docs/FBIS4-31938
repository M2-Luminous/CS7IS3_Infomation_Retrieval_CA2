As was announced, the two sides were to talk exclusively about economic issues. Here is Branislav Bozic reporting from Plitvice: I cannot tell you why the negotiations have been called off. They called me on the phone from Zagreb at 1345 and I was told that the negotiations had been called off since an agreement had not been reached on the details of the negotiations. I was also told to withdraw my people, and this is exactly what I am doing at the moment. This is what Colonel Bill Morton, a Canadian who is deputy commander of the South Sector in charge of organizing the conference, told us half an hour ago. After that, we contacted Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and he told us that the Croatian side has set forth new ultimatums and is still conditioning the negotiations on bringing five of their correspondents and all U.S. correspondents who are in Zagreb, although a reciprocal decision was agreed upon during the preparations to the effect that only one of their correspondents and one cameraman can come, as was the case during the Zagreb talks, when only one correspondent and one television cameraman from the republic of Serbian Krajina were there, Martic said. These negotiations obviously do not suit the Croatian side and they clearly want to not only postpone but interrupt them and accuse us in order to be able to carry out the war option. It is known that they are amassing forces along the borders of the republic of Serbian Krajina.
