FR940303-0-00065 FR940303-0-00022 On July 24, 1991, the FAA published a final rule (Amendment No. 157&hyph;6, 56 FR 33994) that eliminated the impending requirement to provide 90 days advance notice of construction, alteration, activation, and deactivation of certain temporary airports and heliports. Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 also revised the applicability section of part 157 to exclude proposals involving the intermittent use of sites that are not established airports. The ``intermittent use of a site'' means that the site is used or intended to be used in VFR conditions for no more than three days in any one week with no more than 10 operations a day. Finally, Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 clarified that telephone notice for certain emergency or unreasonable hardship situations should be directed to the appropriate FAA Airports District/Field Office or Regional Office. Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 and Amendment No. 157&hyph;4 (with the revisions noted above) became effective on August 30, 1991. The FAA invited comments on amendment No. 157&hyph;6. The FAA stated that the request for comments to Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 did not represent a reopening or reconsideration of the proposals in notice No. 88&hyph;15, or of the revisions resulting from amendment No. 157&hyph;4 that were not revised or otherwise affected by amendment No. 157&hyph;6. Therefore, issues relating to the notice requirement for a change to, or the establishment of an airport traffic pattern; the elimination of the term ``personal use'' as an airport use designation; and other changes resulting from amendment No. 157&hyph;4 will not be specifically addressed in this document. Discussion of Comments The FAA received eleven comments to amendment No. 157&hyph;6. Eight commenters address changes resulting from amendment No. 157&hyph;4 that were not revised or affected by amendment No. 157&hyph;6. As discussed above, such changes will not be discussed in this document. One commenter does not believe that there was a need for regulations to require notice of temporary aircraft operations to and from a landing site that is not intended to be used as a permanent airport or heliport. Amendment No. 157&hyph;6 provides that notice of temporary airports and landing or takeoff areas would be required if the airport will be used (other than on an intermittent basis) for a period of more than 30 days, or if more than 10 operations will be conducted a day. The FAA believes that a level of activity in excess of 10 operations a day warrants closer examination for appropriate consideration of the potential impact to adjacent airspace users. Several commenters believe that the 90-day advance notification requirement would cause economic hardship for certain operators, particularly emergency medical service and other helicopter operators. Section 157.5(b)(1) provides that ``in an emergency involving essential public service, public health, or public safety or when the delay arising from the 90-day advance notice requirement would result in an unreasonable hardship, a proponent may provide notice to the appropriate FAA Airport District/Field Office or Regional Office by telephone or other expeditious means as soon as practicable in lieu of submitting FAA Form 7480&hyph;1.'' The FAA believes that this provision provides for adequate relief from the 90-day advance notice requirements for emergency medical service helicopter operations and other similar emergency or unreasonable hardship situations.
