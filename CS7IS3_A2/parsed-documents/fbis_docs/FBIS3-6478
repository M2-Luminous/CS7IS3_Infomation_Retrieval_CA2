Addressing the reception, Kim Yong-nam, Politburo member of the WPK Central Committee and vice-premier of the Administration Council and foreign minister, said Comrade Fidel Castro visited Korea and had a significant meeting with the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, and this was a realisation of the long-cherished ardent desire of the peoples of the two countries who were fighting in the same trench of the common struggle against imperialism and for independence and socialism, and a historical event that developed the traditional Korea-Cuba relations of friendship and cooperation to a new high level. Noting that the Cuban people are accelerating socialist construction, successfully frustrating the U.S. imperialists' manoeuvrings to isolate and seal off Cuba, under the revolutionary slogan "Let us defend the motherland, revolution and the gains of socialism!", he said the Korean people extend firm solidarity to the Cuban people in their cause of justice. He stressed the party and people of Korea will advance shoulder to shoulder with the Cuban party and people along the straight road to victory of socialism for ever. Jose Ramon Rodriguez Varona, Cuban ambassador to Korea, in his address said "Comrade Fidel's visit to the DPRK, the first of its kind in the history of Cuba, was a realisation of the cherished desire of our comrade supreme commander to personally visit heroic Korea and spend supreme days with Comrade President Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean people." He underlined the excellent bonds of friendship and unity existing between the governments and peoples of the two countries that are defending socialism under so difficult conditions. He added that unquestioned support for Korea's cause of reunification is the first and foremost political activity of Cuba and it will be always invariable.
