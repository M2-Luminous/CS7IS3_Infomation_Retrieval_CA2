Kozyrev expressed his opinion on the "nuclear problem" on the Korean peninsula and the calls by some countries for economic sanctions to be introduced against the DPRK. "In the final count," he said, "it may come to a stage-by- stage introduction of sanctions. But before that all the other possibilities should be exhausted, including the possibility of holding an international conference." Speaking of Russia's possible participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program, the Russian Federation foreign minister stressed that this program not regarded by the Russian side as a panacea.
