FR941116-0-00028 FR941116-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 90&hyph;NM&hyph;265&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9073; AD 94&hyph;23&hyph;10] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 727 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing AD that currently requires periodic leak checks of the forward lavatory drain system and provides for the installation of a new drain valve as terminating action. This action continues to require various leak checks, but deletes a previously provided terminating action; adds requirements for leak checks of other lavatory drain systems; provides for the option of revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to include a schedule of leak checks; requires the installation of a cap on the flush/fill line; and requires either a periodic leak check of the flush/fill line cap or replacement of the seals on both that cap and the toilet tank anti- siphon (check) valve. This amendment was prompted by continuing reports of damage to engines and airframes, separation of engines from airplanes, and damage to property on the ground, caused by ``blue ice'' that had formed from leaking forward lavatory drain systems and subsequently had dislodged from the airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent such damage associated with the problems of ``blue ice.'' EFFECTIVE DATE: December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration, (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 90&hyph;NM&hyph;265&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Boeing Model 727 series airplanes, was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12865). That supplemental NPRM proposed to supersede AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;5250 (51 FR 7767, March 6, 1986). That AD currently requires periodic leak checks of the forward lavatory drain system and provides for the installation of a new drain valve as terminating action. Among other things, the supplemental NPRM proposed to: 1. Delete the existing provision for terminating action; 2. Require repetitive leak checks of both the forward and the aft lavatory drain systems; 3. Provide an optional procedure for complying with the rule, which would entail revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to incorporate a schedule and procedure to conduct leak checks of the lavatory drain systems; and 4. Require the installation of a lever lock cap on flush/fill lines, and periodic leak check of the flush/fill line. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.
