For the first time ever "CIS member states were given an answer concerning the priorities of Russia's domestic and foreign policy. Russia is a great power. We believe in Russia, in its great future. Our belief is based on the historic roots, without which our today's friendship and cooperation would be impossible," the Uzbek president said.
