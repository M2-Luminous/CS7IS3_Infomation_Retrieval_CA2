China's man in charge of Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, told Hong Kong Fujian businessmen that the special administrative region's (SAR) share of land sales, lodged in the Land Fund, could reach $100 billion by the changeover. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod predicted in his March Budget that fiscal reserves - excluding the SAR Land Fund - to be handed over on June 30, 1997, would be $78 billion. However, latest estimates suggest Sir Hamish will finish the year with a huge surplus, possibly close to $20 billion, instead of the modest deficit of $3.36 billion he had budgeted for. If the healthy trend continues and the administration draws nothing from the reserves, $100 billion could be accumulated by 1997. And if Mr Lu is correct the SAR kitty will be doubled by the $100 billion from the Land Fund. The territory's Exchange Fund, used to protect the value of the HK dollar, was already $287 billion at the end of 1992, making Hong Kong the 10th biggest holder of foreign currency reserves in the world. Extra land income resulting from a booming economy is believed to be a key factor in inflating Mr Lu's expectations from the Land Fund, although he did not elaborate on his projections. The strong property market has seen land prices breaking records in the last year. Proceeds from property development along the proposed airport railway projects have not been included in these forecasts as China and Britain have yet to agree on the financing of the railway plan. Despite the growing risk of slippage of the airport projects beyond the target opening date of mid-1997, Hong Kong officials remain noncommittal on whether the government will use the windfall surplus to substantially increase the capital injection into the infrastructure plan. Mr Lu, the Director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, repeated that there was a need to keep a healthy financial position for the post-1997 government. In October, the Land Fund announced that the balance of the fund only stood at $44.3 billion for the year ending March 31, 1993. Mr Lu told the businessmen that although in the past it was estimated the Land Fund would accumulate about $70 billion, now it looked possible that it would reach $100 billion. The director revealed the figure while explaining China's rationale in handling the airport financing plan. "We have to act responsibly on behalf of the SAR government and it is the SAR government's duty to lay a solid financial basis for the SAR so that Hong Kong will have a comfortable financial position," said Mr Lu. "For the good of Hong Kong people, we certainly cannot further compromise (on the airport projects)." To ensure that Hong Kong will enjoy a better financial basis, the Chinese side has requested the British side leave $25 billion in the kitty by 1997 and make sure that Government borrowings do not exceed $5 billion, according to Mr Lu. These requirements are already written down in the airport memorandum.
