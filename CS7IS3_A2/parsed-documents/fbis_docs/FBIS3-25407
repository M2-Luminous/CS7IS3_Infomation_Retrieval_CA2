He told a public meeting in Bloemfontein last night that although the AWB wanted peace, if the right wing went to war it would not be for 14 percent of the country but for the whole country. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Conrad Burke] Addressing a crowd of more than 2,000 supporters in the city hall, Mr. Terreblanche said he had 60,000 trained soldiers in Bloemfontein. He added that 95 percent of the commandos in the [Orange] Free State were also right wingers. Mr. Terreblanche warned that if there was war, it would be full scale. [Terreblanche in Afrikaans] If you want peace, give the Boers their state. If you do not give it to us, I tell you, there is no force on earth which will hold back the Boer nation from taking back its fatherland through violence. [Burke] After all the Afrikaner people had done in the development of the country, said Mr. Terreblanche, a patch of land to plow seemed little to ask for. The AWB leader added that loyal sections of the Defense Force and the police would stand behind the Afrikaner people in their fight for freedom. [Terreblanche] I have the biggest assurance, and I want to say very positively that the South African Defense Force and the South African Police, if commanded by the communist to shoot their people, will not do it because they know where their loyalty, their God, their church, and their people are. [end recording] Mr. Terreblanche told GMSA [Good Morning South Africa] a while ago that he was unaware of the government and ANC [African National Congress] concessions when he made his speech last night. He said that like the other members of the Freedom Alliance, the AWB would study these concessions before commenting on them.
