The Onusal chief and his large team of observers toured the entire country on 19 and 20 March. Ramirez added that they had access to the latest information on what was transpiring "and, therefore, this was an extraordinarily normal election." Ramirez described as "a Solomonic measure" the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] decision to install polling stations in Arcatao, San Jose las Flores, Nueva Trinidad, and San Isidro Labrador, because these four municipalities of Chalatenenango are considered to be refugees for former FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] combatants. The voting started in those places at 1015 because ballot boxes were not transported until yesterday via Air Force helicopters after the TSE had a change of mind. The original plan was to install all ballot boxes in the city of Chalatenango, where 85 percent of the inhabitants of those four municipalities live. Ramirez praised Salvadorans who stood in line without making any fuss to comply with their duties as citizens. He regretted delays in the voting process that prevented many people from voting. [as published] The chief observer, of Colombian origin, recalled the commitment made by presidential candidates and secretaries general to President Cristiani to close polling stations at 1700 only after every citizen still waiting to vote had cast his or her vote. Ramirez said that Onusal will take note of all "anomalies, claims, and requests but will only report worthy ones. The atmosphere that has surrounded the peace process is yielding and will yield results," the chief of the observers added. Among the small problems he noticed at certain voting sites were the delays in opening. In some cases, such as the Central American Pavillion of the International Fair Grounds, Ramirez intervened directly to expedite its opening. "In general, this was an extraordinarily normal election," the Colombian added.
