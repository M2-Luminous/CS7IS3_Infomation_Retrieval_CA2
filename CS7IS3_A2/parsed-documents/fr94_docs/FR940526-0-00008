FR940526-0-00008 FR940526-0-00005 A normal year's exports is defined in section 301(b)(12) of the 1938 Act as the average quantity produced in and exported from the United States during the 10 MYs immediately preceding the MY in which such exports are determined, adjusted for current trends in such exports. In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 1 percent of the national acreage allotment for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments, adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments for new farms. The Secretary has determined that the national reserve, noted herein, for the 1994 crop of each of these kinds of tobacco is adequate for these purposes. On December 21, 1993, a proposed rule was published (58 FR 67376) in which interested persons were requested to comment with respect to these issues. Discussion of Comments Thirty-one written responses were received during the comment period which ended February 4, 1994. Some respondents discussed more than one kind of tobacco. A summary of these comments by kind of tobacco follows: (1) Fire-cured (type 21) tobacco. Eight comments were received. Four comments recommended that quotas be increased by 5 percent. Two others recommended that the marketing quotas be increased by 10 percent from the 1993 MY while two more requested an unspecified increase. (2) Fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23) tobacco. Four comments were received, all recommending a five percent increase from the 1993 marketing quota. (3) Dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobacco. Five comments were received. Recommendations ranged from a 5-percent decrease to a 10-percent decrease in the quota. (4) Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco. Eight comments were received. Recommendations ranged from a 5-percent to a 20-percent increase in quota. (5) Cigar-filler and binder (types 42&hyph;44 and 53&hyph;55) tobacco. Six comments were received. These comments ranged from no change in quota to a 35-percent decrease in quota. (6) Cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco. No comments were received. Based upon a review of these comments and the latest available statistics of the Federal Government, which appear to be the most reliable data available, the following determinations have been made. (1) Fire-Cured (Type 21) Tobacco The yearly average quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993&hyph;94 MY is approximately 1.5 million pounds. The average annual quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco produced in the United States and exported from the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993&hyph;94 MY was 2.7 million pounds (farm sales weight basis). Both domestic use and exports have trended sharply downward. For that reason, a normal year's domestic consumption has been determined to be 0.5 million pounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 2.1 million pounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 5.61 million pounds. Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 4.4 million pounds. The 1993 fire-cured (type 21) tobacco crop is estimated to be 1.9 million pounds. Therefore, the total supply of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 6.3 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 2.5 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 3.8 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained. The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 1.81 million pounds. This represents the quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Less than 85 percent of the announced national marketing quota is expected to be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota of 2.15 million pounds is necessary to make available production of 1.81 million pounds. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for the 1994 MY is 2.15 million pounds. In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 2.15 million pounds by the 1989&hyph;93, 5-year national average yield of 1,388 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of 1,548.99 acres. Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 1.05 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 5.0 acres, by the total of 1994 preliminary farm acreage allotments (previous year's allotments). The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g) of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms. (2) Fire-Cured (Types 22&hyph;23) Tobacco The yearly average quantity of fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 years preceding the 1993 MY was approximately 17.8 million pounds. The average annual quantity of fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23) tobacco produced in the United States and exported during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993 MY was 16.9 million pounds (farm sales weight basis). Both domestic use and exports have trended upward recently. A normal year's domestic consumption has for that reason been determined to be 21.8 million pounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 20.7 million pounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 98.8 million pounds. Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 64.0 million pounds. The 1993 fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23) crop is estimated to be 36.8 million pounds. Therefore, the total supply of fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23) tobacco for the MY beginning October 1, 1993, is 100.8 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 34.0 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 66.8 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained. The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 32.0 million pounds. This represents the quantity of fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during the 1994 MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. About 95 percent of the announced national marketing quota is expected to be produced.
