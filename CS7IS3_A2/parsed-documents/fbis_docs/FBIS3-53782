She was presiding over the annual meeting of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Council in Islamabad today. The council reviewed the progress of work at different establishments of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and considered the main lines of future programs of the commission which lay emphasis on self-reliance and indigenization. Addressing the council, the prime minister said the Islamic, democratic and awami [people's] government fully supports achieving excellence and advancement of technology, be it simple or high technology. It was the elected prime minister, late Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who had first started the atomic projects in Pakistan which are now being implemented. Late Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had 25 years ago given an autonomous status to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and sought cooperation of the United States for support of PINSTECH [Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology] and other atomic projects. Now, the prime minister said, with Chinese cooperation her government is completing the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant after 25 years. There are some undue misgivings about our peaceful nuclear program, but we hope that Pakistan would very soon be able to allay these misgivings. The prime minister expressed the determination to make Pakistan an enviable, progressive and developed state. She paid tributes to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission scientists for working selflessly and single-mindedly without looking for award or name. The present government, after its takeover, especially marked one of its cabinet meetings for preparation and approval of the new technology policy. Despite financial constraints, the government earmarked an amount of 1 billion rupees for this purpose. She expressed the confidence that the new policy would lead the country toward rapid economic development. The present government is attaching high priority to the energy sector. Work at the 300-megawatt nuclear power plant acquired during 1988-90 would be completed soon. The prime minister complimented the commission on its performance and directed it to work with greater vigor for peaceful application of nuclear technology for socioeconomic uplift in the country. Earlier, the prime minister was shown the indigenously redesigned and upgraded Pakistan Research Reactor-1 and the research facilities around it. The chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed, briefed the prime minister about the activities in pursuit of peaceful application of atomic energy.
