"I am convinced that it is possible to get into the Riksdag," he says. In the election this fall he hopes to be able to gather no-voters in Sodermanland Province from all political parties. The new party will enter the election on one issue -- preventing Swedish membership in the EU. The names on the list will span the entire political field, according to Bjorn von der Esch. "The yes side has joined from left to right. The no side should do the same," he believes, and this weekend he will travel to Lund to talk some more about his plans during the organization No to EU's convention. The party name is still secret, however. "The period for registration of party names has ended. If I were now to say what the list will be called, anyone could steal the name." Bjorn von der Esch was rejected by the Moderates because of his strong opposition to the EU. Since then, support for him has been strong both from friends in the party and others. However, 12 percent of the votes in the election are needed to enter the Riksdag from a list in Sodermanland Province. "If I succeed, it will really give the political establishment something to think about. In the Riksdag opposition to the EU is represented by only 3-4 percent of the delegates, while more than half the Swedish people has a negative opinion." Hans Lindqvist, chairman of the organization No to EU, welcomes the initiative. "He will certainly do very well. There are lots of nonsocialist voters who are critical of the EU."
