With the aim of protecting the interests of investors and ensuring the normal functioning of the securities market, the Russian Federation Finance Ministry proposes that all interested citizens should follow the following recommendations in buying and selling securities: 1. First of all, gather as much information as possible about who is issuing the securities you intend to buy (that is, the issuer). If they are being issued by a bank or a credit institution, then find out how long it has been functioning, what its authorized capital is, and what types of banking operations it has a license for. 2. Make sure that the securities are state-registered, and study carefully the prospectus for the issue of securities registered by the financial organs. 3. Never trust advertisements. You can only make a decision to invest your money in securities on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the securities issue prospectus, the accounts and the nature of the activity of the issuer, and the general situation in the market where the issuer in question is working. 4. When concluding security deals, only use the services of professional participants in the securities market (investment institutions which have the appropriate licenses). 5. Make sure that the seller is the owner of the securities or an employee of an owner of the securities. If the seller of securities is operating on the instructions of the owner of the securities (on the basis of a commission contract or a contract of agency), then he should be an employee of an investment institution and have a first-category certificate of qualification (that is, you must demand a photocopy of the license granting the right to conduct activity as an investment institution and a photocopy of the first-category qualification certificate). 6. It is recommended that deals concerning the purchase and sale of securities are drawn up in the form of a written contract in which the following must be determined: the procedure for transactions on the deal, the procedure for entering a new owner in the shareholders' register, the procedure for paying taxes on transactions involving securities, and so on. 7. Register the deal at an investment institution, bank, or with the issuer from whom you are buying the securities. 8. As practice shows, the investment of funds in bills of exchange and granting loans by concluding loan contracts are the most risky at present. You do not need any state registration, nor do you need special permission (licenses) in order to issue bills of exchange and conclude loan contracts, and that is precisely why these financial instruments are most often used by dishonest entrepreneurs with the aim of deceiving the population. At the same time, as a rule neither the issuer of the bill of exchange nor the borrower reveals any information about his financial position or type of activity in the loan contract. Remember that, when you conclude a loan contract, you are entering into a civil-legal relationship with the borrower and, in the event of a conflict, you can only defend your interests via a court. The specific nature of a bill of exchange is such that the absence of even one obligatory element makes it invalid. If you are not familiar with the rules of composing bills of exchange, the circulation of bills, and civil legislation, do not invest money in these financial instruments, regardless of the high interest rates you may be promised. If you do decide to buy bills of exchange, then you should know that the most reliable are the bills of exchange of major banks and banking syndicates. 9. Remember that investing money in non-state securities practically always involves risk. The fact that the securities you are buying have passed through state registration is no guarantee that the funds you have invested will be returned, or of the reliability and profitability of these securities. The basic axiom for investment activity in the securities market states that, the higher the profitability of the security, the greater the risk of investing in such a security. 10. Do not give in to general trends of investing your money at an interest rate which exceeds the average market interest rate many times over. Remember that the founders of joint stock companies are answerable to other shareholders only within the limits of personal contributions to the authorized capital. Investments in joint stock companies with a small authorized capital and a declared issue exceeding the authorized capital thousands and millions of times over are extremely risky.
