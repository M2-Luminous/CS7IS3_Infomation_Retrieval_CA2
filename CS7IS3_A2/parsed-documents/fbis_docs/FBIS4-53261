All kinds of children's food produced by the plant -- including rice powder, vegetable powder, and tangle powder -- are good, and powdered bean milk is better than anything else. The plant has prepared excellent processing lines with its own strength and technology. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: "By vigorously carrying out the technological revolution, the light industry sector should remodel production facilities after a modern style, modernize equipment, make them high-speed, and mechanize and automatize processing lines." When the question on providing children with bean milk was raised, Sinyang County began to build a facility for producing bean milk at the county's food processing plant without hesitation. With the desire to timely embody the great leader and the party's great love and consideration for children, functionaries at the plant tried to find a way to build a modern facility for producing bean milk. The county's party committee intensified the party-oriented guidance to prepare a modern bean milk production base at the food processing plant in accordance with the party's intention, by mobilizing functionaries and technicians at the local industry sector of the county. Food scientists engaged in light industrial scientific research came to the plant to render their active technological support in preparing the bean milk production facility. Scientists, functionaries of the county, functionaries and workers of the plant, technicians, and three revolutions team members cooperated together in studying and testing, and completed bean milk processing lines one by one, displaying all their strength and wisdom. They finally succeeded in producing quality powdered bean milk after repeated research and tests. This processing line can be easily introduced into any plant. The production process is not complicated, but simple. The plant has excellently built these processing lines with its own strength with the scientists' active cooperation, and is now able to supply quality powdered bean milk to day nurseries and kindergartens, which give children powdered bean milk mixed with water. Nurseries and kindergartens say they can economize labor and traffic expenses since it is easy to transport and preserve powdered bean milk. Above all, this food is good for children's health since it is digestible, as well as tasty, because it is fermented by milk bacillus.
