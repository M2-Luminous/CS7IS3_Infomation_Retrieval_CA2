After his arrival on Tuesday [12 April], he first received FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Federal Government's guest house at Petersberg for a brief courtesy visit. In a newspaper interview on Monday, Butrus-Ghali had said that he wants to advocate a German contribution to a permanent UN blue helmet task force of about 3,000 soldiers. By stating this, the UN secretary general, who expressly based his calculations on 1 percent of the strength of the national armed forces, seemed to expect a strength of only 300,000 men for the German Bundeswehr (currently 370,000 men). As during his previous two working visits, the Federal Government will have to point out to Butrus-Ghali its hope that such decisions will become possible as a result of the ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court about armed alliance missions. The foreign minister expects such a ruling in summer 1994 at the earliest. Kinkel linked the issue with Germany's efforts for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However, this seat is not issued by Butrus-Ghali but depends on a discussion of the United Nations. The foreign minister urgently asked Butrus-Ghali for help with evacuating the 11 employees of Deutsche Welle in Rwanda. The United Nations, which has long had observers in the African country, has helicopters and other means of transportation, with which the Germans could be taken out of their isolated station. The UN secretary general promised to immediately examine that matter. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Kinkel also want to emphatically discuss with Butrus-Ghali an appropriate and representative settlement of UN organizations in Bonn. It was stressed in the Foreign Ministry that the promised transfer of the small UN information authority from Geneva does not fulfill this condition at all. On Tuesday, Butrus-Ghali also met with Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth and had dinner with the Foreign Affairs Committee. The UN secretary general will attend the meeting on Wednesday as the guest of honor.
