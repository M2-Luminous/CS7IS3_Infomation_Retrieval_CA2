They are an edict of the president, a government decree, and statutes on reorganizing agricultural enterprises and breaking them up into smaller units. The draft documents have been initialed by many top leaders involved in agrarian problems and privatization. One of the drafts has been referred back for revision, while others have apparently already been fully agreed and will be published in the near future. What do they mean for agrarian reform and the peasants? The main idea is to break farms up into smaller units, which is a fairly popular idea among rural reformers at grassroots level. For instance, my close acquaintance Viktor Gulov, a peasant whom we have often written about, is convinced that it is possible to arrive at real private farming from our kolkhoz reality by a simple arithmetical path -- by dividing farms up into as small units as possible, thus getting down to family farming. The mechanism for this kind of division into the smallest units has been provided by the Nizhniy Novgorod experiment of collective farms being redivided into joint-stock enterprises. It is no accident that the Russian Federation government decree on the practice of agrarian transformations in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast occupies a very important place in the package of documents. All the indications are that the idea of breaking farms up into smaller units as a method of fighting the kolkhoz system has also inspired the Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy under the Russian Federation President's Administration. It was from this center that the aforementioned draft documents were issued. It is a thankless task to explain what is in the draft documents, since they are being subjected to revision, further work, and so on, and even complete changes of meaning. I will merely note that there is a principle of compulsion in these documents. If an agricultural enterprise does not want to be broken up into smaller units, then, according to the draft edict, this will be done for it. It is pointless to dispute the idea of breaking farms down into smaller units. First of all, this has already happened. And the kolkhozes which were made smaller did not stop being kolkhozes. Second, what is there to dispute: Of course, a smaller collective is more mobile, and it is better suited to the market. But it would be more convenient for it to solve the problem of its own size than to have this done on orders from Moscow. And what is to happen now to the agricultural enterprises which have already been turned into joint-stock enterprises and which see themselves as proprietors, even major proprietors? Why should they be subjected to the dictates of the capital and be divided up if they do not want this? Of course, on a broad level, the breaking up of agricultural enterprises may be advantageous. However, for the course of agrarian reform and for the peasants, the future documents may also prove to be a destabilizing factor. The countryside is waiting for something entirely different. A law on agricultural cooperatives, the organization of a land market, a system of mortgage banks, a targeted financial policy, and so on. Instead, a new wave of reorganization is approaching, maybe with some sense to it, but in no way replacing the changes which the Russian countryside is expecting.
