Kalashnikov, Russian deputy minister of Labor, by EIZh [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Department of Social Problems and APK [agroindustrial complex]: "Labor Legislation: New Trends and Directions"] [Text] V. Kalashnikov, Russian deputy minister of Labor, answers our readers' questions. [EIZh] Viktor Vasilyevich, in our opinion, the existing labor legislation is to a great extent oriented toward the former system of economic operation. The situation has changed sharply, however, particularly in the past year: a tremendous number of private firms are in operation, and their development is in many ways held back by the present labor law. What is the Russian Ministry of Labor planning to do this year, what basically new documents will it adopt, and what draft laws are being drawn up? [Kalashnikov] In the course of political and economic reforms, social processes proceed in an ambiguous way. We are therefore faced this year with the problem of drawing up new and revising existing fundamental legislative acts in the sphere of labor relations. They include: the Fundamentals of Labor Legislation, laws and edicts on the minimum subsistence level, settling collective labor disputes and conflicts, regulating wages and the insolvency (bankruptcy) of enterprises, indexing the minimal amount for wages, unemployment benefits, allotments and many others. When drawing up labor legislation, we intend to orient the consolidated norms and rules primarily toward achieving higher labor productivity and strengthening the socio-economic positions of the labor collectives. This is to be ensured on the basis of improving the forms and methods of social partnership and wages and removing the artificial restrictions to labor stimulation. We are now seeking these methods of economic influence on all the participants in the labor process. For example, the draft of the Law on Social Insurance specifies differentiating the rates of enterprises' withholding funds for the social insurance fund on the basis of work time lost because of illness, occupational illness, and other factors. This will, of course, rouse and stimulate employers to improve labor conditions, and, on this basis, reduce the number of sick workers and the amount of work time lost because of their illness. Another point. The system of paying enterprise directors in many ways determines the amount and nature of the wages of the collective and hired workers. In connection with this, the ministry has conceived the idea of determining the wage level of state enterprise directors, even if in accordance with the recommended procedure, by the appropriate normative acts, so that the size of their wages is tied in with the results of production activity. In a word, in the process of improving the labor code, together with the statute on labor safety and social insurance, the main goal is to create, under the new conditions, reliable legal protection for every worker and at the same time to provide the prerequisites for the further growth of work efficiency in the national economy. [EIZh] In the developed countries, the average small business has a substantial influence on the development of the economy as a whole. Russia too is moving in this direction. Let us imagine, however, this situation: a new enterprise of 10-20 people, and one employee has fallen ill. For four months he cannot be even fired. Or another point: when the firing is at management's initiative, the employee must be notified two months in advance. Indeed, one must even ask for the trade union committee's agreement on this. The case, meanwhile, comes to a standstill. In the United States, for example, there is no sick list system at all. There they have a different, simpler procedure even for firing at management's initiative. Why does our country still have such a conservative Labor Code? [Kalashnikov] Yes, it is true, in the United States, only 6 states have legislation on insurance for temporary incapacity, and the other 44 do not have it. A number of other countries do not start paying benefits for temporary incapacity from the first day of the illness: for example, Italy pays from the fourth day, and Finland -- from the eighth day of incapacity. These problems, however, must not be considered separately from other trends in social security, wage level and other forms of social insurance. In the United States, where there is no social insurance by legislation, it is widely organized on voluntary principles, through commercial insurance companies and collective contracts. I do not think that the time has yet come in our country when we could leave workers without compulsory state social insurance. Considering the income level of the basic mass of the population, this is fraught with many negative social consequences. With respect to the conservatism of the Labor Code as regards other social guarantees, it can be said that problems mainly arise here not with the scale, and not with the size of the social guarantees, but with the procedure for their presentation. Obviously, with respect to individual social guarantees based on improving the tax legislation and the procedure for forming social funds, a redistribution of responsibility between the state and the workers should be carried out. Therefore, the ministry now finds itself seeking improvement in labor legislation in all directions. This includes drawing up statutes on state support of small-scale entrepreneurship as well. We will be grateful for all suggestions on this subject. [EIZh] Viktor Vasilyevich, one of the problems which constantly "scares" us is unemployment. It would appear that the state's influence over this should be an active one. It can't pay money to the unemployed just like that. Who will go work in the rural areas, if the unemployment benefits are higher than the average wage in agricultural production? With officially declared unemployment, our country is full of vacant positions. What can you say about this? [Kalashnikov] According to the situation in December of last year, the number of persons without work and actively seeking it was 3.8 million people, or 5 percent of the economically active population. At the same time, approximately the same number of the population were working under conditions not constituting full employment. Approximately 800,000 people, however, are registered with the employment authorities, and have the official status of unemployed. The rest are in transit, which, according to existing legislation, does not require the payment of unemployment benefits. Social surveys show that, given all the existing shortcomings of the legislation in force on employment problems, it does not create a striving to be unemployed. Unemployment benefits are paid with a consistent reduction in amounts and a restriction on periods and conditions for payment. Polls show that two-thirds of the citizens feel: it is better to have a guaranteed wage than to get large sums of money and not have the security of a job. The existence of free work places, constituting 654,000 at the end of the 1st quarter of last year, 703,000 at the end of the 2d, and 696,000 at the end of the 3d, is essentially unrelated to the rise in unemployment, and mainly depends on the lack of correspondence, by type and skill level, of the unemployed to the free work places. In this case, women and young people predominate among the unemployed. On the whole, the effect of the measures taken to ease the negative processes of unemployment is so far not great. Not much more than 2 percent of the employment fund is spent for vocational training of the unemployed and the financing of public works. [EIZh] As things now stand, protecting and improving labor conditions is only in second, and sometimes in third place among businessmen. Many people in general feel that this is one of the courses for saving capital. This is a short-sighted policy, though. What is the Russian Ministry of Labor planning to do about this in the near future? [Kalashnikov] A critical situation is forming in the country with respect to labor safety and conditions. Even under the conditions of a cutback in production volumes, there are 6.3 accidents per 1,000 people yearly in the Russian Federation. These official data, however, are obviously understated. Over 8,000 people die in production, and about 15,000 people a year become disabled. Production injury with a fatal outcome is increasing. There are a considerable number of workers in the enterprises and organizations of the Russian Federation who continue to work while exposed to factors that are harmful and hazardous to their health. Over 18 percent of all workers are employed under conditions that do not meet the sanitary-hygienic norms. Table 1.

By decision of the Russian Federation Government, right up to organizing the appropriate state bodies, the functions of labor safety management, specified by the Fundamentals of Legislation, have been entrusted to the Russian Ministry of Labor. In connection with this, the ministry is taking measures to create, in the shortest possible time, a system of state management, state supervision and control over labor safety practices at the federal and territorial level, to organize work on improving the normative base for labor safety, to solve problems of personnel training and to work out and put into effect an economic mechanism to guarantee labor safety. For these purposes it is specified that a Federal Labor Safety Fund be formed and that the territorial organs of executive power be given help in creating territorial funds and labor safety funds for enterprises. An interdepartmental commission on labor safety problems, attached to the Russian Federation Government, should be set up. The ministry has now prepared drafts of statutes on a Federal Labor Safety Fund, on putting into practice an economic mechanism to ensure labor safety, on investigating and keeping records of production accidents, on supervising and controlling labor safety and on the status of the state inspector for labor safety, with the necessary drafts of government decrees and edicts of the Russian Federation president, which, after the appropriate finalizing, should be passed and put into effect. It is intended that the inspectors will be granted the right to shut down enterprises and individual production facilities in cases when their activity threatens the lives of workers and the population; to impose fines and administrative sanctions on employers and officials of the enterprise for violation of legislative and other normative acts on labor safety. Formation of an economic mechanism and labor safety funds pursues the goal, along with creating a mechanism for financial support of all state measures in the sphere of labor safety and interesting employers in creating the necessary work conditions, of achieving the independence of the offices of labor safety supervision and control from higher organizations and enterprises, which will contribute to the objectivity of their decisions. * * * Essentially, the questions raised with V.V. Kalashnikov are open for discussion. For example, in developed countries, the system of social protection is different for state servants and workers in private companies. Why, in our country, in Russia, is it identical? It would be highly desirable for the system to be differentiated in the new Fundamentals of Labor Legislation. Another question. Up to now, our labor law has been oriented toward identical protection for both the honest worker and the negligent one. After all, this is unfair. The legislation should primarily be aimed at protecting the interests of a citizen who does good work. This problem is inexhaustible. We will continue to cover it in future issues. We hope that the developers and legislators will take a professional approach to solving the problems posed. [Box, p 1] - Differentiated rates for the social insurance fund await entrepreneurs. - The wages of directors of state enterprises should be tied into the end result of the activity. This is what the Ministry of Labor thinks. - The future Federal Labor Safety Fund will be able to shut down production for violation of labor safety practices.
