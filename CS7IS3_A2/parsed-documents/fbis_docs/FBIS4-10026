Mendiandua] [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- Relations between Cuba and Mexico are diverse, exhibit mutual respect, and have a very encouraging future in terms of joint ventures and technical-scientific cooperation, Mexican Ambassador Carlos Tello asserted here today. The diplomat said he was optimistic about the future of bilateral ties with Cuba after having assumed responsibility for the Mexican mission in Havana in February. Tello, who is an economist and a professor with a comprehensive professional vitae, revealed he had already attended several economic and technical-scientific cooperation meetings in the few weeks he has been in Cuba. Regarding reciprocal assistance, he said a mission from the Mexican Science and Technology Council had recently visited Cuba and signed an agreement with the State Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation Committee to increase scientific ties. According to this agreement, oceanographers, engineers, and other specialists have agreed to carry out joint studies and to help each other in specific projects. Furthermore, the ambassador added, active exchanges between the universities of the two countries are continuing and a history seminar for specialists was held just a few days ago. To give one example of developing relations in the field of education, Tello noted that a group from the clinic school, which travels to different parts of the world, recently visited Cuba to exchange student experiences. Asked about Mexico's response to Cuba's policy on opening to foreign investments, Tello said this area is very promising, and he revealed there are agreements to set up joint ventures to produce cement and glass. We are currently negotiating two very important agreements, the ambassador stressed. One is a comprehensive agreement on telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and other communications systems which could amount to more than $1 billion. [PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2023 GMT on 1 April transmits a similar report prefaced with a parenthetical note asking PRENSA LATINA offices to "substitute" the new article for the one printed here. The new report is identical to the first, with two changes. The first is a rewording of this paragraph so that it reads: "We are currently negotiating an agreement on telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and other matters related to this field, the value of which could exceed $1 billion, the ambassador said." In addition, the following paragraph has been deleted and the item continues with paragraph 11.] The other is the signing of a letter of intent between the Cuban Government and Mexpetrol to refine approximately 60,000 barrels of crude oil at the Cienfuegos refinery, located in the country's central region, as well as to manufacture byproducts that will be sold in the domestic and international markets. In terms of tourism -- an industry in which the Mexicans are giving advice to the Cubans -- Mexico and Cuba have signed agreements to operate hotels such as the Tuxpan, Granma, and the Old Man and the Sea. Likewise, Carlos Tello explained that Cuba provides medical, biotechnology, and social security assistance to Mexico. Also, both nations continue to exchange experiences, expertise, and specialists in agriculture, fisheries, and sugar production, which has resulted in mutual benefits. The diplomat expressed regret over the current level of trade, which totalled approximately $124 million in 1992, and he indicated that there are obstacles, like Cuba's debt with Mexico and the shortage of freely convertible currency. The fall of Eastern Europe's socialist bloc was a hard blow to the Cuban economy because 85 percent of the island's trade was conducted with this region, a region from which it also imported 90 percent of its crude oil. Tello stressed that when these difficulties are overcome, trade between the two countries will increase several times over.
