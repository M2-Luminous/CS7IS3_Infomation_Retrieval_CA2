Yatom said yesterday. Ramallah was under curfew for the second day, as reinforced IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units pressed to find more clues. Sources said it is now almost certain that the attackers knew who they were ambushing. Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] published a leaflet contending the attack was made possible through "a Hamas spy who infiltrated the GSS." The leaflet identifies the spy as A.A.H. "A spy is the wrong term, but it is likely that a regular informant executed the attack, assisted by at least two others," one military source said. [passage omitted]
