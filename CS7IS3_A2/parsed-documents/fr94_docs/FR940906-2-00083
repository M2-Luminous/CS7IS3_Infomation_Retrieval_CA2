FR940906-2-00083 FR940906-2-00067 [Docket No. 50&hyph;424] Georgia Power Company, et al.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;68 issued to Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 1, located in Burke County, Georgia. The proposed amendment would eliminate article 2.C(6) and the associated attachment 1 of the license. Article 2.C(6) references attachment 1 which lists special diesel generator (DG) maintenance and surveillance requirements. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The change to the license will delete license conditions related to DG component inspections that were imposed based on the recommendations in NUREG&hyph;1216. Therefore, the detailed steps of preventive maintenance surveillance programs will become subject to the same degree of NRC staff review and approval as for DGs provided by other manufacturers. However, future revisions of the maintenance surveillance program are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. The owners group in conjunction with the DG manufacturer is developing a generic DG management program. The transition from the current program to the generic program will be accomplished under the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. The requirements imposed by attachment 1 to the license were in addition to the Technical Specifications surveillance and maintenance requirements for DGs in nuclear service. The requirements of attachment 1 were imposed due to the unresolved concerns about the reliability of TDI DGs that existed at the time of issuance of the VEGP Unit 1 license. Since that time the concerns have been resolved by substantial operational data and inspection results which have demonstrated that these DGs may be treated on a par with other DGs within the nuclear industry and subjected to the same standard regulations without the special requirements of NUREG&hyph;1216. The proposed change will result in continuing DG performance in accordance with NRC requirements for this function, and it is likely to result in improved availability. The current Technical Specification surveillance requirements will continue to assure that the DGs are proven at regular intervals to perform in accordance with NRC requirements. These license conditions have been technically justified on the basis of current reliability data and inspection results of operating TDI DGs throughout the last several years. The NRC staff has agreed with these conclusions as documented in the SER for the topical report. The current DG maintenance and surveillance program for the VEGP DGs is in agreement with the applicable portions of the surveillance and maintenance programs described in the topical report and with the requirements of the Technical Specifications. Any subsequent changes to the surveillance and maintenance requirements currently contained in attachment 1 to the license following the removal of the attachment from the Operating License will be made in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59. Based on the above considerations, GPC has concluded the following concerning 10 CFR 50.92. 1. The proposed change to the license does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the availability and reliability of the DGs will remain within the limits previously assumed in the safety analyses. 2. The proposed change to the license does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because it does not result in any physical changes to the plant or in its modes of operation and the DGs have been demonstrated to operate at a level of reliability that is consistent with that which was previously determined to be acceptable for this application. 3. The proposed deletion from the license does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the results of the operational data and inspection reports have demonstrated that the license conditions are not required to assure that the DGs will be maintained in a state of reliability consistent with that assumed for the safety analyses. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis in conjunction with its cover letter, and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
