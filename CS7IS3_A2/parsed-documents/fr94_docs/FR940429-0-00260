FR940429-0-00260 FR940429-0-00015 (7)(i) For purposes of this section, a student attending an institution for the first time is a student who_ (A) Has not previously attended at least one class at the institution; or (B) Received a refund of 100 percent of his or her tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under the institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the institution. (ii) A student remains a first-time student until the student either_ (A) Withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the institution after attending at least one class; or (B) Completes the period of enrollment for which he or she has been charged. (8) For purposes of this paragraph, ``the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains'' is determined_ (i) In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged into the number of weeks remaining in that period as of the student's withdrawal date; (ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged into the number of scheduled clock hours remaining to be completed by the student in that period as of the student's withdrawal date; and (iii) In the case of an educational program that consists predominantly of correspondence courses, by dividing the total number of lessons comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged into the number of lessons not submitted by the student. (d) Period of enrollment for which the student has been charged . (1) For purposes of this section, ``the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' means the actual period for which an institution charges a student, except that the minimum period must be_ (i) In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other academic terms, the semester, trimester, quarter or other academic term; or (ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit hours and does not use semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other academic terms, or an educational program that is measured in clock hours, the lesser of the length of the educational program or an academic year. (2) If an institution charges by different periods for different charges, the ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' for purposes of this section is the longest period for which the student is charged. The institution must include any charges assessed the student for the period of enrollment or any portion of that period of enrollment when calculating the refund. (e) Overpayments . (1) An institution shall determine whether a student has received an overpayment for noninstitutional costs for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged if_ (i) The student officially withdraws, drops out, is expelled, or takes an approved leave of absence on or after his or her first day of class of that period; and (ii) The student received Title IV, HEA program assistance other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program for that period. (2)(i) To determine if the student owes an overpayment, the institution shall subtract the noninstitutional costs that the student incurred for that portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from the amount of all assistance (other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program) that the institution disbursed to the student. (ii) Noninstitutional costs may include, but are not limited to, room and board for which the student does not contract with the institution, books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses. (f) Repayments to Title IV, HEA programs of institutional refunds and overpayments . (1)(i) An institution shall return a portion of the refund calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section to the Title IV, HEA programs if the student to whom the refund is owed received assistance under any Title IV, HEA program other than the FWS Program. (ii) The portion of the refund that an institution shall return to the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount of assistance that the student received under the Title IV, HEA programs other than under the FWS Program for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. (2) For purposes of this section, except for the calculation of a pro rata refund required under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section_ (i) An institutional refund means the amount paid for institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged minus the amount that the institution may retain under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section for the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that the student was actually enrolled at the institution; (ii) An institution may not include any unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment in determining the amount that the institution may retain for institutional charges. A scheduled cash payment is the amount of institutional charges that has not been paid by financial aid for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged, exclusive of_ (A) Any amount scheduled to be paid by Title IV, HEA program assistance that the student has been awarded that is payable to the student even though the student has withdrawn; (B) Late disbursements of loans made under the Federal Stafford, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in accordance with 34 CFR 682.207(d), and allowable late disbursements of unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and loans made under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program; and (C) Late disbursements of State student financial assistance, for which the student is still eligible in spite of having withdrawn, made in accordance with the applicable State's written late disbursement policies. The late disbursement must be made within 60 days after the student's date of withdrawal, as defined in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, or the institution must_ ( 1 ) Recalculate the refund in accordance with this section, including recalculating the student's unpaid charges in accordance with this paragraph without consideration of the State late disbursement amount; and ( 2 ) Return any additional refund amounts due as a result of the recalculation in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section; (iii) In determining the amount that the institution may retain for the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged during which the student was actually enrolled, an institution shall_ (A) Compute the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment by subtracting the amount paid by the student for that period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from the scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged; and (B) Subtract the unpaid amount of the scheduled cash payment from the amount that may be retained by the institution according to the institution's refund policy; and (iv) An institution shall return the total amount of Title IV, HEA program assistance (other than amounts received from the FWS Program) paid for institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged if the unpaid amount of the student's scheduled cash payment is greater than or equal to the amount that may be retained by the institution under the institution's refund policy. (3)(i) A student must repay to the institution or to the Title IV, HEA programs a portion of the overpayment as determined according to paragraph (e) of this section. The institution shall make every reasonable effort to contact the student and recover the overpayment in accordance with program regulations (34 CFR parts 673, 674, 675, 676, 690, and 691). (ii) The portion of the overpayment that the student or the institution (if the institution recovers the overpayment) shall return to the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount of assistance received under the Title IV, HEA programs other than the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged.
