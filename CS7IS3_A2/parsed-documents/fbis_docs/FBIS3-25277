He was kidnapped on Sunday, 13 February, at the environs Agoenyive. The president of the Republic expresses his indignation at this odious, gratuitous, and criminal act which he condemns vehemently. The head of state is asking the government to set up a commission of inquiry to identify, arrest, and bring to book those responsible for this crime. The president of the Republic expresses his condolences to the families of the victims. In the afternoon of Sunday, 13 February, four persons, including Gaston Edeh Aziandouvo who was going for a cold drink at LE CARMEN bar in the outskirts of Agoenyive, was allegedly approached by two individuals in military attire. These two individuals seized the vehicle in which the four persons were and drove them to an unknown destination. This morning, 14 February, the National Gendarmerie continued its investigations to find the lost persons and their kidnappers, but I was informed this afternoon that three of the four persons, including Mr. Aziandouvo, were found dead and burned in their vehicle in the environs of Agoenyive. The fourth person fled. The government vigorously condemns these acts of violence that are liable to jeopardize the peaceful climate that is indispensable for the smooth running of the electoral process that will lead to putting in place the democratic institutions. The government will do all in its power to look for those responsible for these criminal acts. They have refused to use democratic means in achieving power and resorted to terror to satisfy their political ambitions. The government will adopt every measure to preserve public order, security of persons and goods before, during, and after the proclamation of the results of the second round of the legislative elections. The security forces will look out for those responsible for the criminal acts. All those who threaten such acts contrary to peaceful, brotherly, and tolerant democracy to which all the Togolese people aspire; these antidemocratic citizens will be hunted down and brought to justice.
