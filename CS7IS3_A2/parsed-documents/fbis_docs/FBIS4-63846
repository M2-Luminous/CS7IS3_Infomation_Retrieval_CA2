Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin Begins Official Visit to PRC 26 May"] [Text] Sino-Russian trade and economic cooperation in 1992-1993 was fairly dynamic. Last year bilateral trade rose 30 percent to total $7.7 billion. China was Russia's number two trading partner after the FRG. At the same time our country's position is more modest in the Chinese "league table" -- it comes seventh after Japan, Hong Kong, the United States, the FRG, Taiwan, and South Korea. During a recent visit to the PRC by a Russian State Duma delegation led by Ivan Rybkin it was noted that by no means full use is being made of the potential for broadening bilateral ties. The Russian market is still experiencing shortages of food and consumer goods, creating the preconditions for increased imports from China, particularly to parts of Siberia and the Far East. At the same time there is potential for increasing exports of Russian machinebuilding output to China (it now accounts for around 35 percent of all our exports to the PRC). Early in 1994 Sino-Russian trade was seen to decline. In the first quarter it dropped 44 percent compared with the same period last year. Specialists think that the reason for the slump was that trade predominantly in the form of barter has exhausted its potential. A move to more modern forms of economic production cooperation is what is needed, with mutual capital investment and the creation of joint enterprises. At the moment inadequate use is being made of this potential and Russia is, moreover, clearly lagging behind in this field. In 1992 300 Chinese missions and joint enterprises were registered in our country while in 1993 the figure was around 500. In China there are just over 400 enterprises involving Russian capital. Their contribution ($200 million) to the Chinese economy as part of overall foreign investment (last year credit and investment agreements were signed worth $110 billion) is still a drop in the ocean. Legal, organizational, and financial support from the state is needed to change the situation along with the development of a market infrastructure -- a transport network, banking system, etc. State intervention is needed to restore equivalent commodity exchange and monitor the quality of the output supplied and contract deadlines. These matters are expected to be discussed during Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to China. The second important aspect of the Russian prime minister's trip is to study the experience of Chinese reform. Over the last 14 years China's economy has developed extremely dynamically. In 1992-1993 the PRC was the world leader in terms of the pace of economic growth (over 13 percent a year). In 1993 industrial production rose 21.4 percent, while investment in fixed capital was up 50.6 percent. Industrial production is rising fastest in the private sector and at enterprises involving foreign capital (64.6 percent) as well as at enterprises in collective ownership (39.8 percent). The sphere of market relations in China is gradually expanding. The proportion of planned output in total industrial production has been seen to drop this year to 5 percent, while goods sold at state prices account for only around 10 percent of retail trade. The Chinese securities market is developing successfully. Stock exchanges are operating in Shanghai and the Shenzhen special economic zone. Around 13,000 joint-stock and shared enterprises of various types have been registered. Shares in 124 companies are quoted on the local stock market and shares in nine on foreign exchanges. In 1994 there are plans to issue shares worth 5.5 million yuan (one U.S. dollar is equivalent to approximately 8.5 yuan). And 22 enterprises will be authorized to sell shares abroad. The liberalization of foreign economic activity is continuing. New spheres of investment opened up for foreign businessmen in 1993-1994 -- domestic trade, highway, railroad, and airfield construction, legal services, insurance, consultancy, auditing, etc. There are 93 banks and financial companies based on foreign capital at work in China. Duties on several thousand commodity groups have been considerably lowered in preparation for joining GATT. Experiments have begun to transform state enterprises into joint-stock companies. The state's share of their capital will gradually decline. It is planned that only purely defense enterprises will remain in state ownership in five or seven years. China has decided to renounce voucher privatization. A new tax system has been introduced as of 1 January 1994. The former turnover taxes have been replaced by value-added tax (at a rate of 17 percent -- 13 percent for some commodities) and excise duties. A single profits tax has been established for all enterprises regardless of their form of ownership (33 percent). Income tax rates paid by individuals have been unified. Some new taxes have been introduced -- on real estate, inheritance, and the use of natural resources. There have been changes in the system of tax payments into budgets of various levels. The center's share of total consolidated budget income will rise to 60 percent within five years (now 38 percent). Reform of the banking system has begun. The People's Bank of China will be turned into a central bank responsible for maintaining the stability of the national currency and monitoring inflation. Three of the four specialized banks are being commercialized and the functions of providing preferential credit transferred to three new state banks specially set up for this purpose. Joint-stock commercial banks will be extensively developed. As of 1 January 1994 the practice has been introduced whereby export enterprises have to sell all their hard-currency revenue to authorized banks. A single market rate has been fixed for the yuan. The circulation of foreign currency is banned in the country. Import enterprises buy currency from the banks at the market rate. Despite what are by and large positive results of economic reform, certain alarming symptoms have emerged in China too. The country's economy is threatened with "overheating" due to excessive investment and credit, which is to a considerable extent covered by increasing the money supply. Inflation has increased. Whereas in 1993 prices rose 13 percent, in the first quarter of this year they are up 20 percent. Over 80 percent of state enterprises are overtly or covertly lossmaking, which has brought about a drastic increase in defaults on payment. The high and uneven pace of industrial growth across various sectors has created new imbalances in the national economy. China's experience in combating these negative phenomena -- in a country where there is still tight state regulation -- could be extremely useful to Russian specialists. In particular, Chinese methods of giving support to the agro-industrial complex deserve attention. The production of highly important agricultural produce is lossmaking here and is backed with income from rural industrial and service enterprises. There are over 20 million of these enterprises. The social orientation of Chinese reforms is an extremely important aspect. Throughout the period of economic transformations increases in citizens' real income and improvements in housing conditions, medical services, and the social insurance system have been recorded. All this ensures extensive support among the population for the reform course.
