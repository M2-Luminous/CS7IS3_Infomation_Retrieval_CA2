Dzhindoyan and A.Ye. Naydeenov, Scientific Research Institute of Microbiology, Ministry of Defense, Kirov; UDC 613.636:616-078] [Abstract] A common approach to safety in the handling of pathogenic microorganisms in microbiological laboratories is based on the probability of biological effects resulting from exposure to a microorganism or its metabolites. This approach also entails definition of socially acceptable risk vis-a-vis a defined endpoint, e.g., death. The suggestion is made that safety be calculated in terms of probability that protective barriers might be overcome by the pathogen per hour of work and be released into the working area. For microbiology laboratories concerned with pathogens the recommendation is made that the acceptable probability for such an event be set at 10[.sup]-8[/] h[.sup]-1[/].
