Shymanskiy; place and date not given: "I Am Ambassador; What Can I Do?"] [Excerpt] [Shymanskiy] Well, Vitaliy Vladimirovich, what can you tell me about your work at the embassy? [Kurashyk] Our embassy is staffed by only three diplomats, so we are swamped with work. In addition, everything is complicated and our bilateral relations are not so cloudless. My situation, however, is rather secure because I am personally acquainted with all the leaders of Ukraine. My previous work as Crimean prime minister has served me well. Hence, if I need a high-level meeting I have no problems getting one. [Shymanskiy] Are there many Belarusians residing in Ukraine? [Kurashyk] Some 450,000. This is not a small number. Approximately 52,000 Belarusians live in the Crimea, where the situation is rather troubled. Our countrymen turn to our embassy with various problems such as, for example, issuing visas, helping with inheritance issues, and so on. Of course, we do not turn their requests down and try to conscientiously perform all consular duties. [Shymanskiy] Ukraine is experiencing a rather tense social- political situation. How would you characterize it? [Kurashyk] The legislative elections are over, the corps of deputies has been formed and has begun work. The Republic is looking forward to the presidential elections. However, this implies harsh political battles. Well, the same refers to Belarus, which is also electing a president. Ukraine has its own specific features. It is more heterogeneous than Belarus. Its west differs from its south in political sentiments and administrative organization. In addition, it has the Crimea, which has its own president. All this, along with a deep economic crisis, intensifies the tension. [Shymanskiy] Belarusian-Ukrainian relations have traditionally been strong, friendly, and diverse. We have always been proud of this. Neighbors, brothers.... What about current relations? [Kurashyk] Currently, some politicians want to disintegrate our brotherly relations. Let us take the economy, for example. Our Belarusian economy is in many aspects closely connected with the Ukrainian economy. We became independent states (of course, this is a positive issue) but our economic contacts were severed and this inflicted a lot of difficulties and problems on us. Of all CIS states, Belarus remained as virtually the only state with which Ukraine could cooperate on a partnership basis. What about our current foreign trade contacts? They do not meet our demands. I can provide only two figures for you. Last year, Belarus fulfilled only 41.7 percent of its deliveries to Ukraine; Ukraine -- 44 percent. [Shymanskiy] Let us be sincere: Are you willing to admit that the two states simply do not want to cooperate with one another? [Kurashyk] Why? We simply cannot exist without one another. We have signed some 20 intergovernmental agreements. This is a considerable number. How are they being implemented? To my regret, not properly. Our mutual deliveries do not meet the demands of both Belarus and Ukraine. [Shymanskiy] So, what is the problem? [Kurashyk] I will provide you with only some of the arguments. The mechanism of holding control over the implementation of these agreements has not been worked out properly. Both sides are responsible for this situation. In addition, frequent changes in the Ukrainian leadership also blocked the implementation of our pacts. During the past three years, there have been four prime ministers in Ukraine. When a prime minister quits, his entire team also quits. When I meet with a minister and remind him that this or that agreement is not being implemented, it often happens that he knows nothing at all about this issue. It is as if he does not have to implement the decisions adopted before him. However, the point of discussion is bilateral agreements, the implementation of which is not a prime minister's private business but an important part of state economic policy. [Shymanskiy] Well, let us assume that frequent changes of leaders is a domestic matter of Ukraine. However, can both states implement what they have already agreed upon? [Kurashyk] In my opinion, we should establish -- both in Ukraine and Belarus -- a sort of coordinating center to deal with our trade and economic relations. In fact, we currently lack an organization which is responsible for implementing these agreements. Each ministry is responsible for its own narrow interests. Even statistical data issued by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Customs Committee are completely different. Can this continue on this way? Ukraine has already adopted a decision to establish its own trading house in Minsk. Belarus should follow this example. Belarusian and Ukrainian enterprises can resolve many issues regarding their mutual deliveries. In fact, they will resolve these issues on the condition that they have efficient managers. This is good because you should not stand idly by and wait until politicians make a deal. [Shymanskiy] This opinion is expressed not only by you, as Belarusian ambassador to Ukraine, but also by our Belarusian managers. This is the voice of one crying out in the wilderness. How long will this last? Can our embassy do anything? [Kurashyk] We can cry as long as we wish, however, no one will resolve issues for us. We should join our forces and seek real ways of stabilizing our bilateral trade and economic relations. What does our embassy do in this regard? I am sincere: We could not handle these issues before because we lacked experts. However, our embassy has now hired Petr Pyasetskiy as our trade and economic adviser. He is an efficient and enterprising person, who well understands both the system of production and economics. So, appropriate work is now under way. We chose a large group of Belarusian enterprises which are leaders in their sectors and have a high export potential. They have to calculate mutual deliveries in karbovanetses and Belarusian rubles. They have already drafted an agreement on this issue. We have high hopes that this agreement will soon be signed. They Cut the Branch on Which They Sat [Shymanskiy] I know that the Belarusian Scientific-Industrial Association and the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs do a lot in this direction. How do you assess their efforts? [Kurashyk] You properly defined their work as efforts. Of course, I approve of their work and try to support those who can do something in this regard. First of all, I am speaking about Belarusian and Ukrainian managers of enterprises. They do everything possible to draw our economies closer. [Shymanskiy] This is a very difficult thing to do because even the leaders of our states cannot solve this issue properly. What can managers do? [Kurashyk] Nevertheless, they have managed to do something. Recently, Belarusian and Ukrainian industrialists met in Kiev and discussed their business relations. I am referring to direct economic relations between Belarusian and Ukrainian enterprises. They decided to draft a program on mutual cooperation to establish joint projects and develop new types of competitive products... As far as I know, interesting proposals will be submitted to our governments. [Shymanskiy] Are Belarusian and Ukrainian politicians keeping themselves for themselves? Who listens to them? [Kurashyk] Excuse me, but it is no fault of theirs if no one listens to them. Let those people who -- due to their official positions -- have to listen and react to them. I am holding out hope that the Belarusian and Ukrainian Governments -- to which participants in this meeting addressed their proposals -- will behave in this way. Does our Ambassador Have To Wait Long in Ukrainian President's Admission Room? [Shymanskiy] It seems to me that there are other arguments negatively affecting our bilateral relations. They are of a political nature. [Kurashyk] The point is that neither the Belarusian nor the Ukrainian Government has the patience to tolerate some political developments. For example, I can hear some people in Ukraine criticizing Belarusian-Russian economic relations, in particular, their intention to unite in a single ruble zone. [Shymanskiy] Why should Belarus coordinate its policy with Ukraine? It is a sovereign state... [Kurashyk] You are right. Belarus can choose its own political and economic track in line with the wishes of its people, legislature, and government. Next. Not all people realize why Belarus decided to become a nonnuclear state. I have to explain this often, primarily to foreign diplomats accredited in Kiev. I am not boasting but they often meet me and talk about Belarusian developments. As to the question of our nonnuclear status, I explain to them that one Chernobyl -- the consequences of which will have to be dealt with for several decades -- was quite enough for Belarus. In fact, we are alone in implementing the Chernobyl cleanup program. Who would even think about nuclear weapons in such a situation? [Shymanskiy] Are you often received by President Kravchuk? How long do you usually have to wait to be received by the president? [Kurashyk] Why should I often visit the president? We should not bother the president with various and sundry trifles. I come to him only on urgent occasions to discuss important state matters. In addition, there are no complications with being received in the presidential office. I have never waited longer than 10 minutes. In my opinion, the point is not in my personality but in the president's attitude toward our Republic and its people. [passage omitted]
