On 28 January, a discussion was held at the bureau of Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, with all the officials dealing with the autonomy issue. The discussion was attended by Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff; Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, head of the Intelligence Branch; Maj. Gen. Shalom Hagay, head of the Logistics Branch; the commanders of the Southern and Central Commands; Israel Police officials; the head of the Shin Bet; and others. The discussion mainly dealt with the implications of the IDF redeployment, the autonomy, and the evacuation of Gaza and Jericho. At the discussion, it became apparent that the Finance Ministry will give the IDF only 250 million shekels for the evacuation and another 100 million for the protection of the Jewish settlements, in addition to the IDF's annual budget. According to a senior IDF source, the agreement was made between the Finance Ministry and the defense establishment, without the IDF's knowledge, and, according the agreement, the defense establishment will not ask for additional funds. [passage omitted] It has been learned that the IDF claims that the overall budget required for the evacuation of the IDF from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and its subsequent redeployment is over 550 million shekels. [passage omitted] It has further been learned that the IDF will insist on receiving additional funds for the redeployment beyond the 250 million shekels allocated. The prime minister said that he understands the situation and that he will try to handle the matter. Speaking at a meeting over the weekend -- held at Bet Hahayal in Tel Aviv, and attended by Prime Minister Rabin, Chief of Staff Baraq, and all the IDF reserves officers ranking from brigadier general up to former chiefs of staff -- Gen. Uri Sagi, head of the Intelligence Branch, said that an all-out war with the Arab countries is not expected in 1994, and that he expects the political process to continue. Gen. Sagi also referred to the remarks made last week by Maj. Gen. 'Uzi Dayan, according to which a limited war is to be expected if the talks collapse. Sagi said that there are two evaluations. Dayan represented the Planning Branch's stand (an operational evaluation) and, according to the Intelligence Branch estimate, no war is expected in 1994. This was the first time the IDF presented the senior reserves officers with its plans, debates, and political evaluation. [passage omitted]
