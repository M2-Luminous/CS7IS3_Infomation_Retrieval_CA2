FR940419-2-00168 FR940419-2-00087 II. EPA Objectives for Permittees A. Overview Permittees with CSSs that have CSOs should immediately undertake a process to accurately characterize their sewer systems, to demonstrate implementation of the nine minimum controls, and to develop a long-term CSO control plan. B. Implementation of the Nine Minimum Controls Permittees with CSOs should submit appropriate documentation demonstrating implementation of the nine minimum controls, including any proposed schedules for completing minor construction activities. The nine minimum controls are: 1. Proper operation and regular maintenance programs for the sewer system and the CSOs; 2. Maximum use of the collection system for storage; 3. Review and modification of pretreatment requirements to assure CSO impacts are minimized; 4. Maximization of flow to the POTW for treatment; 5. Prohibition of CSOs during dry weather; 6. Control of solid and floatable materials in CSOs; 7. Pollution prevention; 8. Public notification to ensure that the public receives adequate notification of CSO occurrences and CSO impacts; and 9. Monitoring to effectively characterize CSO impacts and the efficacy of CSO controls. Selection and implementation of actual control measures should be based on site-specific considerations including the specific CSS's characteristics discussed under the sewer system characterization and monitoring portions of this Policy. Documentation of the nine minimum controls may include operation and maintenance plans, revised sewer use ordinances for industrial users, sewer system inspection reports, infiltration/inflow studies, pollution prevention programs, public notification plans, and facility plans for maximizing the capacities of the existing collection, storage and treatment systems, as well as contracts and schedules for minor construction programs for improving the existing system's operation. The permittee should also submit any information or data on the degree to which the nine minimum controls achieve compliance with water quality standards. These data and information should include results made available through monitoring and modeling activities done in conjunction with the development of the long-term CSO control plan described in this Policy. This documentation should be submitted as soon as practicable, but no later than two years after the requirement to submit such documentation is included in an NPDES permit or other enforceable mechanism. Implementation of the nine minimum controls with appropriate documentation should be completed as soon as practicable but no later than January 1, 1997. These dates should be included in an appropriate enforceable mechanism. Because the CWA requires immediate compliance with technology-based controls (section 301(b)), which on a Best Professional Judgment basis should include the nine minimum controls, a compliance schedule for implementing the nine minimum controls, if necessary, should be included in an appropriate enforceable mechanism. C. Long-Term CSO Control Plan Permittees with CSOs are responsible for developing and implementing long-term CSO control plans that will ultimately result in compliance with the requirements of the CWA. The long-term plans should consider the site-specific nature of CSOs and evaluate the cost effectiveness of a range of control options/strategies. The development of the long-term CSO control plan and its subsequent implementation should also be coordinated with the NPDES authority and the State authority responsible for reviewing and revising the State's WQS. The selected controls should be designed to allow cost effective expansion or cost effective retrofitting if additional controls are subsequently determined to be necessary to meet WQS, including existing and designated uses.
