FR941027-2-00076 FR941027-2-00042 Division of Epidemiology and Oral Disease Prevention (HNP5) Serves as the Federal focus for research in the fields of orofacial epidemiology and disease prevention. (1) Plans, develops, directs, and performs epidemiologic investigations of oral and maxillofacial health and diseases, as well as oral manifestations of systemic disorders; (2) identifies biological, behavioral, social, environmental, and material risk factors for orofacial diseases and conditions; (3) identifies and tests molecular and cellular markers, clinical indices, imaging techniques, behavioral and social factors, environmental indicators, and other approaches for assessing the presence and course of orofacial disorders, treatment compliance and outcome, and the onset of systemic diseases via in vitro, animal model, and human population studies; (4) performs research in the areas of diseases diagnosis, etiology, prognosis, and treatment; prevention and health promotion; delivery of care; utilization of services; risk-benefit assessment; and decision systems; (5) develops current estimates for, and monitors trends in, levels and distribution of orofacial health status and diseases; (6) compiles, maintains, and analyzes databases, disease registries, and data banks on orofacial health status in the U.S. general population and particular subpopulations; (7) facilitates the diffusion, dissemination, and transfer of knowledge related to oral disease prevention and health promotion, and evaluates that process in terms of such factors as feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and long-term adoption of intervention strategies for improving oral health practices, utilization of dental services, and oral health status; (8) fosters the transmission of scientific knowledge to the research, public, and practitioner communities; (9) identifies emerging orofacial health problems and issues in populations, evaluates the sources and implications of trends in the orofacial health status of populations, and uses results to help develop research priorities for the division and Institute; (10) offers training programs related to the mission of the division; (11) provides technical assistance to other NIDR program components, NIH, PHS, DHHS, and Federal and non-Federal agencies, and professional groups; (12) prepares analyses and reports to assist Institute staff and advisory groups in carrying out their responsibilities; (13) consults with health organizations and professional associations in identifying research needs and developing programs to meet them; and (14) provides advice on the program and science in general to the Institute Director.
