Shevardnadze warned against complacency, however. In his words, there have been certain groups behind Gamsakhurdia which "will try again to set up a pro-fascist organization which will oppose the existing authorities." Shevardnadze believes that it was up to Gamsakhurdia's family where to bury him. "We will agree to anything," he said. He called for an international investigation of Gamsakhurdia's death "to prevent any rumors."
