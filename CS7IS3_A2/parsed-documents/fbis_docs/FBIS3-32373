According to de Leon, the democratic process in Guatemala is going through a period of great consolidation and stipulated that he has not been requested to remove the defense minister, whom he considers to be one of his most trusted allies. Local radio stations, citing confidential sources, reported that a group of military officers "dissatisfied with Enriquez' management style had called for his dismissal or there would be a coup during the next few days." The radio reports contrast sharply with the calm in the streets adjacent from the presidential palace and the government house where security measures remain normal.
