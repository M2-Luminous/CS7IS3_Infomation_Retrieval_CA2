There was a young Hong Kong capitalist, 30-some years old, who was in the textile-garment business, primarily making blue jeans. Sorry I cannot recall his name now; I only remember people used to call him "trousers king." He was from Guangdong's Huizhou. During the Cultural Revolution, he was among the Red Guard's "leisure faction," and he fled to Hong Kong illegally. At first he worked in a small garment factory, and after finishing his own work, he would volunteer to help the boss with odd jobs. The boss liked him and promoted him to foreman and later assistant plant manager to help run the business. During the oil crisis in 1977, Hong Kong was in an economic slump. The boss did not want to continue the business and sold it to him at a very low price. Then he began to receive orders from the United States and got his quotas, and that was how he got started. When I visited him, he had already set up a branch company in the United States. He had more than a dozen branch factories in Hong Kong, Africa, and the mainland. He not only had Hong Kong quotas but also mainland quotas and was doing $200 million in business a year. This was a typical example of how Hong Kong people took advantage of every opportunity. This young man was a vegetarian; he never married; he worked hard and was an honest man. He moved his brothers from Guangdong to Hong Kong and let them manage his companies. When Tan [word omitted] yun and I toured his factory, he laid out everything and talked for more than an hour about how he got started by utilizing Mao Zedong's dialectics to run his business. He changed the quotations from Mao Zedong slightly and turned them into his own ideologies, terms, and rules in educating his workers. Slogans were posted everywhere on the walls of his factory. He told me that he had gotten started on the quotations from Mao Zedong. He did not appear to be insincere; he probably did apply the principle of dialectics to market operations. I asked him, "How many are there in Hong Kong who are just like you?" He said, "I am not the only one." I was moved. There was a saying, "a worm in the mainland turns into a dragon in Hong Kong." It vividly showed that the mainland system restricted human development as well as economic development. Let's tell another story of how a "worm turned into a dragon." Liu Yongling [0491 3057 7881] went to Hong Kong in the 1960's, and when he first arrived, he had only $20 on him. I visited him when I was working in Hong Kong. By then, his house was no smaller than Pao Yu-kang's [0545 3768 0474] summer home. He was working with Nanjing's No. 8 Machine Tool Factory and Suzhou's Changfeng Machinery Factory to produce plastic molding machines. At that time, the mainland's plastics industry was in its infancy, and there was tremendous demand for plastic molding machines. His method was to process imported materials; he imported spare parts and components and made large molding pieces in the Chinese factories and then complete the assembly work. In fact, based on the amount of work performed to complete each machine, more than 70 percent of the processing work was done in the mainland; basically, they were mainland-made products. But according to Chinese policies at that time, processed imported materials were not counted as Chinese-made, and basically they had to be sold abroad. Liu Yongling took advantage of that loophole and used the so-called "taking delivery of a foreign-sale product on the mainland" approach to sell those machines on the mainland. That was how he got started. Subsequently, he set up a processing plant in Shataukok's tax-free zone and became very successful. His company was appraised to be worth more than his original investment. He then mortgaged his assets and took out a loan from a Hong Kong bank to open a 100,000 sq meter factory in Shenzhen's Shekou. I cut the ribbon for his new factory when it opened in 1989. He told me then he intended to hire 10,000 workers. He already had 3,000 people, including several hundred technical personnel who had graduated from various Chinese universities. He no longer limited himself to making molding machines but was also producing some mechanical and electronics products. He had invited the presidents and vice presidents of Beijing University, Qinghua, Fudan, Shanghai's Jiaotung University, and Nanjing University to attend the opening ceremony. He told me that he had signed contracts with those five famous universities to do scientific research and development work. I thought that was indeed farsighted. Giving priority to scientific and technological development meant that success would be no accident. He had gathered the technological and scientific talents of several hundred university graduates and was combining that with the scientific and technological strength of five famous universities. His future development will be even greater. He probably was the first in Hong Kong to take that approach. He also has a unique way of thinking. He said he did not support communism, but he supported the current CPC leadership. China's reform and opening up once again brought the Hong Kong people's spirit of seizing every available opportunity into full play. China was a main target of Hong Kong investments. Prior to 1990, Hong Kong had accounted for more than 60 percent of all investments made by foreign nations and regions. Today, although there are substantial Taiwanese and foreign investments, the percentage of Hong Kong investments remains high. Today, not only small and medium-sized businesses are investing in the mainland, but some of the biggest names such as Li Ka-Hsing and Wu Kuang-cheng [0702 0342 2973], Pao Yu-Kang's son-in-law, are also doing business there. No doubt they will be very successful. We can say that Hong Kong has not failed to seize every political and economic development opportunity the world and Southeast Asia have to offer; it has made timely development every time. Hong Kong has become a free, open, diversified market. Despite its tiny size, it has shown tremendous capacity. Today, Hong Kong businessmen and Hong Kong money are showing up all over the world. To different extents the continents have become Hong Kong's market and business arena. Hong Kong is indeed a miracle to be proud of. [End of Installment No. 83] [27 Jul 93 p 2] [Text] The Unique Hong Kong Culture (Part 1 of 2): Hong Kong People's Real Estate Dealings Are Equal to Yokohama's; Mainland Advised To Separate Ownership Rights From Use Rights Gu Mu [4474 2606], a State Council member, and I visited Japan in 1978. Yokohama left a deep impression. Of Japan's eight major cities, Yokohama was the only self-sufficient one; the Japanese central government had to subsidized the others. When we toured the city, the mayor made a special point of telling us their experience, and I was very interested and asked some detailed questions. Gu Mu teased me, telling the mayor, "Mr Xu is very interested in your experience because he hopes to apply that in Jiangsu." The reason Yokohama was self-sufficient was because the city government operated many businesses, especially the real estate business. To build the grounds for the World's Fair, they leveled mountains and filled the sea to create land. Must of the funds came from bank loans. They signed one contract with the banks and took out loans in installments. At that time, I could not understand why they turned to bank loans and how they took out loans in installments. I asked the mayor. He explained that the first loan installment was for development. After the preliminary development, the project was turned over to private parties for further development. The businesses that took over the project had to pay a percentage in deposit, and the city government used that money to start another project and used the second and third loan installments to make interest payments. The mayor said that not only were they reclaiming land from the sea but the flattened hillsides also provided new land for development. The land development projects were undertaken by city-owned companies. The city government used revenues generated by these city-owned companies to supplement tax revenue shortfalls and other municipal expenses, and therefore they did not need central government subsidies. That was the first time I learned about how real estate development could be so profitable. When I began working in Hong Kong, I felt that Hong Kong people's approach to the real estate business was no less brilliant. Take the example of Huang Jin-hui [7806 6930 6540], son-in-law of former KMT general and united front target Wang Yao-Wu [3769 5069 2976], who developed a piece of land in the New Territories and built a village there. Fei Yimin [6316 1744 3046], a good friend of Huang, persuaded me to take part in the ribbon-cutting ceremony. I agreed. Fei Yimin's son was manager of Huang's company. On the day of the opening ceremony, he gave me a ride, and in the car, he told me about how they did business. Huang Jin-hui had bought a piece of land in the New Territories for more than HK$100 million. After the land was developed, they began to offer pre-sales, meaning that even before they began building the houses -- when they only had the drawings on paper, they would sell those houses; the buyers only made a down payment. In the village to be built by Huang Jin-hui, the buyers paid 30 percent down. With those deposits, he had the money to build the houses and could operate without borrowing money from the bank. Installment payments allowed more people to afford their own homes, and it made it easier for the sellers to sell homes. This kind of "buy now pay later" policy which increased the consumers' purchasing power and accelerated the circulation of real estate funds really impressed me. I reported to Zhao Ziyang and Li Xiannian on this approach. I said, Hong Kong's real estate industry has become one of the Hong Kong economy's mainstay industries. Its real estate industry to a large part owes its development to the separation of ownership rights and use-rights. Ownership right to the land belongs to the Hong Kong government, but use-right can be bought and sold, and a time limit is put on the use-right -- 99 years for Hong Kong island and 75 years for the New Territories. I suggested that the mainland also adopt the method to develop the real estate industry -- ownership right should go to the state and should be publicly-owned, so as not to compromise the public ownership system, and use-right should be privately owned. They did not respond at the time, but they probably paid some attention. With respect to the use of bank funds and social funds, Hong Kong people are very smart. This was obvious in the way the Hong Kong businessmen invested in hotel constructions in the mainland. When they built hotels, they utilized little of their own funds, but they were very profitable. This was because they mainly used bank funds, and at first, their loans were guaranteed by Bank of China. From the selection of hotel sites to the design, construction, installation, finishing of the interior, and actual operations, everything was managed by the Hong Kong businessmen. Often they were able to recoup their investment, and even made a profit, in material and equipment purchases and in interior installations alone. At first I did not understand the arrangement where the Chinese side would provide the land and the Hong Kong side would control the stock and the operation but let the Chinese take over the hotels in 15 or 20 years. It was later that I came to understand that by the time the hotels were turned over to the Chinese, the Hong Kong businessmen would have earned 15-20 years' worth of profit already. (Installment No. 84) [28 Jul 93 p 2] [Text] The Unique Hong Kong Culture Hong Kong is an open society. Information travels fast and business competition is intense, and these allow the Hong Kong people to quickly adapt to and utilize the latest methods of modern market and enterprise management and administration. They make continuous improvements and changes with each passing day. In 1986, a Hong Kong entrepreneur introduced me to the investment concept of mutual funds. Back then, Hong Kong did not have many mutual funds, but within a few years, they became very popular. Mutual funds of all types flourished like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Hong Kong people accept and utilize modern, advanced tools and management methods quickly and effectively. The driving force behind that ability is Hong Kong's unique cultural pattern (and that itself is also a part of Hong Kong's own culture.) This is a main reason behind Hong Kong's rapid rise to becoming a great international metropolis. We should begin with the educational background of Hong Kong's development. Hong Kong's education system, from kindergarten to university, emphasizes English. English is the first language of the upper-middle class. Government documents and company and institutional correspondence are primarily in English. It is this language foundation that enables Hong Kong people to go everywhere in the world to do business without having to rely on translators. Businessmen from all over the world who come to make connections and do business in Hong Kong find it extra convenient because they speak the same language. Hong Kong's lower-middle class primarily speaks Cantonese, but Hong Kong's Cantonese is different from that spoken in Guangzhou. Hong Kong's language contains a lot of English terms which have been turned into a sort of colloquialism for the common people. For example, they call street cars, "bashi" ("bus"); a ball, "bo" instead of "qiao"; and hired cars, "dishi" ("taxi".) Some people say that Hong Kong culture is neither Eastern nor Western, Chinese nor English. They think that this is backward. I disagree. I find Hong Kong's culture a good mix of Chinese and foreign cultures; it has its progressive side. We cannot judge it by its inability to carry forward and to absorb our intrinsic culture; we should also look at the development side. Hong Kong's language and culture give it a definite edge and facilitate international exchange and rapid absorption of advanced experiences. With the exception of Singapore, no other major Far Eastern cities, including Tokyo, Shanghai, Taipei, and Soeul, are equipped or ready to replace Hong Kong in this respect in the near or even not-so-near future. Hong Kong indeed owes it all to the "English." A Proposal To Develop the Hainan Special Zone (Part 1 of 2): Li Ka-Shing Expresses Interest In Investing in Hainan; He Wants To Make Me Consultant and Li Pengfei Chairman of the Board Applying the Hong Kong experience to develop the Hainan Development Zone was an idea I suggested to Deng Xiaoping in a letter. Around 1986, at a private meeting with Li Ka-shing, we talked about constructions in Hainan Island. Li himself said that he was interested in investing there. He said, "I can make a one-time investment of HK$100 million to develop Hainan. But I have one condition: Either you go to Hainan and take up leadership position there -- perhaps as a concurrent position, or I can set up a company and you act as chairman of the board." When I first arrived in Hong Kong, Li Ka-shing had indicated that he had no interest in investing in the mainland. He had been complaining then that, "Even before I finished negotiating a project, people are already saying I am making this much or that much money off of the state. I have decided never to invest in the mainland. I may donate some money though." This time, he actually volunteered to invest in Hainan, which was quite unexpected. I immediately applauded him, but I also said, "I am already 70-something. I am too old to govern Hainan. The central authorities probably will not let me go. I am too old and have little energy left. The central government probably will not let me serve as chairman of the board either. But if you invest there, I can be your consultant. I think the government will agree to that." I figured that Li was worried that his investing in the mainland would make things difficult all around. I could serve as his advisor to smooth things for him, and he would have less to worry about. Upon hearing that, Li asked me, "How about getting Li Pengfei to be chairman of the board?" I said, "So long as you trust him." I promised Li Ka-shing that I would report to the central government on his plans. At that time, I thought, if Li Ka-shing would indeed invest in Hainan Island, it not only would help develop the mainland but would also create a new situation where Hong Kong and overseas funds would be attracted to the mainland. It would also have a tremendous effect on stabilizing Hong Kong. But I had never been to Hainan, and everything I knew were second-hand. I decided to pay a visit. At that time, the National People's Congress was in session. I looked up Guangdong's provincial party commission secretary, Lin Ruo [2621 5387], and Governor Ye Xuanping [5509 6693 1627], indicating that I was interested in visiting Hainan while the Congress was holding group meetings. They both said that I would be welcomed. Ye Xuanping explained that he was heading the delegation and could not take time off and so he could not accompany me, but he immediately called up Hainan's district party committee and made arrangements for me. I requested a few days off from the Congress's secretary general and went off to Hainan. Hainan Administrative District's party committee secretary, Yao Wenxu [1202 2429 4872], met me and showed me around the island. He and the Hainan district, county, and city leaders made a detailed presentation of the situation there. Hainan indeed is another pearl of South China. It has great location, climate, and plenty of natural resources (although it has a shortage of trained personnel, and its educational standard is low.) The only thing it needs was to be developed. I told Yao Wenxu my tentative plans after the tour. I said I planned to suggest to the central government to separate Hainan from Guangdong and turn it into a separate province and make it the nation's largest special zone. I wanted the central government to grant the Hainan special zone more "special" policies than any other special zone. Upon hearing that, the district party committee comrades were delighted. Yao Wenxu said, since the "auto incident" (see footnote,) the central government had "taken away" all preferential policies once granted to Hainan. Things had been tough and morale had been low among the cadres. He was hopeful that the central authorities would consider my proposal. He added, "Before setting up the large special zone, it would be best that the central authorities could restore the preferential policies, or at least restore some of them even if not all them." I understood. He had little confidence that my suggestion of a large special zone would be accepted. (Installment No. 85)
