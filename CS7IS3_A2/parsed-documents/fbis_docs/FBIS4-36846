These establishments will be able to receive deposits and can participate in production and economic activities nationwide. Central Bank Governor Adeli today explained the activities of the private credit institutions. He told our correspondent that a set of rules and regulations has been prepared allowing those who wish to establish such credit institutions to hand over their application forms to the Central Bank next week. Conditional on approval by the Money and Credit Council, such persons will be able to begin their activities. The Central Bank governor added: Such institutions will be able to receive deposits and open all kinds of deposit accounts apart from the Qarz ol-Hasaneh current accounts [goodwill loans] which only banks may deal with. Also, the initial capital for the establishment of such institutions should amount to at least five billion riyals and a part of the capital should be held in cash in the institution's own safe. A part of the deposit should be held at the Central Bank. Mr. Adeli said: The highest loan paid out by such institutions will be 15 times the deposited capital. According to Mr. Adeli, in this way the Central Bank will be able to precisely supervise the activities of the private credit institutions and therefore guarantee them. On the rate of profit paid by such institutions he said: They can expect to pay one percent more profit than the current rate paid by [ordinary] credit institutions for the facilities provided; and they can determine their own rates for their deposit accounts. He stressed that the private credit institutions are not allowed to engage in usury transactions and will operate according to the law on usury. The Central Bank governor added: The rules and regulations for the establishment of such institutions have been approved by the Cabinet and by the Money and Credit Council; and following a request made by the Central Bank, the Guardians Council announced that the action is not against the Constitution or the religious laws.
