At present, Russian troop contingents are performing peacemaking missions in Bosnia (UN peacemaking forces), Tajikistan (collective CIS peacemaking forces), the Dniester Region, and South Ossetia. In January 1994, the independent Russian infantry battalion in Bosnia was increased to 1,200 men. The battalion is serving in the "East" sector. The bulk of the battalion's forces are located on the 36 checkpoints separating the forward positions of the Serbs and Croats. For the purposes of monitoring the cease-fire in Sarajevo, a Russian battalion unit (400 men) completed a two-day march along mountain roads and took up positions along the dividing line. In the Dniester Region, Russian peacekeeping forces are represented by four motorized infantry battalions with an overall strength of around 1,800 men. In South Ossetia, there is one motorized infantry battalion numbering 523 men. Apart from this, there are around 1,000 Russian servicemen in Abkhazia. Russian peacekeeping forces are subordinate to the Ministry of Defense, which exercises command and control through Deputy Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev. General Kondratyev explains: [Kondratyev] Peacekeeping forces are made up purely of volunteers from among servicemen's ranks. They undergo special training at a Russian Army training center. Personnel participate in dividing the conflicting sides, escorting humanitarian aid cargoes, evacuating the population from combat zones, and blocking the flow of weapons into the conflict zones. However, it is worth distinguishing between the terms "peacekeeping forces" and "collective peacemaking forces" in which we are taking part. The collective peacemaking forces comprise the 201st Motorized Infantry Division with reinforcements, which is stationed in Tajikistan. Not long ago, the 27th Guards Motorized Infantry Division and the 45th Guards Motorized Infantry Division, as well as an independent parachute battalion, were allocated from the Russian Armed Forces to perform peacemaking functions. [Burbyga] What losses have been incurred by the troop contingents performing peacemaking functions? [Kondratyev] Unfortunately, there have been losses. In all, we have lost 107 men, and 193 servicemen have been wounded. As of today, five groups of Russian UN military observers are taking part in peacekeeping operations being performed under the aegis of the United Nations. There are 16 men in the Near East. That is, eight in Egypt, four in Israel, three in Syria, and one in Lebanon, while there are 15 men on the Iran-Kuwait border, 30 men in the Western Sahara, two men in Cambodia, and 23 servicemen in Yugoslavia. [Burbyga] What kind of funds are being earmarked to finance these operations? [Kondratyev] In 1992 alone, over 2.5 billion rubles [R] (at 1992 prices) were spent on financing peacekeeping operations on former Union territory from the Defense Ministry budget, while in 1993 this figure was over R26 billion. [Kondratyev ends] As of 22 March, the number of dead among servicemen performing peacemaking functions was 107, while the number of wounded was 193. In terms of regions, the figures break down as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |dead |wounded | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Former Yugoslavia |2 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dniester Region |16 |23 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |South Ossetia |2 |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |North Ossetia, Ingushetia|28 |60 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Abkhazia |6 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |53 |77 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
