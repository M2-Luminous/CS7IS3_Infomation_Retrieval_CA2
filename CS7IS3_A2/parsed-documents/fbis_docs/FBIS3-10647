Entrepreneurs and politicians from a broad variety of ideological sectors -- including those labeled center-right and center-left -- no longer doubt that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has the anti-Lula image today. Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the all-powerful Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries (FIESP), has said: "His candidacy is perfectly viable. He is competent and enjoys credibility." His supporters gleefully say that Cardoso's candidacy has a center-left profile and is the only one capable of dividing the left, attracting the center, and appealing to the right. Luiz Eulalio de Bueno Vidigal Filho, the director-superintendent of Cobrasma [Brazilian Railway Material Company] -- who is another business big-shot -- has said: "It will be great if he becomes a candidate. I will work hard for his nomination." Cardoso's name is accepted by the elites who do not swallow the type of socialism imagined by PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who has led all the opinion polls with a 30 percent support for the past six months. Entrepreneur Romeu Chap Chap, president of the Brazilian Association of Shopping Centers, says: "There is no question that he is the anti-Lula candidate," adding that a correct implementation of the economic plan "does not depend on him staying at the ministry." Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa), said: "Cardoso is the anti-Lula. He only needs to wait for his plan to be consolidated before leaving the government." Alcides Tapia, president of the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), has said that Lula and the PT are campaigning, and it is only natural for other groups to seek their own candidates. He added: "Minister Cardoso could be one of those candidates because he is prepared and has what is needed to fill the position." Enthusiastic defenders of the anti-Lula candidacy think the minister has the basic ingredients to defeat the former Sao Bernardo do Campo workers leader. He has the image of a new politician, with credibility, experience, and a clean past. Lula has the same attributes, they admit, but lacks experience. Other factors will also weigh in the balance when voters become polarized for an eventual runoff between Lula and Cardoso. Gaudencio Torquato, a consultant in electoral campaigns and a Political Marketing professor at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), has said: "Brazilians want change but fear the jump is longer than they can manage unaided," adding: "Voters fear the unpredictability and ideas of Lula, which are considered revolutionary. Voters want change, but this is not the kind they want. In this field, Cardoso has the advantage." In Torquato's analysis, Lula would be a clear favorite if the race becomes polarized against politicians like Paulo Maluf (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] or Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. As a political analyst, he dares to suggest that Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy will be practically unbeatable in a runoff election against Lula. He forecasts that result: 70-30 in favor of Cardoso.
