The bulletin was released today, with the country partially paralyzed by a general 24-hour strike called by labor unions and other sectors demanding that the government repeal the higher gasoline prices. Several Quito radio stations have reported numerous clashes betweeen demonstrators and police in Quito, Cuenca, Guayaquil, and other cities during the morning. The police bulletin gave no figures for injured or arrested demonstrators [as received], but witnesses and the media are reporting that they run into the hundreds. Leaders of the United Workers Front [FUT], the country's largest labor federation, said at noon that the strike is "widespread." FUT President Edgar Ponce said in a news conference that "the response has been very positive." He declared that, if the government fails to repeal the gasoline price hike, another strike, this time for an "indefinite time," will be called. [passage omitted]
