The conference is sponsored by the Organization Department and the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee. It has been reported that the education of party members has constantly been intensified since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. In recent years, in light of the central committee's plan and requirements, the vast number of party members have been systematically educated on the "three basics" -- the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, the party's basic line, and basic party knowledge -- as well as on the current situation and policies, party conduct and party discipline, the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress. As a result of the educational courses, party members, with higher political awareness, have given full scope to their roles as vanguards and role models, and party organizations have continued to demonstrate their roles as fighting fortresses. The educational courses for party members have powerfully quickened and promoted the development of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. To keep pace with the new situation, the current conference on the education of party members stated that the general requirement for party members' education under the new conditions is to firmly adhere to the guidance provided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; focus on economic construction; improve the quality of party members in all fields; amplify the militancy of party organizations; and mobilize all party members to work hard to build a socialist market economic system, achieve the second-step strategic objectives, and carry out all strategic missions put forth by the 14th National Party Congress. Liu Yunshan [0491 0061 1472], deputy head of the Central Propaganda Department, said at the conference that education for party members today and in the future should give priority to three things: First, it should complete the assignment to arm the whole party with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all levels must earnestly implement the central committee's decision of studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and continue to organize the vast number of party members to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping until results have been achieved. While making sure that grass-roots party members will properly study the book, special attention should be paid to study among party member-cadres, especially party member-leading cadres. Second, it should persist in educating party members on party spirit. Party members must be educated to merge communist ideals with the ideals shared by people throughout the country at the present stage, and to rally and guide the vast number of people to work hard together to expedite reform and construction; to merge the objective of serving the people wholeheartedly with the work of developing the socialist market economy; to cultivate lofty moral sentiments by fostering communist ethics as well as social and professional ethics; and to preserve and carry forward the party's fine traditions through strictly abiding by the party's disciplinary rules while embarking on exploring new fields, bringing forth new ideas, opening up to outside world, and enlivening the economy. Leading cadres must set personal examples in order to make education on party spirit a success. Third, it should educate party members on basic knowledge of the socialist market economy, modern science, and modern general knowledge. This educational project is an urgent assignment which must be properly accomplished. In conclusion, Liu Yunshan said: There are now extremely good opportunities for educating party members. It is to be hoped that all party committees and departments in charge of party members' education will earnestly strengthen their leadership over party members' education, have a firm grip of the project, place it high on their agendas, and accomplish it firmly and meticulously so that a new situation in party members' education can be created with a new approach. Zhao Zongnai, deputy head of the Central Organization Department, chaired today's meeting. Present at the meeting were Lu Feng, Zhang Quanjing, Fu Jie and other comrades in charge of relevant central departments; and persons in charge of organization and propaganda departments and discipline inspection commissions of party committees of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government's jurisdiction, and some cities.
