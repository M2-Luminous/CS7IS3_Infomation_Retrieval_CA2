FR940512-0-00005 FR940512-0-00002 The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 950 producers of Oregon and Washington filberts/hazelnuts under this marketing order, and approximately 21 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Oregon and Washington filbert/hazelnut producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year was prepared by the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Board are producers and handlers of filberts/hazelnuts. They are familiar with the Board's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the expected quantity of assessable filberts/hazelnuts handled. Because that rate will be applied to the actual quantity of filberts/hazelnuts, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Board's expenses. In a mail vote conducted the week of March 28, 1994, the Board unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $507,010, $97,215 more than the previous year. The major budget item is $250,000 for the Board's promotion program to maintain and expand markets for filberts/hazelnuts. This is $30,000 more than budgeted last year for promotion. Other increases include $2,865 for general and administrative expenses, $1,350 for furniture, $1,000 for a crop survey, $20,000 for research, and $42,000 for the emergency reserve fund. The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.007 per pound, the same as last year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 56,000,000 pounds, will yield $392,000 in assessment income. This, along with $28,000 from previously unassessed 1993 crop filberts, $6,000 in interest income, and $81,010 from the Board's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, estimated at $453,673, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one marketing year's expenses. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Board and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Board needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the marketing year begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the marketing year apply to all assessable filberts/hazelnuts handled during the marketing year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Board in a mail vote and is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
