FR940202-0-00056 FR940202-0-00006 (ii) Determination of yield and maturity. Yield determined without regard to the call option is 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually. Yield determined by assuming J exercises its call option is 10.75 percent, compounded semiannually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that J will not exercise the call option because exercise of the option would increase the yield of the debt instrument. Thus, for purposes of calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of $100,000, and a yield of 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually. (iii) Consequences if the call option is, in fact, exercised. If the call option is, in fact, exercised, then under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the debt instrument is treated as if the issuer made a pro rata prepayment of $55,000 that is subject to ยง1.1275&hyph;2(f). Consequently, under ยง1.1275&hyph;2(f)(1), the instrument is treated as consisting of two debt instruments, one that is retired on the call date and one that remains outstanding after the call date. The adjusted issue price, adjusted basis in the hands of the holder, and accrued OID of the original debt instrument is allocated between the two instruments based on the portion of the original instrument treated as retired. Since each payment remaining to be made after the call date is reduced by one-half, one-half of the adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and accrued OID is allocated to the debt instrument that is treated as retired. The adjusted issue price of the original debt instrument immediately prior to the call date is $97,725.12, which equals the issue price of the original debt instrument ($95,000) increased by the OID previously includible in gross income ($2,725.12). One-half of this adjusted issue price is allocated to the debt instrument treated as retired, and the other half is allocated to the debt instrument that is treated as remaining outstanding. Thus, the debt instrument treated as remaining outstanding has an adjusted issue price immediately after the call date of $97,725.12/2, or $48,862.56. The yield of this debt instrument continues to be 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually. In addition, the portion of H's adjusted basis allocated to the debt instrument treated as retired is $97,725.12/2 or $48,862.56. Accordingly, under section 1271, H realizes a gain on the deemed retirement equal to $6,137.44 ($55,000 ^ $48,862.56). Example 7. Debt instrument issued at par that provides for payment of interest in kind_ (i) Facts. On January 1, 1995, A purchases at original issue, for $100,000, X corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 2000, at a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest of $6,000 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The debt instrument gives X the unconditional right to issue, in lieu of the first interest payment, a second debt instrument (PIK instrument) maturing on January 1, 2000, with a stated principal amount of $6,000. The PIK instrument, if issued, would provide for annual payments of interest of $360 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1997. (ii) Aggregation of PIK instrument with original debt instrument. Under ยง1.1275&hyph;2(c)(3), the issuance of the PIK instrument is not considered a payment made on the original debt instrument, and the PIK instrument is aggregated with the original debt instrument. The issue date of the PIK instrument is the same as the original debt instrument. (iii) Determination of yield and maturity. The right to issue the PIK instrument is treated as an option to defer the initial interest payment until maturity. Yield determined without regard to the option is 6 percent, compounded annually, Yield determined by assuming X exercises the option is 6 percent, compounded annually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that X will not exercise the option by issuing the PIK instrument because exercise of the option would not decrease the yield of the debt instrument. For purposes of calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of $100,000 and ten semiannual interest payments of $6,000, beginning on January 1, 1996. As a result, the debt instrument's yield is 6 percent, compounded annually. (iv) Determination of OID. Under the payment schedule that would result if the option was exercised, none of the interest on the debt instrument would be qualified stated interest. Accordingly, under ยง1.1273&hyph;1(c)(2), no payments on the debt instrument are qualified stated interest payments. Thus, $6,000 of OID accrues during the first annual accrual period. If the PIK instrument is not issued, $6,000 of OID accrues during each annual accrual period. (v) Consequences if the PIK instrument is issued. Under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if X issues the PIK instrument on January 1, 1996, the issuance of the PIK instrument is not a payment on the debt instrument. Solely for purposes of determining yield and maturity, the debt instrument is deemed reissued on January 1, 1996, for an issue price of $106,000. The recomputed yield is 6 percent, compounded annually. The OID for the first annual accrual period after the deemed reissuance is $6,360. The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument at the beginning of the next annual accrual period is $106,000 ($106,000 + $6,360 ^ $6,360). The OID for each of the four remaining annual accrual periods is $6,360. Example 8. Debt instrument issued at a discount that provides for payment of interest in kind_ (i) Facts. On January 1, 1995, T purchases at original issue, for $75,500, U corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 2000, at a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest of $4,000 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The debt instrument gives U the unconditional right to issue, in lieu of the first interest payment, a second debt instrument (PIK instrument) maturing on January 1, 2000, with a stated principal amount of $4,000. The PIK instrument, if issued, would provide for annual payments of interest of $160 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1997.
