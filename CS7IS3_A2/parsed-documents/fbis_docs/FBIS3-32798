Talks to disarm the Nicaraguan recontras of the so-called Northern Front 3-80, led by Jose Angel Talavera, a.k.a. Chacal, begin today. Local media sources report that a peace commission composed of Catholic Church and CIAV [International Commission for Support and Verification]-OAS delegates have already made contact with recontra leaders to establish the necessary conditions for the negotiations. The people are afraid rifles will be heard again given the recontras' mistrust for the military presence. On Sunday, Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, vicar of the Managua Archdiocese, advocated the rapid resolution of the situation in the country's north. We hope the rifles will remain silent and that the pacification process will move forward so Nicaragua can tread the path of balance, he said during his homily at the Managua Cathedral. The disarmament talks will be held at El Naranjo, Nueva Segovia Department, close to the Honduran border. Despite the cease-fire announced separately on Thursday by the Sandinist People's Army staff and rebel leaders, the presence of government troops increased over the weekend, a CIAV-OAS official reported. Sergio Caramana, CIAV-OAS coordinator general, warned that the peace commission's mediation might fail if the Army's presence near the town where the talks with the recontras will be held is maintained. A military source, however, denied that the Army is hampering the Catholic Church and CIAV-OAS mediation. We remain in our positions and maintain the cease-fire to facilitate the disarming, the source added. The suspension of Army offensive operations only covers the Nueva Segovia Department, where the Northern Front 3-80, made up of some 400 rearmed men, is stationed. The Army source said the operation continues in the rest of the country, but declined to report on any new clashes. In exchange for disarming, the recontras operating in the country's north demand that the government of Violeta Chamorro implement social programs for Nueva Segovia Department peasants and protection for the would-be demobilized.
