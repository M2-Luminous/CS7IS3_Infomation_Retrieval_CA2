The Mexican economy grew slightly in the first quarter with the GDP increasing 0.5 percent over the same period in 1993. Nevertheless, for thousands of Mexican companies and their employees, the recession that began in 1993 continued. This was particularly true in the service subsectors of trade, restaurants, and hotels. The recession in the service sector has lasted longer than in the other areas of the economy. The last time this sector showed growth was in the first quarter of 1993, when it registered an annual growth rate of 2.2 percent.

In a news conference, Diaz proposed that new family businesses be exempt from all types of taxes and a 3 percent cap be placed on sales taxes. According to Diaz, these measures will allow "groups in the underground economy to pass into the formal economy, and this will prevent the unemployment problem from worsening."

The Bancomer Group forecasts a 3.9 percent increase in the GDP this year, but only a 2.1 percent increase in the garment industry's gross product. Problems faced by the industry include a lack of integration in terms of production, a shortage of raw materials, low quality, limited designs, and high financing costs.
