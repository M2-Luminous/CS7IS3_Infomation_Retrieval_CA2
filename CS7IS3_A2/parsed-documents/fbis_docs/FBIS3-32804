With the same arrogance it has always displayed in total disregard for the Salvadoran authorities in other cases of similar violations, the U.S. Embassy quickly took the major out of the country virtually as a criminal would leave the country -- by not filing the requisite immigration paperwork. The incident showed the lack of organization characteristic of the government. The Presidency accused the Embassy of hindering the investigations conducted by the Nacional Civilian Police [PNC] and the district attorney. The PNC and district attorney supported the accusation made by the Presidency. Attracted by a sense of nationalism, the president of the Supreme Court of Justice also expressed interest in the problem. The foreign minister, however, refuted everyone when he declared that the Embassy was in constant contact with him, that the major had diplomatic immunity, and that all Embassy officials can enter and leave the country freely. On the other hand, the Embassy praised the Salvadoran authorities, as it had done very few times before, for its investigation and cooperation. If the Embassy is offering praise while government officials are protesting, then one of the two is lying, and neither of them have enough credibility for us to take their word at face value. Both have proven to be capable of lying quite openly. The fact that the victim is Salvadoran must not make us lose our perspective. The Salvadoran officials crazed by the ruling party's false nationalism have protested the Embassy's actions, thereby demonstrating their ignorance regarding diplomatic immunity and their provincialism. If they are so interested in justice, why do they not investigate why the military attache left the country. The Embassy should have followed established immigration procedures rather than pulling the major out of the country like a criminal. The U.S. Government can also strip the major of his immunity so that he can be tried by the Salvadoran courts, but that would be asking too much. The Embassy is accustomed to acting with this kind of arrogance and disregard. Therefore, the Salvadoran authorities should not be surprised, because they have allowed this to go on for many years. Likewise, we must not overlook the friendly "agreements" reached over the telephone by the foreign minister and the Embassy. Still, we must also ask ourselves: Who, on his own accord, would place himself in the hands of Salvadoran justice? The Embassy knows better than anyone else how it operates; it knows the vices that plague it, and the passionate nationalism of the magistrates, judges, and lawyers. To allow a U.S. citizen to be tried in El Salvador is to abandon him to the calvary the Salvadorans, who must deal with the judicial system, must endure. Despite all this, the United States has set a bad precedent when it proved, once again, that he who is the strongest can avoid the laws and justice.
