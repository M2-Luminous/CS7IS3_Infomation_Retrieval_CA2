But now this saying is no longer applicable to U.S. congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, because she has already bumped against the wall but still will not turn around. Under the pretext of "human rights," Miss Pelosi has made arbitrary attacks on China over the past few years, and kept babbling about advocating so-called "trade sanctions." Proceeding from U.S. basic interests, the Clinton Administration has recently announced its decision to extend MFN trade status to China and delink MFN trade status from the human-rights issue to go along with the strong demand of U.S. figures of various circles and the public. That was a wise action. However, Pelosi would not admit defeat and attacked the White House decision from nowhere; in addition, she set out in the U.S. Congress the need to take sanction action against China. She threatened: "We have grounds, and will get great support in the Congress." Does Pelosi really "have grounds"? No. Everyone knows that China and the United States grant each other the MFN trade status according to the bilateral agreement on trade and economic relations; that is entirely an arrangement beneficial to both sides on an equal footing, and the foundation for normal trade between the two countries. Over the past few years, the United States has jeopardized Sino-U.S. relations by setting out some side issues on MFN trade status, that were likened to weaving a cocoon and get imprisoned to it. The peoples of the two countries were unhappy about it. That being the case, the aforementioned decision of the Clinton Administration has not only won China's welcome but also the admiration of various circles in the United States and world public opinion. This has precisely demonstrated the practice of Pelosi and her like is totally groundless. As for the "great support," Pelosi might not even believe it herself. Long before the Clinton Administration made that decision, a common understanding on delinking human rights from trade issue and improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations had taken shape in the U.S. Government and the public, from the top to the grass roots on an extensive scale. Aside from U.S. business and public opinion circles, there are an increasingly greater number of people of insight inside the U.S. Congress who once supported Pelosi, who are for improving and augmenting Sino-U.S. relations, believing that this conforms to U.S. strategic and economic interests, and is favorable to peace and stability the Asia-Pacific Region and the world. Democrat Senator Johnston indicated that U.S.-Chinese relations are "the most important in all bilateral relations in the world," canceling the MFN trade status to China would seriously jeopardize bilateral economic relations and trade and even political relations. The majority of the Senate was for changing the policy, and 106 House members from both political parties had jointly written a letter to the White House urging extension of MFN trade status to China. Could it be that Miss Pelosi has turned a deaf ear to the words of her fellow congressmen? People would like to see just what "great support" Miss Pelosi will get! Congresswoman Pelosi has never stopped talking about "human rights." If she really cares for the human rights issue as she claims herself, why should she have taken the trouble to find such an issue in China or some other parts in the world? Miss Pelosi has only to stand at the door of her own house and she will find it. Several years back, racial turmoil on the largest scale in U.S. history took place in Los Angeles, California, the very state from which she has been elected a congresswoman. Was that not plainly a human-rights issue? The LOS ANGELES TIMES disclosed not long ago, some elderly American Chinese residing on Vallejo Street in San Francisco, who were impoverished and weak, suffered greatly from street crime, and dared not leave their living quarters, "their human rights are violated every day," and "there is no way to protect them" ... Has Miss Pelosi ever exerted any efforts on that issue? If Miss Pelosi has any shame about it, she should mind less about other countries' matters, and say less about things that she is ignorant of. She should instead exert some effort to improve the human rights condition in California to live up to the expectations of her California constituents. Not long ago, President Clinton said: "Linking human rights to the MFN trade status has taken us to the end of a path." However, should a small handful of people like Pelosi insist on moving on when they have arrived at the end of the path, what a scenario that will be?!
