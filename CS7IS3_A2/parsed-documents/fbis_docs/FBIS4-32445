Although, as he says himself, "he speaks Bosnian with more difficulty than he should have and his thoughts are always running ahead" he asked me to forgive him if he used any English words in the interview. His very successful two-year diplomatic career speaks of him personally and professionally more than any biography. Sacirbey graduated from law school in 1980 and a year later finished the Columbia Business School. Before his diplomatic assignment he worked as a very successful lawyer in a U.S. company specializing in international law. What probably predetermined Sacirbey for the diplomatic post in America were his manner, diplomatic skill, perfect English, and feeling for the right time and place. [Cerni] The latest U.S. Congress resolution about the lifting of the arms embargo for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government has fully demonstrated the duplicity of the U.S. policy. The administration with the exception of verbal statements about the need to lift the unjust embargo has not done much so far while the Senate and the Congress have been faced for the second time with the decision whether or not to lift the embargo. How do you assess the latest resolution? [Sacirbey] I believe that this is an important political and also symbolic decision. It is much more important than the actual implications on the battlefield. This resolution places a certain pressure on Europe and Russia, and also on Serbia, to reach a sort of peace settlement. I believe that some of the commentaries in Europe and even in the U.S. administration that the Congress resolution is not the right way are wrong. We in Bosnia care about peace and not war, as some think, wrongly anticipating our moves if the arms embargo were lifted. We would like to create a sort of equilibrium and make the peace talks proceed. Neither Europe nor America were willing to provide us with the necessary balance of power and the U.S. Congress has demonstrated a better understanding of the Bosnian problem than the U.S. administration. This is not merely a problem of "the victim of the Serbian aggression" which has a legitimate right to self-defense but a problem of principles and tactical conceptions, so to speak. This is the equilibrium of which I speak. We care a lot about peace, however, a peace that can last. [Cerni] Russia, some European countries, and Canada are opposed to the unilateral U.S. lifting of arms embargo, and even President Clinton, although the decision is binding, can pass a veto. What will happen if he does so? [Sacirbey] President Clinton must accept the consequences of this resolution because it is binding. I believe that he will also find it difficult to use his veto because this resolution is linked to a whole "package" of documents that give money for the U.S. defense and the Pentagon. I understand that numerous European countries, and even Canada, are not thrilled with the latest resolution because their soldiers are deployed in Bosnia. Many in the West, who have been "pushing" for "peace agreements" for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia have with their stance in a way recognized the Serbian conquests in Bosnia and the results of a genocide, they have acknowledged that Serbia is the most powerful and the mightiest in the former Yugoslavia. The resolution could now shake up this concept and the victim of the Serbian aggression could finally get the opportunity to achieve the same position on the ground. This would be a direct threat to Serbian military predominance in this war. [Cerni] If America lifts the arms embargo for Bosnia unilaterally then could this give impetus to consultations and talks in the UN Security Council about the passing of a similar decision? [Sacirbey] This is a truly interesting question. I have talked to numerous people in America and the Security Council these days and the fact is that Americans do not have a determined plan, that is to say, strategy in this situation yet. I believe that they should put pressure on their friends and allies in the world to create a new strategy on Bosnia-Herzegovina that would penalize the Serbian aggression and the genocide more. This means that they would have to deploy bigger forces, for example through NATO or the systems of the UN Security Council, and truly lift the embargo. The worst thing that can happen is that the U.S. Congress would work in one direction and the U.S. administration in another. This would have direct consequences on the UN Security Council. [Cerni] Many who are opposed to the lifting of the arms embargo claim that you are receiving arms from your Muslim friends in the world despite the embargo. [Sacirbey] The lifting of the embargo would contribute to a peaceful solution for Bosnia and not to war. The peace process is a lengthy process and for the first time it gives the victim the right to self-defense. On the other hand, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government was always of the opinion that the embargo imposed on it was unlawful and not binding for Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we have, thus, so far been forced to seek aid from anyone who wanted to help us. These are our friends and one cannot demand from any country in the world that has been the victim of aggression not to defend itself. This is stipulated in Article 51 of the UN. Naturally, we have accepted the aid that was offered to us for the defense of our country. Many would like to portray us as an Islamic country that has linked itself with the Islamic countries worldwide, which is not true. We are receiving aid and political support from various different countries. One should actually look where Serbia is getting its aid from. There are numerous gaps in the embargo against Serbia, it is smuggling oil, arms, and all other produce. On the other hand, the countries that speak most feverishly against the so-called Islamic danger in this region most frequently help the Fascist regime in Belgrade. However, this fact sheds a light on something else. Namely, a new alliance of the former communists and the neo-fascists is being forged in the former Communist Europe. This is connected to a desire to preserve the old "regimes," their infrastructure, and their armies. In the new system of free exchange of goods and democracy there is no need for Russia or Serbia to have such big armies and so many arms, especially if one bears in mind their "economic strength." [Cerni] You have numerous friends among the Jews and the Americans and many ascribe the success of the latest Congress resolution to the powerful lobbying of the Muslim-Jewish-American circles. How big is this influence in fact? [Sacirbey] The main man behind this Congress resolution is Senator Bob Dole. There is a Croat woman, a great friend of Bosnia-Herzegovina, working in his office. The truth is that we have some influence, however, in general the Muslims have not had too great an influence on the creation of U.S. policy. However, the Jews have a huge influence in America and we are very grateful to them for everything that they have done so that this resolution could see the light of day. [Cerni] Let us return to Bosnia. What are your conclusions about the observation of the four-week cease-fire that has recently been agreed in Geneva? [Sacirbey] Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about this because I do not have the information that is currently going on in the military sphere. However, it is important to emphasize that I personally was very satisfied with the talks with the contact group and [UN envoy] Mr. Akashi, and especially satisfied with the cooperation of the Croats and the Bosniaks in these talks. This has all led to a certain strengthening of our position in the peace talks. The talks about a political solution with the contact group are the most important as without them no concept of cease-fire is possible. There must be a powerful connection between our political talks here in Bosnia and the international factors, especially the contact group and Mr. Akashi. [Cerni] Can you comment on the scope of present talks of the warring sides with the contact group. I am particularly interested in the maps of division and the issue of the Serbian corridor through the Bosnian Sava Basin. [Sacirbey] I believe that it is too soon to discuss such issues because the contact group has not yet finished its job. I think that the issue of the so-called gray zones is very important. This is an opportunity to find a solution for the refugees and their permanent return to their homes. This is not merely a question of the Muslim refugees but also of the Croats who have escaped from the Serbian terror in Bosnia to Croatia. Unfortunately, it is forgotten that numerous Croats have been the victims of ethnic cleansing and genocide. We believe that these people should not seek permanent shelter in Croatia but should return to their homes. For this reason the concept of the gray zones can be applied in those regions where the Croats and the Muslims constituted the majority before the war, these are the towns such as Prijedor, Visegrad, Zvornik, and so forth. [Cerni] What do you think about the scope of the Croatian-Bosniak Federation, that is to say, the results of the Washington agreement? How do you view the visit of [Croatian] President Tudjman in Sarajevo? [Sacirbey] I am satisfied with the results so far and it seems that they are improving increasingly. The most important thing is that there is peace, that the people are not dying. However, we must go further. Some elements, especially in Herzegovina, are not exactly thrilled with this peace and we should, therefore, appease all the sides so that this peace may live. I am satisfied with the cooperation of Zagreb and Sarajevo so far, even though the cooperation in the Federation itself is proceeding somewhat slowly. [Cerni] Finally, do you believe in a just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina or can the term of a just peace be viewed only philosophically. Bearing in mind the situation on the field -- the Serbs hold 70 percent of Bosnian territory and in the negotiations with the contact group 51 versus 49 percent to the advantage of the Federation are being offered -- do you believe in a just peace after this war? [Sacirbey] The concept of the so-called just peace can be accomplished only with difficulty in Bosnia-Herzegovina at this moment. However, we cannot agree to a concept that would offer less than a lasting peace, that is to say, what we call "a just and lasting peace and such a country." Just peace would be if the Chetnik forces were definitively defeated. For as long as the Serbs are behind the negotiating table I find it difficult to speak about it. We must seek peace in which Bosnia-Herzegovina will be able to constitute itself as a country that will be fully functional and will be a country in the true sense of this word. We are aspiring toward a country that will reintegrate itself in the international processes like all other countries that have emerged from the inferno of Yugoslavia's disintegration. For this reason I am glad about the normalization of the relations in the Croat-Bosniak federation because the people are slowly returning to their homes. However, for as long as [republic of Srpska president] Karadzic and [republic of Srpska army commander] Mladic lead the Bosnian Serbs it will be difficult to achieve a just peace. They are the chief creators of this war and they must be held accountable for it. In its efforts, Europe is looking more for a realistic than a just peace in Bosnia. If we look for a realistic peace, then this must contain at least a certain degree of fairness and above all "a concept of the functioning of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina." We can never agree to the reality if Bosnia-Herzegovina remains a crippled country.
