Though this has been under examination by the company, high import duties have given the issue new impetus. A possible location is the harbor of Vysotsk in Vyborg; another is St. Petersburg, where cutbacks in the military industry have left many vacant facilities. "We are looking at many conceivable locations for an assembly plant in Russia, but no decision has been made on production," says Olle Odsell, public relations chief of Volvo Cars International. What has spurred Volvo's interest in assembling cars in Russia are the high import duties and other taxes that that country has recently imposed on imported cars. "Import duties and other fees now total 146 percent of the invoiced price of the car," says Odsell. "In this situation it will be interesting to see if it would be possible to avoid at least some of these by putting cars together in Russia." Volvo's decision is dependent on how tax and import regulations are going to look in Russia over the foreseeable future. Rumors are circulating that they are going to be lowered again. "Only if the import duties stay at the present high level will it be profitable for Volvo to establish itself there," says Odsell. "It is more expensive to assemble them in Goteborg. Shipping and assembling are associated costs, plus the investments that would have to be made." Many Aspects Volvo must also take other aspects into account. There are no plants in Vyborg, so everything would have to be constructed from the ground up. In St. Petersburg, already a year ago, Mayor Sobchak offered to let Volvo start production in the city's military plants. Labor force availability is also an important consideration. The car model being looked at is the 940 series, and a diagram on capacity was presented in the [business] daily DAGENS INDUSTRI some time ago suggesting 10,000 units annually. Volvo equipped and trained 28 authorized dealers last year in Russia, and they sold around 7,000 cars. The high import duties, which have more than doubled the price for a new Volvo since the beginning of this year, have meant that many dealers are having big problems in selling any cars at all. Pekka Perttiniemi, chief of Volvo Cars International in Russia, said to DAGENS INDUSTRI: "For logical reasons we will locate near the border with Finland, and therefore the harbor Vysotsk is a better alternative. Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak wanted to attract us there a year ago. At that time we had no plans for starting up assembly operations, since we could import cars and sell them. St. Petersburg is still one of the alternatives we are studying," said Perttiniemi.
