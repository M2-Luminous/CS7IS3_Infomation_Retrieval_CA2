They read: "Let us strive for a peace agreement"; "Let us stand and fight for a great decision and a great definition"; and, "Let us support President Gonzalo [SL leader Abimael Guzman] and the leadership." In addition to this, last 25 January a local newspaper published a long SL document, which is "secret" according to the newspaper's editors, entitled: "The SL is using the `peace agreement' to gain time." These facts inevitably awakened more than one specialist on Shining Path affairs, "experts" who study the violence phenomenon in Peru, with some exceptions obviously, whose apocalyptic predictions made before 12 September 1992 [when Guzman was arrested] we had forgotten. [passage omitted] Santiago Pedraglio, another expert on the subject, believes it is a mistake to identify what is called a "peace agreement with the overall pacification of the country." He said: It is fair to request the ideological defeat of the SL, but we should not "confuse apples and oranges." There is a time and way to defeat the SL ideologically, but this is not the same as a political, and especially a military, defeat. The ideological defeat does not fit in a negotiation, no matter how different it may be. The Shining Path's ideological defeat not only concerns the government and Fujimorism, but also and especially the opposition... It is surprising, therefore, that criticism of any negotiation with the SL is coming from some of those who for many years fervently upheld the need for a political outcome to the armed conflict. It seems that they are blinded by their anti-Fujimori feelings. This is extremely dangerous because it encourages a military outcome from the opposition. [passage omitted]
