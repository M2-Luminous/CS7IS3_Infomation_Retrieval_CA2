FBIS3-49603 "dreeu008__a94014" FBIS-EEU-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Unions Want To Renegotiate `General Agreement' AU1101173594 Prague CTK in English 1206 GMT 11 Jan 94 AU1101173594 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Czech trade union and employer groups met respectively yesterday, and reached decidedly different judgments regarding the General Agreement negotiated by the tripartite (composed of unions, employers, and the government) in December. The collective of labor unions expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement, while the employer collective supported it. (The General Agreement concerns work conditions and relationships, wage issues, business conditions, employment, and social policy, and is the basic instrument for maintaining social peace.) At yesterday's meeting of the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), labor representatives decided that they would not sign the proposal for the General Agreement, calling it a basically political declaration which did not guarantee the fulfillment of unions' demands. The representatives suggested that their social partners in the tripartite (that is, the government and employers) were positioning themselves against the spirit of the prepared agreement. The CMKOS Board recommended that the union representatives negotiate the agreement further, and also drafted a letter with concrete suggestions to be sent to Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, the government's tripartite representative, and to employers. However, employers also assembled yesterday at a meeting of the Confederation of Employer and Entrepreneurial Unions, and expressed a willingness to ratify the agreement. The employers had obtained a request from labor unions, said confederation president Jan Fencl, for guarantees protecting real wages and their growth, and also for a renegotiation of the collective agreement. But according to Fencl, employers cannot guarantee real wages because their feasibility depends on the progress of economic reform, the development of the entrepreneurial environment, and the quality of employees' work. A joint tripartite council had approved the General Agreement text on December 20, to be then approved by each individual social partner. The government approved the agreement last week.
