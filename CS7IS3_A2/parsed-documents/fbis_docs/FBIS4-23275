President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano registered as a voter this morning at the station operating in the Josina Machel High School near the Ponta Vermelha palace, the official residence of the Mozambican head of state. Afterwards, Chissano gave an interview to journalists covering the event. The journalists wanted to know what assistance the president of the republic would give to resolve the transportation problem hindering the electoral process. [Begin recording] [Chissano] We are aware of the shortage of transportation, even for state and government activities. There are even government administrators and heads of administrative regions who walk. We would like every vehicle to be used fully so that government departments and the National Elections Commission [CNE] may successfully accomplish their missions. [Unidentified correspondent] Transportation difficulties have to a certain extent affected the integration of Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] areas, even [words indistinct] Renamo says its advisers lack the facilities to ensure the full integration of its areas into state administration. The registration of voters is under way, but reports from the provinces say it has been difficult to reach Renamo areas. So, one could say the government and Renamo bear a degree of responsibility, in that the former has not created facilities for Renamo advisers and the latter is preventing people from entering its areas. Would you like to comment? [Chissano] The question of transportation for Renamo advisers is a false one. I have just said there are administrators who have no transportation whatsoever. Yet, they continue to carry out their activities. As for the advisers, they are not advising Renamo, but the governors. They have been named by Renamo to be appointed by the government as advisers to governors. They work under the same conditions as other officials serving provincial governors. So, that is a false problem because no one ever said vehicles would be allocated to every official. What was said was that an adviser was entitled to transportation. That means the use of public transportation, if available, or facilities that have fortunately been provided by communities so that our officials may operate. So, that is a false excuse. [Correspondent] How do you view the difficulties Renamo has created [words indistinct] it seems that in most provinces the (?CNE) teams have been (?prevented) from operating? [Chissano] Really, I think Renamo has some difficulties. It had problems in filling certain teams of district electoral commissions. They have been recruiting personnel in districts and areas. We know of people who used to work for us, but who have been recruited by Renamo. So, Renamo is recruiting people. I would like to say that the integration of areas has already begun. I announced it at the opening of the meeting of Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] cadres yesterday. The minister of state administration today met with the Reintegration Commission. Areas have been identified. We have appealed to Renamo to name those who will be appointed to state agencies at location, district, and administrative region levels. This is something that is in progress. So, I think every difficulty will be overcome. I believe Renamo is facing real difficulties. [end recording]
