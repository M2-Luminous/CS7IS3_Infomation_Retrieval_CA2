He was one of the founders of the China Campaign Committee (CCC), which was set up in 1937 when the Sino-Japanese war broke out. He worked tirelessly to draw trade unionists, working-class activists and public figures into aiding and supporting China's resistance to Japanese invasion. Clegg published three books on China: "The Birth of New China" (1943), "New China, New World" (1949), and "Aid China, 1937-49 -- A Memoir of a Forgotten Campaign" (1989). Right until his death on February 8, Arthur Clegg showed a keen interest in China's modernization drive. He told his daughter that he appreciated China's "building a market economy within the framework of socialism". He also expressed the belief that China would solve the Hong Kong problem well. Among those attending today's meeting were Huang Hua, president of the China Society for People's Friendship Studies (CSPFS), and friends and former colleagues. Israel Epstein, vice-president of the CSPFS, and Clegg's daughter Jenny Clegg were among those who spoke at the meeting.
