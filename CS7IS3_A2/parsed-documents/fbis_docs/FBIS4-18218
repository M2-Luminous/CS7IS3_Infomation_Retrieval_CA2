The British diplomat, named by the Russians as John Scarlett, was reported to be head of MI6 in Moscow and was expelled last month. The Foreign Office today confirmed expulsion of the Russian as a reciprocal move. The expulsions follow a television appearance in Russia by a man who claimed the British recruited him as a spy. "We were asked by the Russians to withdraw a diplomat," an FO [Foreign Office] spokesman said. "We regret this demand, which is at odds with the bilateral relationship we are trying to build. In response, we asked the Russians to withdraw the diplomat from London. Neither diplomat has been declared persona non grata. We hope this is an end to the affair." It follows recent damaging revelations that top CIA agent Aldrich Ames had been working for the Russians.
