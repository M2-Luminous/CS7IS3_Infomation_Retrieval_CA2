In accordance with the agreement's conditions, the government of Ukraine, in the person of Valentyn Landyk, deputy prime minister for issues of foreign economic activity, is handing over the debt for gas equaling U.S. $671,900,000 to the "Respublika" corporation, which was recently set up in Kiev. The corporation has also assumed the obligation to pay for deliveries of Turkmen gas for 1994 to the value of $500 million. In accordance with the agreement's conditions, 35 percent of the said totals should be paid in cash. The remainder should be compensated to Turkmenistan by Ukrainian goods, which in fact means the consolidation of the system of export quotas and licenses. In the event that the "Respublika" corporation does not fulfill its obligations in paying off the debt, Ukraine's government is to pay it. That is, under the agreement the mediator does not bear any financial responsibility. Experts note that the resale of state debt to nonstate structures is an extremely dangerous matter. These means are only used after a country has been officially declared bankrupt (for example by The Hague arbitration court). We will note that payment for the mediation operations of the "Respublika" corporation could be from 3 to 8 percent of the total debt, which is from 35 to $94 million. In addition, the mediator becomes a monopolist of 10-15 percent of Ukraine's total exports. The emergence of a commercial mediator in interstate relations evokes the surprise of experts. We emphasize that in accordance with the law, such agreements become valid only after ratification by Ukraine's Supreme Council.
