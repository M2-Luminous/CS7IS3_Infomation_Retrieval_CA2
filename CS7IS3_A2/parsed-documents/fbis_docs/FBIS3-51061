Such expectations were expressed on the first day of the year by President Fidel Castro, who estimated that the sector must continue to increase crude oil production and that initial exploration, currently carried out in association with foreign companies, must begin to show results. For the first time in 30 years, Cuban oil workers produced more than a million tons of a oil in a 12-month period. Specialists describe the oil as dense, viscous, and with high light hydrocarbon content, which makes it more flammable and thus harder to control. The 1.1 million tons of oil expected to have been produced by the end of the year would represent savings of $45 million to the national economy and have helped generate 30 percent of the electricity used in the country. In addition, hydrocarbon by-products were used to make cement and basic oils, the latter basically used to produce lubricants. Cuba's record high oil production was the 938,000 tons reached in 1986. Successive productions were 894,600 (87), 716,800 (88), 718,400 (89), 670,800 (90), 521,800 (91), and 882,100 (92). According to sources at Cubapetroleo, the drop between 1987 and 1991 was basically due to the depletion of the Boca de Jaruco deposit, approximately 45 km east of Havana. This last deposit and the one in Varadero (140 km east of Havana) were the most important in the archipelago; 20 additional deposits have been discovered there in the last 30 years. During this period -- according to GRANMA -- 65,000 km of seismic lines [lineas sismicas] were completed; 1.5 million meters of deep shafts were perforated; magnetic, radioactive, and geological surveys [levantamientos] were conducted; and the use of aerial and satellite photography was regularized to study the natural oil and gas [gasopetroliferas] possibilities. Oil prospecting gained strength by the end of last year, when 11 plots on land and superficial waters in the Cuban insular platform were offered for international bidding in Canada and London. This made possible -- according to TRABAJADORES -- the securing of a large number of contracts with foreign firms, including the UK's Premier company (to explore 2,990 square km) and France's Geopetrol (1,600 km). Jean Louis Remondin, board member of the French enterprise, told the local press that he was confident that there were important reserves of the so-called black gold in Cuba. The geographic location and the geological and geophysical characteristics of the territory contradict those who doubt the existence of more oil in the island, the specialist added. In addition to the exploration contracts, Geopetrol has similar agreements to recover and improve the Cuban deposits, especially those in the Yumuri Valley, Puerto Escondido, and Martin Mesa, all in the western part of the country.
