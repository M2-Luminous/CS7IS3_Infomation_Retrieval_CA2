FBIS4-20120 "drweu082_b_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 BENELUX COUNTRIES Netherlands VVD Rules Out Labor Party Coalition VVD Rules Out Labor Party Coalition BR2604141894 Rotterdam ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD in Dutch 26 Apr 94 p 3 BR2604141894 Rotterdam ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD Dutch BFN [Unattributed article: "VVD Ready To Work With D66 and CDA"] [Text] Last night in Amsterdam, VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] leader Bolkstein expressed a strong preference for a new coalition government between the VVD, D66 [Democrats 66] and CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]. He also announced that the VVD would not enter into a coalition with the CDA and PvdA [Labor Party]. The chances of seeing a "purple coalition" between the D66, PvdA and VVD, as advocated so strongly by D66 leader Hans Van Mierlo, seem very slight following these statements, as PvdA leader Wim Kok yesterday expressed his preference for a coalition between the PvdA, D66 and CDA. According to Bolkstein, only one of the present coalition members CDA and PvdA can be included in the new government. "One of the coalition parties belongs on the opposition benches. This government has seen to that." He is least enthusiastic about seeing the PvdA return to government as he sees the party as strongly divided in the light of contrasting statements by prominent PvdA members. This is why the liberal leader prefers a government formed by the expected election winners, the VVD and D66, supplemented by the CDA. Speaking to EO radio, Kok stated that a coalition between the PvdA and VVD was less obviously evident than a pact between the PvdA and CDA. Kok probably does not rule out in advance any possibility of cooperation with the VVD, but he does not want to create the impression of exuding an "anti-CDA" sentiment. CDA leader Brinkman reacted with great satisfaction to this: "Fortunately, PvdA members are repenting." Kok admitted that he had agreed with Bolkstein last summer that the parties would not mutually exclude one another from a coalition. But yesterday he stated that cooperation with the VVD was now less evident due to the election programs. Major obstacles not only include the minimum system of social security proposed by the VVD, but also authorization for migrants. Kok believes that speculation regarding a "purple coalition" of the Pvda, VVD and D66 is excessively dictated by an "anti-CDA sentiment." D66 will not join a future government unless there are new initiatives for social and political reform, D66 leader Van Mierlo said yesterday in Utrecht. "I do not see us as part of a government which does not make a start with the referendum. The D66 is never going to simply shuffle along. We will not be a part of that. W will press for a new approach." Van Mierlo stated that D66 has become an essential component of any new government. He also no longer wants to remain a bystander.
