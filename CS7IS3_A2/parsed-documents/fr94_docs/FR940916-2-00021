FR940916-2-00021 FR940916-2-00019 Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award a Grant to National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of Intent. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(H) to the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), under Cooperative Agreement number DE&hyph;FC01&hyph;94RW00304. The NARUC will provide administrative support to a Special Intergovernmental Review Panel in its charge to conduct an independent, financial and management evaluation of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Project in Nevada. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (P.L. 97&hyph;425), as amended by P.L. 100&hyph;203, December 22, 1987, established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) within the DOE, and directed the office to investigate a site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine if this site is suitable for the construction of a repository for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. Work on site characterization has been underway for several years. This work has been funded by Congressional appropriations from a Nuclear Waste Fund to which contributions have been made by electric utility ratepayers through electric utilities generating power from nuclear power stations. The period of performance is contemplated to be twelve (12) months commencing on or about September 9, 1994 and ending September 8, 1995. The total estimated cost of this effort is $1,000,000 which will be provided by DOE. No cost sharing is anticipated. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, ATTN: Rosemarie Marshall, HR&hyph;531.11, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20585. Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the NARUC has the experience to provide objective administrative management of the proposed project and fulfill the requirements of the agreement. The criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600 7(b)(2)(i)(H) is being relied upon to justify a noncompetitive award to the NARUC. This criterion authorizes noncompetitive awards when the Office of Emergency Planning, with the approval of the Director, determines that a noncompetitive award is in the public interest. In this case, such a determination is supported by the following: (1) The NARUC has the experience to provide the administrative management of the proposed project; (2) the requested funding will enhance the public benefit to be derived from the agreement by accelerating the completion of the review. NARUC is in a position to expedite the work of the Special Review Panel in its selection of an acceptable contractor to accomplish the objectives of the Project Description. Issued in Washington, DC, on September 7, 1994. Jeffrey Rubenstein, Director, Operations Division ``A'', Office of Placement and Administration.
