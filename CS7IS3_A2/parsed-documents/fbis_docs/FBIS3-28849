RMAF pilots would be flying the aircraft from Britain to its new home at the RMAF air base in Butterworth, better known as Malaysia's fightertown. The officials said the nine other Hawk 100 would be delivered by British Aerospace (BAe) in batches until the end of the year. [passage omitted] The Hawk 100s were bought under the RM [Ringgit Malaysia] 2.4 billion memorandum of understanding [MOU] signed between Malaysia and Britain in 1988. The RMAF also ordered 18 hawk 200 aircraft under the same agreement. The RMAF would be the first air force in the region to fly the British-made aircraft. Indonesia is reported to be buying the aircraft too. [passage omitted] The MOU also provides fog training of RMAF pilots and ground crew, including technicians, under an offset programme. A total of 69 RMAF technicians would be attending 20 types of courses. Four selected RMAF pilots, who completed a three-year training programme, would become instructors on the creation of a new squadron at the Butterworth air base. [passage omitted] In December 1990, Malaysia reached agreement under the same MOU for a rm400 million offset deal involving technology transfer to Malaysian defence-related industries such as Syarikat Malaysia Explosives, the country's ordnance manufacturer and AIROD Sdn. Bhd. [Company Limited], Malaysia's privatised aircraft and overhaul facilities. The offset programme, for the local manufacture of air delivered ordnance and ammunition (bombs and missiles), ground support equipment, aircraft components, repair and overhaul services would enable Malaysia to be self-sufficient in the support of the fleet of Hawk aircraft.
