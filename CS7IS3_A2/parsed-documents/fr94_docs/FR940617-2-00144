FR940617-2-00144 FR940617-2-00084 Fish and Wildlife Service Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for Development of a Residential Lot AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Mr. Welton Tapper, the owner of a single family lot in the Country Cove subdivision, (Applicant) is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The proposed permit would authorize the incidental take of a threatened species, the Florida scrub jay, Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, incidental to construction of a single family residence on an approximately 0.5 acre lot within the subdivision. The lot is located in the Country Cove subdivision, in the Town of Malabar, Brevard County, Florida. The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP) for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office address below. The Service is soliciting data on Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens in order to assist in the requirement of the intra-Service consultation. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the permit application, EA, and HCP should be received on or before July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the application, HCP, and EA may obtain a copy by writing the Service's Southeast Regional Office, Atlanta, Georgia. Documents will also be available for public inspection by appointment during normal business hours at the Regional Office, or the Jacksonville, Florida, Field Office. Written data or comments concerning the application, EA, or HCP should be submitted to the Regional Office. Please reference permit under PRT&hyph;790906 in such comments. Assistant Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1875 Century Boulevard, Suite 200, Atlanta, Georgia 30345, (telephone 404/679&hyph;7110, fax 404/679&hyph;7081). Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive, South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida 32216&hyph;0912, (telephone 904/232&hyph;2580, fax 904/232&hyph;2404). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dawn Zattau at the Jacksonville, Florida, Field Office, or Rick G. Gooch at the Atlanta, Georgia, Regional Office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The Florida scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida, it has been estimated that the Florida scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. Surveys have indicated that suitable Florida scrub jay habitat exists on the Applicant's property and surrounding areas. Construction of this individual homesite may therefore result in death of, or injury to, Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. The EA considers the environmental consequences of two alternatives. The no action alternative may result in some loss of habitat for Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens and exposure of the Applicant under Section 9 of the Act. This action is inconsistent with the purposes and intent of Section 10 of the Act. The proposed action alternative is issuance of the incidental take permit. This provides for restrictions of construction activity, monitoring Florida scrub jay activity during construction of the home, retaining natural vegetation to the maximum extent practicable, enhancing native vegetation through replanting, a prohibition on pets, and installation of a bird feeder and bird bath on the property. The HCP provides a funding mechanism for these mitigation measures. Dated: June 9, 1994. John R. Eadie, Acting Regional Director [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14753 Filed 6&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;P
