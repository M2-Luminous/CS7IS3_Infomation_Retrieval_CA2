Pushkareva by Inessa Lasovskaya in Novosibirsk, under the rubric "Stay Healthy!"; date not given: "Alas, Drug Addicts Learn Only From Their Own Experience"] [Text] The number of children and teenagers registered by drug rehabilitation clinics because of a weakness for alcohol, drugs, and toxic substances has increased by a factor of more than two in our city. The narcologists and the mayoralty committee for youth affairs believe inviting both children and parents to a meeting at the imeni October Revolution House of Culture at 1500 on 8 June to be one of the measures to hamper the spread of this teenage "epidemic." They planned to show a very interesting film which clarifies many points, and to comment on what the film narrates and what happens to those who are brought up on the street. Physician-narcologists will present answers that are easy for children to understand to all the complex questions that are asked from the floor. As we announce this event and deeply appreciate the anxiety of the public, we offer for your attention an interview with psychiatrist-narcologist Larisa Vladimirovna Pushkareva, chief of the adolescent ward of the municipal city drug rehabilitation clinic. [Lasovskaya] Larisa Vladimirovna, how does it still happen that adults living side by side with a teenager do not notice that they have a real drug addict in the family? [Pushkareva] This happens when attention is paid to the children only in a pro forma manner: They are fed and clothed. Upbringing means work and responsibility. One cannot shift this direct duty to others. Depraved inclinations develop out of a lack of occupation; many cling to "their own" groups and packs just because they have nothing to do. They go to "their own" kind because of a lack of understanding from adults. Their parents are seldom their friends and advisers; more frequently they act as prosecutors. Meanwhile, adolescents have their own problems. A girl fell in love, and the boy dumped her. This is a tragedy for her. A girlfriend makes her an offer: "Here, take this, you will feel better." Perhaps this girl, having gotten used to the regular use of the "tranquilizer," will pity some other person. You and I may not know how drugs are distributed, but they know! [Lasovskaya] One gets the impression that modern-day children have no notion of the danger in which they are putting their lives. Among those whom you begin to treat, is there not a single person who has discussed this topic with adults? [Pushkareva] Why not? About 30 percent have been forced to listen to admonitions from their mothers and fathers. However, like fools, they learn from their own experience, although these children are far from stupid, rather the other way around. [Lasovskaya] It is clear as far as they are concerned, but what about the parents? Why do they fail to see deviations in the behavior of their children? Or are the signs of drug addiction imperceptible? [Pushkareva] It is precisely the point that they leap out at you. The toxic substance addict altogether reeks of glue from three kilometers away. Both drug addicts and nascent alcoholics cannot conceal mounting aggression, nor do they want to conceal it. Love in children alternates with hate. How is this normal? And what about a puffy face? What about memory loss? What about strange burns and skin lesions? They deliberately slit their skin; for them, this is a technique for the infusion of intoxicating preparations. They have bruises along their veins, they behave as if they were drunk, but there is no smell. Is this easy to overlook? However, many parents display unsoundness even on learning of the disease. We are the ones trying to convince them: It is not coming to us that is shameful, but failing to have your child treated. Or else they bring their children and sort of dump them on us: "Do what you want. Treat them any way you know how, but we cannot do anything any more." [Lasovskaya] In general, you are not discussing your work in the mass media in vain. By all signs, your work has picked up in response to the growth of adolescent drug addiction and the crime it entails. We have an opportunity to give a telephone number which people may call for your advice. [Pushkareva] The telephone number is 23-48-14. Ask for me, Larisa Vladimirovna. At the reception office of the clinic they will immediately understand what will be discussed. Recently we separated from the city adolescent narcological complex which had an inpatient facility and a chain of outpatient facilities. [Lasovskaya] Support from the public is needed for the efforts of adolescent narcologists to rescue perishing children. Do you encounter indifference most often nonetheless? [Pushkareva] It is easier for me to answer by giving favorable examples. We have invited parents, teachers, guardians, adolescents, and members of commissions for minors' affairs for a meeting on 8 June at a large auditorium (holding 500 people). So, Kalininskiy Rayon has even made arrangements for its own bus to bring in all those who wish to come, and this is characteristic of them! Central Rayon accommodates us in all our endeavors; it is easy to work with any representative of the rayon administration there. I hope that such examples will be much more numerous. *** Like all adolescent narcologists of the city, Larisa Vladimirovna Pushkareva handles three times the regular workload, and not just because this is virtually a new specialty for physicians which has been occasioned by our new, utterly debauched times. When there was strict morality there were modest children and plain pediatricians. Then the immoral video conditioning for depraved inclinations appeared, and the pattern of assistance to children by physicians changed: Children are now treated by venereal disease specialists and narcologists. They are already taking up functions which are not properly theirs: Distracted from the treatment process, they go to youth audiences to meet potential patients and call things by their proper names, or try to talk some sense into parents: Please understand that the departure of a child from the family and preoccupation with "grass" are paths toward tragedy. Adolescent drug addiction (alcoholism, toxic substance addiction) is a new mass disease which is transmitted through the social milieu, through the communication of children. It should be perceived precisely as a disease--that is, your own and other children alike should be protected against it.
