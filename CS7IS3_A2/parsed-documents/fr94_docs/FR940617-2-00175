FR940617-2-00175 FR940617-2-00097 11. If any class of a Fund's shares are distributed by a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), with respect to each class of shares such Fund shall comply with Article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD as it relates to the maximum amount of asset-based sales charges that may be imposed by an investment company. 12. Applicants anticipate that shares of one new class will be offered to tax-exempt employee benefit and retirement plans of AMR Corporation and its affiliates (the ``AMR Class''). Other new classes, as well as the existing Institutional Class and Mileage Class, will be offered to institutional investors (other than such benefit plans) and to natural persons (the ``Unaffiliated Classes''). The offerees of AMR Class shares, on the one hand, and of the Unaffiliated Classes, on the other hand, will not overlap. Offerees of the AMR Class shares will consist of tax-exempt employee benefit and retirement plans of AMR Corporation and its affiliates for the benefit of employees, under which the assets are held in trust by a trustee and employees have limited pre-retirement access to the assets. Applicants propose to describe, in a separate prospectus, the expenses, performance data and net asset value of the AMR Class shares only to investors eligible to purchase AMR Class shares and not to investors eligible to purchase shares of the Unaffiliated Classes. Only those limited ``inside'' investors described above will be eligible to purchase AMR Class shares. Persons to whom the Unaffiliated Classes will be offered will be ineligible to purchase AMR Class shares since such investors do not fall within the scope of AMR Class offerees as defined above. 13. In addition, because shares of each class will be marketed to different types of investors, the method of soliciting sales of such shares will vary. A separate prospectus will be used to offer AMR Class shares and will be tailored to the needs of such investors regarding purchase procedures and cost information. 14. The shares in different classes within a Fund might have different exchange privileges. Any exchange privilege connected to any of the Funds' shares will be limited to exchanges among Funds that are part of the same ``group of investment companies,'' as defined in rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. All exchanges will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of rule 11a&hyph;3. In addition, applicants anticipate that shares of each Fund will be exchangeable for shares of other classes within the same Fund to the extent that the shareholder will have been eligible to purchase the shares acquired in the exchange. 15. The expenses of the Trust that cannot be attributed directly to any one Fund (``Trust Expenses'') generally will be allocated to each Fund based on the relative net assets of those Funds. Certain expenses that may be attributable to a particular Fund, but not a particular class (``Fund Expenses'') will be allocated to each class based on the daily net assets of the class. Finally, certain expenses may be attributable to a particular class of shares of a Fund (``Class Expenses''). Class Expenses will be charged directly to the net assets of the particular class and thus will be borne on a pro rata basis by the outstanding shares of such class. 16. Class Expenses may include: (a) Plan Payments relating to a class of shares, (b) transfer agent fees identified as being attributable to a specific class of shares, (c) stationery, printing, postage, and delivery expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class, (d) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (e) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (f) expenses of Administrative Services Agreements and other administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (g) trustees' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, (h) accounting expenses relating solely to one class of shares, (i) auditors' fees, litigation expenses, and legal fees and expenses relating to a class of shares, and (j) expenses incurred in connection with shareholders meetings as a result of issues relating to one class of shares. Any other expense will be allocated as a Class Expense only if such allocation is approved by a further SEC exemptive order. 17. AMR may choose to waive or reimburse Class Expenses on certain classes of the Fund on a voluntary, temporary basis. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or waive Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund. 18. In addition, AMR may waive or reimburse Trust Expenses and/or Fund Expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses), but only if the same proportionate amount of Trust Expenses and/or Fund Expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class of a Fund. Thus, any Trust Expenses that are waived or reimbursed will be credited to each class of a Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Fund Expenses that are waived or reimbursed will be credited to each class of that Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Trust Expenses and Fund Expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Trust Expenses or Fund Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an amendment to the Prior Order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of an unlimited number of classes of shares representing interests in the same Funds might be deemed to (a) result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and (b) violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).
