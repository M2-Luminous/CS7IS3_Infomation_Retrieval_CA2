Vladimir Bezkorovannyy, commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces, believes the naval vessels of the coastal service of the Black Sea Fleet must be divided equally between Russia and Ukraine. However, in the opinion of Valeriy Kuznetsov, adviser to the Crimean president for military issues, Ukraine is not capable of financing combat training even with the minimum of vessels at its disposal. The Black Sea Fleet numbers more than 100 naval vessels in all; of these only five are Ukrainian. At the same time, as Valeriy Kuznetsov emphasized, Ukraine has substantially increased the number of its ground armed forces on the territory of Crimea. Here there are now about 50,000 Ukrainian servicemen together with their construction units. Ukraine is probably afraid of the processes that are taking place in Crimea, Valeriy Kuznetsov said, because Crimea is Russian in spirit.
