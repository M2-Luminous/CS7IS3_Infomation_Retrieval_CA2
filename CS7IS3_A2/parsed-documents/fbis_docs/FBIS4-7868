UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] will be deployed between them. The two armies will withdraw their heavy weapons 10 km (mortars) and 20 km (heavy artillery). According to the Zagreb agreement, UNPROFOR will carry out checks to see whether the two side are observing the agreement. The blue helmets will, for the first time, carry out checks not only on the Krajina territory, but also on the Croatian territory, up to 20 km from the line of separation. In his interview for POLITIKA, Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of the republic of Serbian Krajina and a member of the Krajina negotiating team in Zagreb, also stressed this new fact. We asked Minister Jarcevic what status Krajina's delegation had at the negotiations. Two Equal Sides [Jarcevic] We and the Croats acted as two equal sides. We agreed not to mention the terms Republic of Croatia and the republic of Serbian Krajina in the negotiations and documents. The documents refer to the two delegations only as "two sides," without using any other designates. For instance, the documents state that "the two sides agreed" that the "Serbian army withdraw," that the "Croatian army withdraw...." During the preliminary talks with Mr. Churkin we agreed that we would not touch political issues. Our aim was to arrive at a cease-fire agreement and to end hostilities, and not to make an agreement on borders and demarcation lines that would deal with the status of the territories occupied by the Croatian side. Both we and the Croats also supported the proposal that, immediately after the implementation of this agreement, we will begin negotiations about roads, the economy, oil pipelines, power lines, trade, and so forth. The condition for these talks will again be that we do not deal with political problems. Only once life, the economy, and everything else begins to function, could we discuss political issues. [Radivojsa] What will the Serbian side demand in the negotiations regarding roads and economic cooperation? [Jarcevic] Our aim is the scrapping of Security Council Resolution 820. Point 12 of this resolution forbids import-export activities by the republic of Serbian Krajina. Moreover, we are interested in the opening of the roads only if we are allowed to trade with the world. Otherwise, if we open roads, which is what Croatia wants, our trucks could be confiscated in Hungary. Therefore, we would not benefit from this kind of agreement. 400,000 Serbs Fled [Jarcevic continues] The Security Council would therefore have to guarantee us freedom on the market. Only then will we sign the agreement. [Radivojsa] Does this also refer to the opening of the Zagreb- Knin-Split rail line, and the opening of the Krajina section of the Belgrade-Zagreb highway? [Jarcevic] Of course, but we are opposed to the consolidation of the roads, economy, and even tourism in Croatia while we are closed off and subjected to the sanctions. We demand freedom to export to Belgrade, to Slovenia, and to Hungary via the shortest route, through Western Slavonia. We will also seek a tax-free port on the coast, because a large part of our trade gravitates around the ports on the Adriatic coast. We primarily have one of the Zadar ports in mind. This port would handle our exports and imports without inspection by the Croatian customs authorities. [Radivojsa] What could Slobodan Jarcevic say at present about the third stage of negotiations, about possible political issues? He says that the talks in that stage will be the most difficult, because they will deal with the issue of refugees, the territories that Croatia occupied in its aggressions of 1992 and 1993. The Serb ethnic territories in Western Slavonia, where Serbs constituted a majority until 1991, will also be on the agenda. Then, we will also discuss war crimes and ethnic cleansing, which, as Jarcevic says, assumed much larger proportions in the Republic of Croatia. The Republic of Croatia has expelled some 400,000 Serbs from its territory. What could we then expect from the negotiators in the third stage? [Jarcevic] Regarding Krajina's future, I can say that the sanctions introduced against the Serbian people are a paradise in comparison with what they could experience in a Croatian or a Muslim state. The world should therefore not be surprised that we are putting up with the sanctions. This is why we should not be asked whether we will accept a federal or a confederal model, or an autonomous status in the Republic of Croatia. We do not want any of that. [Radivojsa] This was a categorical answer by Slobodan Jarcevic.
