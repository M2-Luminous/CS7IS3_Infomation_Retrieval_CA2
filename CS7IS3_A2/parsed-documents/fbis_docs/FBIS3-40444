Testing the performance of integrated deicing systems in certain types of portholes, windshields, and glass enclosures, is part of the total quality assurance of the products manufactured by Lucas Aerospace's Department of Engineering and Heating Systems. Whether made of pure glass, acrylic, or polycarbonate, or of acrylic glass, deiceable transparencies must respond to various stresses that necessitate in-process testing during manufacture. To test the electric heating systems--a thin layer of gold and or indium oxide applied by vacuum deposition on the surface of the glass or other "plastic" material--of the windshields that it manufactures, Lucas uses Agema's thermal imaging system Thermovision 870, by means of which the temperature distribution over the heated surfaces can be displayed. The testing procedure consists of placing the windshield, with its heating element activated, in front of the infrared system. Without making contact, the Thermovision 870 equipment senses and measures the radiation emitted by the windshield. The resulting image is displayed on the monitor screen and compared with the thermographic pattern of a standard reference windshield. It takes less than two minutes to test the windshield in its entirety, with precision and without slowing the production rate. The infrared testing technology replaces the thermocouples method, which required that 30, and up to 40, thermocouples be positioned on each windshield to obtain a plausible image of the temperature distribution, the Lucas company explains. And in any case, the thermocouples method was, at best, incapable of a high degree of reproducibility and could even generate an abstraction of what is actually a very localized zone. Another advantage of the Thermovision 870 system is that it permits the archiving of 40,000 referenced thermal images on disk or magnetic tape.
