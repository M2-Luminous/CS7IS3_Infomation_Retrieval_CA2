Our correspondent reports from Krasnodar with the details. [Correspondent S. Shcherbal] The 43-year-old governor of Kuban, Nikolay Yegorov, who has not been released from that post yet incidentally, arrived in Moscow today to take up the seat as minister of nationalities and regional policy affairs, which he has inherited from Sergey Shakhray. [Begin recording] [Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev] We see Nikolay Dmitriyevich's appointment as a hopeful sign, and we heads of republics and regions must of course help him formulate policy. [Yegorov] In my work as a Russian government minister, I don't intend to do anything revolutionary, especially in the sphere of interethnic relations. [Unidentified correspondent] At one time you did try to use harsh measures to extinguish a number of hotbeds of interethnic tension that flared up in the kray. In your capacity as minister, do you plan to use these sorts of harsh measures on a Russia-wide level to extinguish conflicts? [Yegorov] If it is necessary to use harsh measures, if the situation demands it, then I do indeed have enough strength and will to do that. [K. Zatulin, chairman of State Duma committee for CIS affairs] Alexander Dumas the elder commented that blood in the south flows more quickly, thus any indigent nobleman from the south of France, from Gascogne, who went to Paris would make a career for himself faster than his far richer comrade from the north, from Normandie or Picardie. I think that what goes for France is typical for the south of Russia, too. [end recording]
