We know that for the past year and a half, you have been preparing a decree on land reform in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, and today I would like to find out what this program represents, what progress has been made in general, and what the prospects are? [Nemtsov] Yes indeed. Last spring we began working on a program for reorganizing the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. So we worked on it for a year and finally the work was completed, and during the Prime Minister's visit to Nizhniy Novgorod we demonstrated the program's potential. After that, on 10 March, the Prime Minister declared that on the basis of this work, an overall national program of land reform could be announced within 10 days. This was a very big honor for us, the people of Nizhniy Novgorod... [Yermilova, interrupts] In other words, it was convincing. [Nemtsov] As far as I know, the Prime Minister was very pleased with it and the fact that a draft Government decree has been drawn up -- I hope it will be signed in the next few days -- speaks for itself. Viktor Stepanovich [Chernomyrdin] did what he promised, although he was 10 days late. But that is not important. But I would like to... [Yermilova, interrupts] Well, I wish you success and hope the decree will be signed as soon as possible. [Nemtsov] The most important thing is for Viktor Stepanovich to sign it. In fact the program looks fairly straight forward, and I would simply like to outline its basic principles. The most important principle, in our view, is that the peasants themselves should choose how to work, whether to work separately as farmers, in cooperatives, or in joint stock associations. This is their problem. We as bureaucrats should not interfere with this. On the basis of this principle we proposed the following scheme: Every peasant, including pensioners, who worked in an agricultural establishment [khozyaystvo] will receive a certificate like this... [Yermilova interrupts] Let us show it. [holds up certificate]. [Nemtsov] It is a certificate of entitlement to a portion of the land, and a similar certificate will be issued for the right to a share of the property. After receiving these certificates, the peasants have the right to do what they want with them. They can invest a certificate in a new partnership in the form of founding capital, they can sell it, they can bequeath it, or give it away as a gift. So what happens in practice is that leaders, whom you can always find in an agricultural establishment, organize powerful partnerships around themselves, while babushkas who relinquish their certificates receive certain advantages. For instance, they may request a daily delivery of three liters of milk in exchange for their certificates. [Yermilova] This really happens? [Nemtsov] Yes it does. An agreement on the delivery of milk, or possibly the repair of a roof, or deliveries of wood is drawn up. [Yermilova] But who will do this, surely this would require a large team of people who would do nothing else? [Nemtsov] No, this will not be their only job, first of all they will... [Yermilova interrupts] But who will deliver the milk? [Nemtsov] A new partnership which will be engaged in milk production will take care of this. After the partnership has been formed, its leader will submit a request to the privatization commission asking it to consider the possibility of purchasing the given portion of land and the property, such as a tractor, warehouse, and so forth. Now the question of who gets what is solved in a rather interesting way. If, for instance, two partnerships or two individuals aspire to the same piece of land, then an auction is held. Besides, payment is made with these certificates -- not money, not dollars, only these certificates. The one who gives the greatest number of certificates for the land will get it. The same will be done with property. For instance, if there are several prospective clients for a tractor, it will go to the one who provides the most certificates. [Yermilova] So the idea is that citizens should give up their certificates to those whom they trust -- those who know how to work and love working on the land. [Nemtsov] What we have in mind is that citizens will determine for themselves what they will do with their certificates. Experience has shown that they will give them to the most promising people who will be able to organize the work, who as owners of this land and property will be capable of working efficiently and making profits, thereby fulfilling their obligations to, say, the babushkas, right? [Yermilova] Yes. [Nemtsov] Now we already have this kind of experience, and in fact, one agricultural establishment, the Pravdinskoye establishment in Balakhninskiy Rayon, has been reorganized and nine establishments have appeared in its place -- two farming partnerships that produce milk, maintenance workshops, and so forth. Besides, there were no rows and no fighting as usually happens when people argue about who gets what. None of that occurred because everything was done in an open and honest way. So the main principle, the freedom of choice, was adhered to. It is a principle which never existed in old Russia when the land issue was being worked out. [Yermilova] Even in the time of Stolypin? [Nemtsov] Yes, even in the time of Stolypin, because Stolypin sometimes broke up communes by force and people simply left for (?remote regions). They were coerced. In fact, the Stolypin reform was carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Stolypin was the minister of internal affairs at one time. Of course, he was also the governor of Saratov, but when he was the governor, he was not involved in any reforms. He only took on the reforms when he became a big boss in St. Petersburg. [Yermilova] Boris Yefimovich, how do the people in Nizhniy Novgorod themselves view this idea? Have you made any kind of analysis of this issue? [Nemtsov] You know, we are carrying out our enormous preparatory work with people. For instance, very many people have no idea what to do with their certificates. So babushkas are putting them under their pillows, and until things have been explained to them... [Yermilova interrupts] And they wait for some special moment. [Nemtsov] They are either waiting for some moment or for an explanation about what they can do with them. When they learn about their unusual opportunities, they promptly become the major supporters of reforms. So the polls which we held in agricultural establishments showed that most people support this idea and consider it to be most constructive. [Yermilova] I think the idea is simply grand. [Nemtsov] It is particularly supported by two categories of people: first of all the pensioners who have nothing -- all of a sudden they have an opportunity to acquire something. The second rather surprising circumstance is that the idea of reorganization is supported by leaders. You often hear: Those red kolkhozniks, those kolkhoz chairmen ruin everything. Nothing of the sort. It turns out that they are the greatest supporters of this idea because they are tired of forcing drunkards and idlers to work. Secondly, because they are sick and tired of everyone being judged equally, and thirdly, because they want to see a return on the work that they have undertaken so that they can exist in a normal way -- so that they can live on their earnings, spending as much as they have earned. So the leader is interested in these reforms because they rid him of drunks and idlers. For instance, if an alcoholic comes to him and says he wants to work in his agricultural establishment, the chairman can say: You know, dear fellow, no thanks, go find work somewhere else. I will not employ you. Or: I will take you, but only on the condition that I can fire you at any moment. [Yermilova interrupts] In other words: You have a choice, quit drinking and start working. [Nemtsov] Yes, stop drinking and start working. You know there is hope, which is not often mentioned, for raising discipline in production. Well, our agricultural enterprise leaders nurture this hope, and it can be realized. The most important aim of this program is to make agriculture efficient. As soon as laborers show concern, as soon as we can get rid of idlers and drunkards, people will become active and will start working. In my opinion, this is the most essential circumstance setting this program apart from all previous ones. We are not coercing people into becoming farmers. They choose for themselves. We do not tell them which method of production is the best -- they can choose it themselves. Thirdly, as a result of this reorganization, we rid ourselves of a ballast which weighs us down and really impoverishes Russia. [Yermilova] Boris Yefimovich, I have lots of questions to ask you. I would like to talk about industrial loans and about telephone loans, but we do not have the opportunity to do this today. So I would like you to promise to reappear in our program's studio again soon. Now, if I may, a short final question. You are a young, presentable, handsome, and unattached person. Does this help you or hinder you in your work? [Nemtsov] This helps me without a doubt. I do not entirely agree with what you just said, but it helps me. At least, I think it is highly fortunate to have the energy and opportunities to implement your ideas. [Yermilova] Thank you. All the best and good luck with this project and decree. I hope it will be adopted soon. I would like to remind our viewers that Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov, governor of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and deputy of the Federation Council, was the guest of the "Utro" program. Thank you. [Nemtsov] Thank you.
