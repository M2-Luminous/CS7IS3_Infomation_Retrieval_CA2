This position means that Hamas has recognized the enemy. Thus, the fighting spirit has died down. There is no difference now between this movement and those who have recognized the enemy, since they all take the same position when they say that Palestine is the territory that was occupied in 1967. This is a major fallacy that destroys historical facts and the constants of the nationalist cause for which the Arab nation has confronted the Israeli enemy since he began his occupation of the Palestinian land a century ago.
