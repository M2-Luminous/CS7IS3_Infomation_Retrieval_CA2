Our comrades should always bear in mind Comrade Xiaoping's dictum that development is the last word. In discussing this year's work, deputies asked whether deficit-ridden, district-owned collective enterprises should be allowed to declare bankruptcy. Wu Bangguo noted: Some small district-owned enterprises may be sold to individuals in a step-by-step manner, whereas enterprises incurring substantial losses may be allowed to go bankrupt. We must, however, approach this matter very prudently. When deputies from educational circles discussed educational issues, Wu Bangguo said: It is not easy to undertake educational service. Shanghai now suffers an acute shortage of skilled personnel; the training of skilled personnel in demand brooks no delay. Wu Bangguo exhorted: While maintaining Shanghai's strong momentum for economic development, we should earnestly solve several problems of concern to the people. First, we should ensure that shopping baskets are filled, stabilize and develop production bases of nonstaple foodstuffs, actively develop agriculture with distinctive features, and improve commodity distribution. Second, we should heed issues relating to state-owned enterprises, especially those pertaining to deficit-ridden enterprises. Properly dealing with enterprises making meager profits or incurring losses not only affects Shanghai's economic development but also the vital interests of many workers. We should be determined to solve these problems. Third, we should resettle [words indistinct]. Fourth, we should show concern for people's lives and earnestly solve the problems of low-wage workers regarding their livelihoods.
