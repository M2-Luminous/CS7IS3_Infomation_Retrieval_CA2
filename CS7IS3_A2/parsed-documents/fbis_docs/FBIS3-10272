Hector Rosada, chairman of the government's Peace Commission, said the human rights issue will be the first point to be addressed in this round in an attempt to resolve it "because it has already been discussed previously." They will also decide on the timetable of the agenda for subsequent meetings. Rolando Moran, leader of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG], emphasized that human rights must be "the first point discussed in the meeting. Agreements in this area have already been reached and signed with the previous government. There are a number of points that have already been signed. We have to base ourselves on them and discuss them...therefore, the human rights issue is the first topic to be discussed, mainly because of its importance in Guatemala," he added. The guerrilla leader said human rights are very important, as shown by Argentine expert Monica Pinto's report presented at the Geneva meeting on the situation in Guatemala. Today in Mexico, the government and the URNG General Command resumed talks to end the armed conflict in the Central American nation which has lasted for more than 30 years. The government delegation of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio also includes General Carlos Pineda, deputy chief of staff; Gen. Arnoldo Balconi, Army inspector general; and Gen. Victor Argueta, commander of the Honor Guard. Commanders Gaspar Ilom, Pablo Monsanto, Rolando Moran, and Carlos Gonzalez, and members of the Political-Diplomatic Commission are participating in the guerrilla delegation. Today, UN-appointed mediator Jean Arnault met separately with the two sides to find points of concurrence. In January in Mexico City, the two sides agreed to resume the negotiations after they were suspended for eight months because of former President Jorge Serrano Elias' self-inflicted coup. The government and the URNG held talks for the first time in Mexico City in April 1991. Only relative progress has been achieved to end the conflict that has caused more than 100,000 deaths and left 50,000 missing.
