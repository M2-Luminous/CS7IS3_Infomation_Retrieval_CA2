Besides Victor Benoit, present were the current minister of education and spokesman for the National Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD], Dunois Eric Cantave, former Aristide presidential commission member Micha Gaillard, and BP-FNCD bloc president Jude Marie-Jacinthe Jean-Baptiste. The following is a report by Varrio Serran. [Begin recording] [Serran] No to the clean-sweep strategy, no to political inertia, but yes to the parliamentarians' realistic initiative aimed at resolving the country's crisis. These are the words of CONACOM leader, Victor Benoit. According to him: On the one hand, this plan meets President Aristide's principal demands -- his return to power and General Cedras' early retirement; on the other hand, it meets that of the commander in chief -- amnesty to the military. [Benoit] It is a set of proposals in keeping with the Constitution, the Governors Island agreement, the New York pact, the Miami conference, and a series of documents to which CONACOM feels it is linked. It also respects the demands of the entire political class -- the formation of a government of national concord, sociopolitical appeasement, and national reconciliation. This proposal also respects what all strata of the country are demanding: the lifting of the embargo so people can work under proper conditions. [Serran] To make a long story short, in CONACOM's opinion, this plan offers the means to extricate the country from its deadlock through facilitation of, among other things, the restoration of the head of state, cessation of violence, reduction in the high cost of living, protection of the country's institutions, and removal of the sanctions. Asked about the division that seems to have developed within the FNCD over this plan, BP-FNCD President Jude Marie- Jacinthe Jean-Baptiste replied that the divergences are only on the tactical plane, but that regarding restoration of the head of state to his post, the front remains united. Does CONACOM's firm, vital support of this plan include a wild run for the post of prime minister? Certainly not, said Victor Benoit, who drew up a profile of those who would run for this post. [Benoit] The following is a profile of those who would discreetly run for prime minister. I am going to give you this profile so you can identify them: They are either in Haiti or abroad and claim to side with President Aristide. Actually, some are very close to him. They do not talk or take a stand at all. They do not take a stand publicly. But they behave as if they completely agree with anything the president thinks. They have no personal advice to give. They do not behave as people who have a personality. They behave as simple opportunists because they know it is the president who will appoint the prime minister. As there are political divisions, they agree with the president up and down the line. [Serran] Nobody, not President Aristide, not his advisors, not the international personalities we have met, nobody can say that Victor has ever tried to run for prime minister, Benoit said, adding: We are the president's allies, but not his sycophants. Political inertia can kill. Politics presupposes not only a stance, but also an initiative. This person in charge of political affairs for CONACOM added that some people are linked to President Aristide, the person. But we, he said, are linked to the cause that President Aristide defends. Asked finally about the alliance arising from circumstances in the Chamber of Deputies among the BP-FNCD, the socialist bloc dominated by the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti, and the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, the CONACOM leader explained that in politics, yesterday's adversary may today be an ally, and today's ally may be an adversary tomorrow. What is fundamental is the [common] goal. [end recording]
