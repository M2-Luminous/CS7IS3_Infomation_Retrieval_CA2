FBIS4-32724 "dreeu125__a94044" FBIS-EEU-94-125-A Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 ANNEX Slovakia HZDS To `Put Aside' Meciar After Elections HZDS To `Put Aside' Meciar After Elections AU2706195694 Prague CTK in English 1545 GMT 27 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2706195694 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava June 30 (CTK) -- Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), said today he believed that after the autumn elections, his party would not be faced with any clash due to the allegedly different views of its leaders on the possibility of the SDL's coalition with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The SDL is a government coalition party, successor to the former Communist Party, while the HZDS is in the opposition. Headed by ex- Premier Vladimir Meciar, it has repeatedly topped opinion polls and is the SDL's biggest election rival. Weiss assured journalists that SDL representatives would not "swallow Meciar's bait." Rumours alleging controversies within the SDL which the HZDS is permanently airing through the media are untrue, he said. "On the contrary, I have information that a right-leaning HZDS faction intends to use Meciar only as an electoral flag, which they will put aside later," Weiss stressed. He said he considered speculations about SDL's coalition with HZDS "without Meciar" premature. First he does not want to view the partnership only in an "interpersonal" dimension, and the developments after the elections also could be affected by the absence of any present coalition party in the next Slovak parliament, Weiss said. Speculations about a post-election SDL-HZDS coalition have been appearing in the press for certain time. Observers point to the possibility of the removal of Weiss by more conservative SDL members, or of the SDL's split. Weiss said that real post-election variants would be considered by the SDL national council on July 9. He stressed that pre- election polls had also to be taken into account, according to which up to 70 percent of voters approved Meciar's dismissal in mid-March, and most of them would not give their second vote to the HZDS, if enabled to vote for two parties. According to the latest poll, the HZDS is supported by 29 percent of citizens. The SDL is placed second, supported by one fifth of voters.
