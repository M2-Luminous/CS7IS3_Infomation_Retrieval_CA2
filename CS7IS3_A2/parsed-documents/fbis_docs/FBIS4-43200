Cetin met Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans during the North Atlantic Cooperation Council meetings and said Dutch laws did not ban an organization or an association which is not directly involved in a violation. `Kooijmans conveyed that they are obviously taking additional measures and they struggle with possible terrorism activities that could come from other sides of Europe,' Cetin said. `Kooijmans said there were reported ones who are under custody and some of them were extradited. They stressed importance to preventing terrorism activities rather than banning,' he added. Cetin said European friends and allies should give support to Turkey on terrorism adding that giving this support is an international obligation. He also said they discussed developments in the European Union [EU] and Turkish-EU relations.
