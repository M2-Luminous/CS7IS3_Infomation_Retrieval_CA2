In conversation, the sides touched upon questions of strengthening regional economic ties, the implementation of joint programmes to be financed by the Swedish side, and also illegal immigration and cooperation between law-enforcement bodies. In Margaretha af Ugglas' opinion, the setting up of a House of Sweden in the city on the Neva would contribute to the deepening of bilateral contacts, including cultural exchange. At a meeting with Russian and foreign journalists she said that in Pskov she intended to discuss with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev the problem of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic republics. Sweden's position, Margaretha af Ugglas stressed, is that they should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on Sweden's attitude to the "Partnership for Peace" program, she said that her country will be joining this program. And it would very much like Russia to join this process, too. "Sweden intends to build a new Europe together with Russia, and not against Russia. Russia needs to take reciprocal steps," the minister said.
