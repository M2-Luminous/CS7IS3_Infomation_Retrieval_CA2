ACTION: Public notice; withdrawal. SUMMARY: On January 31, 1994 (59 FR 4281), EPA published a Clean Water Act public notice. This notice was published as the result of an administrative error. It was substantially identical to a notice published in the Federal Register on September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50548). EPA did not intend to provide a second public notice and comment period.
