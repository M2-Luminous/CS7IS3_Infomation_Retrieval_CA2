Thousands of persons participated in the ceremony, including several members of the Cuban leadership, with the obvious exception of Fidel and his brother, Raul Castro, who is the first vice president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba (FAR). Such absences, particularly that of the chief of state, caused surprise. Especially when some of Fidel Castro's bodyguards were seen taking up positions in Ciudad Libertad, formerly Columbia camp, which was the general headquarters of the troops of Dictator Fulgencio Batista, who was defeated by the Castroite guerrillas on 1 January 1959. The media and government have thus far refrained from explaining the absence. Some observers attributed it to the fact that Castro delivered a speech last 1 January in Santiago de Cuba (east) commemorating the revolutionary triumph. On that occasion Castro reiterated his willingness to keep Cuba on the socialist path and expressed his confidence for 1994 following the "most difficult year" ever experienced by the regime since its emergence. The Cuban revolution celebrates 1 January as the day when Cubans began the year 1959 without Batista, who fled on 31 December for Santo Domingo. The guerrilla columns entered Havana and Santiago the following day, 2 January, after the last cells of military resistance surrendered. Only Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Communist Youths (UJC), spoke at the commemorative ceremony and insisted on persevering in the socialist path. Over the past few days Castro's epic event has been widely commented on by the press, which has insistently cited a phrase by the Cuban leader that is currently applicable: "Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that everything will be easier from now on. Perhaps everything will be more difficult."
