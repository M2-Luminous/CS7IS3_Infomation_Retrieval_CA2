FR940627-0-00159 FR940627-0-00019 In general, for existing information to fulfill the Tier 2 testing requirements, it must include the in vivo inhalation exposure to whole motor vehicle emissions (combustion or evaporative, as applicable), except for the few in vitro studies acceptable for carcinogenicity/mutagenicity assessment. In order to be acceptable, previous toxicity studies must include exposure to non-catalyzed emissions, as required in this final rule. EPA is requiring the use of an evaporative emission generator for the evaporative emission testing. However, EPA will accept previous inhalation exposure studies of whole evaporative emissions in which the emissions were generated using standard evaporative emission procedures under FTP conditions. Raw product tests, using F/FAs in the uncombusted state, are not considered adequate replacements for Tier 2 combustion emission testing. In addition, studies using whole aerosolized preparations or tests on individual emission products of the fuel or additive cannot be used as substitutes for whole emission testing for either combustion or evaporative emissions. The reason for this requirement is that, as explained in Section III.A.2 of this preamble, this rule focuses on the effects of whole emissions rather than raw F/FAs or individual emission products. Tests performed on the emissions of F/FAs which are classified in the same group as the subject fuel or additive are considered relevant, but tests on products not conforming to the grouping criteria of the subject fuel or additive do not apply. Other important parameters to consider in determining if existing studies are adequate include: the type and number of test subjects, the number and adequacy of dosages, the methodology and duration of exposure, and the technical methods used for monitoring the progress of the test and for analyzing the results. Generally, 90-days is the minimum acceptable length of exposure. However, an existing study having a shorter exposure period might be considered adequate if the test results are positive, i.e., adverse effects are observed. Previously-conducted studies using mammals other than rodents may be acceptable in lieu of rodent testing, if the existing studies meet all other applicable criteria for adequacy. For carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, the Salmonella assay is always required because of its broad sensitivity and specificity for detecting chemical exposures having mutagenic and/or carcinogenic potential. Manufacturers should note (see Table 2) that when a registrant needs to conduct new Tier 2 testing, two in vivo assays (MN and SCE), in addition to the Salmonella assay, are required to satisfy the carcinogenicity endpoint. However, in lieu of new testing, a manufacturer may rely on one existing in vivo assay for carcinogenicity, in addition to the Salmonella assay and another in vitro assay. In other words, two in vivo tests for carcinogenicity are required if new testing is performed, but only one in vivo study is required if the manufacturer relies on existing carcinogenicity information. The reason for this is that the incremental costs of performing the two specified in vivo assays (MN and SCE) within the 90-day inhalation protocol (as required in this final rule) is low in comparison with the amount of useful data obtained. This approach is cost-effective because the same animals used in the inhalation study can also be used for the in vivo carcinogenicity assays. In fact, fewer resources will be spent to do both the MN and SCE assays within a single group of inhalation-exposed animals than to conduct just one of these tests along with a separate in vitro carcinogenicity assay (in addition to the Salmonella assay). D. Alternative Tier 2 Provision The Tier 2 tests described above pertain to all designated F/FAs, unless mitigated by special provisions or comparable data from adequately performed and documented previous studies. In general, EPA considers this standard testing program to be necessary for the health effects evaluation of F/FA emissions, even if further evaluation may be required under the provisions of Tier 3. However, this final rule also adopts the special provision discussed in the Reopening Notice, under which EPA retains the authority to modify the standard Tier 2 test requirements in certain instances. The exercise of this authority will be done wholly at EPA's initiative and discretion. The alternative Tier 2 provision is intended to provide a degree of flexibility to EPA when available information indicates that, in a specific case, another testing regimen is preferable to the standard set of Tier 2 tests. There are three scenarios under which EPA generally anticipates the possible use of this provision.
