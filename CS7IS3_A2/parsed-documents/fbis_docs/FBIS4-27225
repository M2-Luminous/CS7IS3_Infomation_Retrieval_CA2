Attending the meeting as observers were members of the King's Council and especially the two Buddhist supreme patriarchs, Venerable Mongkol Teppeacha, and Venerable Moha Khousananda. The KoC, representing a legal and legitimate institution established through the free and fair elections in May 1993, concretely responded to His Majesty's initiative for the roundtable. This manifests the KoC delegation's strong support, full of unswerving goodwill, for the King's policy for peace and national reconciliation. (?During the meeting), the KoC delegation proposed that the roundtable should focus on a three-plus-two formula as clearly stated by the King in his 21 November 1993 message. The KoC delegation believes that the implementation of the three-plus-two formula constituted a key solution and displayed the real goodwill of all participants in striving to achieve the King's policy for peace and national reconciliation. The Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]'s delegation reiterated its unconditional, immediate, total, lasting, and unchanging acceptance of an on-the-spot cease-fire throughout the country. The Royal Government's delegation also voiced support for the King's wise proposal for an immediate cease-fire on the spot to begin at noon on 15 June 1994. The RGC also voiced support for the King's initiative on the establishment of an inter-Cambodian monitoring commission to be made up of generals and high-ranking military officials from the KRAF and the Khmer Rouge group with three neutral generals representing the King as the chairman and vice chairmen of the commission. Moreover, the Royal Government's delegation warmly welcomed the appointment of Samdech Chakrei Nhoek Chulong, General Um Manorin, and General Buor Hol respectively as the chairman and vice chairmen of the inter-Cambodian monitoring commission proposed by the King. In this connection, the KoC had earlier mentioned its delegates to this commission. The RGC delegation also proposed that simultaneously with the cease-fire, a [words indistinct] without delaying the cease-fire. The RGC delegation voiced full support for the King's sacred and wise idea solemnly declaring Cambodia as a unified state without any division or secession within its territorial integrity internationally (?respected and) recognized between 1963 and 1964 and as a state of peace, solidarity, national unity, and progress in the joint effort for national reconstruction. But unfortunately, all of the King's ideas and initiatives concerning the above-mentioned unconditional, immediate, total, permanent, and on-the-spot cease-fire throughout Cambodia were vehemently rejected by Mr. Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge, despite an energetic appeal by the King and repeated pleas by the two supreme patriarchs, and Venerable Patriarchs Mongkol Tepeacha and Khousananda. At first, Khieu Samphan proposed that the process of this cease- fire must (?be participated by some foreign countries). Five countries out of the 10 countries in the list that Khieu Samphan proposed for consideration had been elected before as cease-fire observers. It should be noted that the proposed 10 countries are all full-fledged members of the United Nations which had bitter experiences of the Khmer Rouge in the implementation of the Paris agreement. Secondly, the Khmer Rouge proposed that the RGC delegation accept a formula of so-called minimal political program before continuing the discussion on the cease-fire proposed by His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the KoC. There is nothing in this minimal political program. But the Khmer Rouge did this in an attempt to dismantle the KoC's legal and legitimate institutions, namely the National Assembly and RGC born of the general elections arranged and supervised by the United Nations. On 28 May, the participants agreed to issue a joint communique [words indistinct] roundtable for peace and national reconciliation was formed under the chairmanship of the King's representative Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong so as to [words indistinct]. This (?commission) will be made up of four delegates from the KoC side and four others from the Khmer Rouge. It will hold its first meeting on 15 June 1994 at Damnak Chan Hall in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. From this roundtable meeting, it is irrefutable that the Khmer Rouge had displayed their intention not to seek a solution to the remaining Cambodian problems through political means. The Khmer Rouge had used the evil trick of attacking while negotiating. They had tried to internationalize the remaining internal problems of Cambodia [words indistinct] in order to dismantle the Cambodian National Assembly and RGC, which are internationally recognized through the free and fair general elections organized by the United Nations in May 1993. This means that cease-fire which [words indistinct] vehement stubbornness of the Khmer Rouge. [Dated] Chhanghsu-on, 28 May 1994
