Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain was assured of this by his Chinese counterpart Wu Yi at Thursday's opening in Beijing of the tenth meeting of the BLEU-China Joint Committee [for Trade], despite the already high level of trade between the two countries -- worth more than $1 billion in 1993. Mrs. Wu did not specify whether Chinese exports to the BLEU will increase more, or vice-versa, but the total Chinese foreign trade deficit in 1993 gives reason to believe that the former hypothesis will prevail. Internal growth in China will remain high, and high technology imports will continue, especially from the member states of the European Union [EU], said Mrs. Wu, who sees in this an argument for rejecting the reservations voiced by members of the EU concerning the efforts deployed by China to conform with GATT standards. She contests the accusations of dumping, and insists on the continuous growth of foreign investments in China. The leading foreign investment there at the moment is namely the construction of the Shanghai Bell factory, which represents an investment of more than 9 billion Belgian francs [BFr], for which a loan worth over $125 million is about to be granted, specified Minister Urbain. When it goes into production in Putong in 1994, this factory will be the largest production unit in the world for digital telephone lines (5 billion lines per annum -- BELGA editor's note), employing 2,700 people who will figure among the most productive employees in China. Moreover, it is a long-term investment, for the joint venture has been extended until 2013. For its part, ATEA-Belgium [Telephone and Electricity Workshops, Antwerp], which is trying hard to compete with Alacatel-Bell, is making ready to supply the central provinces of China with telecommunications equipment worth $133 million. Currently, the company is waiting for a green light from the regional subsidiaries of the Bank of China. [passage omitted]
