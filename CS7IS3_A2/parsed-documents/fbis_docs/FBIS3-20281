Stuck on the two controversial issues of trade in nuclear materials and foreign banking access in Russia, negotiations have scarcely progressed since December. Although both sides had been confident that the Agreement could be successfully concluded before the visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Brussels on December 9, it emerged that significant problems remained with trade in nuclear fuel and the Russian banking sector. Since then, experts from both sides have attempted to tackle the core of these issues but to no avail. One Russian diplomatic source was very pessimistic for the future of the talks, arguing that it was unlikely that agreement would be reached before the end of March, threatening a further extension of negotiations into April. Trade in Nuclear Fuel The problems surrounding trade in nuclear materials between Russia and the EU countries focus on a draft separate agreement negotiated at an earlier date with the Russians in the framework of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). This draft agreement has been rejected by the Russians who want trade in nuclear products integrated into the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. The Europeans argue that it is crucial to maintain specific regimes on price levels and traded volumes, etc., in the nuclear domain and, as such, the issue must be resolved within a EURATOM accord. In response, the Russians produced new proposals at the end of January outlining their plans for integrating nuclear trade into the Partnership Agreement. The Commission rejected several of the ideas as unclear and contradictory, but is still examining them. Nevertheless, according to one Commission source, it is "highly unlikely" to give a positive response. Banking Block The other stumbling block concerns the controversy over foreign banking facilities. In recent weeks, the Russians have limited the possibilities for foreign banks to operate in their territory, while a tentative agreement on the level of activity of European banks in Russia had already been reached. Nevertheless, the new law considerably limits the activities of foreign banks operating in Russia by restricting their activities to transactions with nonresidents only. Even this means of operating will only be allowed to continue until January 1996. Moreover, only those banks with existing links with Russian residents before November 15, 1993 will be allowed to stay in business. The European Union, for its part, is prepared to limit foreign banking activity in Russia, but on the basis of other, less demanding, conditions. It is prepared to prevent the establishment of any new branches of foreign banks on Russian territory and to limit deposits to those over ECU100,000 which would concentrate foreign bank activity on large-scale enterprises. Furthermore, the EU would outlaw transactions on privatisation shares and Russian bonds while granting a licence to those foreign banks already established in Russia to allow them to continue operating.
