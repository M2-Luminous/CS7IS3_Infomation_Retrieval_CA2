We were lucky enough to meet today in Egypt, the country with the greatest and most profound experience in war and peace, to begin together the first steps on the path that we hope will lead us to our dream and the dream of generations, the dream of achieving a permanent, just, and comprehensive peace. I register here for Egypt, the land of civilizations, its people, Government, and president, its essential and effective contribution to what has been achieved, a contribution that encourages us to be optimistic about the future when we all proceed together side by side to complete the process and provide the guarantees for its success. Gentlemen, our people have chosen the path of peace and expressed this choice with the most sophisticated means of action. Their glorious struggle for peace was the subject of admiration by the entire world just as their steadfastness in the struggle for existence was an unparalleled miracle in this and any other age. As we take the first and most important step on the ground, we realize that peace is not made through agreements and documents alone, but gains its vitality and viability by its ability to achieve the interests of peoples and by the extent to which it can match their daily needs and its relationship with their dreams. With this understanding, I would like to speak in the language of the future and address my words first to our Israeli partners, the other party to the equation and the other party with which we have long fought and with which we are trying now to shape new relations to end past calamities and tragedies to benefit peace and tranquility today and in future. I tell our partners: You have fought long but even at the peak of your strength you never felt peace and security. Every day, every moment, there was something that disturbed and frightened you. This is because strength, however great it may be, can never cancel the feeling of the harm of isolation from your geographical and human environment and can never prevent the pain from the constant bleeding in your body and the body of those you are fighting. We have stretched our hand out to you to get rid of all the pains of the past. You, and among you there are some who support the peace we are creating at this critical time and others who are against it, you shoulder the major part of the responsibility for the coming success or failure, God forbid. As we see it, your responsibility begins by getting rid of the old thinking that is full of fears and doubts and the endless search for guarantees, which affects the core of the interests of others, to replace them with a creative approach to tomorrow's requirements, in which your partners in the peace course will feel reassured and confident of the usefulness and permanency of cooperating with you. This has nothing to do with a new language we find ourselves speaking but with a new spirit that is reflected in behavior on every level. You have achieved peace with Egypt, the biggest country in our Arab world. You are today trying to achieve peace with the Palestinian people, whose cause it is, a people at the center of the conflict. I do not doubt for a single moment your mature awareness of a self-evident truth that says that peace in our region cannot become firmly established and guaranteed without completing its interconnected links so as to see it also achieved with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan in the clearest terms and fairest contexts. While we feel increasingly confident when we hear about serious actions to resume the efforts to achieve peace with our remaining brothers, we do not hide from you our fears for everything that has been achieved if it is not completed soon with its other Arab links. It has probably become clear to you and to the whole world that the essence and dimensions of the peace with the neighboring countries are not confined to the geographic scale of the regional map and its borders but are much deeper, because it should be a peace with the great nation, from the Ocean to the Gulf. Fears will remain and an inadequate, if not nonexistent, sense of security will remain if we do not put this at the center of our attention and efforts. On such a day, I address our Palestinian people. Among them there is not one family that has not lost a martyr recently to the convoys of martyrs who have fallen since the start of the conflict and throughout every chapter and whose precious sacrifices have built the bridge to the peace station. The children of the intifadah and their sacrifices [applause] have ripened this historic moment. We tell our vibrant, alert, and very cultured people that we feel your pulse, share your fears, and understand your observations on the formulas we have reached between Oslo and this day. But with you we see an opportunity for a new coming together to wage a new experiment. How great it is to start with difficulty on the ground and how much more miserable it is to continue to easily adopt verbal slogans and remain confined by their restrictions. We will meet on the same ground to share in the sweetness and bitterness of our new life, to struggle to rebuild the society and homeland that has been exhausted by the long and bitter war and that has planted many illnesses in its heart. We will struggle together for the dream that will never leave us as long as we live, the dream of freedom and independence, the dream of the beautiful life for our children and grandchildren, the dream of the hopes and assuredness on the soil of our homeland, the dream of enjoying dignity under our sun and skies, the dream of the creative contribution to the building of our region and the consolidation of the pillars of its stability, and the dream of the creative cultural link with our Arab and Islamic nation and with the whole world, without wars and their calamitous requirements. Yesterday when Nelson Mandela [applause] dropped his voting card in the ballot box we heard him say: I feel a dream has come true. Today we say we feel that the march toward our hopes has effectively begun. Still at the beginning of the road, we extend an intimate and loving call to our brothers who either reject, have reservations about, or have fears regarding our steps: Come to the house so that we can build it together, close the windows of evil together, make the best of the opportunity, and besiege the chances of danger with all our force. We sincerely call for a national mobilization where efforts and capabilities are integrated to achieve our present and future missions on democratic bases and with a view toward building modern institutions that will ensure for our pluralistic society the best factors of progress and development and boost our national aspirations, only the first steps of which we have achieved, with all the factors that will allow them to be realized. Let us work together for the sake of repatriation, for Jerusalem [applause], on which we are about to enter negotiations, and for fulfilling the requirements and tasks of the final stage of the peace process in all its aspects. The homeland we are hoping for is one for all the Palestinians. Let us build it on its soil, not on impossible slogans that only distance us from it. On this day we address the new world, which is being shaped in a new climate and under new considerations, saying that the opening of the file of peace in the Middle East was the most courageous step toward building a new international order, or let us say new international life, on the rubble of the Cold War and its scores of destructive regional and civil wars. The Middle East, which burdened the conscience of the world for half a century, troubling international interests and placing them at the mercy of instability, deserves further international efforts to entrench its new ambitious image. Any serious and effective contribution to ensure the stability and growth of this part of the world is, in essence, a vital contribution to the stability of everybody's interests in their every form and content. Finally, we extend our appreciation to Warren Christopher [applause], who is joining us in celebrating these historic moments, and it pleases us to convey through him our greetings to the American people, the U.S. Administration, and President Clinton, who continued to work to achieve peace in our region. I also greet Mr. Kozyrev [applause]. We are pleased to convey through him our greetings to the people and Government of Russia and to President Boris Yeltsin. It is perhaps also useful to refer with appreciation and loyalty to the Government of Norway and to remember late Foreign Minister Johan Holst and his creative efforts [applause]. We do not forget the positions and initiatives of every nation, each working as much as it could to support and sponsor the peace process. I particularly refer to our fraternal Arab Maghreb countries, which played a major and creative role in embodying the Palestinian character and its political reality, and also to our brothers in the Arabian Gulf countries, who, from the beginning, joined us in the peace process, on both the bilateral and multilateral tracks. I call on them today to translate the slogan of frankness and reconciliation into action on the ground [applause]. I also salute our brothers in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, who are moving with us along the road of peace with great confidence and the fraternal cohesion that embodies the nation's interests and aspirations. As we prepare to embark on the return trip to the homeland, we do not forget green Tunisia, its hospitable people, and its president, who protectively embraced us in the hardest of times and who honorably and fraternally supported us [applause]. Mr. President, this is an additionally good act by you on your birthday. We congratulate you [applause]. We do not only say thank you; we will engrave this act in our hearts and will plant it on the boundaries of our homeland so that the generations will remember your position and noble work. Peace be upon you. [applause]
