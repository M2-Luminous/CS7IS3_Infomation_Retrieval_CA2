COB Finance Secretary Carlos Camargo said the bill that has been submitted to Congress had "an artificial beginning" because it was not based on a "consensus" with representative Bolivian institutions. Camargo added: "It does not have the support and the essence of active participation by civilian society." Camargo then said he was optimistic that national authorities will reflect and discuss the bill recently proposed by the chief of state. He reminded the government that the COB "was never against the implementation of a popular participation law; we did it in 1983 with the materialization of regional health programs, which set the stage for a larger program." Camargo added, however, that the bill recently announced to the country by the president of the Republic does not have the support of the great national majority. The COB leader warned: "It undoubtedly will meet the peoples' opposition because a law that has this sort of beginning has no future." Mining leader Lucio Gonzales, COB social security secretary, said the popular participation law is nothing other than "evil for Bolivian labor organizations." He charged that the government, deep inside, intends to "bury labor unions in Bolivia to make room for neighborhood and peasant organizations that have little experience in Bolivia." Gonzales said: "They have planned this carefully; with the law's implementation the COB and labor union organization demands will unavoidably disappear, thus clearing the way for them to implement their anti-patriotic and anti-popular policy."
