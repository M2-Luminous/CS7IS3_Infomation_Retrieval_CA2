On 4 May, Chief of the State Duma Staff Andrey Voykov and General Director of the Steepler Company Maksim Selivanov signed a general agreement on the creation of the Duma Data and Communications Complex (IKK). The first stage of the effort ended as early as today: The computer network has been installed, tested, and started up; Steepler has embarked on user training, and the deputies have begun to test the complex at work and submit individual wishes. According to a business plan submitted by Steepler, the tentative cost of the complex comes to $30 million. No official competition or tender to automate the State Duma was held. At any rate, in the words of company president Andrey Cheglakov, Steepler has not happened to encounter competition, even if the Duma staff considered alternative variants. Mr. Cheglakov believes that there was simply no time to hold a tender in keeping with all the rules. Indeed, 100 days have already passed since the Duma began its work, but its location was not finally determined until the end of April. As soon as the specific floor space became known after the move into the building of the former State Planning Committee, Mr. Voykov, who has great experience with automation, made his choice. An extremely tight schedule for making deliveries and performing work was one of the conditions of the project. Steepler has accumulated great experience in the area of comprehensive automation of enterprises (its customers include the Staff of the President of Russia, the Bank for Foreign Trade, and Surgutneftegaz). Steepler has included in its staff specialists who at one time took part in the computerization of the CPSU Central Committee, the Staff of the USSR President, the USSR Supreme Soviet, and other structures. Incidentally, the perestroyka history of automation of deputy work began with an order from Anatoliy Lukyanov. The Supreme Soviet he headed was equipped with Macintosh computers made by the Apple company with specially designed automated work stations for deputies. The fate of this complex is traceable up to the October events of last year in the White House, and thereafter the trace is lost. In view of the fact that Steepler has the status of wholesaler (large wholesale supplier) of the Hewlett Packard company, the current IKK of the Duma has been designed on the basis of network equipment, computers, and peripherals of this American company. A dozen Epson dot matrix printers and Panasonic communications and office equipment account for an insignificant proportion of the total volume of equipment. Each Duma deputy will receive a work station worth $15,000-20,000. It will be possible to quickly dismantle the entire complex and move it to another building: The Duma is making provisions for the event of moving yet again. Mr. Cheglakov views the assignment of the Duma automation order specifically to a Russian company also as a manifestation of protectionism: This is an effective way for the state to support Russian business. Perhaps counting on the continuation of such practices, Steepler, which used to bet on developing a dealership chain, has changed priorities in its operations somewhat. At present the company gives preference to the implementation of large projects involving the comprehensive automation of enterprises. [Boxed item] Commentary The world understood long ago that legislative authorities wishing to work efficiently must be computerized. The case of the U.S. Congress is perhaps the most impressive. The computerization of the Congress began as early as 1974. Annually no less than $1 billion is appropriated to maintain a colossal data and computer network. The House of Representatives and the Senate have their own networks; not only each legislator but also his aides have computerized work stations. However, giving everyone a computer is just the beginning. The effectiveness of operation of a network depends on its interaction with nationwide databases. The computer networks of the U.S. Congress have access to all databases of the country (there are about 10 that are the most important), and have an opportunity to retrieve any data, from a quote from a provincial newspaper on any topic to data about world industrial output broken down by sector. There also is a database of the Congress itself drawing on the Library of Congress. At present, the transfer of its records to laser disks is being completed. As a result, the staff of the U.S. Congress is capable of not only criticizing or knowledgeably supporting the draft laws of the administration, but also of developing in detail a full-fledged alternative draft budget (this means thousands of pages of text). In general, computerization is a good foundation for legislative fertility: During one session the U.S. Congress passes more than 20,000 laws, and is in a position to monitor the execution of any one of them.
