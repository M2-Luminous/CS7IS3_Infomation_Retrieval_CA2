The aim of this is to reconcile the nation and put an end to the Vietnamese war of aggression, thereby restoring peace, independence, national unity, and territorial integrity. Democratic Kampuchea and the entire Cambodian nation and people have supported the king's initiative and have undertaken all kinds of activities to speed up the call for the roundtable meeting with a view to quickly ending the sufferings of our nation and people. Nonetheless, the communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government, abiding by the advice of the communist Vietnamese and their alliance, have persistently opposed the king's initiative. At this present time they are continuing their opposition to the roundtable. They have impudently said that reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge must be brought about by guns and that the Khmer Rouge should be smashed to pieces. [Words indistinct] the communist Vietnamese puppets and two- headed government were very busy buying armaments, ammunition, tanks, and cannons for the purpose of launching offensive attacks on Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people. They launched an audacious attack on Stoung and Phnum Chhat in August 1993. Afterward, they attacked Anlung Veng and Pailin in the most brutal and barbarous manner. During their attacks, they indiscriminately massacred our people. They also plundered and completely destroyed houses, property, and farms that had taken our people several years to build in difficult conditions. Hundreds of thousands of people, with their children, run away from their houses and villages to escape from the criminal activities of those bandits. The two-headed government, the communist Vietnamese, and the alliance, which is their master, declared that those criminal activities were their great victories. They claimed they had destroyed the Khmer Rouge at this or that area and had occupied and captured this or that Khmer Rouge position, and so on. The aforementioned events have been given very wide coverage both nationally and internationally. It is the communist Vietnamese puppets, the two-headed government, the communist Vietnamese, and their alliance which have opposed the king's national reconciliation plan and further inflamed the Vietnamese war of aggression. At present, our Cambodian people are denouncing them and jointly attacking them everywhere. This is to force them to accept the king's five-point national reconciliation plan.
