Fujii, speaking at a press conference after a two-day meeting of APEC finance ministers here, gave high credits to the gathering but reserved his comments on making it a regular one. "It is first necessary to create an environment that facilitates flow of private funds in the APEC nations which has become a world growth center," Fujii said. In a joint statement issued at the end of the conference, the 17 APEC ministers agreed to develop their capital markets and improve capital flows as their principles of policy formation in the region. Praising the first-ever gathering of the APEC finance ministers, Fujii said, "we were able to learn together with (other APEC) nations that are continuing to stage diverse (economic) growth." Fujii confirmed that the ministers agreed to meet again next year in Indonesia but he showed a negative stance on holding it regularly. "It moves under the atmosphere at that time." Meanwhile, Japanese officials quoted Fujii as saying at the meeting that the APEC nations must pursue "sound macroeconomic policy primarily to raise domestic savings to maintain high economic growth." They also said Fujii offered financial support both bilaterally and multilaterally to other APEC nations.
