Situation in the Bryansk region mirrors that in other regions, which were exposed to the Chernobyl fallout, said Petr Kuzmin, head of the radiological medicine department of the public health board under the Bryansk regional administration. Almost 500,000 inhabitants of the Bryansk region live in the territory polluted with radionuclides. Since 1990, mortality rate has exceeded birth rate by six persons per 1,000 (in some districts, by 10 persons per 1,000). General morbidity has grown markedly over the years - a fact related to undermined immune systems. Complications registered at pregnancy and childbirth have increased threefold, and the number of congenital anomalies and malignant tumors have doubled over the past five years. The incidence of the thyroid gland cancer has increased fivefold. Before 1987, there had not been a single case of a child suffering from the disease on record in the region, whereas at present local endocrinologists and oncologists are dealing with 20 such cases. In expert opinion, the incidence of oncological and hereditary diseases will continue to grow over the next 10-15 years.
