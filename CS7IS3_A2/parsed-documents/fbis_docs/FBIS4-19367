Denktas has assessed the latest situation in the indirect talks between the two sides in Cyprus for the TURKISH CYPRIOT NEWS AGENCY. Accusing the Greek Cypriot side of rupturing the package of confidence-building measures [CBM's], he said they must repair it. Denktas stressed that significant pressure has been directed on the Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree to the package and noted that the changes effected in the package concern the issue of sovereignty and as such cannot be accepted. Denktas recalled that Glavkos Kliridhis strongly reacted to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's latest intermediary report: ``Kliridhis revealed that he had seen the initial draft of that report. He also complained that particular changes were made to its final form in favor of the Turkish Cypriots. Consequently, the Greek Cypriots have regarded it as a moderate document against the Turkish Cypriots. Why have the Greek Cypriots described the report as a moderate document? Obviously, somebody must have made other promises to them. That person also showed them the initial draft of the report. That person, whoever he may be, has definitely not facilitated the talks by playing such a game. The Greek Cypriot community has described the CBM's package as a `catastrophic' document. Kliridhis can talk on behalf of that community, including the other Greek Cypriot leaders, the Greek Cypriot Church, and EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters]. What has he said to them? Let me outline things: `Do not worry. In essence, I have agreed to nothing. I have purportedly agreed to the CBM's package for tactical purposes because the Turkish Cypriot side is confronted with several problems. The Turkish Cypriots cannot agree to that package as it stands.' That is why Kliridhis has said he `is ready to accept the CBM's package, providing the Turkish Cypriot leader does likewise.' What does that mean? The UN officials have been unable to assess that. They expect us to transfer Maras to the Greek Cypriots without receiving anything tangible in return.'' Denktas said that Kliridhis' main objective is to have the Greek Cypriots enter Maras. Stressing that the Greek Cypriot leader cares for nothing else, Denktas asserted that the Turkish Cypriot side calls for the establishment of a functional UN Administration and for a tangible form to the rights and powers it will gain. He stressed: ``Kliridhis has not even informed the other political party leaders of the second `nondocument paper,' which he purported to accept for tactical reasons... How can that be? The Turkish Cypriot side is expected to make concessions for an agreement that the Greek Cypriot side does not wish to accept... Why is that so? What will happen to the concessions we may make if the Greek Cypriot side rejects the agreement? We will have made concessions for nothing. But the Greek Cypriot side's position in the next round of talks will be a step ahead of us... Can the Turkish Cypriots be expected to make concessions in accordance with the promises that are made by this or that person? Why have U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher and the other officials not documented in a tangible way what they have verbally guaranteed? They are working on the text of an agreement, which will say that we `will place Maras under UN jurisdiction and the Greek Cypriots will return to that area.' That will be put on record... What will the Turkish Cypriots receive in return?'' I Have Been Subjected to Pressure Recalling that significant pressure has been directed on the Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree to the initial CBM's package, Denktas stressed that the Turkish Cypriots have remained within the parameters promised to them. So, he said, the ball is in the Greek Cypriot court. Reiterating the Turkish Cypriot side's views on the status of Dhimokratias Avenue in Maras, Denktas asserted: ``We insisted that we retain the north of Dhimokratias Avenue so that the security of the Port of Famagusta and its environs can be guaranteed. But the UN secretary general clearly informed us as follows: `You will retain the access road to Maras in the south of that area. Travel to and from Maras will be under your control. The UN officials will be responsible for law and order in Maras... The issue of security cannot be an excuse...' Considering that, we agreed to give up Dhimokratias Avenue. But afterward, the UN General Secretariat moved immediately to say: `The exercise on Maras will be meaningless if the access road is not placed under UN jurisdiction. A massive hole was drilled in the package in favor of the Greek Cypriots. I have repeatedly said that `I cannot have the TRNC Republican Assembly and the Turkish Cypriot people agree to that package with such a hole in it.' But no one seems to understand.'' Stressing that the package must be repaired by the Greek Cypriots because they are responsible for rupturing it, Denktas asserted that nothing can be achieved by blaming the Turkish Cypriot side and that maintaining the talks is the only way to solve the problem. Clark's Disclosures Recalling that the UN General Secretariat submitted the initial CBM's package to the two sides on the condition that "it cannot be changed and that the Turkish and Greek Cypriots must remain within its framework," Denktas stressed that the UN General Secretariat drilled a hole in the CBM's package in favor of the Greek Cypriots without the consent of the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas also assessed remarks by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative to Cyprus, to journalists in New York. Stressing that the benefits and rights the Turkish Cypriots stand to gain from the first package have been given no tangible form, Denktas recalled the promises made to the Turkish Cypriot side in return for Maras and noted that he was informed that several of those promises would be fulfilled if he agreed to place the area under UN jurisdiction. He described that as "an unreliable situation." Asserting that a tangible form must be given to the promises made to the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said that the changes effected in the package against the Turkish Cypriots cannot be described as being of "secondary importance," because they have harmed the essence of the package and indicated that the promises made have been rescinded. Denktas stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side must retain its control of the access road to Maras in the south of that area and noted that the issue is vitally important for the Turkish Cypriots. Recalling the UN secretary general's promise on the issue, Denktas said that no one seems to remember it apart from the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas asserted that the promises made to the Turkish Cypriot side on the Nicosia International Airport have not been fulfilled either. He stressed that the failure of the UN officials to fulfill their promises has disrupted the balance. But no one seems to care about that, he said. Denktas reiterated that the Turkish Cypriot side is prepared to maintain the indirect talks and blamed Glavkos Kliridhis for creating a deadlock in the negotiating process. He said: "We maintain our contacts with the UN officials... We will see what will happen in four weeks." Arguing that Joe Clark, in a bid to satisfy the Greek Cypriot side, wants to force the Turkish Cypriots to agree to various issues, Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side only wants the promises that were made fulfilled.
