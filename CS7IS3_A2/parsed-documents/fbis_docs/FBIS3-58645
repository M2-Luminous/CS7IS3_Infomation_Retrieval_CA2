A few hours later, in fact, we learned of the resignation of Yegor Gaydar, the very symbol of that reform policy. This departure by the former prime minister may seem logical. Yegor Gaydar, who, with Boris Yeltsin, was the main loser in the 12 December parliamentary elections, is merely acting on the defeat of his party, Russia's Choice, which despite considerable resources and unconditional support from television, was clearly overtaken by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. This election highlighted one of the main handicaps of Yegor Gaydar and his friends: Their inability to show they understand the fate and concerns of their compatriots. Although he does not refer to this in his resignation letter -- he preferred to "go out" on two stronger themes, and especially the very costly construction of a new parliament building -- Yegor Gaydar, and the whole liberal wing of the government, were seriously weakened by the December election. His influence within the executive was reduced accordingly. What the government will lose in talent and international reputation -- rightly or wrongly, Mr. Gaydar was regarded as the guarantor of reforms with regard to the Western governments and the international financial institutions -- it could perhaps gain in cohesion. [Prime Minister] Viktor Chernomyrdin's previous "team" was characterized by a plethora of staff and serious disagreements among the ministers. What could the advocates of ultraliberalism and the supporters of the "status quo" do together other than what they have done for two years -- namely, implement a seesawing economic policy that in many cases succeeded in combining the injustices of rampant liberalism and the cumbersome aspects of a persistent collectivism? Viktor Chernomyrdin's hour seems to have come. Chosen by Boris Yeltsin in December 1992, but from the list put forward by the Supreme Soviet deputies to replace Yegor Gaydar, this representative of big industry is particularly in favor with the president since his declared loyalty during the "White House" insurrection last October. The prime minister will henceforth have a free hand to implement the "centrist" policy he advocates. This team, smaller and more homogeneous, will nonetheless have to define and impose this mythical third path which aspires to be both reformist and social.
