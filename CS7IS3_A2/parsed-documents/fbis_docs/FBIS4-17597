"A meeting of the (U.N.) Security Council convened at the initiative of Russia has decided that the decisions made by NATO in response to the request of the U.N. secretary general to protect Gorazde and other 'safe havens' in Bosnia were correct," a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement issued in Moscow on Monday. "Grave as the present situation is, military measures must not replace the principal line, that towards a peaceful settlement. We expect that the Bosnian parties and our partners seeking a settlement will be actively involved in the process." Russia's settlement program has the following principal elements, the spokesman said: 1. Tighter regulations for safe havens in Bosnia on the basis of U.N. Security Council decisions. 2. An agreement between Serbs and Muslims for an indefinite and universal cease-fire. Such a document has already been drafted and must be signed as soon as possible without any reservations. All parties to the conflict must realize that the international community will tolerate no more provocations or barbaric responses to them. Both mean disregard for the United Nations. 3. Embarking on a comprehensive peaceful settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such a decision must take account of the legitimate interests and equal rights of all three peoples of Bosnia. A Muslim-Croat federation would form no basis for the future of the Bosnian Serbs. The sharing of territory must be based on earlier plans and be carried out only by negotiation. A political agreement must naturally involve all humanitarian aspects of the Bosnian problem. 4. Progress towards peace in Bosnia must be accompanied by weaker sanctions against Yugoslavia. "There is a need for active work both on the part of special envoys to the former Yugoslavia and on the part of the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and the European Union, with the participation of the United Nations. This would provide a basis for convening in the near future a summit on a settlement in Bosnia," the spokesman said.
