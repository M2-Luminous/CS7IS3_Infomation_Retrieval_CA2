The participants in the current session have held discussions on such topics as reform, development, and stability; drawn on collective wisdom; absorbed all useful ideas; acted as masters of the country; and demonstrated a strong sense of mission. A large number of work reports and resolutions have been deliberated on and adopted at the current session, thereby affirming our achievements; summing up experiences; laying down clear-cut tasks, goals, and work measures for this year; and fully embodying the will and aspirations of the people of all nationalities in Yunnan. The current congress session has been a successful, democratic, united, truth-seeking, and confidence-boosting meeting, capable of mobilizing the people of all nationalities in Yunnan to work with one heart and one mind, continually carry out explorations, and constantly forge ahead. Now that the current congress session has laid down clear-cut goals and tasks for Yunnan's reform, construction, and development in 1994, the crux of the matter lies in carrying out these goals and tasks to the letter and in conducting our work in a down-to-earth manner. Yin Jun concluded his speech by saying: Let us unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core; hold aloft the great banner of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and mobilize and unite the people of all nationalities across the province to bravely forge ahead to build a new socialist economy structure and to fulfill all the economic and social development goals set for this year under the leadership of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee!
