The report begins with clips in Zhirinovskiy's 47th birthday in Moscow recently, where he received Gerhard Frey, chairman of the German People's Union, and Iraqi ambassador to Russia Gafil Husayn, who wished him well. The reporter notes that Zhirinovskiy and Iraq's Saddam Husayn are comrades because of their "joint hatred for the Jews." The report then flashes back to the time after the putsch against Gorbachev. At a meeting in the Kremlin in September 1991, Zhirinovskiy is shown engaging in "political forecasts": "There will be only one unified Russia; no autonomous republics. The bolsheviks have experimented. This has failed. Now come the democrats. This will fail, too. And then I will come." At some unidentified outdoor rally, Zhirinovskiy is seen speaking to a crowd of people: "I reach my hands out for the nuclear weapons. I will put an end to Russia's humiliation. Our Army will stay there, and not one single Georgian combat plane will ever again shoot down a Russian pilot. No gang of Afghans will ever again violate the border again. Not one single kilogram of Russian goods will ever again be stolen. No one will harm even one hair on a Russian's head. Then they will feel what Russia is. But those guys in the Kremlin are just dragging themselves, groaning and panting, from the buffet to the toilet. That is all that they are still able to do. When Moldovan bandits saw a Russian to pieces with a chainsaw, I will destroy their industry -- quite simple. And when in Kyrgyzstan a Russian is torn apart by two horses, I will destroy the entire region." An unidentified officer in the crowd speaks up, holding out his right arm in the fascist salute: "Vladimir Volfovich, we officers support you." There follow clips on interviews with people in the street, who all support Zhirinovskiy: "Zhirinovskiy is great, much better than Yeltsin. He defends Russia. He stops the sell-out of the nation." "He speaks very well, above all soberly." "He describes everything correctly. The nation is being oppressed, our nation." The reporter notes that Zhirinovskiy supported the "putsch of the Stalinist nomenklatura against Gorbachev." Zhirinovskiy is shown commenting on the putsch: "There should not have made so many telephone calls; they should simply have shot everyone involved in the sabotage. When Russia's interior minister did not follow orders, the officers should have liquidated him within five minutes. Just as with Pinochet: Shoot a few officers, and the putsch would have been successful. A few combat helicopters should have bombed the White House to rubble, and the entire gang should have been arrested. Everything is rotten. All generals are senile. They are incompetent. That is why they lost. It could have worked, and then this would have been a different country here -- a powerful USSR." The report then continues with film clips on Zhirinovskiy showing his bodyguards his former headquarters in the Moscow hotel. Explaining the uniforms his bodyguards wear, closely modeled on German uniforms during the Third Reich, Zhirinovskiy notes: "We have meanwhile become a powerful organization, and the boys wanted a uniform. This commits them to our cause and they feel like full party members." Zhirinovskiy says that he will make sure that a memorial plaque is mounted in the room where his party headquarters was located during the presidential elections. In the new party headquarters in Moscow's "Fishmonger's Lane," guards wear "contemporary" German uniforms. The building also houses the party's youth organization. Its head, V. Akhimov, says: "Our party developed practically out of nothing in very turbulent times. We have won thousands of followers virtually overnight, just as Hitler's party did in the past. It, too, won its followers before it came to power. The second common point: Hitler came to power legally, through elections. We, too. Our party is legal. Therefore, we will come to power in line with the Constitution. Third, Hitler pursued a tough national policy. He did a lot of good for the Germans. Today we are pursuing the same policy, but here in our country. We want Russians to be well off in Russia." The reporter notes that "for this purpose, firm friendships abroad are also needed. Russia's Hitler feels particularly comfortable with Iraqi dictator Saddam Husayn." Zhirinovskiy is shown pointing at a world map and saying: "Our Arab friends are our most reliable partners. And here you see Europe. We fought against the Finnish, the Swedish, the Poles, the Hungarians, and the Romanians. The only really consistently reliable partner is Germany." Then follow film clips of a festive event organized during Gerhard Frey's recent visit to Moscow. Toasting Zhirinovskiy, Frey says: "We want you to become the leader of strong, large, just, and rich Russia. Together with millions of Russians, we see you as Russia's hope. In this spirit, I drink to our personal friendship and to the eternal and inseparable friendship of our peoples. Long live Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, long live Russia." Zhirinovskiy, for his part, says: "I would like to add that, to implement our plans, we need German precision and the courage of the Russian people. In the Middle Ages [as heard] in Germany there was an attempt to establish a new order in Europe. This did not work out. And in Moscow there was an attempt to establish a new order at the end of the century. This did not work, either. To German Prussia and to Russian Alaska." The reporter then notes that, despite Zhirinovsky's heavy drinking, he, together with a uniformed delegation, was invited to Baghdad. "After all, Russians and Iraqis have a common enemy," the reporter says. In Baghdad, Zhirinovskiy is shown saying: "Everywhere there is war, there are Americans. Wherever there are diseases, they come from the United States --AIDS, drunkenness, moral decline -- everything comes from the United States." The youth organization is not so happy about this enemy image. V. Akhimov says: "Actually, I do not want to wage war against the United States, because both countries have the same, threatening problems -- our government, our press, science, and arts are very deeply permeated by Jews, and this also applies to the United States. I do not understand that -- as if there were no talented, intelligent, educated people among the Russians. Of course, they exist. However, again and again, one is confronted with the following situation: A Russian employs everyone who can work in his company. A Jew, however, always only takes a Jew." Then Zhirinovskiy is shown speaking at some rally: "As a result of World War I, the rule of the Zionists developed. They intended to take over world leadership. However, they miscalculated. They thought: After Lenin comes Trotsky -- and he agreed to it, too. However, thanks to the communist revolution, that did not work. Then they planned World War II, the invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia. All this was planned by Zionists. They thought that they would also be able to oust the regime in our country. However, they miscalculated, in particular as regards Russia. Everywhere they ousted governments. They forced Germany to its knees and had a firm grip on the country. And today Germany is no longer a danger to us." The reporter notes that, "in contrast to the group of old communists and also in contrast to Gorbachev and Yeltsin, the uninhibited populist is looking for contact with the people." Zhirinovskiy is shown walking through a street, talking to people, including a cripple sitting on the ground. According to the reporter, "Zhirinovskiy is demagogically exploiting mass fears of humiliation, fear of unemployment, poverty, and crime." He says: "You will be even worse off when you vote for the wrong people again. None of these parties will save you. They are all too small for that. Today only a government of personal power can still save the situation. The former state -- despite its big disadvantages -- at least produced the most powerful weapons in the world: nuclear, chemical, bacteriological, and space weapons. Everyone was afraid of us. This was a positive foreign policy factor. People are afraid -- thus, one is respected. The entire world is based on this principle." Zhirinovskiy and his people are again attending communist demonstrations. During one of these rallies, the reporter and his camera team ask some of the demonstrators why they are here. The people are extremely hostile toward the reporters and do not want to be filmed. Many revile them as Jews. The report concludes with clips of Zhirinovskiy's birthday party. Regarding Zhirinovskiy's future plans, the reporter notes that at the first meeting of the newly elected parliament, Zhirinovskiy plans to put forward a motion for an immediate amnesty of all the 1991 and October 1993 putschists. This report is followed by a 10-minute report by Thomas Amman and Mark Brasse on Zhirinovskiy's "Greater German friends." The report begins with clips of the search of the T.V.O. company offices on 6 January, a former cover firm for the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in Berlin, where material was found proving that millions of German marks in SED property were illegally transferred abroad after the upheaval in the GDR. Josef Dierdorf of the Trust Agency notes that 4 million German marks were transferred to some unknown place via the T.V.O. The money seems to have ended up in secret accounts in East Europe. According to the reporter, the main suspect is West Berlin entrepreneur Werner Girke, who "discretely administered the communists' assets abroad in GDR times." Girke's impounded documents also show that he is reportedly dealing with Russian neofascist Zhirinovskiy. Dierdorf notes that "there are corresponding statements that one of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's associates spent up to six weeks here at the T.V.O. last summer and autumn and cultivated intensive contacts there." Then follow clips on Zhirinovskiy's meeting with DVU Chairman Gerhard Frey in Munich last December. Frey welcomes him by saying: "Welcome! We are all happy to see you. Wonderful! A wonderful victory, a great victory, fantastic. Congratulations!" The report continues with footage on Zhirinovskiy's visit to Austria. At Vienna's Schwechat Airport he says: "Today there are many industrialists in West Europe that I would like to meet. One must research economic problems more thoroughly. This is the most important thing now. Today I am just coming from Germany. Soon I want to go to Australia, perhaps also to Zurich for a change." In Austria, Zhirinovskiy is accompanied by his financial adviser Aleksey Videnkin, the man who stayed with Girke last year, according to the reporter. Zhirinovskiy was invited to Austria by Carinthian industrialist Edwin Neuwirth. From the Austrian Animal Protection Society, Zhirinovskiy receives a cable that is read by one of his aides: "Dear Mr. Zhirinovskiy. If Alaska is included in the Russian Empire, we request that you make sure the local wildlife, in particular grizzlies and seals, are protected. Thank you on behalf of the Austrian Animal Protection Society. Anton (Zadik)." In Austria, Zhirinovskiy also met with a number of European businessmen. Regarding these meetings, Edwin Neuwirth says: "When businessmen learned that he was visiting me, some people from Slovenia and Croatia come -- not from Serbia, as was reported. There was not a single Serb here. There were some from Bulgaria, etc. These people knew him from past business dealings. Thus, they discussed various things." Neuwirth claims that he does not know what was discussed. When asked by the reporter whether any businessmen from Germany were there, he says "no" after hesitating for a fraction of a second. The report notes that Zhirinovskiy and his troops were attentively watched "by a dozen plainclothes investigators from an antiterrorism unit of the Austrian State Police." When Michael Sika, director general of public security, is asked whether he knows whom Zhirinovskiy met, he says yes, the State Police knows, but he refuses to comment on any details. The reporter says that the journalists who were present did not get to see any of the visiting businessmen, only Zhirinovskiy, his bodyguards, and a certain Svetoslav Stoilov, a Bulgarian exile who is Zhirinovskiy's liaison in Vienna. Journalist Hannes Reichmann says: "An entrepreneurs' summit took place. Entrepreneurs -- I put it cautiously, let us say ambiguous entrepreneurs -- from all over Europe met here, who already expect that Mr. Zhirinovskiy will soon become president. I quote Stoilov, who said that it will take only four to five months until Mr. Zhirinovskiy is president. He was unable to explain how this would take place, but is convinced that it will happen." When Zhirinovskiy wanted to visit Germany again on 29 December, he was refused an entry visa. According to Neuwirth, he had been invited by Werner Girke and his associates, who did not even know that Zhirinovskiy would not be permitted to enter but learned about this matter only when Neuwirth told them. Foreign Minister Kinkel is asked about the entry ban and the conditions under which he would be willing to receive Zhirinovskiy. Kinkel says: "I refused to let Mr. Zhirinovskiy enter the country. However, at the same time I stated that in the future the matter will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis as to whether or not he will be permitted to enter. I do not want to speculate on such questions. I do not intend to give a theoretical answer." Kinkel also refuses to comment on Zhirinovskiy's activities in Austria, because he does not want to "interfere in other countries' internal affairs." He also claims not to know that Zhirinovskiy met with German businessmen in Austria and says that, if this is true, this is the businessmen's business. The report concludes by noting that it is not yet entirely clear what kind of business Girke has had with Zhirinovskiy. Reportedly, the last time he transferred money to Moscow was on 30 December.
