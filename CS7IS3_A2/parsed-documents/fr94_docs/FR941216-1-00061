FR941216-1-00061 FR941216-1-00010 (h) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. In each example, assume that the qualifying debt instrument is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. Example 1. Issuer hedge _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1997, V, a domestic corporation, issues a 5-year debt instrument for $1,000. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest at a rate equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR and a principal payment of $1,000 at maturity. On the same day, V enters into a 5-year interest rate swap agreement with an unrelated party. Under the swap, V pays 6 percent and receives 1-year LIBOR on a notional principal amount of $1,000. The payments on the swap are fixed and made on the same days as the payments on the debt instrument. Also on January 1, 1997, V identifies the debt instrument and the swap as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. (ii) Eligibility for integration. The debt instrument is a qualifying debt instrument because it is a variable rate debt instrument. The swap is a ยง1.1275&hyph;6 hedge because it is a financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash flows of the swap and the debt instrument can be calculated. V has met the identification requirements, and the other requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under this section. (iii) Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. The synthetic debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument that has an issue price of $1,000 and provides for annual interest payments of $60 and a principal payment of $1,000 at maturity. Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the annual interest payments on the synthetic debt instrument are treated as qualified stated interest payments. Under paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 (the sum of all amounts to be paid on the qualifying debt instrument and the swap, reduced by amounts to be received on the swap and the annual interest payments on the synthetic debt instrument). Therefore, the synthetic debt instrument has no OID. Example 2. Issuer hedge with an option _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, W corporation issues for $1,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 1998. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of $1,000 payable at maturity. The debt instrument also provides for a payment at maturity equal to $10 times the increase, if any, in the value of a nationally known composite index of stocks from January 1, 1996, to the maturity date. On January 1, 1996, W also purchases from an unrelated party an option that pays $10 times the increase, if any, in the stock index from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1998. W pays $250 for the option. W identifies the debt instrument and option as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. (ii) Eligibility for integration. The debt instrument is a qualifying debt instrument because it is a contingent payment debt instrument. The option is a ยง1.1275&hyph;6 hedge because it is a financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash flows of the option and the debt instrument can be calculated. W has met the identification requirements, and the other requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under this section. (iii) Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. The synthetic debt instrument is a 3-year debt instrument with an issue price of $1,000 that provides for a payment immediately after issuance of $250 and a payment of $1,000 at maturity. The synthetic debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,250 and, therefore, has OID of $250. The $250 payment reduces the adjusted issue price of the synthetic debt instrument to $750 immediately after it is issued. Therefore, the OID allocable to the first accrual period is based on the $750 adjusted issue price. See ยง1.1272&hyph;1(b). Example 3. Hedge with prepaid swap _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, H purchases for 0D1,000 a 5-year debt instrument that provides for semiannual payments based on 6-month pound LIBOR and a payment of the 0D1,000 principal at maturity. On the same day, H enters into a swap with an unrelated third party under which H receives 10 percent, in pounds, semiannually and pays 6-month pound LIBOR semiannually on a notional principal amount of 0D1,000. Payments on the swap are fixed and made on the same date that H receives payments on the debt instrument. H also makes a 0D162 prepayment on the swap. H identifies the swap and the debt instrument as an integrated transaction under paragraph (f) of this section.
