FBIS4-28862 "dreas114_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 North Korea Japan's `Suppression' of Chongnyon Protested Japan's `Suppression' of Chongnyon Protested `Mass Rally' Held in Pyongyang SK1406105894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1041 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406105894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Working people of various strata in Pyongyang held a mass rally today and bitterly denounced the Japanese reactionaries' reckless suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan as a gross infringement upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In his speech, Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, said: The recent fascist suppression and persecution of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan by the Japanese reactionaries are hostile acts most vicious ever since the inauguration of Chongnyon. In view of their look and danger the acts remind us of the eve of the Korean war when the Japanese reactionaries suppressed the Federation of Koreans in Japan (Choyon) and Japan-resident Koreans. Noting that the suppression was not an accidental incident, the speaker said: The Japanese reactionaries are now openly scheming "constitutional amendment," "emergency legislative arrangements" and "measures for domestic security" in a bid to stage a military comeback to Korea and the rest of Asia, while serving the U.S. imperialists and the international reactionary forces as a shock brigade in their frantic moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of its fictitious "nuclear issue." Branding the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan by the Japanese reactionaries as a heinous crime which cannot be justified with anything, Yu Ho-chun said: We cannot remain an onlooker to the criminal acts of the Japanese authorities, who have committed an unheard-of suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, availing themselves of the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and the South Korean puppets. We will always keep tabs on them. The Japanese authorities must act with discretion, pondering over all the consequences to be entailed by their antagonism against and harsh suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and promptly stop the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon moves. Speeches were made also by Vice-chairman of the Korean Committee for Aiding Overseas Compatriots Kim Tong-sop, permanent member of the Korea-Japan Friendship Association Paek Pong-kyu, a faculty dean of the Korean University of Chongnyon Ku Tae-sok and Korea-resident Japanese woman Sin Chong-ho. They demanded that the Japanese reactionaries immediately stop the suppression of Chongnyon, apologize for it, liquidate the past doings of aggression and plunder against the Korean people and make an adequate compensation, clearly mindful that the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan is a foolish act of wringing their own necks. A letter of protest to the Japanese Government was adopted at the rally. It says that though the Japanese authorities intend to attain their sinister political purpose without difficulty by launching the repressive campaign against Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan at a time when the international reactionaries are intensifying their moves to take "sanctions" against the DPRK, this is a mistake. The letter says: The Japanese authorities must stop acting rashly and know that antagonism against the DPRK and the suppression of Chongnyon will bring nothing favorable to them. Strong is the will and resolution of the Korean people at home and in Japan, who hold the sovereignty and dignity of the nation dearer than their lives. We strongly demand that the Japanese authorities apologize for the unjustifiable suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, promise to refrain from such acts and take steps to sternly punish the masterminds of the recent cases. We also state that it is a good option for the Japanese authorities not to join the international reactionaries in their reckless moves to take "sanctions" against the DPRK in a bid to stifle it. We will never tolerate the infringement on the national dignity and democratic national rights of Chongnyon, an organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Koreans in Japan but decisively counter it to the end. Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Kim Chung-nin and Vice-premier of the Administration Council Chang Chol were present at the rally.
