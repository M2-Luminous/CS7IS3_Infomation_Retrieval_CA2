Francois Leotard wished that those who give advice to think first, particularly Abbe Pierre, to whom he said: [Begin Leotard recording] Everybody understands that there is no military solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I have a lot of respect for Abbe Pierre. I cannot recall him being closely associated in recent months with any military decision that should be taken regarding this matter. Once more, all those who express themselves should think of not undermining either the morale or the action of our soldiers on the ground. One should be very careful. When we find ourselves in a crisis situation, youngsters, officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers are carrying out a difficult mission risking their lives. Every word should be weighed. I am not sure this has been the case during the last few weeks with civilians. We have to be very careful. We are engaged in sensitive operations. Let's not undermine either the morale or the missions our soldiers are asked to carry out. [end recording]
