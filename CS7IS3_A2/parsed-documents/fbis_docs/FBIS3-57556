The 900-day blockade was broken near the village on January 18, 1943. Yeltsin said that would be an equestrian statue and added that everybody remembers how the marshal inspected the victory parade in Red Square in 1945. "This is the right decision (to erect the monument)," Yeltsin said and added the symbols of Russian patriotism and valour should replace the cemetery of top Soviet leaders in Red Square. The main Russian square houses the mausoleum where the mummified body of Vladimir Lenin lies. Behind the mausoleum are graves of top Soviet communist leaders and outstanding personalities. Zhukov won the battle of Stalingrad, lifted the siege of Leningrad and seized Berlin, and most Soviet victories in world war two were connected with his name. After the war he became the Soviet defence minister and member of the ruling Politburo of the Communist Party. It was he who actually led the arrest of Lavrenty Beria, head of the secret police and a close associate of Joseph Stalin, after the dictator died. He supported Nikita Khrushchev when the communist leadership tried to oust him in June 1957, however Khrushchev, who feared the popularity of Zhukov, dismissed him from the post of the defence minister and Politburo member in the same year when the latter was on a visit in Yugoslavia. Zhukov died in 1974.
