Earlier, veteran British legislator Du Ye Xien [Elsie Tu] refuted this absurd argument in Legco, citing remarks made by the British foreign secretary two and a half years ago. [sentence as received] In a motion filed with Legco requesting the postponement of a debate about Patten's plan, Du Ye Xien said: "Transferring sovereignty and implementing the Basic Law in Hong Kong in 1997 are a very solemn affair for China. China's establishment of the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as well as remarks about starting a so-called new kitchen, are all preparations for this major event." She pointed out: "Of course, some people say that if the British Government's political model is established in 1995, the Chinese Government will not dare replace it in 1997. To those who believe this, I would like to quote British Foreign Secretary Hurd's remarks to the British House of Commons on 16 February 1990. It was only some 30 months between the time he made such remarks and the time he abruptly changed course to support Mr. Patten's political reform draft bill. The remarks went like this: `People who believe that in 1997, the Chinese Government will accept all that we are currently doing are divorced from reality.' These remarks really came from Mr. Hurd." After repeating the above remarks by Hurd, Du Ye Xien said: "Let us use Mr. Hurd's remarks for verification purposes. Are his current actions and the government he represents divorced from reality? Who in Hong Kong will be so naive as to think that China will allow this British model to continue after 1997? The Chinese Government has repeatedly said in unequivocal terms that this is a matter of national dignity."
