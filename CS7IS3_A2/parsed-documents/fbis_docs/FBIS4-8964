Laszlo Urban also told our correspondent that a general agreement between the employees, employers, and the government which, above a 10 percent guaranteed level, would link wage increases to improved productivity, would be a key element of implementing their program. If it came to government, the Fidesz would radically reorganize the economic institutions, it would establish an economic top ministry and budget ministry, and it would strengthen the economic diplomacy activities of the Foreign Ministry. [Ferencz] The Fidesz is the only party that can express its economic program in a slogan: half-turn. However, this short slogan can be interpreted many ways. What does it actually mean? [Urban] It means a change of priorities in the budget policy. Economic growth would be the goal, but this cannot be reached through artificially suppressing the interest rates -- unsuccessful attempts at this have been made in recent years -- or through restriction, namely reducing the expenditure. In our view, the budget policy has to be focused on investment incentives. The deficit of the current budget cannot grow but, when the budget is planned, funds have to be created for tax allowances and measures taken to stimulate investments. This is a half-turn compared to the current practice, because the government's running expenses have increased in past years and, due to the increased budget deficit, it is precisely the investment expenditures that have been cut back. [Ferencz] However, to make this policy successful, insensitivity to social problems has to be accepted! [Urban] No, it does not! Insensitivity to social problems would arise if someone wanted to drastically reduce the budget expenditure, including welfare spending. However, this is suggested by parties other than the Fidesz -- at least, on the level of campaign slogans. In our view, society would not accept the reduction of welfare expenditure. [Ferencz] On the other hand, the Fidesz's experts talk about the need for voluntary wage limitation by the employees as a necessary means to curbing inflation. [Urban] The resources for the temporary overspending that is to stimulate the investments has to be found in the budget. In our view, this can be solved through reducing the interest on the already accumulated debts. This is a huge burden because interest payments are already now reaching 20 percent of the total expenditure and this might increase to 25 percent next year. This item can only be reduced if inflation is noticeably reduced. A 5-percent reduction of inflation can decrease the interest payments by 30 to 40 billion forints. This is more than what a committed government, with a strong political support -- I do not actually see any chance for this -- could save through reducing the budget expenditure. However, to reduce inflation, we will need a tripartite agreement (between the state, the employees, and the employers) which will cool down the inflation expectations. It has to be achieved that wage increases should basically be linked to increased productivity. [Ferencz] Can this be regulated through a central pact in a market economy? [Urban] A central pact can provide a positive background for the bargaining at company level although, naturally, cannot replace it. As early as the end of 1993, some of the employers attempted to set the automatic wage increases at the lowest possible level, and to establish a connection between wage increases and the increase of productivity. However, on a national level, it was precisely the government's representative who first called this untenable. A central agreement can force the representatives of employers and employees at every company to face the question: Do they consider it more important to preserve the workplaces even at the cost of lower wages or will they accept the dismissals and fight for a higher wage for the people who stay? The government cannot decide this but it can establish favorable conditions for the bargaining. The view of the trade unions obviously is that more burdens cannot be placed on the employees, therefore, wage increases at least have to counterbalance inflation. However, in a stagnating economy, this would actually contribute to maintaining inflation. [Ferencz] Therefore, the Fidesz's experts attribute a decisive importance to inflation expectations in the actual increase of prices. However, the experience of the past few years seems to contradict this: Between 1990 and 1993, the inflation expectations -- and even the inflation forecasts -- at the beginning of the year always exceeded the level measured at the end of the year. [Urban] The analyses prove that at least half of the inflation is wage inflation. The speed of price increases stopped receding in the past year, and I attribute the reduction in the former years to the dampening effect of the recession and to a consequence of the exchange policy that was revaluing in real terms. However, the latter was double-edged because it placed the costs of curbing inflation on the exporting companies and this backfired in 1993. If we want to face the fact that there is an over-distribution in the Hungarian economy compared to the level that would be supported by our productivity then we either cut the budget expenditure drastically -- but this does not have the necessary political support -- or we have to make self-restricting wage agreements. Private companies are inclined to do this anyway, and the managers of state-owned enterprises could be encouraged in contracts made with them to implement this central agreement. [Ferencz] How well developed is the Fidesz's program on changing the economic policy institutional system? [Urban] The economic policy mistakes of the past four years can largely be attributed to the lack of a chief economic strategist in the government, and the rivalries between the various economic-type ministries. It is completely ridiculous for a minister who is responsible for the economy to have the same number of votes on economic policy issues in the government as ministers who have nothing to do with the economy: This makes it impossible to make strategic decisions. According to our concept, an economic top ministry should be set up based on the economic policy experts from the Finance Ministry, the Industry and Trade Ministry, the Ministry of International Economic Relations, and other ministries, while the economic diplomacy activities of the Foreign Ministry should be strengthened. At the same time, based on the Finance Ministry's staff, a ministry dealing with budget issues could be established, thus ending the situation where strategic decisions are also determined by daily fiscal considerations. [Ferencz] How long would it take for the results of the Fidesz's economic policy to manifest themselves? [Urban] The already mentioned tripartite agreement would establish the opportunity for a breakthrough. If we managed to complete this by the autumn of 1994, it would be possible to anticipate lower inflation and increasing investment activity when planning the 1995 budget. Economic growth could begin, however, based on this, the reform of state administration would first have to be implemented in 1996, it could be decided what kind of expenditure can be removed from the state treasury. In the following year, in 1997, the expansion of consumption would also be noticeable to the people.
