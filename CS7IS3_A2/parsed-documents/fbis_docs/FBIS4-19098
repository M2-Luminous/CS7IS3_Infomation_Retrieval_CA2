Unsubstantiated radio reports from United Nations officials in Gorazde described continued shelling of the town despite a second air strike against Serb positions. The Bosnian Serbs have said they will consider themselves at war with the UN if air strikes go on. Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg issued a stern warning to the Serbs: "They need to keep in mind that force will be used to support UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units in the way that has just happened in Gorazde." And NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner strongly advised the Serbs not to retaliate as such a move would provoke a tough response. "We would not sit there," he said. "We have so far used only two aircraft. There are far more than 100 aircraft down there, so I would warn anybody against the idea of retaliation." Government sources in London made plain that Serb forces should be under no illusion that there is a reluctance to use air power. "If shelling continues and UNPROFOR feels threatened, then the same is likely to happen again," said one official. "The writing is on the wall -- the message is there and we can see it being hammered home until they finally get the message." But Britain's support for strikes against the Serbs is believed to have been behind an abortive attempt by ultra-nationalist Greek terrorists to hit the carrier Ark Royal with antitank rockets. The November 17 guerrilla group said it had tried to hit the 20,000-ton carrier with two 88mm rockets as it was docked in the port of Piraeus near Athens. A Whitehall source said: "This group of terrorists is ultranationalist and, as such, support the Serbs. The connection is not too difficult to make." Ark Royal with its six Sea Harrier jump-jets and its sister ship Invincible have been alternating on six-month tours since January last year as part of NATO's operations to enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia. It is now steaming back into the Adriatic from Greece. It was unlikely that RAF [Royal Air Force] or Royal Navy warplanes would be used in strikes at present, British sources said last night. For the second day running an elite seven-strong squad of SAS [Special Air Service] soldiers in Gorazde played a key role in the attack on Serb positions. Acting as forward air controllers, they successfully directed an American F/A-18 bomber on to its targets of Serb armoured vehicles. Several patrol groups from the Hereford-based regiment were ordered into a number of Muslim enclaves following a specific request from UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, himself a former SAS commander. Lieutenant Colonel Simon Shadbolt, military assistant to General Rose, gave an update on the situation on the ground in Bosnia overnight. He said: "There has been no shelling of Gorazde town. There has been some sporadic fighting in the hills to the north and to the east, which we are investigating, but of the town itself and of the UN personnel and troops in the area -- they have not been engaged and the area is described as calm." Replying to Bosnian Serb criticisms that General Rose had treated Bosnia like a British colony he said: "This is a highly complex operation and over the last few days General Rose has made a series of very fine judgments over which way to go. ``But he has maintained two clear tracks. One track is his obligation to the safe area and the safety of the troops, and that is in Gorazde. His other track is maintaining the ceasefire process and the cessation of hostilities throughout Bosnia.'' Lt Col Shadbolt told BBC Radio 4 that UN commanders would be drawing up a plan for Gorazde and considering further aid and a helicopter evacuation of the seriously injured.
