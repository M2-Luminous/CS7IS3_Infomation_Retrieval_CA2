The just-born People's Army and people of Korea could win over the world's reactionary Allied forces in the fatherland liberation war because they fought an all-people heroic struggle, only believing in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a legendary hero of the anti-Japanese struggle and ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, and closely rallied behind him, the article says, and goes on: The Korean people, above all, rose as one in the war of justice and fought valiantly in hearty response to the militant call of the party and the leader "Everything for victory in the war!" It was their unfailing loyalty to the party and the leader and high patriotic zeal that made the Korean people rise as one for victory in the fatherland liberation war when a grave danger befell their country and nation due to the imperialist aggression. The entire people took arms instead of hammer and sickle, pen and book and enthusiastically volunteered to the front with a resolve to fight it out to the last drop of their blood. The officers and men of the People's Army defended every inch of the fatherland at the cost of their blood by displaying matchless mass heroism, upholding orders of the respected leader with their whole heart. Many heroic soldiers including hero Yi Su-pok ensured victories in fierce battle with the enemy by dedicating themselves to silence the enemy's pillboxes and destroying tanks and warships. All the people in the rear, workers, peasants, students, the old and the young, fought heroically for wartime production and aided the front, not yielding at all even under the barbarous bombings by the enemy, and creditably ensured victory in the war, overcoming all hardships and difficulties, united firmly as one. In particular, in the enemy-held areas, people organized guerrillas, young people formed young guards, and children children's guards to fight against the U.S. imperialist aggressors. The Korean people and People's Army could so fully display mass heroism and the spirit of patriotic devotion in the fatherland liberation war because they firmly believed that they would always emerge victorious when they fought as indicated by the leader, cherishing deep down in their hearts the justice of the line, strategy and tactics laid down by the great leader Comrade Kim Il- song and the wiseness of his leadership. The enormous significance of the fatherland liberation war lies in that it strikingly demonstrated the fact that the strength of a people united firmly behind their party and leader is inexhaustible and nothing can break it. Now, the Korean people and People's Army are firmly united behind respected supreme commander General Kim Chong-il, an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, ideologically and purposefully and In-moral obligation. They will as ever firmly unite behind the party and the leader and wage an all-people heroic struggle, thus smashing whatever maneuvers of the imperialists and firmly defending and further glorifying the Korean-style socialism.
