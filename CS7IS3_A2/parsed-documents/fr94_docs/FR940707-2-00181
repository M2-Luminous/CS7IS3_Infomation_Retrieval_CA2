FR940707-2-00181 FR940707-2-00098 [Release No. 34&hyph;34279; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;58] Self Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers Relating to Handling of Customer Limit Orders June 29, 1994. On October 13, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 a proposed rule change consisting of an Interpretation to the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice relating to the handling of customer limit orders. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register . 2 Two comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33697 (March 1, 1994), 59 FR 45 (March 8, 1994). I. Background Over the past several years, limit order practices involving NASDAQ stocks have become the subject of investor complaints and Commission scrutiny. Current NASDAQ limit order handling practice often results in a market maker's delaying execution of the customer's sell (or buy) order until the highest bid (offer) from among competing market makers equals the customer's limit price. Moreover, firms that accept limit orders often trade for their own accounts at prices better than the customer's limit order price without executing the customer's order. The priority accorded a customer limit order today is different depending on the structure of the marketplace of execution, a distinction customers do not always understand. The rules of national securities exchanges require specialists to yield to a customer's limit order; the specialist cannot trade for its own account at prices better than the limit order until the limit order is executed. In 1988, the Commission expressed its views on the issue of limit order protection in the NASDAQ market when it ruled that broker-dealers owe a fiduciary duty to their limit order customers not to trade ahead of these orders unless the customer is first informed of the firm's limit order policy. 3 As a result of the Manning decision, the NASD filed a proposed rule change with the Commission that states that a member firm will be deemed not to have violated NASD Rules of Fair Practice if it provides to customers a statement setting forth the circumstances in which the firm accepts limit orders and the policies and procedures that the firm follows in handling these orders. 4 3 See In re E.F. Hutton & Co. (the ``Manning'' decision), Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25887 (July 6, 1988), 41 SEC Doc. 473, appeal filed, Hutton & Co. Inc. v. SEC, Dec. No. 88&hyph;1649 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 2, 1988), (Stipulation of Dismissal Filed, Jan. 11, 1989). 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26824 (May 15, 1989), 54 FR 22046 (May 22, 1989). The proposal included model disclosure language to be used by firms whose policy is not to grant priority to customer limit orders over the member's own proprietary trading. In July of 1993, the NASD Board of Governors reviewed the handling of limit orders in NASDAQ securities and concluded that ``the continuation of the disclosure exception appeared inappropriate.'' 5 The NASD solicited member comment on eliminating the disclosure safe harbor for members trading ahead of customer limit orders and the effect a rule prohibiting trading ahead might have on integrated broker-dealers, on limit orders received from other firms (``member-to-member'' trades) and on market liquidity. 6 5 See File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;58, p. 6. 6 See Notice to Members 93&hyph;49 (July 23, 1993). After full consideration of the concerns articulated in the comment process, the NASD withdrew the rule filing containing the disclosure approach, 7 and submitted this proposed Interpretation to its Rules of Fair Practice, prohibiting member firms from trading ahead of their customers' limit orders in their market making capacity. 7 See Letter from Robert E. Aber, Vice President and General Counsel, National Association of Securities Dealers, to Selwyn Notelovitz, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC (Oct. 13, 1993).
