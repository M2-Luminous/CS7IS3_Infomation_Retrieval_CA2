Kumgang. North Korea is currently reviewing the project in detail to attract foreign capital, according to a well-informed source in Tokyo. The source said: "North Korea has already started consultations with the U.S. State Department on receiving capital, technology, and experience necessary for the introduction of the market economic system into the economic zones by joining the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund." The source also disclosed that North Korea's former Vice Premier Kim Tal-hyon (currently a manager of the Sunchon Vinalon plant), who was previously removed from North Korea's power circle, is in charge of the project and is secretly serving as a dialogue channel with the United States.
