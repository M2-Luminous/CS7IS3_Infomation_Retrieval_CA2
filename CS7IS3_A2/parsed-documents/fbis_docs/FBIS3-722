For over a week now, the mediator and the troika of observers have been trying to find a common stand between government proposals and UNITA's replies. Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye only now understands that he is going nowhere. To end the game of words, he therefore decided to fly today to Huambo and then to Luanda to listen to the voices of ultimatum. He was at the airport, but did not travel because the aircraft had a breakdown. He will therefore leave for Huambo tomorrow.
