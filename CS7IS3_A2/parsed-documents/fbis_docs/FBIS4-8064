After 13 days of fighting [words indistinct] the defenders from the area of Vitkovici decided to plant explosives in a nitrogen factory. We have just learned from Mirsad Dragolj that explosives were planted in two tanks containing 25 metric tons of ammonia each and a tank with 20 tons of formalin. If these tanks explode, the consequences would certainly be vast, not only for the area of Vitkovici and Gorazde, but also for the whole of the northern part of the Drina valley. Mr. Dragolj said this was not an act of desperation, but a move caused by futile actions of the representatives of the peacekeeping forces. It is a consequence of the lies about the latest offensive by some key people in the world organization and also of the reactions by our state and military organs, which came too late.
