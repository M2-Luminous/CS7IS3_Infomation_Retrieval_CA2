FR941117-0-00055 FR941117-0-00010 Finally, the IIHS is critical of the study methodology and faults the FHWA for its failure to use a control group as originally planned. The FHWA will more fully address this in the methodology to be developed to establish parameters for a performance-based vision standard. The American Trucking Associations, Inc., a national trade association of the trucking industry, also commented in opposition to the FHWA proposal. The ATA had participated in the D.C. Circuit case, AHAS v. FHWA, supra ., by filing an amicus curiae brief in support of the petitioner's challenge to the waiver study. The ATA contends that the decision of the Court of Appeals in AHAS was broad enough to preclude the FHWA's present proposal. The FHWA disagrees for the reasons stated herein and in its filings with the D.C. Circuit in opposition to the AHAS motion for issuance and enforcement of a mandate, which the court dismissed. The filings in that matter are recorded in the docket. The ATA suggests that pooling of the waived drivers may mask poor performance by individual members of the pool, and that comparisons with general populations are faulty because the waived group contains only experienced drivers. The ATA then significantly concedes that ``(a) pool of experienced drivers will also appear to be safer than the national pool which includes new drivers and drivers with various driving experience.'' That is precisely the point. The FHWA's ``consistent with safety'' determination is based on the premise. The waived drivers had all been operating commercial motor vehicles on the highways when the waivers were issued to them. If they were required to stop driving they would have to be replaced by drivers drawn from the general population of truck drivers or new drivers. This is particularly true in this era of driver shortages which the ATA has publicly and repeatedly proclaimed. (See, e.g., Transport Topics , No. 3050, January 17, 1994, p. 12; and No. 3083, September 5, 1994, p. 42 and p. 49.) The ATA also faults the study design because it will never be probative of ``the ability of visually impaired drivers, in general, to operate CMVs safely.'' The ATA states that this is because ``the study is limited to the experiences of these apparently better-than-average drivers.'' Once again, the ATA makes the FHWA's point. The ``consistent with safety'' determination relates to the issuance of the waivers, and not to the design or conclusions to be drawn from the study. The FHWA recognizes that the study as presently fashioned has some problems, which the FHWA is taking steps to correct. The FHWA also recognizes that its group of waived drivers may include some subpar performers who individually may present an unacceptable risk to safety. The FHWA is taking steps to identify and exclude such drivers, while at the same time maintaining the integrity of the overall waiver program. Finally, the ATA contends that the FHWA proposal is an attempt to give retroactive effect to its previous waiver rule, and that this is violative of the Administrative Procedure Act, citing Georgetown University Hosp. v. Bowen , 821 F.2d 750 (D.C. Cir. 1987), aff'd. , 488 U.S. 204 (1988). The Georgetown case involved a rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that affected the formula under which hospitals were to be reimbursed for the provision of certain health services. After the rule was invalidated because it was issued without opportunity for public comment, the HHS issued a new rule retroactive to an earlier date. On the basis of this new rule, the HHS then sought reimbursement from the hospitals for payments made before the date of the new rule which were greater than would be allowable under the new formula. The FHWA's decision allowing waived drivers to operate in interstate commerce until March 31, 1996, has no retroactive effect whatsoever. It speaks only prospectively. On September 30, the FHWA validated the waivers for a 30-day period and requested comments. Moreover, the rule in this instance was not vacated for procedural error, as it was in the Georgetown case. In this instance, the rule was vacated after the court determined that the agency did not have the necessary empirical evidence in the record to support its assertion that the waivers were consistent with the safe operation of CMVs. The Notice published on October 6 provided the necessary empirical evidence for the future effect of the waivers, including data on the driving performance of the waived group of drivers as a whole, which clearly indicates that allowing this group to continue operating in interstate commerce is consistent with the safe operation of CMVs. (See 59 FR 50887 at 50889, 50890, October 6, 1994). In providing the necessary empirical evidence, the agency cured the defect and now validates the waivers through March 31, 1996. Consequently, this action is entirely consistent with the APA. The comments of the American Movers Conference merely voice its support for the position taken by the ATA. Arthur H. Keeney, M.D., D.Sc., a Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Dean Emeritus of the University of Louisville Department of Ophthalmology urged the FHWA to hold to its previously established physiologic standards without further reduction. Dr. Keeney suggested that the FHWA might grandfather the remaining waived drivers into the system as a means of proceeding away from the agency's current course, but recommended against enrolling any more ``monocular blind or ``visually deficient drivers' who may be interpreted as otherwise qualified to meet occupational requirements.'' Dr. Keeney also submitted a recently prepared but thus far unpublished paper entitled ``The Monocular Quandary'' which includes an extensive bibliography. The paper supports the current standard and explores operational problems, particularly associated with individuals with no vision in one eye. The FHWA believes the comments and the research paper of Dr. Keeney will be useful in its pursuit of performance-based vision standards. Strong opposition to the FHWA proposal was also received from the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (AHAS), the petitioner in the D.C. Circuit case referred to throughout this notice. The AHAS reargues its position in the court proceeding both before and after judgment and urges a broader interpretation of the court's decision.
