FR941221-0-00057 FR941221-0-00018 4. The final rule clarifies that an owner who makes the elderly preference election must be able to produce, if challenged, all relevant documentation in the owner's possession that pertains to the original design of the project, not only the evidence that was ``supporting evidence'' as the language read in the interim rule. (See ยง880.612a(a)(2)(i) and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) 5. The final rule clarifies that the primary source list in the rule is not limited to underwriting or financial documents. (See ยง800.612(a)(b)(1)(i) and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) 6. The final rule clarifies that in discussing project unit mix with a higher percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units, higher percentage means more than fifty percent. (See ยง880.612a(b)(1)(ii) and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) 7. The final rule clarifies that the requirement to make vacant units available to otherwise eligible families if there are an insufficient number of families qualifying for the elderly preference or for the reserved units for non-elderly disabled families (or qualifying for the near-elderly disabled family secondary preference if adopted) applies to owners of covered projects who make the elderly preference election, and not solely to owners who elect the elderly preference and elect also the secondary preference as the May 3, 1994 interim rule indicated. 8. The final rule clarifies that projects under National Housing Act programs and receiving section 8 assistance may be subject to preferences in addition to those contained in the section 8 regulations. (See ยง880.612a(g) and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) With the exception of these eight changes, the final rule remains the same as the May 3, 1994 interim rule. The following section of the preamble provides a summary of the issues raised by the public commenters, and HUD's response to these issues. Although only six commenters commented upon the May 3, 1994 interim rule (also referred to as the subtitle D rule) by the end of the public comment period on July 5, 1994, the six commenters raised a number of issues. III. Discussion of Public Comments Comment. One commenter stated that interim rulemaking was inappropriate for the subject matter addressed by subtitle D, and HUD should have solicited advance public comment before issuing the subtitle D rule for effect. Response. As noted earlier in this preamble, and discussed in more detail in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule (59 FR 22921&hyph;22922), very little in HUD's subtitle D rule would be altered by public comment because the system of occupancy preferences established by subtitle D allows HUD little discretion to expand or depart from this system by regulation. Therefore advance public comment would not have been practicable or necessary. Additionally, as noted in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule, HUD, in issuing the subtitle D rule, had the benefit of public comment received on the rule that implemented subtitle B of title VI of the HCD Act of 1992 (59 FR 22921&hyph;22922). Subtitle B provides public housing agencies (PHAs) with the option, subject to certain requirements, to designate public housing projects, or portions of these projects, for occupancy by elderly families, disabled families or elderly families and disabled families. HUD's final rule implementing subtitle B was published on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17652). To the extent that the subtitle D rule which concerns section 8 housing, and the subtitle B rule which concerns public housing, address similar issues, the public comments on the subtitle B rule were taken into consideration in development of the May 3, 1994 interim rule. Comment. One commenter stated that given the recent publication of the notice revising HUD's Occupancy Handbook for multifamily projects, and the May 3, 1994 interim rule, project owners are confused about their obligations and responsibilities to persons with disabilities, and further clarification is needed. Response. The notice of the revision to Chapter 2 of HUD Handbook on Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs, which was published on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21992) advised that Chapter 2, as revised, would remain in effect pending issuance regulations for subtitle D, at which time further revisions to Chapter 2 would be issued. Those revisions are now in preparation. Chapter 2 remains in effect to the extent that it is not contradicted by the interim rule, and until such time as the next revision to this chapter is issued. The Department also intends to issue further guidance on subtitle D and the issue of mixed populations in the form of technical assistance materials. Comment. One commenter expressed concern that HUD has not issued its rule that would revise the terms ``families'' and ``elderly person,'' among others, in HUD's section 8 regulations to reflect the changes made to these terms by section 621 of the HCD Act of 1992. Response. The definitions of these terms in section 621 of the HCD Act of 1992 are applicable without issuance of a HUD regulation. On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12686), before enactment of the HCD Act of 1992, HUD published a proposed rule that would revise, among other things, the definition of ``family'' in parts 812 and 912 to reflect changes made to this definition by the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub.L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990). Rather than issue separate rulemaking to revise the definitions in parts 812 and 912 to reflect the changes made to certain definitions (e.g., ``elderly person,'' ``person with disabilities'') by the HCD Act of 1992, HUD determined to make these changes at the time of issuance of the final rule for the April 10, 1992 proposed rule. HUD anticipates publication of this final rule by December 1994. Again, however, the definition changes made by the HCD Act of 1992 are currently applicable despite the absence of a final rule that amends parts 812 and 912 to reflect these definition changes.
