SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 13, 1994, the Corporation proposed regulations setting forth procedures to be used in requesting access to and responding to requests for Corporation Privacy Act records. See 59 FR 24988. Essentially, the Corporation proposed regulations that provided that all requests for access to Corporation Privacy Act records must be in writing and signed by the subject of the record, adequately describe the material sought, and be sent to the Corporation in McLean, Virginia. The proposed regulations delegated to the Privacy Act Officer authority to make initial determinations concerning requests for access to records. The proposed regulations provided procedures for requests for amendment of records and the appeal of an initial adverse determination on a request to amend a record. Finally, the proposed regulations provided a fee structure. The Corporation did not receive any written comments in response to the proposed regulations. After publication of the proposed rule, the Corporation determined that a specific exemption was appropriate for a system of records. The Corporation now wishes to adopt a regulation providing for the specific exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552(k)(5) of a system of records pertaining to the personnel security files of the agency. The head of an agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within the agency from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f) of section 552a of title 5, United States Code, if the system of records is investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. In order to ensure appropriate maintenance and use of Corporation records, as well as orderly and timely access to Corporation records, it was determined that the regulation should be adopted as an interim rule. However, comments are sought on this regulation. The Corporation now adopts 12 CFR part 1403 as an interim rule. List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 1403
