Mr. Eduardo Vallarino, now that several hours have passed since the end of the elections, we would like to hear what you have to say about the election results. [Vallarino] Panama's elections have been extremely pure and transparent, very civic, very enthusiastic. Panama is the winner in these elections. It is evident that we did not fare as well as we would have desired. Panama has attained a great victory, however. [Reporter] What message do you have for the Panamanian people, although the final results are not yet known? [Vallarino] I think the results are indeed known. They are determined by a number of factors which I think are irreversible. Although the official results are not yet known, it is clear that the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] won the elections and that Perez Balladares has won the right to become president. What message do I have for the Panamanian people? Simple: We will have a new president, elected by a considerable number of Panamanians and whom we all must support. We will become the opposition, a responsible one. [Reporter] We have talked with Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo Vallarino.
