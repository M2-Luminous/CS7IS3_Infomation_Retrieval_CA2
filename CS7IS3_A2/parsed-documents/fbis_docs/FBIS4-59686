They strongly denounced such acts by the Socialist Party war criminals, which have caused the death of many women, children, and elderly people. This came in a statement issued by the Yemen Ulema Society. The statement said that fighting against the secessionist, rebellious elements in the Socialist Party leadership is legitimate because it seeks to eradicate sedition, protect religion against the advocates of apostasy and secession, and avert the dangers posed to the people and the country. God says: And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God. [Koranic verse] The ulema praised the heroic stands of the Army and Security Forces men, who are resolutely fighting the forces of evil and sedition and the advocates of secession and division, scoring great victories by depending on God and holding out in the fighting arenas. The ulema appealed to all our Yemeni people to support our Armed and Security Forces, confront the rumor mongers, and report any attempt to disturb security. The ulema supported the wise and sound steps taken by the Presidential Council, the House of Representatives, and the Council of Ministers to deal with the situation and destroy the dangers of sedition and its perpetrators. They stressed their rejection of any interference. The ulema concluded their statement by urging our people to sincerely beseech Almighty God in their prayers to aid our valiant soldiers and grant them victory. God says: Already has Our Word been passed before this to Our Servants sent by Us, that they would certainly be assisted, and that Our forces,-they surely must conquer. [Koranic verse]
