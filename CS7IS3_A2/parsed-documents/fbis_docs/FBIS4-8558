Eleven shells fell on the airport mid-morning and three fell on the market in Tuzla, said Major Dacre Holloway with the UN Protection Force. There were no injuries, Halloway said. He said the Nordic UN troops' observation post was hit with artillery fire early Thursday but gave no other details. Elsewhere Thursday, Serb forces seized 17 UN peacekeepers guarding a weapons stockpile at Cifluk, northwest of the capital Sarajevo and just inside the heavy weapons exclusion zone around the capital ordered by the UN in February. Tuzla's airport, closed since the start of the conflict two years ago, was opened under the threat of NATO bombardment of Serb positions only last month, allowing UN relief flights to bring humanitarian aid to hard-hit northern and central Bosnia.
