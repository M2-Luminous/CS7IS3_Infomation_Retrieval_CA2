Lurking behind this is a sinister intention of the United States, says a MINJU CHOSON analyst today. The news analyst goes on: The mounting tension on the Korean peninsula is attributable to the United States' policy hostile to the DPRK, not to the latter's "nuclear threat". The U.S. authorities, particularly the military quarters closely connected with warmongers, are seeking to intentionally aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula and make money through arms sales by taking advantage of it. This is borne out by the fact that in November last year when Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, went to the United States, the U.S. authorities vociferated about "North's nuclear threat" and forced him to open the South Korean rice market, any more for the maintenance of the U.S. occupation forces in South Korea and buy more weapons including Patriot missiles in return for their "commitment" to the "security" of South Korea. In aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula they also seek to find a way out of the crisis at home. The U.S. Administration is now floundering under great condemnations and criticisms from the American people for its anti-popular policies and snowballing trade deficits. The recent "White Water" scandal has made its position all the more difficult, and the U.S. political crisis is worsening daily. Hence, the U.S. authorities are aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula, crying themselves hoarse over the "North's nuclear threat" to divert public attention elsewhere with the aim of defusing the domestic crisis. Whatever petty tricks they may play, they cannot conceal the stark fact. They must refrain from such despicable, anachronistic acts as selling off lethal weapons by spreading a lie and aggravating the situation and withdraw all their destructive weapons and troops from South Korea. That will do them good.
