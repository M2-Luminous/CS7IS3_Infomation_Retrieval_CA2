As a presidential spokesman told INTERFAX, the meeting was not planned. Although he declined to say what the two leaders had discussed, he suggested that they had continued to examine the problems related to cabinet reorganization. He said that the unexpected flow of criticism to the government reshuffle had been staggering for them in many ways. So they might have made a new attempt to choose a new finance minister and possibly reach a compromise with Fedorov. As for the recent speculations about the possible appointment to the post of finance minister of ex-USSR premier Scherbakov, the spokesman described them "as an attempt to sound out the president and the prime minister on this candidate."
