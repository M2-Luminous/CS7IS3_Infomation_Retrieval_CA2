FBIS4-10349 "drlat070_m_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 9 Mar 1994 Brazil Franco Makes 40th New Cabinet Appointment Franco Makes 40th New Cabinet Appointment 94SM0300A Sao Paulo VEJA in Portuguese 9 Mar 94 pp 42, 43 94SM0300A Sao Paulo VEJA Portuguese CSO [Article: "Change, Change, Change"] [Text] Last week, President Itamar Franco made the 40th change in his cabinet. It features shifts like that of the acting minister of a ministry that was going to be abolished who became the permanent minister of a ministry that will be maintained--the case of Leonor Franco, of Social Welfare. A reserve minister became head of a ministry in his own right--Colonel Djalma Morais, of Communications. A former minister with a questionable background was called to hold a portfolio that was to become extinct--Deputy Aluizio Alves of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], summoned to Regional Integration. The military reinforced the olive-green cordon of Itamar's team by adding General Rubens Bayma Denis, the new transportation minister, and the tucanos gained another ministry--the Ministry of Planning--now held by Ceara Senator Beni Veras. In the commotion, former Minister of Transportation Margarida Coimbra even sought support from her mother, in Rio de Janeiro. After phoning her mother Monday night, the former minister wept. "I don't know what is going on out there, I haven't the least idea. Now I am unemployed and have no place to go," a desperate Margarida told Marcelo Auler, VEJA assistant editor in Rio. The administration did not announce any new plan or new goals as part of the reform, only changes in names. In less than two years, Itamar has made more appointments than former President Jose Sarney did in five years of government (see box). The game of musical chairs brings to a close a reform that has been dragging on for five months. It has accomplished almost nothing, except to reaffirm Itamar's taste for uniformed ministers. The addition of Bayma Denis brings to five the number of top-ranking military officers holding civilian posts at the first and second echelons of the government, The minister of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat is from the Navy--Admiral Mario Cesar Flores. The president of Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.] is from the Air Force--Brigadier General Adyr da Silva. General Romildo Canhim is minister of Administration. Another general, Nilton Moreira Rodrigues, is the head honcho at Sudene [Northeast Development Superintendency]. There are so many top-rank military men in civilian posts that Itamar has surpassed former President Joao Figueiredo, a military man who had only four generals on his team. Itamar also has two high officials who bear the rank of colonel: Djalma Morais, confirmed last week as head of Communications, and Wilson Romao, director of the Federal Police. [Box p 42] Numbers from the Tumult - Itamar replaces an average of two ministers a month. - In less than two years in office, the president made more appointments than Sarney did in five years--69, compared with 62 for the former president. - Itamar took office with 15 ministries, created 12, and now has 27. He had 12 acting ministers and one extraordinary one. - Alexis Stepanenko, now minister of mines and energy, has held three posts in this administration. - The one who warmed his chair for the shortest time was Wilson Romao. His stay at Agriculture lasted one day. "I Want a General" President Itamar decided to appoint Bayma Denis on Tuesday, during a phone conversation with Minister of the Army Zenildo Lucena. "I want a general," Itamar said. "I am not going to allow the cabinet to be the target of birds of prey." By "birds of prey" he meant opportunistic politicians, the technicians connected to economic groups, and the construction contractors. Minister Lucena suggested Denis, who was head of the Military Command of the East from which, two months ago, he dispatched troops to forestall demonstrations at the Rio-Niteroi Bridge. A Rio native, age 64, the general is respected within the Army. He was minister of the Military Household in the Sarney administration. "Our administration makes no distinction between civilians and military personnel," President Itamar said in Caracas, Venezuela, on Friday. "There are civilians who should hold civilian posts. But there are also military men who can occupy civilian posts, with civilian objectives." As Fernando Henrique Cardoso said during a conversation about the reform with Raul Jungmann, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning, this is a putt-putt administration. "Putt-putt?" Jungmann wondered. "Yes. It takes two or three months for something to happen. When it does happen, everything changes: the economy, the currency, the ministers...." Minister Alexis Stepanenko, who was shifted from Planning to Mines and Energy--his fourth move within the cabinet--is tired. "I hope they don't move me again," he grumbled. He found out he would be reassigned on Wednesday morning when he got a phone call from Itamar. "You're going to Mines and Energy, O.K.?" [preceding word in English] the president said. "But why? Don't you and Fernando Henrique like my work?" Stepanenko wanted to know. "Best wishes, minister. Best wishes. Ciao," said President Itamar, ending the phone call. Senator Beni Veras, of the Ceara PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], went to Planning thanks to his party colleague Fernando Henrique. A former traveling salesman and the son of a tailor, Veras had to struggle to earn his degree in business administration. As an executive in the Guararapes apparel factory, he never took a vacation or missed a day of work. When fired, he sued the company and used the money he received to set up his own clothing factory, Confex. Soon he became a business leader and participated in the movement that launched Tasso Jereissati as candidate for governor of Ceara in 1986. Gutsy For the Ministry of Regional Integration, Itamar went looking for a name in the PMDB. The post had been vacant since the budget scandal broke out and implicated then-Minister Alexandre Costa. The party chose Deputy Aluizio Alves, who was minister of administration under Sarney and once served as governor of Rio Grande do Norte. Aluizio Alves is a choice that comes with a lot of baggage. Along with his son and office manager Aluizio, Alves is accused of igniting a bonfire of improprieties in the ministry, ranging from payments to contractors for projects never built, to disappearance of equipment. The father was indicted in four Federal Police investigations. He was eventually acquitted in three of them. In the remaining one, he is accused of crimes against the public administration. The son has four cases pending against him in the federal courts. "Appointing Aluizio Alves is just another gutsy move by the Itamar government," was the sarcastic comment by Deputy Augusto Carvalho of the PPS [Socialist People's Party] of the Federal District, who plans to requisition information on the minister from the Federal Police, the National Accounting Office, and the Federal Supreme Court. As minister, Aluizio Alves hired 620 employees in irregular fashion, including six relatives. He was responsible for managing 213 apartment buildings that are occupied by federal civil servants. He took care to hand over the best units to his relatives--one of them measuring 242 square meters and featuring four bedrooms, all renovated with marble. Minister Aluizio Alves is a wealthy man, the owner of a newspaper, a TV station, and five radio stations in Rio Grande do Norte. When he left the Sarney government in 1989, he tried to get himself elected to the Superior Military Court. He won the election, but was never sworn in. The vote in the Senate was annulled when evidence of fraud came to light. Starting Monday, Aluizio Alves will have a budget of 23 billion real cruzeiros to administer.
