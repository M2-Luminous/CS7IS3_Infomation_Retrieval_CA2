The Customs modernization portion of this Act (Title VI of Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057, codified at 19 U.S.C. 3301 note), popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act or ``Mod Act,'' became effective when it was signed. In order to share ``straw man'' implementation proposals specific to carrier manifest requirements and entry and clearance procedures, remote filing, and general order procedures, and to invite informal dialogue relative to implementation plans and issues, the Office of Inspection and Control conducted a series of public meetings throughout the country. These meetings were announced in other Federal Register notices, e.g., 59 FR 15498, dated April 1, 1994, and 59 FR 27306, dated May 26, 1994. Comments and suggestions received on the ``straw man'' proposals have been reviewed, analyzed, and, in some cases, incorporated into the revised proposals that will be presented at a final public meeting scheduled to be held on August 26, 1994, in Washington, DC, at the Renaissance Hotel, located at 999 9th Street, NW., from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The meeting will begin with a general briefing covering the Office of Inspection and Control's progress to date, including a review of the discussions from previous public meetings and future plans to implement ``Mod Act'' provisions. Following this general briefing, staff members from the Office of Inspection and Control will present revised proposals concerning vessels, air, truck and rail, general orders, and remote entry filing (for release purposes). Among the topics to be discussed at this session will be: carrier manifest requirements, electronic transmission of data, carrier entry and clearance procedures, and carrier liability issues. Presentations on the status of the In-bond Task Force and the Automated Export System Development Team will be provided by members of those teams. Participants will be given ample opportunity to ask questions and provide suggestions. In addition, the Director of the ``Mod Act'' Task Force will report on the present status of implementing provisions of the ``Mod Act.''
