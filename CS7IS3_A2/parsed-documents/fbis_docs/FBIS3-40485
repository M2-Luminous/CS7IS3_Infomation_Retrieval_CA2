Future work on the fuel cycle will be determined greatly by the demonstration FBR program. In the FBR experts' subcommittee, selection of type of the first demonstration reactor was narrowed down to the top entry type, and the feasibility of the technology has been studied mainly by this subcommittee's basic survey subgroup. Results of this study are to be reported at the FBR subcommittee on 22 September. If work on the draft of the subcommittee's interim wrap-up has advanced sufficiently, a draft report of the interim wrap-up may be presented as well. With regard to the demonstration FBR program, the current long-term plan for development and use of nuclear energy says that construction will begin in the latter half of the 1990s, but no concrete policy has been set. Finalization of the report will depend on the degree of specificity of the plans presented by the electric power companies, who will be the main entities involved in the building and operation of the demonstration FBR. Although the construction date will become clear in the course of coordination of the plans, it appears that the intention is to leave construction cost as an issue for future deliberation. As for R&D, prospects are good that the roles of the government and the private sector, including technological development at the large-scale research facility in the Oarai Engineering Center of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC), will be decided. Subcommittee wrap-up is expected to be around October or November. Paralleling this work by the FBR experts' subcommittee, Subgroup Two of the long-term plan experts' subcommittee also is hurrying to complete its work. Subgroup Two is to review the plutonium supply and demand balance that was released 2 years ago, based on the demonstration FBR development program presented by the FBR subcommittee, and already has presented a table of estimates at the August meeting of the subgroup. According to that table of estimates, there will be a delay in commencement of operation of the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant if demonstration FBR development proceeds according to the current long-term plan for development and use of nuclear energy, but plutonium supply and demand will be balanced because of delays in construction of the ``Monju'' and the demonstration advanced thermal reactor (ATR). This will be reestimated in the future when operation of the demonstration FBR begins. Incidentally, the majority view is that the date of commencement of operation of the demonstration FBR will be somewhat later than given in the current long-term plan. The wrap-up of Subgroup Two is expected to be done within the year.
