FR940628-1-00083 FR940628-1-00014 The study ``Center of Gravity Height: A Round-Robin Measurement Program,'' sponsored by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and conducted by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI&hyph;91&hyph;4) compared the test facilities, procedures, and results of center of gravity height measurements at four laboratories. Each of the four laboratories used different test equipment and procedures. The study concluded that different measurement procedures can produce significantly different results. However, the study also concluded that for each laboratory and test procedure, repeatability was very good. Another study, ``Vehicle Inertial Parameters_Measured Values and Approximations,'' by Garrott et al. (Society of Automotive Engineers # 881767) shows the coefficient of variation of center of gravity height at the Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) facility to be 0.8 percent. The measurements used in the analyses of the relationship of critical sliding velocity and single vehicle rollover accidents came from the VRTC facility. Based on these studies, NHTSA believes that measurements of center of gravity height and roll moment of inertia are repeatable within an individual laboratory using a specified procedure. NHTSA also believes that these measurements would be repeatable among different laboratories if all were using the same test procedure. The agency has data on a group of six make/models of light trucks and one make/model of car for which tests were run on identical vehicles, or repeated tests were run on the same vehicle. The results for all of these tests show the repeatability of critical sliding velocity to be well within the required accuracy of one kilometer per hour. Therefore, NHTSA tentatively concludes that the test procedure proposed in this notice would produce repeatable results. The proposed regulatory text does not include language for either the test equipment or the test procedure. The test equipment to be used in the procedure is VTRC's Inertial Parameter Measuring Device (IPMD). The equipment is described in United States Patent No. 5,177,998. VRTC is in the process of refining the test procedure for use with the IPMD, which is described in the report, ``Vehicle Inertial Parameters_Measured Values and Approximations,'' by Garrott et al. of NHTSA's VRTC. Copies of both the patent and the report have been placed in Docket No. 91&hyph;68, Notice 03. 2. Tilt Table Angle Some commenters to the ANPRM stated that the tilt table procedure is not standard practice and its repeatability is not known. Other commenters stated that the procedure was repeatable. NHTSA examined two studies which concluded that the tilt table test is a simple, repeatable method of estimating the static roll stability of a vehicle. ``Sensitivity Analysis of the Tilt Table Test Methodology'' is a study sponsored by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and conducted by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI&hyph;91&hyph;48 December 1991). UMTRI found the tilt table test to be repeatable in their laboratory and found nothing to prevent site-to-site reproducibility. The other study is a NHTSA study which found the following parameters to be critical to achieving an accurate tilt table angle: slow, steady lift rate, minimal platform deflection, platform angle measurement accurate to 0.1 degree, and accuracy of measurement of the point at which the last tire leaves the table (DOT HS 807 747 May 1991). Based on these studies, NHTSA believes that the tilt table test would result in repeatable measurements if conducted under specified conditions. The agency's results for either tests on identical vehicles or multiple tests on the same vehicle show the repeatability of tilt table angle to be within the required accuracy of one degree. To ensure repeatability, NHTSA has included specific test conditions in the tilt table angle test procedure. D. Timing of Information Provided by the Manufacturers and NHTSA By each January 1st, each manufacturer would be required to report to NHTSA the stability metric for each vehicle to be manufactured on or after the next September 1 and on or before the first August 31 following that September 1st. Thus, the information for ``1997 model year'' vehicles (vehicles manufactured between September 1, 1996 and August 31, 1997) would have to be reported by January 1, 1996. NHTSA recognizes that not all manufacturers change to production of a new model year on the same date. If a manufacturer changes production on a date after September 1, and the difference between model years affects the stability metric, the manufacturer would have to report a metric for two ``vehicles'' for a single make/model. NHTSA requests comments on these proposed dates. NHTSA would consider changing the beginning and ending date of the annual production period specified in this regulation if there was a different date that coincides with a majority of manufacturers' ``model year.'' If option one, which is a quantitative measure based on vehicle metric calculations, were chosen for a final rule, NHTSA would use the information provided by the manufacturers to supply manufacturers with ranges for all passenger cars and light trucks for the upcoming model year by April 1 of that year (i.e., in the above example, NHTSA would provide manufacturers ranges for 1997 model year vehicles by April 1, 1996.) If option two were chosen, NHTSA would use the information provided to provide manufacturers with the ``rating'' which must be labeled on the vehicle. Since there is a possibility that this information could not be provided by April 1, the agency requests comments on how much leadtime manufacturers would need to place the information on labels and in owner's manuals on all vehicles manufactured on or after September 1.
