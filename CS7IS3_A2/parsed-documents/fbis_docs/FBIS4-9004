In his view, the Balkan countries should call for a change in the status quo but not for a complete and sharp lifting of the sanctions as suggested by Serbia and Greece. "It is not proper to claim that the Balkan countries or Bulgaria are ready to tolerate indefinitely the current state of affairs, linking it to a so far unclear positive effect on the peace process in the former Yugoslavia," Videnov said. He believes that "Bulgaria cannot uphold a view that in April 1994 the embargo is a strong peace factor in the Balkans." He said he objected to Bulgaria's positive official view on the embargo rather than to its commitment to enforce it. During his unofficial visit to Bulgaria on Sunday, Vladislav Jovanovic, foreign minister of Serbia and Montenegro, also called for the lifting of the sanctions as "a road to the peaceful settlement of the Yugo-conflict." After his meeting with Jovanovic, Bulgaria's Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said Bulgaria would continue enforcing the sanctions despite the great damage it has suffered. Zhan Videnov believes that the sanctions could be lifted partly by allowing transit transport across Serbia and Montenegro, to which the international community has become reconciled according to him. This has not materialized because Bulgaria has not been importunate, so the embargo has cost it several billion dollars, Videnov said. According to him, the United Nations should take a decision at last to grant passage to escorted Bulgarian convoys through Serbia and Montenegro. Videnov drew an analogy between this and the decision taken by Bulgarian Parliament last Friday to allow UN equipment granted by the U.S. Government to cross Bulgaria into Macedonia, where it will be used by the UN Protection Force. The BSP voted against, arguing that Bulgaria had clearly declared itself in favour of non-involvement in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The other parliamentary forces, President Zhelyu Zhelev and the government stated that granting the convoy a single passage would contribute to Macedonia's security, and therefore to Bulgaria's security, and would not run counter to the basic principles of Bulgaria's Balkan policy. The Socialist leader assumes that the UN blue helmets in Macedonia are the prelude to U.S. military bases on its territory. "The whole affair is under the UN aegis but genetically it is not related to the UN," Videnov said. According to him, Macedonia has the sovereign right to decide together with the United States or any other country how to guarantee its national security. "What worries me is the likelihood of revival of the logic of cordons, blocs and axes in the Balkans, the likelihood of keeping the peace in the Balkans through foreposts of great powers or military alliances," the socialist leader said.
