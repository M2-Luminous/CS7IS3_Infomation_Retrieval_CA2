FBIS4-214 "drafr065_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Federal, National Parties React to Editorial Federal, National Parties React to Editorial MB0404161194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1513 GMT 4 Apr 94 MB0404161194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by Duncan Guy] [Text] Johannesburg April 4 SAPA -- Federal Party leader Frances Kendall on Monday [4 April] expressed support for an editorial in the latest issue of the London SUNDAY TIMES, calling for the postponement of regional elections. The editorial accused the National Party and the African National Congress leaders' propaganda machines of "perpetrating an enormous fraud on 40 million South Africans" by claiming the interim constitution was a federal one even when many foreign experts had pointed out it was not. Ms Kendall said the only way to bring the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) into the democratic process was to devolve real powers to the regions, then elect regional structures -- not the other way around. "All of the regional elections should be postponed to allow Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington the opportunity to recommend constitutional changes and have them implemented. In the meanwhile, a nationally elected body can run the country rather than the authoritarian Transitional Executive Council (TEC)," she said. Ms Kendall added that the state of emergency and clampdown on the IFP would not solve the fundamental issue that the constitution was not federal, and the real issue of federal power was the underlying cause of violence in the country. Meanwhile the National Party (NP) called the tone of the SUNDAY TIMES editorial "hysterical", adding that its criticism confirmed "we South Africans know more about how to solve our problems than a British editor 6,000 miles away." The NP said it was acutely aware of risks facing South Africa at present. "That is exactly why President (F W) de Klerk took the initiative in proposing a meeting between himself, (ANC leader) Mr (Nelson) Mandela, (IFP leader) Chief (Mangosuthu) Buthelezi and the Zulu king which will take place on Friday." It said that to allege that the NP was guilty of an enormous fraud exposed the newspaper's lack of understanding and knowledge of the situation in South Africa. "The newspaper's implicit claim, that the NP sees the state of emergency in Natal as a solution, is without foundation and an indication that its editor did not read President de Klerk's statement when he announced the state of emergency." The state of emergency, the NP stressed, was never intended as a solution.
