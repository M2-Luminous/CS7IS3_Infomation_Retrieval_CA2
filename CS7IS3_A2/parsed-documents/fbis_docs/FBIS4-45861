According to this source, who does not wish to be named because he fears a negative reaction from the public, the virus was not destroyed out of the sheer indolence of the staff involved in the research. "The scientific recommendation from the World Health Organization that supplies of the smallpox virus be destroyed were ignored by us out of laziness, not out of any evil intentions," he declared. The ministerial commission that is now looking into the fate of the dangerous virus has -- to date -- only Kotlar's statement at its disposal. He has admitted that, although he ordered the virus's destruction, he was not personally present for it. Moreover, according to the findings so far, there are no records of this. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry rejects the possibility that the smallpox virus was unknowingly preserved in the Czech Republic until this February, that is, until the entire bank of viral strains was completely destroyed. According to some employees from the military institute, a test tube with this virus could -- of course -- have been deposited along with the other viruses in a special container with liquid nitrogen and did not have to be registered in the official record of the bank of viral strains. Doctors recorded the last case of smallpox in Czechoslovakia in 1976 when a Czechoslovak Airlines pilot was diagnosed as having the disease after he returned from Bombay, India. The Czechoslovak Health Service stopped inoculating the population against smallpox in 1980 after the World Health Organization had ascertained that mankind was no longer at risk from a smallpox epidemic.
