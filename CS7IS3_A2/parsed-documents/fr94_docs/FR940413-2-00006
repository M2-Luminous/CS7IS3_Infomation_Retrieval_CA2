FR940413-2-00006 FR940413-2-00004 [A&hyph;475&hyph;059] Pressure Sensitive Plastic Tape From Italy; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration/International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping finding on pressure sensitive plastic tape from Italy. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Todd Peterson or Thomas Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4195 or 482&hyph;3814, respectively. Background On October 21, 1977, the Department of the Treasury published in the Federal Register (42 FR 56110) the antidumping finding on pressure sensitive plastic tape (PSPT) from Italy. On October 18, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 53709). On October 27, 1993, the petitioner, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), requested that we conduct an administrative review for the period October 1, 1992, through September 30, 1993. We published a notice of initiation of the antidumping administrative review on November 17, 1993. The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by the review are shipments of PSPT measuring over 13/8 inches in width and not exceeding 4 mils in thickness, classifiable under item numbers 3919.90.20 and 3919.90.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS). HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and for Customs purposes. The written descriptions remain dispositive. Preliminary Results of Review Because the single manufacturer/exporter subject to review, NAR, had no shipments of this merchandise to the United States during the period of review, the Department has preliminarily assigned NAR the rate applicable to it from its most recent administrative review as the estimated cash deposit rate. This rate is 1.24 percent. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed firm will be that firm's rate established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, or the original less-than-fair-value investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters not previously reviewed will be 12.66 percent, the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first notice of final results of administrative review published by the Department (48 FR 35686, August 5, 1983). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. Interested parties may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice, and may request a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held as early as convenient for the parties but not later than 44 days after the date of publication or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs or other written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including its results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments. This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: April 5, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8906 Filed 4&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
