By the year 2000 around 10 million Germans could be mobile telephone subscribers. The entire telecommunications field should by then have a greater importance in the national economy than the automobile industry. Provided that the federal liberalization and the elimination of monopolies proceeds rapidly. And, not least of all, the natural, comfortable use of the mobile phone--that is, its development from luxury item into consumer good--should contribute to such rates of growth. At the current time, however, being constantly accessible [by telephone] remains a luxury. There are approximately 1.8 million mobile phone subscribers in Germany who treat themselves to this still costly freedom. It is primarily business customers then who are acquiring [phones by] the only two competitors currently in this market, the Telekom subsidiary DeTeMobil and the private Mannesmann Mobilfunk. That is supposed to change in May when E-plus wants to start [operating]: this new company, under the management of Thyssen and Veba, was officially granted a license for a second private mobile phone network last May and was founded in April. New focus groups, like the young, singles and regionally active business people, will be targeted. The goal of the newcomer is to conquer the mass market. And without a doubt the structure of the market will change greatly with the entry of E-plus: the buildup of the network will be forced; the use of mobile phones will develop more quickly into a consumer good; the initially strongly regional company E-plus will bring about a change in the rate policies, also in those of the competition, and thus a mid-term reduction in price. With the start-up of E-plus the market will finally be opened up. Since the new company does not want to present itself--next to DeTeMobil and Mannesmann Mobilfunk--as the "third in the alliance" of those who have been granted a lucrative license. E-plus wants to act. We can well be curious about the marketing mix. The suspicion that the two other licensees, to the detriment of their initial customers, are trying in a "secret alliance" to amortise their network as quickly as possible is unresolved. Customers can hope that when E-plus enters the market, then this often criticized "alliance" will break up. If we look at the head start that DeTeMobil and Mannesmann Mobilfunk already have now with the build-up of the network and the acquisition of customers, then E-plus's strategy seems born of necessity. The past year and a half have shown that the market actually is growing more quickly than the optimistically intended forecasts made at the start of D1 and D2 predicted: for 1993 the two [service] providers counted on 300,000 to 350,000 subscribers. Nearly a million customers, however, were actually signed up by the end of last year. And the number increases daily by two thousand. The reason is first and foremost the unexpectedly large decrease in the price of the mobile phone. The strategy of the newcomer could thus bear fruit, although it will not be able to reach the profit zone until after the two established [companies]. The rapid development in the mobile phone occurs, however, in the face of increased competition which is to the detriment of some private providers of equipment and services. The price of the equipment has dropped dramatically, and it is here that the struggle for customers is already being waged. The calling charges are actually relatively stabile. That leads to the "English sickness" in Germany, too: the equipment is to some extent sold below cost in the hopes that customers will be industrious about booking "air-time," that is, will use the telephone. The success of this strategy is hampered by the high prestige value of the mobile phone. For many, the possession of this phone is more important than the telephoning, especially since that is very expensive. These customers, however, do not make the business profitable for the now 13 private service providers. But also the three network providers are struggling with starting difficulties. The old burden of structural difficulties is giving DeTeMobil a great deal of trouble; Mannesmann Mobilfunk cannot keep up with the high level of advertising activity by DeTeMobil, which is written off as cross subsidization by the parent [company]; and the newcomer E-plus must after all start out with high investment costs [coupled] with a simultaneous late start compared to the established competition. Since in spite of some still existing "phone service gaps"--the DeTeMobil and Mannesmann Mobilfunk networks already almost blanket Germany now--E-plus must make due at first with patchwork solutions. On the other hand, the start-up costs are lower than for the two D-networks operators. The costs for the infrastructure are estimated to be between twenty and thirty percent more favorable than in 1990. The way to the mass market is, however, also being smoothed over by the newcomer. The new network is laid out in such a close-knit fashion that telephones can be used which have a substantially lower transmitting power than the phones in use up until now, which also means the batteries will last longer. And the smaller and more compact that the telephones are, the greater will be their acceptance by the public. Experts predict that in a while around 90% of the end units will be pocket models. When all networks are so built up that units with low transmitting power are sufficient, the decisive [factor] in the market success of the product will no longer lie with the technology of mobile phones but rather and especially with the marketing and thus also with the price. The Pan-European digital GSM standard does not permit a great deal of differentiation. If the price over the mid term approaches that of the [landline] network, however, it will become clear that mobile communication offers not only a complement by rather an authentic alternative to location-bound telecommunication. Only then will the mobile telephone enjoy the future which is being predicted for it.
