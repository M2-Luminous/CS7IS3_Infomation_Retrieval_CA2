During the visit, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi met with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and a number of Palestinian figures in Jordan. In a statement before his departure for Tunis, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said that he will meet with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to discuss the memorandum that was presented to him by Palestinian figures two weeks ago. This memorandum calls for expanding the base of decisionmaking within the PLO. He stressed the importance of reactivating Jordanian-Palestinian coordination within the framework of Arab coordination. This is especially so since the peace negotiations are facing a crisis that requires pooling Arab efforts to overcome it in a way that guarantees Arab rights and interests. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi is accompanied by a delegation that includes a number of Palestinian figures who signed the memorandum.
