GATT head Peter Sutherland, attending an economic summit in Beijing, said China's reentry would be dependent on China and trade body members hammering out a protocol by the end of June which can speed negotiations. "The protocol is in effect a text of the agreement under which the reentry will take place. It will set up the broad terms and conditions under which China will reenter the multilateral system," he said. China wants to reenter GATT before January 1995, when the Uruguay Round of agreements come into effect and GATT becomes the World Trade Organization (WTO). Issues regarding transparency in China's trade regime and safeguards assuring that China will abide by GATT agreements are needed before reentry can take place, Sutherland said. "One needs to be satisfied that the legislative framework is in place to provide an adequate assurance to the contracting parties that they have security in terms of trading policy," he said. "Assurances need to be given that the (GATT trade) regime will be evenhandedly applied, not merely through national government but also at the provincial level. This is an obligation imposed on the Chinese Government authorities," he added. Sutherland acknowledged the critical role of the United States in overseeing China's reentry, saying the U.S. is "constructively engaged" with the Chinese and there is no reason to believe that the U.S. is "blocking" China's reentry. He said failure for the U.S. to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status in June would "signal difficulties vis-a-vis the conclusion of the reentry to the WTO," while maintaining that the issues "are not related." Since Sutherland's arrival in China on Monday evening, the Chinese press has viewed his visit as an assurance that China will be allowed to enter the WTO at "an early date," preferably as a founding member. China was a founding member of GATT but pulled out of the trading body after the People's Republic was founded in 1949. The ongoing economic summit meeting has attracted many of China's top economic and trade leaders. Featured speakers include Sutherland, World Bank managing director Ernest Stern, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and top executives from leading multinational enterprises.
