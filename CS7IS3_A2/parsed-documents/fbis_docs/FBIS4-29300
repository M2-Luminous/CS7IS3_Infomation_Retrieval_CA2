The army brigadier, who is also chairman of the sub-Committee for Lao-Thai Border Security Keeping, said in a press conference, "Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham, member of the sub-Committee for Thai-Lao Border Security Keeping, made a statement through Thai Radio and Thai TV (Channel 3) on the evenings of May 26, 27 and 28 alleging that the Lao People's Army put chemical substances into water and on tree leaves in the area along Thai-Lao border opposite Thai Phayao's Chiang Khan District, Thai Nan's Mae Rin District and Ban Sok in Thai Uttaradit and that this caused death to Lao people and animals." He said the same statement was also published in the May 27 issue of "Thailand Times" and in the May 26 issue of "Daily News". Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit categorically denied the Thai army officer's allegation and confirmed that the Lao People's Army neither spread chemical substances over those areas nor possessed any such chemical weapons, chemical substances, nor have they purchased any such chemical substances from abroad. He added that such a news report was simply a fabrication by Thai authorities. He stressed that not only was it slander against the Lao People's Army and the Lao PDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] but also an act of sabotage against the Lao-Thai relations, causing trouble in the areas concerned and creating misunderstanding between the people of Laos and Thailand. The Lao army officer also held that the one who created the event had to solve it. This means that Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham must admit his statement in front of the Lao side during the meeting of the committees for Lao-Thai border security keeping scheduled to take place in Vientiane late June this year. He elaborated that to improve cooperation in common border security keeping both sides had to strictly implement the relevant agreement signed between the two committees for border security. Only in so doing would the two armies be able to fulfill their responsibilities to their respective governments for safeguarding peace and security along the common border.
