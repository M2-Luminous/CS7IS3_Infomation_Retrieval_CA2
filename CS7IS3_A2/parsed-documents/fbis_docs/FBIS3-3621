At 1500 that afternoon, leading comrades of the municipal revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang walked to a meeting room of the organ of the municipal party committee, where Comrade Chen Xitong had already stayed. Chen Xitong happily said: Today, I invite comrades of the Kuomintang Committee, a friendly party of ours, here to have a talk. There are already the system of political consultation and the forms of special report meetings and forums. But, the small-scale heart-to-heart talks are very limited. Now that you are invited to a heart-to-heart talk today, you may make yourselves at home and chatter away about this and that, such as international and domestic situation, the modernization of the capital, the united front work, and the difficulties and problems requiring our help and solution. Amid the cordial and warm atmosphere, comrades of the committee of Kuomintang, expressed their opinions on the multiparty cooperation led by the CPC, on participation in and discussion of political affairs, on democratic supervision, on overseas propaganda, and on self-construction. Some comrades said with deep feeling: Through heart-to-heart talks, our affection with municipal leading comrades has become closer and we are greatly inspired. Comrades participating in the talk maintained that this form of talk was good and convenient for them to speak their mind freely. During the three-hour talk, Chen Xitong continuously exchanged opinions and ideas with Kuomintang comrades. He said: In upholding the principles of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and sharing honor or disgrace, the key lies in showing utter devotion to each other. Only by having a heart-to-heart talk can we establish a profound friendship and can we coexist for a long time and supervise each other in an even better way. Today's heart-to-heart talk is the first of its kind between us. From now on, we should strengthen contacts through diverse forms. The CPC and the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang share the same goal, that is, to make China strong and prosperous at an earlier date and to build the socialism with Chinese characteristics that was advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Therefore, the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang has no reason to refuse to participate in the multiparty cooperation and has no reason to refuse to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of showing utter devotion to each other, that had been manifested between Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and the old generation of leaders of democratic parties. Chen Xitong sincerely hoped that the revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang would recommend its comrades to hold leading posts at pertinent government departments. He added: The CPC should strengthen the construction of itself, but I hope that democratic parties will also strengthen the construction of themselves. Attending the heart-to-heart talks were He Luli, Zhang Lianyun, Wang Xijue, Li Peiyu, Gan Peigen, Jiang Jianguo, Han Ruqi, He Shengtao, and Geng Yuqi, leaders of the municipal revolutionary committee of the Kuomintang. Also attending were Wang Daming, Li Zhijian, and Shen Rendao, leaders of the municipality. It is learned that Comrade Chen Xitong will also hold talks with leading comrades of other democratic parties and industrial and commercial federations in the first half of this year.
