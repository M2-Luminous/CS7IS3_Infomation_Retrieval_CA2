Asked why he wants to stay in power, Kravchuk replies: "There are many reasons. The first and most important is the fact that over the last two and a half years, Ukraine has made very important and very serious steps toward forming its own statehood and reorientating the economy toward the market and reforms. Over these years, Ukraine has become a state in full measure and has been recognized by the world community. "Obviously, I am not trying to take credit for all these achievements; I realize these have been achieved by the people and all the power structures. In spite of all the criticisms, they have made very important steps in this direction. Therefore, I would like to see that everything that has been planned and implemented, all the foundations that have been laid, should develop and be consolidated. This is one of the most important reasons." In reply to criticism that during recent years, life in the Republic has deteriorated, Kravchuk said: "Yes, the material life has not improved for the majority of the people, and for a considerable part it has even deteriorated. I can explain this. Such a major transition from one system to another, such major changes in society, the change in economic and politic systems certainly involves major consequences, and people can feel this for themselves; this is inevitable. Neither Ukraine nor other states are an exception here." Asked whether he, as the president, has created the necessary conditions for implementing the reforms, Kravchuk says: "The conditions were created. It is another matter that it was not easy to find educated and professional people in the situation that evolved -- I mean, we started the reforms with the personnel potential of the past. Attempts to introduce new people into the government -- there were such attempts in the Fokin and Kuchma governments, but to my great regret and sadness, the people who joined the government with good intentions to step up the reforms failed to implement them." Kravchuk is asked whether he regards himself as a nationalist. He replies: "I am very often asked this question here in Ukraine. Some call me a nationalist, while others call me a betrayer of national interests; in other words, there is one point of view on the left and another on the right." He continues: "My reply will be brief: I have defended and will defend the interests of the people of Ukraine, the national interests, because there can be no other interests than state interests, integrity, and the independence of Ukraine and its statehood. This is my sacred duty." To the accusations that the disruption of economic ties has done a great deal of damage to common people, Kravchuk agrees that politicians are to blame for this. He says: "I will be honest with you. I am ready to sign a document on free trade with Russia tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and I have proposed this repeatedly. But let us be consistent. There should be no exceptions to free trade. In other words, Ukraine should not make exceptions and Russia should not make exceptions, if we are talking about free trade where goods move freely. But Russia says it would not be beneficial to subject its oil, gas, and nonferrous metals to the sphere of the free movement of goods -- on the whole, more than 60 different goods that earn Russia's revenue. In such a case, Ukrainian manufacturers would have to buy oil and gas for twice as much as do Russian manufacturers. How can they compete with Russian manufacturers? They cannot. Therefore, I agree with you: The political leadership is to blame for this, but both political leaderships, not only Ukraine's; one should not reduce this to saying that we are the ones pursuing some special policy." Asked about national ideology, Kravchuk says: "We are not dividing people according to their nationality either in the economic, political, legal, or any other aspect." He adds: "We are building a civil society and all our ideology is based on this. We know and firmly believe that to build a state in a multinational country on the basis of nationality would be dangerous for the development of this state. This would be grounds for possible contradictions today and tomorrow." Touching upon Crimea and federalism, Kravchuk says: "Evidently, it is not easy at present to find a clear-cut and correct solution." He adds: "I am advocating and will advocate the most decisive economic sovereignty of the regions; in other words, the widest and fullest rights and freedoms as regards the budget, the formation of the budget from below, and the utilization of resources and protection of people's interests taking into account the peculiarities of a particular region." To the accusation that Ukraine has isolated itself from Russia, Kravchuk replies: "I cannot agree that we have isolated ourselves. Only recently, apart from signing the treaty on friendship and cooperation with Russia, we have signed more than 70 different political, economic, and other documents." He adds: "It was not Ukraine who started erecting borders, but Russia -- one can check the documents. It is not Ukraine who stands firmly at a customs post today and says that customs duties are necessary."
