The problem will reportedly be the central issue at talks between the Lithuanian Government, the central bank and an IMF mission that is scheduled to come to Vilnius next week. "The fund is quite concerned about inflation. It has gone up from less than 1 percent in August to 7.3 percent in October and then fell to 6.8 and 6.2 percent in November and December respectively. These are inflation figures that we regard as too high," Cornelius said. The IMF official admitted, however, that there are some extraordinary factors behind these figures, such as the reduction of subsidies to energy and the increased import tariffs for certain agricultural products. Cornelius said "these factors had an impact on inflation, however to a large extent, it has been caused by the monetary policy" of the Lithuanian central bank. He said this is indicated by the amount of money in circulation. 1 billion lits were supposed to be in circulation by the end of 1993, but 1.1 billion were released. Another 0.1 billion later added to that amount in two weeks. "Next week, the IMF mission will thoroughly discuss inflation and how to get the monetary policy back on track." Cornelius said the central bank's interference with the foreign currency market is too strong. On the average, the bank buys around 5 million U.S. dollars per week, or around 20-15 million per month, which is around 80-100 million lits. The IMF representative said the bank's hard currency reserves totalled 227 million U.S. dollars in late December, but, according to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, the reserve was supposed to be only 110 million. Cornelius denied press reports that the IMF pressingly recommends to create a currency board, but added that the system has some advantages. "No space is left for politics to interfere with the monetary policy." In his opinion, a currency board also means "very tight arrangements which do not allow credits to the government, enterprises and commercial banks." Currency boards function in Estonia, Hong Kong and Argentina. Their activities are very successful in all of these countries, Cornelius said. "We do not push the idea of a currency board but we are ready to help in implementing it if the government makes a decision and if there is strong support in the parliament.''
