In an statement to Radio Monte Carlo, Dr. Salman said the timing of these aggressions is part of Israel's continued attempts to undermine the peace process and obstruct U.S. efforts that aim at ending the stalemate in the peace talks, which were launched in accordance with the Madrid frame of reference. He noted that the cause of the stalemate is Israel's hard-line approach that rejects full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories in return for full peace.
