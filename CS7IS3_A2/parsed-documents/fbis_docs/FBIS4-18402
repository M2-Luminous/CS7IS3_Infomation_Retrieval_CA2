In the studio, Staisch reviews the historical background and at 1820 GMT broadcasts a prerecorded interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Staisch's first question concerns why Europe is hardly involved in the peace efforts. Kinkel responds: "I do not think that with regard to the Middle East peace process one can say that we are completely out of the picture. On the contrary, within the framework of the European Union [EU] we have done all we can politically, but also, very important, economically, for the region. We have supported the peace process. For example, we have tried to call upon those who still oppose this peace process to join in and to give up their resistance. And we have done everything possible within the framework of the multilateral opportunities to help, and that is not a little." Staisch asks: "To what extent is our overheated domestic situation, with regard to antiforeigner feeling, to new escalations against the Jews -- I am thinking here about the debate, one can hardly call it a debate, the slandering of Ignatz Bubis [chairman of the Jewish Community in Germany]. To what extent is this domestic situation a brake on our effectiveness in becoming involved in this peace process?" Kinkel replies: "I am very glad that this awful event in Luebeck [the firebombing of the synagogue] was received relatively calmly in Israel. But of course the violence from the extreme Right here is something which burdens our foreign policy as a whole. I always try to put it as simply as this: Moelln and Solingen [scenes of earlier antiforeigner attacks] have not been forgotten, not by any means. And of course the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck gives the whole matter another negative, unpleasant [word indistinct]. ``In my talks at home and abroad, my partners raise this topic again and again and it is very difficult to explain how such a thing can happen in Germany again.'' Regarding the deadline for the agreement reached on Maundy Thursday 13 April, about nine days away, Staisch asks Kinkel whether he is "optimistic" that on 13 April this peace process will get a huge boost. Kinkel says: "Well I hope that what was agreed on Maundy Thursday will actually be put into practice. I think it is necessary. After the awful events in Hebron it looked for a long time as if the process had come to a standstill. The week before last I had a long talk here with the Syrian foreign minister. I talked to other colleagues about it; we had a full discussion of the topic last weekend at our European Union meeting in Greece, and we thought about how we could help. I am glad that the talks have been resumed and we must trust that, above all, American influence, which is the most important in this Middle East peace process, helps to ensure that there is decisive progress." Staisch's final question: "It looks as if the interests of the Israelis and the Palestinians now coincide more than they have ever done before. The Israelis want out of the Gaza-Jericho power vacuum. They do not want to push escalation any further, they want to withdraw from it, and the Palestinians want to take on responsibility very quickly. Ideal conditions for a final agreement. Do you share this assessment, which is made by many observers?" Kinkel: "Basically, that is how it should be, but the Israelis have of course quite considerable security interests. That applies particularly to the situation vis-a-vis Syria. The Palestinians, on the other hand, would of course like to take on as soon as possible responsibilities of their own in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Basically, the interests are the same, but there has been too much in the past for things to go very quickly now. We hope -- and I think it's a realistic hope now -- that things will progress. We should continue to try to help 'Arafat, above all now directly in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, because he needs support there. The people who believe in him, put their hopes in him, who must also agree to the political line he takes, must see successes for themselves. They must be able to say, yes this peace process brings us something personally. If that is not the case we will endanger 'Arafat's position, which cannot be in our interests. ``Thus, what is important again is a rational stance on both sides. We have no direct opportunities to exert influence, but nor do the other European countries have a direct involvement. It is essentially the Americans' affair. Previously, the Russians were far more heavily involved in the region, but those times are past. Now it's very much up to the Americans, and we must ensure that by means of bilateral, multilateral, and economic aid we show above all that we are committed.''
