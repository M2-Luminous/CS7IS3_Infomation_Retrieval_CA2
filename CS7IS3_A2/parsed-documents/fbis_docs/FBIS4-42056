[Oreja] Basically that of encouraging the European Union [EU] to respect the member states' national identities. There is no incompatibility between the European interest and that of each particular nation, because the former is not something abstract: It is a real interest formed by that of the states comprising the Community. [De Andres] Which values, in your opinion, should the EU recover or highlight in order to surmount the disenchantment caused by its apparent powerlessness in the face of problems such as unemployment, the Yugoslav crisis, or the internal differences over the model of [European] building? [Oreja] I believe that, above all, it is necessary to implement the Maastricht Treaty to the letter, and, at the same time, to ensure that citizens know what is being done. In my opinion, the greatest failure on the part of the EU and the Commission has been the difficulty which they have encountered in convincing citizens that what is being done is something that directly affects their interests and ideals. [De Andres] To what do you attribute this lack of understanding between the Community authorities and the public? [Oreja] There are perhaps several reasons. There is an economic crisis which creates the temptation to renationalize policies, forgetting that a better solution to the potential problems which arise in the member states can often be found within the European framework. And then there is another crisis -- very grave, in my opinion -- which is the very widespread crisis of values in Europe. In my opinion, this situation requires greater vigilance, on the part not only of the governments but also of the citizens themselves, through associations and intermediate bodies. Indifference to moral values is a very worrying sign of our times, and, in my opinion, their recovery depends very much on economic recovery. [De Andres] Owing to the circumstances, you will keep Abel Matutes' portfolios -- transport and energy -- until the end of this year. Do you see yourself holding other responsibilities, perhaps in the area of the Community's external policy, in the next European Commission? [Oreja] One of the customs hitherto observed in the Commission is that a country does not repeat portfolios, although there is no written rule. In any event, I feel very content with the energy and transport portfolio, because it has a content characteristic of the treaty's "heart." [De Andres] During your predecessor's time in the post, there was talk of a tacit "nonaggression pact" between Abel Matutes and Spanish official policy. Your appointment to the post of European commissioner has also required the support of Felipe Gonzalez' government. Who will prevail? Marcelino Oreja the diplomat or the Christian Democratic politician? [Oreja] In the first place, I wish to point out that it is a matter not of a policy of "nonaggression" but of a policy of cooperation. In my opinion, irrespective of the still existing ideological differences, there should be good cooperation between the two Spanish citizens working in the Commission for one fundamental reason -- in order to make known, when necessary, the situation in one of the member states, which is the one which we know best. I emphasize that this is not to the detriment of our main task, which is safeguarding the European interest. [De Andres] Nevertheless, do you also intend to be responsive to the Community interests outlined by Madrid? [Oreja] There is an article in the treaty which is categorical and which lays down that a commissioner can receive no instruction from a government or from any other institution or association. This does not prevent my having a good relationship with the government and with all the Spanish social and economic sectors, because the commissioner must make known the situation in the state to which he belongs in the Community executive's deliberations. In my case, both my political career and my ideology -- which conforms to the principles of Christian humanism -- are unequivocal, and I will never renounce what is part of myself. [De Andres] You have made several references to your role as a communicator of the situation in Spain, whose image is not at its best right now.... [Oreja] I would like to explain that the commissioner's role is not to sell his country's image, this is the responsibility of the minister or the ambassador. Everybody must know how to play his role. In what I believe to be the defense of national interests, insofar as they coincide with European interests -- and they should be able to do so -- I see no reason for not performing the task well. [De Andres] Do you see Spain in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union in 1997? [Oreja] It seems very difficult to me at present. In fact, it is also difficult to make forecasts right now. Two months ago, I would have said that it was impossible that there could be a sufficient "critical mass" of countries at the end of 1996 to open the way to monetary union. Right now, the fact is that four new states are preparing to join the EU, and they will probably meet the Maastricht criteria in inflation and the public deficit. Today Spain is very far from achieving these results, at least in some of the convergence criteria. [De Andres] What consequences would this "uncoupling" from the economies of the north have? [Oreja] I believe that ensuring that the convergence process continues is more important than whether monetary union occurs in 1997 or 1999, and to this end appropriate economic policies must be adopted. As long as there are countries which have higher wage costs, energy costs, and fiscal and financial costs than the other countries, this gap will be sustained for want of the necessary competitiveness. The problem of competitiveness does not mainly concern enterprises but rather the economic policies mistakenly advocated by some European countries. [De Andres] Together with the possible creation of the single currency, another of the key tasks of the next European Commission will be the cooperation with the 1996 intergovernmental conference, which is to establish the new balances of power within the Community. How could Spain be left politically after that occasion? [Oreja] This is a very important matter for Europe's future, and so there should be no improvisation. I believe that in 1996 it is necessary also to involve the Commission and the Parliament, together with the personal representatives of the heads of government. I understand that there could be different rates of integration, provided that the final aim is for this to affect all the member states. [De Andres] What impact, in your opinion, will next month's elections to the European Parliament have? Will they be just a settling of scores over national issues? [Oreja] I believe that the "European" impact of those elections will be slight at the time that they are held, but important in its consequences from 13 June onward, because it makes a difference whether the future parliamentary majority is Socialist or People's Party.
