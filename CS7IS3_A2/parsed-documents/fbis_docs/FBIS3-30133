The ruling parties basically agreed to accept the LDP's proposal that a regulation on a limit on the public raising of funds for political parties should be included in the Law on Fund Raising for Political Parties. However, the ruling parties and the LDP failed to agree on the LDP's other proposal that "corporate status should be given to political parties" to clarify responsibilities of political parties which will receive subsidies. They will discuss this issue again and also the issue of the regulation on funding limits on 24 February. Regarding an issue of setting a limit on the public raising of funds for political parties, both sides basically agreed on the LDP's proposal that the amount of public funds allowed to be raised should be limited to less than two-thirds of the amount of revenue -- which does not include the amount of funds political parties raised publicly during the previous year. Concerning the issue of giving corporate status to political parties, they failed to reach an accord because participants from the ruling parties, one after another, said: "Giving corporate status to political parties would invite intervention by the administration. There is a possibility that `the freedom of association' will be violated by restricting political parties' activities. This issue should be cautiously discussed."
