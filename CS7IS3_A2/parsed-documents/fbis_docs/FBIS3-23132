The movement also announced the cancellation of the cease-fire between its combat groups and the forces of occupation, and herds of settlers and the resumption of operations against them. The movement called on the strike forces to escalate the intifadah against the settlers and the army forces at all times and to consider any settler who passes in Hebron streets as a target for our strike forces. The movement also called on national institutions and figures to halt all forms of contact with the departments of the military governor in Hebron, and held the Rabin government responsible for preparing and implementing the horrendous crime perpetrated by the settlers under the protection of the occupation forces.
