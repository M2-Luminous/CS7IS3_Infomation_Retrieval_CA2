The end of the "cold war" minimized the importance of military potential as a factor determining a country's position in the international arena and assigned priority to indicators of economic, scientific-technical, and financial strength. As a result, Russia, which had been the United States' equal as a leader in world development and which had essentially determined the course of this development in conjunction with the United States, turned into one of the large but economically weak states with claims to only a "secondary role." The collapse of the USSR, the severe economic crisis in Russia, and the uncertainty of emergence from it made our state even more vulnerable in world politics and international economic relations. Members of the U.S. military-political, business, and scientific communities, however, know that Russia still has significant economic and scientific-technical potential in addition to nuclear strength and political influence. If the reforms are successful, this could turn it into one of the United States' principal competitors in the international arena and the world market, particularly in several advanced fields. This is one of the main factors motivating the United States to become actively involved in the reform of the Russian economy according to guidelines convenient for the United States. Freedom of Choice? One of the main elements of the present U.S. policy on Russia is the encouragement of the Russian Government to choose patterns of economic reform meeting the long-term economic and political interests of the West. In this context, the United States was instrumental in imposing the IMF stabilization program on Russia. This program has obvious foreign economic goals in addition to internal economic objectives. The experience of other states with comparable programs proves that their main results are "favorable" economic conditions for the servicing of foreign debts and the rapid growth of energy and raw material exports, which have always been convenient for the United States and the other leading nations that are the largest creditors and consumers of fuel and raw materials. The results of Russian economic development since 1992 prove conclusively that the United States and other leading Western nations managed to create the necessary conditions for Russia's integration in the world economy as a country specializing in the export of fuel and raw materials and of finished goods requiring only the slightest processing. Serious negative tendencies of a structural nature, resulting from the IMF stabilization program, are already apparent in the Russian national economy. One of these tendencies is the "weight gain" of the Russian economy, in which the processing industries' share of physical production had already decreased to 64.5 percent in the first half of 1993 in comparison to 65.6 percent in 1992 and 67.9 percent in 1991. This was accompanied by the noticeable growth of the fuel and raw material sector, which accounted for 25 percent of physical production in 1993 in comparison to 11.3 percent in 1991. Besides this, the accelerated decline of industrial production as a result of the "shock therapy" also made additional fuel and raw materials available for export, which more than compensated for the reduction of output in various industries. When aluminum production in Russia decreased by 8 percent in 1990-1993, for example, its domestic consumption was reduced by a factor of almost 2.2, which allowed for a more than 3.7-fold increase in exports of this metal. Exports of crude oil from Russia increased by more than 20 percent just in 1993, in spite of the 6-percent reduction in output. As a result, exports of fuel and raw materials already exceed 80 percent of the Russian total. The expansion of Russian exports of fuel and raw materials to the world market is in the long-term and short-term interests of the United States and other developed Western countries. Russian shipments in recent years were the main factor destabilizing these markets and lowering prices. The index of world prices of nonferrous metals, for example, had reached its lowest level in the last eight years by the end of 1993--40 percent below the 1990 indicator. Comparable tendencies were apparent in the markets for energy resources. These price dynamics are extremely convenient for the industrially developed countries, stimulating their economies and helping them surmount economic difficulties of a cyclical nature. Welcome, or Off-Limits to Outsiders The United States' attempts to accomplish the Russian economy's integration in the world economy as a fuel and raw material appendage of the industrially developed nations are also evident from the development of trade and economic relations between the two countries. Raw materials are clearly prevalent, for example, in Russian exports to the United States: The overwhelming majority of export shipments to the American market consist of nonferrous metals (aluminum, nickel, zinc, copper, and others), metals of the platinum group, silver and precious stones, petroleum and petroleum products, inorganic chemicals, and fertilizers. Russian fuel and raw materials have been of the greatest interest to American private businessmen, who invested around 400 million dollars in Russia in 1993. It is no coincidence that the biggest project will entail a consortium of U.S. oil and gas companies investing a total of 3.4 billion dollars in the exploration and development of new oil and gas deposits in West Siberia and on the shelf of Sakhalin Island. All of this has been accompanied by U.S. attempts to crowd Russian exporters out of traditional markets and to keep Russia out of the world markets in which it could compete, particularly the markets for high-tech goods. In the last seven years Russia's share of world arms exports decreased from 38 to 17 percent, while the United States managed to increase its share from 30 to 58 percent. In the last two years alone, the United States almost doubled its own arms exports. Meanwhile, the United States, which has a monopoly in the world market for space services, is constantly spreading rumors about Russian dumping in this field, although this industry is no longer subsidized by the state in Russia, and the low overhead costs of production are due to effective technology and cheap manpower. A similar situation is taking shape in the world uranium market, where Russian shipments still account for only 4 percent of the total, although the Russian output represents around 25 percent of the world total. Furthermore, the United States is in no hurry to make any cardinal improvements in the trade and economic status of Russian goods. Most-favored-nation status in trade was extended to Russia for only one year, the Jackson-Vanik amendment is still in effect, and anti-monopoly legislation is still being applied vigorously to Russian goods. Integration processes on the North American continent are having an increasing effect on the development of foreign economic relations between the two countries. The more active recent steps to form a North American free trade zone (NAFTA) created even more difficulties for Russian goods in American markets. The sale of Russian motor vehicles in the United States with minimal customs duties, for example, would require two-thirds of the components to be produced in the NAFTA states. There are even more serious restrictions on textiles. The exporter of Russian linen fabrics to the United States has to prove that the goods have no analogues in the North American countries. The perceptible relaxation of CoCom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control] controls on exports of several high-technology goods to Russia was dictated primarily by competition in the world market. The findings of a study by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in particular, indicated that existing restrictions were ineffective because high-power computers could be obtained in the world market in circumvention of all controls. According to statements by American officials, the liberalization of computer exports will enhance the competitiveness of American companies substantially without hurting U.S. national security. In spite of Russia's increasingly severe socioeconomic difficulties, most of the West's financial aid is being extended in the form of comparatively expensive credits from international financial institutions, and not in the form of the nonrefundable aid that was extended to, for example, Japan and Germany during their periods of economic reform in the 1940s and 1950s. This provides more evidence that the West has no intention, or even the potential, to offer Russia sweeping economic assistance comparable to the famous Marshall Plan (the American aid in the restoration of the postwar economy of Western Europe), which would amount to 60-75 billion dollars in today's prices. The `Triangle' Will Not Become a `Square' This approach to the Russian reforms is a reflection of the way in which the United States and other Western powers see the new balance of power in the world economy and international relations after the end of the "cold war." At present there is an obvious tendency toward more vigorous efforts by the leading Western countries to set up an effective system for the collective regulation of world economic processes and international relations, which should be based on the three "poles" of economic strength--the United States, the European Union, and Japan, which account for around two-thirds of the world GDP. As Director F. Bergsten of the distinguished Institute of the World Economy remarked in this context, the "big three" should begin acting like an unofficial managing committee of the world economy. Under these conditions, Russia's many attempts to become an equal member of the group of leading Western countries for the collective resolution of global problems will not win any support. We must not forget that the harsh laws of competition were always at work in the world economy and international politics, and there was always the determination to secure national interests, frequently by infringing the national interests of others....
