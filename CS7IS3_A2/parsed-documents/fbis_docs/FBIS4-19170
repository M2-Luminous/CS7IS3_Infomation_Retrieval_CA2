The terrorists had sabotaged the part of the lines running into Northern Iraq and as a result no power has been sent to that region since Sunday [10 April]. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his weekly briefing that repair works are underway. Baghdad has cut off power to Northern Iraq. Turkey announced last week it will help the region to meet its needs.
