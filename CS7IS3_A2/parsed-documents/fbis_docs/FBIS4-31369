Meanwhile, the pursuit of Kosovar youths with the aim of forcefully sending them to the army of the Serbian aggressor do not cease. Mehmet Haziri reports from Prishtina: [Haziri] The Serbs installed in the Prishtina District Court filed a suit against a group of Albanians who had allegedly received out special training in Albania during 1992-93. According to the articles published today by the Serbian newspapers JEDINSTVO and BORBA, this group is made up of Femil Estrani, Shkelzen Bajrami, Nexhmedin Sabriu, Lul Heti, Beqir Muleti, Hysni Oranca, and Bajram Galapeni, inhabitants of the communes of Gllogovc, Shtime, Istog, Ferizaj, and Lipjan. They are accused of having allegedly prepared, in collaboration with several other persons, the violent secession of Kosova [Kosovo] and other areas in former Yugoslavia that are inhabited by Albanians in order to form an independent state or to annex it to Albania. The indictment also stresses that this group of Albanians, on the initiative, as it is claimed, of the illegal government of the Republic of Kosova and even of its prime minister, Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, had allegedly taken part in a special intelligence and military training in Lac and Labinot near Elbasan. The fabrications by the Serb Investigation Office and Court also stress that wearing the uniform of the Albanian Army, these youths from Kosova, after taking the oath, had allegedly been trained to use all kinds of arms and explosives, as well as to utilize all the military skills to carry out, as asserted, diversionist and terroristic acts. The Serbian mass media state that all the members of this group had nick-names and acted in full conspiracy. The trumped-up trials of Albanians on charges of having received military training in Albania have recently been held in Gjilan, Peje, and in several other centers of the republic of Kosova.
