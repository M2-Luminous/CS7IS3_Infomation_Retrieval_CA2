Teoman Erkan, Turkish deputy minister of national defence, and Gen. Boyko Noev, Bulgarian deputy minister of defence. The plan envisages the exchange of visits by top military officials, the exchange of specialists, the training of officers at Turkish military academies, cooperation in the defence industry and military topography. Today Gen. Erkan, who is on a three-day official visit to Bulgaria, was received by Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov. The defence ministers discussed a range of problems concerning the two countries' relations in a friendly atmosphere. They expressed the shared opinion that conducting cooperation in various fields contributes a lot to the promotion of good-neighbourly relations in the Balkans. The frank conversation Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov and I had with Gen. Teoman Erkan gives enough ground to believe that there are no insoluble problems in Bulgarian-Turkish relations, Gen. Noev said on the Bulgarian National Radio. "There is political will, there is friendship and mutual trust between us," he said. "Today's meeting is a continuation of the policy of the Bulgarian and the Turkish Government aimed to advance further the friendly relations between the two countries," the deputy defence minister said. "The step we took today should be viewed both in the light of NATO's recent decisions and its summit and within the context of Bulgaria's strong desire for closer integration into the North Atlantic structures," Gen. Noev added. It was stressed during the exchange of opinions that the effort of Bulgaria and Turkey to guarantee security in the Balkans and expand cooperation in all spheres is a model to follow which should be made known to still larger circles of the international community, the BULGARSKA ARMIYA paper wrote today.
