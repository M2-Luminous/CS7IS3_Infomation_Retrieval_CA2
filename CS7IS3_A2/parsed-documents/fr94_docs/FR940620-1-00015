FR940620-1-00015 FR940620-1-00006 II. Legislative Changes and Discussion of Regulatory Provisions A. Medicaid Payments for Medicaid Eligibles Under Group Health Plans 1. Statutory Provisions Under section 1905(a) of the Act, States may pay health insurance premiums on behalf of eligible recipients. In such cases, the insurer is liable to pay for benefits covered under its plan but Medicaid continues to pay for services covered under the Medicaid plan (but not covered under the insurer's plan). In addition, State payment of a health insurance premium must not have the effect of limiting a recipient's rights under Medicaid (for example, freedom of choice among providers). Section 4402(a)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508, enacted on November 5, 1990, added section 1906 to title XIX of the Act to require States to provide, as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, for mandatory enrollment of certain Medicaid eligibles in employer-based group health plans determined to be cost- effective under guidelines established by the Secretary. This provision applies to the 50 States and the District of Columbia and includes any State providing Medicaid to its recipients under an experimental, pilot, or demonstration project under the waiver authority of section 1115 of the Act. A group health plan is defined under section 1906(e)(1) as having the same meaning given the term in section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and included in the provision of COBRA continuation coverage by a plan under title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title VI of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). In addition to adding section 1906 to the Act, section 4402 of OBRA '90 made the following conforming amendments: •Added a new section 1902(a)(25)(G) to specify that State plans must meet the new requirements of section 1906 for enrollment of individuals under group health plans (Section 4402(a)(1)). •Added a new section 1902(e)(11)(A) to allow States to continue Medicaid payments of premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations on behalf of a Medicaid recipient required to enroll in a group health plan for a State-defined period of up to 6 months after the effective date of the recipient's enrollment, even if the enrollee ceases to be eligible for Medicaid during that period, but only for services covered under the group health plan. •Added a new subparagraph (XI) in the matter following section 1902(a)(10)(F) to allow Medicaid coverage for the cost of premiums, deductibles, coinsurances, and other cost-sharing obligations for individuals in cost- effective group health plans without requiring the availability of comparable services of the same amount, duration and scope to any other individuals (Section 4402(d)(1)). •Revised section 1903(u)(1)(D)(iv) to specify that in determining the amount of erroneous excess payments for purposes of Federal financial participation (FFP), HCFA will not include any error with respect to Medicaid payments made in violation of section 1906 of the Act (Section 4402(b)). •Revised section 1905(a) by adding language to indicate that ``medical assistance'' may include expenditures for Medicare cost-sharing and premiums under Part B for individuals who are eligible for medical assistance and are AFDC, SSI, OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD recipients or SSP beneficiaries and are eligible for medical assistance made available to individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(A); and, except in the case of individuals 65 years of age or older and disabled individuals entitled to Medicare who are not enrolled under Medicare Part B, other insurance premiums for medical or any other type of remedial care or cost. •Revised section 1903(a)(1) to delete the reference to Medicaid expenditures for Medicare cost-sharing and premiums under Part B. This language was added to section 1905 of the Act in the definition of medical assistance. Section 4402 of OBRA '90 has also undermined the legal basis of Pottgeiser v. Sullivan , 906 F.2d 1319 (9th Cir. 1990). In Pottgeiser , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court's ruling that the definition of ``medical assistance'' under section 1905(a) of the Act did not include the payment of medical insurance premiums. We note that the Ninth Circuit issued its Pottgeiser decision on June 25, 1990. However, section 4402 of OBRA '90 subsequently amended section 1905(a) of the Act to include the payment of medical insurance premiums expressly within the definition of ``medical assistance.'' Therefore, we regard section 4402 of OBRA '90 as superseding legislation, which effectively nullifies any legal effect of Pottgeiser . 2. Identification of Cost-Effective Plans Section 1906(a)(1) requires States to implement guidelines that are established by the Secretary to identify cases in which enrollment of a Medicaid eligible individual in a group health plan (in which the individual is otherwise eligible to be enrolled) is cost-effective. In section 1906(e)(2) of the Act, the term ``cost-effective'' means the cost of paying the premiums and cost-sharing obligations under a group health plan is likely to be less than the cost of providing services covered under the State plan. To determine cost-effectiveness, we would require States to use the cost-effectiveness methodology included in their approved State plan. States are required to use either the methodology described in §3910.11 of the State Medicaid Manual (HCFA Pub. 45&hyph;3), or an alternative methodology that could be supported by documentation furnished by a State. The State's alternative methodology, at a minimum, must include factors accounting for the employee's premiums, coinsurance, deductibles, and other cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan. It must compare these factors to the State's average Medicaid expenditures for an equivalent set of services for an individual with similar characteristics. To comply with the section 1906 requirement that the Secretary establish cost-effectiveness guidelines, we are restating the information contained in the State Medicaid Manual as an example of an acceptable methodology that a State must include in its State plan.
