Only the Communists voted against it. Since no amendment was retained, the law has now been definitively adopted. Answering questions with regard to the 2.5-billion-franc [Fr] freeze in the equipment budget (Fr1.9 billion) and the operating budget (Fr0.630 billion), Defense Minister Francois Leotard said that "France is engaged in a formidable economic war." Nevertheless, the defense minister hopes that this freeze will not lead to cancellation, as is feared by the Armed Forces, which saw their budget slashed already by Fr630 million in March.
