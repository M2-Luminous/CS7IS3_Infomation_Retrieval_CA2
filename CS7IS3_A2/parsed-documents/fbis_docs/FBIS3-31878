Last year, you were talking about the threat of the war spreading to Vojvodina -- the Serbian region where a large part of the population is Hungarian. Do you believe that this eventuality is closer? [Jezsensky] No, fortunately; partly thanks to our careful moves and partly also because Belgrade has now won through war what it wanted and is now interested in consolidating and wants no more problems. The defeat of the most extremist Serbian groups in the last elections must also be taken into account. It is true that the Hungarians of Voivodina remain innocent victims of the economic embargo and that they are harassed by certain sections of the population -- especially Serbian refugees from Bosnia and Croatia -- who are pressing them to leave, but we have detected in Belgrade signs in favor of granting this minority a certain cultural autonomy. [Lopez] Around you, there is almost frantic diplomatic activity between Romania, Serbia, and Greece. Do you not feel isolated? [Jezsensky] The three nations are Orthodox and share common -- Byzantine -- cultural roots, but it would be dangerous to see these moves as the beginning of a division between the Catholic and Orthodox cultural worlds in the area. It is true that Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia share a rejection of the Hungarian minorities' desire for autonomy, and that Greece and Romania vigorously supported Serbia at the worst point in the Balkans crisis, but I believe that the mutual rapprochement now is due more to a desire to end the Balkans conflict and to maintain an economic route to the West through Yugoslavia or Romania. [Lopez] Hungary has just joined the Partnership for Peace. To what extent do you feel protected by this intermediate course between NATO and nothing? [Jezsensky] We have always made it clear that our intention is to join NATO; from this viewpoint, we disagree with Partnership for Peace, but at the same time we understand the efforts of Europe and the United States to reassure Russia. Moreover, the Partnership is much more than we initially believed. In fact, NATO's future expansion has been accepted, and we are being allowed to prepare for later membership. We will take the opportunity. [Lopez] I recall that you used to be very much in favor of strengthening the CSCE.... [Jezsensky] The CSCE is too uncoordinated. Its members are too numerous, and some of them are not actually European or, unfortunately, stable. The CSCE has shown itself unable to resolve the Balkans conflict. It has noble aims, but it is too large to guarantee European security. To some extent, when thinking about the CSCE, I recall Stalin's remark about the pope. How many divisions does he have? The CSCE has no divisions, but NATO does. That is why NATO is effective. [Lopez] Speaking of effectiveness, NATO has just taken an initiative. What will become of this current ultimatum? [Jezsensky] An ultimatum is a threat in order to try to secure something. It must be backed up by credible strength but also by common sense. NATO has this strength, and I believe that the Serbs will not venture to repeat their contempt of the ultimatum which was delivered in 1914. At least, Belgrade does not seem inclined to do so, and although everything depends on the Bosnian Serbs, I hope that they will withdraw and carry out what is being demanded, but I also hope that, even if they do not do so completely, NATO will not find itself obliged to intervene. Peace is the responsibility of all the parties involved. Responsibility for the origin of the war is a matter for an international court and history, but the most important thing now is to secure peace, even at the cost of not achieving everything that is demanded. The alternative is mutual annihilation. Feel Nostalgia for Stalin [Lopez] The Russian scene has changed substantially with the rise of opposition leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. What is Hungary's stance on this change of scene? [Jezsensky] Look, Zhirinovskiy does not alarm me personally or Hungary. What does alarm me is Europe's not taking him seriously. Although there is no exact parallel, it must be recalled that Hitler was not taken seriously, either. The Russian people feel that they have lost an empire. They were told for decades that everybody loved Russia because it provided security. Now, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, they find themselves abandoned by everybody and plunged into poverty. The West has done a great deal, but it must do more. It must help seek an economic solution and show them the advantages of the free market and democracy; help them understand, as was done with Germany and Japan after World War II, the evilness of the regimes which were left behind. If the Russians do not see an improvement in their immediate situation, they will feel nostalgia for Stalin. They will forget the 50 million dead but remember the price of bread when he was alive. Zhirinovskiy cannot be understood outside the Russian situation. That is why it is imperative to support the minority who see Russia's future in Europe and who, unfortunately for everybody, did not fare well in the last elections.
