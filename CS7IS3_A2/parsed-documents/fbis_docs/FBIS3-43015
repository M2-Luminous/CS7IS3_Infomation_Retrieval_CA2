A. Titkov, Scientific and Technical Institute of Interbranch Information, Ministry of Science of Russia] [Excerpts] The developed countries of the world are presently involved in the global exchange of materials, information, and specialists. The direction of the flow of high technology is decisive in this process. Theoretically, one can quantitatively measure the volume of these exchanges across national borders; however, practically speaking, the scale of the transmission of high technology in three such streams can be determined only qualitatively. For example, the influx of high technology from the West into Japan greatly exceeds the influx from Japan to the West, judging from some unsystematic data, for example, statistics on Japanese students and graduate students studying in the US and Europe or the exchange of scientists. In essence, today's high technology is global, and one cannot avoid the aforementioned contacts. Especially interesting is the problem of systemization, classification, and analysis of the number and quality of specialists in high technology, the "generators" and bearers of this technology. The success of Japan in developing high technology areas of industry and science, as well as the active positive role of the government in this process, have made Japan's experience important for the reform of science and industry in Russia. Thus, it is especially interesting to study Japanese specialists in high technology areas (primarily microelectronics, computing, etc.) as well as the scientists who provide for the development of these fields. An instrument, and at the same time, an object of study is the NAMES database, which includes the leading Japanese scientists, businessmen, and specialists in high technology. The objects of study were: 1. analysis of the sources of information; 2. the method of selecting specialists for inclusion in the database; and 3. a quantitative estimate of the level of competence of the specialists (optimal number of parameters characterizing a specialist, elimination of the subjectivity of expert opinions, etc.). [passage omitted] Description of the NAMES database (``Who's who in the high technology of Japan'') The NAMES database is an automated information research system which includes a card file and specialized software based on the dBASE IV database management system with a list of classification headings. The database includes about 5000 names of Japanese scientists, engineers, and managers working in high technology fields such as computing, microelectronics, automated design and production, robotics, etc. A record in the database includes personal parameters (full name, presence or absence of name written in Japanese characters, address of employing organization, telephone, fax, etc.) as well as professional parameters (degree/title, post, area of scientific interests, patents, etc.). In addition to these fields there is also a text field for additional information. A program module has been developed to calculate a generalized estimate of the level of competence, for which a special field is reserved. Information in the card file has been collected since about 1975. In the future, NAMES will have a modular structure including thematic files (computers, semiconductors, robots, etc.), a patent file (patent abstracts, patent holders included in the database), a statistical module, and possibly an organizational file on the structure of organizations whose employees are included in the database. The database language is English, because the product is primarily oriented toward a Western market. Of course, as the situation in Russia improves it will be easy to adapt the database to the domestic market. Specialists in the database may be grouped by firm, government scientific research institute, governmental department, professional society, association, or corporations of Japan. At present the database does not require a knowledge of programming and enables one to work in the following modes: query by example, editing of records, editing of the screen, addition of new records, and printing of the current record. In query mode one can search the following fields in the record: name, organization, area of scientific interests, degree/title, and patents. Additional database capabilities enable the user to join and sort data in different ways, to verify information, to organize interactive work modes, and to protect in formation. Prospects for further development The world is involved in a constant battle for the possession of intellect and access to its sources. A consequence is a continuing migration of intellect across national borders, and this requires a practical estimate of the potential of the scientists and specialists of various countries. Here a database of the scientists and specialists of various countries can play an irreplaceable role. Such databases make it possible, with the appropriate depth of development and entries, to determine the number and level of competence of specialists in various fields of science and technology and detect trends and features of development, priorities, and goals in the scientific and technical progress of various countries. Our NAMES database may be used as a prototype database for various countries, and is a useful instrument for researchers and private companies. It is also a methodological basis for the creation of similar database. Such databases have good commercial prospects, because the participation of high technology specialists is key in determining the success or failure of new firms. In the Russian Academy of Sciences and in industry there are specialists from the countries of the Far East and Southeast Asia who may be drawn to the development of such databases, which would make it possible to solve another problem, that of the optimal use of scientists and specialists in our country. We can use the existing methodological and factographic materials right now and fill the niche in the Western information market for a database of personal information on Japanese specialists in the area of high technology. According to our estimates this niche will remain empty for a maximum of 2-3 years. The market for a database on Japanese specialists in areas of high technology in industry and science may attract thousands, even tens of thousands of users and may constitute a sum of several million dollars. Our plan, given minimum financing, is to develop a full-scale relational database of personal information, programs for statistical analysis and quantitative evaluation of the level of competence of the specialist in interactive mode, independent of the contents of the database, as well as active sounding of the Western information market with advertisements and the formation of demand for such software products.
