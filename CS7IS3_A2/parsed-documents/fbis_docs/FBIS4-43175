However, before they make their final decisions, they want to know what the situation is regarding European Union [EU] membership and the Oresund bridge. "Swedish membership in the EU is a precondition for receiving this Japanese investment," Elisabeth Lindquist, a market consultant with the Japanese export organization JETRO [Japan External Trade Organization] in Stockholm, said. "That membership and the Oresund bridge are the two most important factors," Carl Henrik Hamrin, economic advisor to the Swedish Embassy in Tokyo, added. According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, a total of four Japanese companies could already make their investment decisions within the coming months. Some of them will probably make their decision before the EU referendum in November. It depends on whether or not they bank on Swedish EU membership. Companies on the Way In addition, another 20 or so companies are at various stages of planning business start-ups in Sweden. "There is a whole string of Japanese companies currently considering going into Sweden. In all cases, Swedish EU membership is one of the most important preconditions for this," Carl Henrik Hamrin said. "The next most important question is the Oresund bridge. If I am going to be quoted, then I merely wish to say: `Build the bridge!' The transport issue is extremely important." "Billions of Kronor" According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, the Japanese investment plans concern "billions of kronor." "If Sweden says no, then an investment process that is already under way will be curtailed. Over the last two or three years, 10 Japanese companies have pumped approximately 200 million kronor into Sweden," Carl Henrik Hamrin said. He pointed out that many Japanese regard the popular referendum to be a proper election situation. They do not have referenda themselves, and therefore regard the upcoming referendum more as a necessary step in the whole process. Their opinion, he maintained, is that the important decision was made when the European Parliament approved Swedish accession in principle. The EU issue as a whole is of great concern to Japanese companies. "They are tremendously curious about what will happen if the EU really becomes a trade bloc and if it comes to adopting a position either in support of or against Japan," Tommy Kullberg, trade secretary at the Swedish Export Council in Tokyo, said. Yukio Matsui, CEO of the Mitsui trading house in Sweden, told DAGENS INDUSTRI that his company is starting to follow not only the specific question of Swedish membership, but more particularly the development of the EU as a whole. Yukio Matsui sees the EU as a kind of insurance policy for the Swedish people to reach a larger market. Newly Awakened Interest The Japanese interest in Sweden is relatively new. In the current situation, characterized by a strong yen, an altogether excessive Japanese trade surplus, and high Japanese labor costs, Japanese companies are being forced to set up abroad. "On the plus side, Sweden has low labor costs for a highly trained work force," Elisabeth Lindquist said. High-Tech Companies According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, several of the planned business start-ups in Sweden concern high-tech companies. Over the last 12 months, Sweden's exports to Japan have risen by 50 percent to reach a level of 10 billion kronor. The increase in volume over the same period has amounted to 25 percent. The increase is due both to currency advantages and to a number of new Swedish businesses starting up in Japan.
