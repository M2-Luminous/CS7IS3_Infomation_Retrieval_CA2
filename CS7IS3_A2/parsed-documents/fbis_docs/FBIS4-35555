Following his meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati today, Bin-'Alawi told MENA that he and the Iranian minister discussed several important issues, including the situation in Yemen, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Gulf region in addition to bilateral ties. Touching on the Gulf security arrangements, Bin-'Alawi explained that this issue was not discussed during the meeting. Our stance is clear in this connection, he said, noting that his meeting with the Iranian minister focused primarily on the issues included on the agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement Conference. The Omani state minister emphasized that a cease-fire in Yemen will give Yemenis the chance to return to negotiations and decide their country's future. Replying to a question on relations between the Sultanate of Oman and Israel, Bin-'Alawi said that there are no relations between his country and Israel and that the Israeli delegation that visited Muscat recently only took part in the multilateral negotiations. This does not mean that there are Omani-Israeli relations, he said. I clearly explained that the establishment of such relations in the future means that Israel will have to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories and that a comprehensive peace will have to be established between Israel and all Arab states, he said.
