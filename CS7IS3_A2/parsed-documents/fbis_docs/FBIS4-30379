He said the United States should first listen to the views of the East Asian nations. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will hold a meeting with East Asian countries soon to discuss the matter officially. When all the East Asian countries have stated their views, then the other countries can give their comments, he said after receiving the Russian minister of culture, Yevgeniy Sigorov, and secretary general of the Libyan People's Congress on Foreign Affairs, Saad Mujabar [title and name as received], here Monday. He said whatever proposal about EAEC now was still at ASEAN level and as such it was not necessary for any country outside East Asia to make any comment on the matter. Abdullah said the U.S. should realise that EAEC was not a conspiracy against the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) or the U.S. On the other hand, he said, EAEC would be consistent with APEC and would complement the efforts of APEC, while the U.S. was seen as a friend in which Malaysia and ASEAN had many common interests. He said ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia, was holding to the statements made U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Japanese Foreign Minister Kabun Muto in Singapore last July that they did not oppose the proposal for the EAEC and were prepared to continue to discuss the matter.
