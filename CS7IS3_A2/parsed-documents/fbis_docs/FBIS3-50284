The statement was presented to journalists by Ivan Simko, deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. In the statement, the opposition parties that attended the meeting--the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the KDH, the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic, Coexistence, and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement--note that, instead of becoming an economic instrument of the transformation process, privatization has become a political means to concentrate power. Unless changes are made to eliminate the danger of privatization being abused at the forthcoming meeting of parliament, scope for corruption will be created. The opposition parties will support such changes as will make privatization more transparent and effective and prevent its misuse. They expect deputies representing the governing coalition to realize their responsibility toward their voters and to endorse those changes, the statement by the parliamentary nongovernment parties states. Regarding the KDH's initiative to pass a vote of no confidence in Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation, communications, and public works, Ivan Simko announced that signatures are still being collected. He believes that it will be possible to raise this issue in the course of the forthcoming meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. SDL Deputy Chairwoman Alzbeta Borzova told the TA SR correspondent that the SDL has "commissioned an analysis" on the extent to which Roman Hofbauer's procedures correspond to "the principle of rationality." The SDL's view on this matter has not yet become crystallized, she said.
