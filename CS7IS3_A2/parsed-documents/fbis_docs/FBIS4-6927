As a response to the recent agreement emanating from friction concerning cellular phones, IDO will invest about 60 billion yen to expand the service area and accelerate signing of new subscribers to provide for early recovery of its investment in the Motorola system. IDO expects to enlist about 120,000 subscribers within the fiscal year. By expanding the service area and emphasizing the Motorola system, it hopes to compete more effectively with NTT's mobile communication network called NTT Dokomo [Anywhere] and to prevent recurrence of Japan-U.S. friction. The dedicated team will be established as the Fourth Sales Section within the Sales Department. It will be initially staffed with eight individuals. Since it does not have any company-owned direct sales outlets, IDO will set up dealers that specialize in Motorola cellular phones and provide sales support to distributors. In the past, IDO had established the First, Second and Third Sales Sections under the Sales Department and had provided sales support to dealers which handled both NTT and Motorola cellular phones. However, now IDO sources say, "If we approach the sales effort for both rival NTT's Dokomo and Motorola systems in the same way, there is little prospect of improving sales of Motorola units." But, now that capital investments in the Motorola system have been expanded as a result of the agreement, IDO has decided to place emphasis on the promotion of Motorola units. In conjunction with the outright sale of cellular phones which began in April, IDO as an operator of communications systems will stock a maximum of 11 models of cellular phones and provide that eight of them will be applicable to the Motorola system. It will thus position the Motorola system strategically in the competition to increase its subscriber share in the market place. As a follow-on to the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular phones, IDO will invest about 60 billion yen to expand its base stations for the Motorola system and reassign some of the frequencies currently used on the NTT system to the Motorola system by the end of September 1995. Further, the operating plan submitted by IDO to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications contains a passage which states, "We will install a dedicated sales organization to promote the Motorola system." IDO subscribers to the Motorola system as of 31 March 1994 totaled about 22,000. This figure is far behind the 310,000 IDO subscribers for the NTT system, but is close to three times the number existing at the same time last year.
