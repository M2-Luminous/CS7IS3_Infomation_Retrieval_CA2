FR940628-2-00073 FR940628-2-00060 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29, 802] Western Geophysical Company a/k/a Halliburton Company, Houston, TX; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Notice of Certification Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on May 31, 1994. The notice will soon be published in the Federal Register. At the request of some of the workers and the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The investigation findings show that Western Geophysical Company purchased the Geophysical Services Division of the Halliburton Company in January 1994 whose workers were certified for TAA under an earlier certification, TA&hyph;W&hyph;27, 776. As a result, some of the former Halliburton workers laid off from Western Geophysical do not have the required 26 weeks to meet their personal eligibility requirement. Accordingly, the Department is amending the subject certification to show that Western Geophysical is a successor-in-interest firm to Halliburton Geophysical Services. The amendment notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29, 802 is hereby issued as follows: ``All workers of Western Geophysical Company, Houston, Texas, the successor-in-interest firm to Halliburton Geophysical Services, Houston, Texas, engaged in seismic activities related to oil and gas exploration who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after April 25, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed in Washington, DC, this 15th day of June 1994. Violet L. Thompson, Deputy Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
