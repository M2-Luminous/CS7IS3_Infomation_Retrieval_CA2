The land will sell its stakes in the "Neue Maxhuette" and the "Lechstahl" enterprise to Max Aicher, a construction and steel industrialist of Freilassing. This Cabinet decision was announced by Minister President Edmund Stoiber, of the Christian Social Union, in Munich on Tuesday [15 March]. "The future of the Maxhuette is thus safe," Stoiber said. The looming bankruptcy has been avoided, and Sulzbach-Rosenberg will be preserved as a steel center and a significant part of jobs in Maxhuette will also be saved. However, to attain this objective, Bavaria must provide another 140 million German marks. Stoiber also announced that in the coming week, the Bavarian Government will resign from the German Aviation and Space enterprise Dasa.
