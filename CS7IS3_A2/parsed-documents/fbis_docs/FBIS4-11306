In statements to the media during a recess at the Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which started this morning, Alarcon noted that such changes had been discussed for some time, and he added that they are designed to adjust the structure of the island's central government to the current situation. He stressed that the idea is to do at the government level what the people have already been doing to reduce expenses, to rationalize by way of austerity, and to make the best use of resources. "We cannot, however, throw anyone into the streets," he stressed. "The idea is to simplify structures and, in turn, reduce excess payrolls without affecting workers," Alarcon said. He added that this is precisely what makes Cuba's situation complex. There is a need to overcome this difficult phase, to clean up the nation's finances, and to revive the economy without adopting capitalist models. In the United States, for example, there are a lot of unemployed people in the streets looking for jobs, medical attention, and something to eat, although that country is not facing a blockade and a special period (the name given here to the years of economic crisis), "but this is not and will never be the case in Cuba," Alarcon added. Today, the Cuban Government announced the creation of a new structure that eliminates several ministries and central government organizations and creates new ones, such as the Ministries of the Economy, Foreign Investment, and Tourism. Decree-Law No. 147, which was issued by the Cuban State Council and was published in GRANMA, explains that the goal is to reduce the size and adjust the duties of the government apparatus through measures already under way to confront the crisis prompted by the disappearance of the socialist bloc. Alarcon added that the decree is designed to better adjust the government structure in accordance with the trade relations and cooperation the island is developing within today's international situation.
