The decision was taken at the emergency parliament session which closed on Saturday night. The session transformed the parliament into a people's assembly. Before the decision was taken, the parliament regulations were changed because deputies of the Russian nationality left the session. The session also formed the legislative committee of the Republic's People's Assembly, which consists of 27 deputies representing the main nationalities of the republic. Elected to it were five deputies from each of the Abazin, Nogai, Karachai and Circassian nationalities and one deputy from each of Ossetian and Greek nationalities. It is decided to elect to the legislative committee five deputies of the Russian nationality at the next stage of the session scheduled for 1 April. The decisions of the emergency session have caused a very negative reaction among the public movements and parties of Karachai-Circassian Republic which stand for the holding of democratic elections on 24 April.
