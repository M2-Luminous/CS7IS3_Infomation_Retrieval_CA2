Judging by the way in which it is managing the expansion of the European Union [EU], there is reason to doubt it. While the Twelve have been in confrontation for several weeks -- the discussions are resuming in Brussels today -- on the balance of power within a Union of 15 or 16 states, France has remained strangely withdrawn. It is only saying that it wants to ensure that the decisionmaking process within the Council of Ministers is not made more difficult by the membership of Austria, Finland, and Sweden and, if the negotiations are successful, Norway. In the context of expansion, what is at stake is the Union's institutions and hence "Europe's capacity to make effective decisions and be a power," as someone close to the Elysee [presidential office] remarked. However: "We do not know what is desired," the diplomats responsible for implementing France's European policy say almost unanimously. Does it want a more federal Europe? A Europe with variable geometry? A Europe welcoming all the countries of Eastern Europe? Or a diluted Europe without any real capacity for initiative? France which, just a short time ago, set the tone for European construction together with Germany, seems to have abdicated in favor of Bonn and London, which have made an unambiguous choice in favor of expansion even if it is at the expense of the deepening of the Union. "It is difficult to discern France's ambition, its grand design," a Benelux diplomat noted with despair. "We have the impression that it is trying to reap short-term successes, which are considerable but isolated, like GATT or the former Yugoslavia." This French "absence" is due to several factors. First, it is clear that "these short-term successes were achieved at the expense of fundamental concessions," a senior French official asserted. The Germans are now demanding the price of their support during the monetary crises or in the Uruguay Round negotiations. Second, "it is as if the ratification of Maastricht had not been overcome," one diplomat said. Finally, the 1995 presidential election makes any overly clear assertion of a European policy potentially explosive both within the Majority and between the Elysee and the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office]. Last fall's episode is revealing in this respect. Alain Juppe, the head of French diplomacy, being aware of the dangers of expansion without deepening, had suggested to his European partners a revival of the institutional debate. But, without warning anybody, Francois Mitterrand, on an official visit to Vienna on 7 October, ruled out any reform. "This situation is likely to tip France into the British camp -- blocking for fear of moving," a Benelux diplomat said with regret. Here too, virtually the same situation is found in the vast majority of EU countries (especially Germany, Britain, and Italy) where politically weakened governments form a veritable "assembly of cripples," to cite one diplomat. The French paralysis also stems from the weakness of the Franco-German axis. The German Government, in the throes of a difficult election year, is playing its own game within the Union: Expansion is one indication of this, but so is the German ambiguity on Economic and Monetary Union. However, as Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a French European deputy (European People's Party-Union for French Democracy), remarks, "there can be no vision of Europe without a fundamental agreement between the French and Germans." In short, this French refusal to make choices, whatever good reasons are invoked, is bound to accentuate the "swing in the British direction," in other words the Union's march toward a simple free trade area without any capacity for action. Unless of course some people, especially in Paris, find that this serves their purpose?
