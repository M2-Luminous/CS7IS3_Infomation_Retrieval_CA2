He went to the 18th floor where the office of Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin is situated. For a comment on this fact one can quote Georgiy Satarov, the Russian Federation president's aide, who said today that after speaking to Ivan Rybkin, it became clear to him that the chairman of the chamber and its deputies feel that they are responsible for the behavior of those whom they had freed. In order to preserve their reputation of supporters of reforms, the Duma leaders are apparently trying to obtain promises of trustworthiness from the organizers of the October events in Moscow.
