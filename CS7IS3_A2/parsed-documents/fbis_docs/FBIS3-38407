In a statement after the meeting, Gustave Feissel said that he had a good discussion with President Kliridhis. Feissel noted: President Kliridhis reaffirmed that the Greek Cypriot side accepts in principle the confidence-building measures [CBM's] as outlined in Paragraphs 37, 38, 42, and 43 of the UN secretary general's report of 1 July 1993. He also said that he looks forward to hearing from Mr. Butrus-Ghali on how the process is to move ahead, given the positive reply by the two sides. Responding to a question on President Kliridhis' reaction to the second letter from Rauf Denktas, Mr. Feissel said that it is known that the secretary general and the Security Council are guided by the Security Council resolutions. He remarked: There is nothing new in this. Answering another question on whether Denktas' second letter had been conveyed to the secretary general in the correct manner, Mr. Feissel said that President Kliridhis knows that Rauf Denktas has accepted the CBM's in the same manner. Feissel added: The next step will be to brief the secretary general on all the developments and then, I imagine, Mr. Butrus-Ghali will convey his views, suggestions, and appraisal on how we should proceed. Asked if he has any dates in mind, Feissel said that he will not make any forecasts but added: Both sides have now given a positive response to the CBM's as they are outlined in the [secretary general's] report and it is up to Mr. Butrus-Ghali to express his views to both sides. Mr. Feissel further noted that a significant element is that time is valuable; therefore, we should then proceed with the main goal of the process, which is to reach an overall settlement. Asked if the three questions raised in President Kliridhis' letter were discussed, Mr. Feissel said that Denktas' reply to this correspondence is categorical and added: Rauf Denktas says that he accepts everything that is in the four paragraphs of the secretary general's report. Responding to a remark that Denktas is invoking principles, Mr. Feissel said that the key is how we accept and interpret the replies by the two sides. Responding to a question on whether he expects negotiations to begin before or after the secretary general's report at the end of February, Mr. Feissel said that he believes things will have advanced a considerable degree by then. Until then, the Security Council will wait for the Butrus- Ghali report so that it may proceed with a detailed review of the situation. Asked about Joe Clark's report, Feissel said that the report will be submitted to the secretary general on Thursday [3 February] at the latest. In conclusion, Mr. Feissel said that yesterday evening he had a meeting with Mr. Robert Lamb who, he added, had come to Cyprus to support the secretary general's efforts. In a statement after President Kliridhis' meeting with Gustave Feissel, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that they made an analytical assessment of the situation following the contacts Mr. Clark and Mr. Feissel had in Athens and Ankara. Kasoulidhis added: We are waiting for Butrus-Ghali's reply to the second letter from President Kliridhis on his position concerning the CBM's. Gustave Feissel will have a meeting with Rauf Denktas this afternoon. Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special Cyprus coordinator, also began a round of contacts in Nicosia this morning. Robert Lamb met with President Glavkos Kliridhis at approximately 0900 today. Robert Lamb avoided making any statement after his meeting with President Kliridhis. He merely said that he thinks that talks might be starting now. Lamb noted: We probably are starting the process of talks. Commenting on Robert Lamb's statement that the talks might be starting now, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the discussion had not yet begun. Robert Lamb then left for the occupied areas to meet with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas.
