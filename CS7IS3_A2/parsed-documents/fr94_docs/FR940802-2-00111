FR940802-2-00111 FR940802-2-00059 The February notice proposed to test devices to determine whether acetone or, in the case of breath or saliva devices, cigarette smoke affects the functioning of the instruments. The notice also requested comments on whether devices should be tested for interference from other substances. With regard to the test for acetone interference, one commenter agreed that there is a need for such a test. Another commenter strongly recommended that the test be deleted from the Model Specifications. The commenter argued that acetone is unlikely to interfere with the measurement of breath alcohol and, if persons have levels of acetone that are sufficiently high to cause interference, such persons should not be performing safety sensitive functions. In addition, the commenter stated that requiring devices to distinguish between alcohol and acetone would greatly increase instrument cost and restrict participation for certain instruments. NHSTA has reconsidered its position on this issue, and decided that alcohol screening devices should not be required to distinguish between alcohol and acetone, particularly since the instruments used for confirmation testing are capable of distinguishing between these substances. Based on existing data, 2 we do not expect a high incidence of acetone interference and, in the unlikely event that a device indicates a positive result due to the presence of acetone, this will be detected in the confirmation test. The Model Specifications have therefore been amended to eliminate the acetone test. 2 Flores, A.L. and Frank, J.F., ``The Likelihood of Acetone Interference in Breath Alcohol Measurement,'' Washington, DC, U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Technical Report No. DOT HS 806 922, 1985. Frank, J.F. and Flores, A.L., ``The Livelihood of Actone Interference in Breath Alcohol Measurement,'' Alcohol, Drugs, and Driving, 3 (2), 1&hyph;8, April-June 1987. With regard to cigarette smoke and other interfering substances, we received only one comment, which stated that non-interference from smoking, eating and drinking should not be a conformance requirement since these activities can be avoided before a test is performed. If the evaluation of cigarette smoke is retained in the Model Specifications, this commenter recommended that it be performed for information purposes only. NHTSA expects the likelihood of cigarette smoke interference will be much greater than acetone interference, and has decided to retain the cigarette smoke test. As provided in the Model Specifications, the test will be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Any waiting period specified in the manufacturer's instructions will be strictly observed. The test will be performed within one minute after the person smokes the cigarette where no waiting period is specified in the manufacturer's instructions. NHTSA did not propose to conduct a test for interference from eating and drinking, and we have not added any such test in the final Model Specifications. The commenter also suggested that, if the Model Specifications continue to include a cigarette smoke test, that the method used for conducting this test on saliva screening devices should be similar to that used for breath screening devices. NHTSA concurs that this comment, and has revised the Model Specifications to clarify its application to both saliva and breath devices. The agency also proposes to conduct high (40 ○C) and low (10 ○C) ambient temperature and vibration tests for alcohol screening devices to determine their ability to function under a range of environmental conditions. NHTSA proposes that these tests would be performed by an investigator at VNTSC. Five trials would be conducted at .000 BAC under Test 3.2. Forty trials (including 20 at .008 and 20 at .032 BAC) would be conducted under each of these other tests. One commenter, a manufacturer of a passive alcohol sensor, noted that the proposed temperature range for testing is more severe than that for EBT testers. This commenter is correct. The temperature range is more severe because it is anticipated that screening tests may be performed outside in widely varying temperature conditions. Tests performed with EBTs are generally performed indoors where temperatures are controlled. The proposed temperature range has been adopted without change. Another commenter, a manufacturer of a saliva test device, suggested that the specimens for saliva testing should be held at body temperature (37 ○C) while performing the two ambient temperature evaluations ``to stimulate real-life situations.'' NHTSA disagrees with this comment. When saliva tests are being conducted in the field, the temperature of the saliva will change soon after the sample is taken from the person's mouth. NHTSA therefore believes the procedures contained in its proposed Model Specifications more accurately simulate the conditions under which actual testing will be conducted. This portion of the Model Specifications has been adopted without change. The manufacturer of an alcohol breath testing device commented that disposable devices, which cannot be checked for calibration on a periodic basis, should be evaluated throughout their useful life. This manufacturer also recommended that devices which require that results be checked through a visual inspection should be tested under a variety of light conditions, such as fluorescent, mercury vapor, sodium vapor and daylight. NHTSA disagrees that the Model Specifications should provide for the evaluation of disposal devices throughout their useful life. As explained in the February 15 notice, manufacturers of alcohol screening devices must meet the requirements contained in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR Part 820), and they must include labels on their devices that meet the requirements contained in FDA's Labeling regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR 809.10), even if the devices are not to be used for medical purposes. The Labeling Instructions for Alcohol Screening Devices included as an Appendix to the February notice instructed, among other things, that the label ``Provide the reagent's shelf life and opened expiration dating, if applicable.'' In addition, manufacturers must determine shelf life and expiration dating in accordance with FDA's regulations on Good Manufacturing Practices.
