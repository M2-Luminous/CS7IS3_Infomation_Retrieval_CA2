Not that this guarantees a meaningful future. Lacking a self-perpetuating administrative structure, NAM appears to face an even more uncertain destiny, its fate being in the hands of its members, now numbering 109 after South Africa's admission at the ministerial meeting in Cairo recently. But, in the ultimate analysis, its ability to survive may owe more to the political perceptions of the leaders of these mainly developing nations of Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania than any rational factor. Nor may the end of the Cold War present NAM with its defining moment. Though global polarisation provided the movement's raison d'etre, its heyday came with the decolonisation process of the '60s. Non-alignment has tried to justify its existence since then by claiming to be more than just neutrality between the superpowers. It represented, so ran the thesis, a positive option for peace that permitted developing countries to pursue their own aim of economic reconstruction without becoming bogged down in global rivalry. It can be argued that one set of challenges has now replaced another. The objective of growth without forfeiting political sovereignty retains its validity at a time when many nations of what used to be called the Third World are being pressured by the West, with human rights or the environment as the fig-leaf, to make internal changes that will have the effect of negating the comparative economic advantage they might now enjoy. Recognising that the economic agenda is the most important to confront its members, NAM is preparing to set up a coordinating committee in conjunction with the Group of 77 to negotiate with the developed nations on trade issues. But whether NAM provides the best platform for fighting what Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar calls "political conditionalities", and whether the exercise is even relevant, is another matter. In practice, NAM has always been noted for its political posturing and a tendency to pronounce on virtually every subject under the sun. Often, this seems to be an end in itself, more satisfying than trying to put an end to wars and violence, which was, in any case, beyond the mandate of a movement that had only an "exhorting effect", according to Professor Jayakumar, and not an "enforcing mechanism". However, the need for consensus decisions often meant bargains to sweep bilateral disputes under the carpet while pandering to the national susceptibilities of members. And this has not always added to NAM's credibility. For instance, while it is understandable that the outrageous conduct of the Serbs should arouse repugnance, the Cairo meeting's decision to allow Bosnia to attend as a guest of the host government, while ignoring Serbia's request to be represented, looked like prejudging the succession to the vacant Yugoslav seat. More than ever now, because it is at the crossroads, NAM cannot afford to be seen as lacking in objectivity. The global situation has altered vastly since Nehru, Tito and Nasser laid the foundations of the non-alignment in Belgrade. Perhaps more to the point, as NAM looks around for an additional supplementary role, a number of economic organisations and regional groupings have sprung up. Being smaller and honed to a specific task, associations like ASEAN and APEC are likely to be far more effective than a large umbrella organisation that still tries, judging by the Cairo declaration, to be all things to all men. But their greater effectiveness may not necessarily make NAM redundant in the eyes of most members: many Third World politicians find the non-aligned forum, more intimate than the United Nations, both necessary and deeply fulfilling.
