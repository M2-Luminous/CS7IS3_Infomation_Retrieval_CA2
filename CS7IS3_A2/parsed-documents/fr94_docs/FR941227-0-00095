ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule revises the HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 570, subpart F, which govern the administration of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Small Cities Program. The purpose of subpart F is to set forth the procedures by which CDBG funds are provided to non-entitled units of general local government in those States which have not elected to assume administration of the CDBG formula allocations for use in non-entitled units of general local government within such States. The rule amends subpart F to incorporate the statutory changes made to the Small Cities Program since the subpart F regulations were issued in 1982, and streamlines the operation and administration of the program. In addition, the rule makes additional changes to subpart F, and various changes to subparts I and M which are necessary to permit use of the section 108 loan guarantee authority by non-entitled units of general local government in States which have not elected to assume administration of the CDBG formula allocations for nonentitlement areas of such States. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 26, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen M.

Background_September 15, 1994 Proposed Rule On September 15, 1994 (59 FR 47500), HUD published a proposed rule that would amend HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 570, subpart F, which govern the administration of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Small Cities Program. The proposed rule provided for a 30-day public comment period. By the end of the comment period on October 17, 1994, 21 comments had been received. The 21 commenters consisted of 11 units of general local government (7 New York, 3 Hawaii, 1 Arizona), 5 consultants, and 5 public and private non-profits. These commenters made approximately 75 different comments about the September 15, 1994 proposed rule; many of these comments were made by more than one commenter. Section II of this preamble describes the changes made to the proposed rule at the final rule stage, and Section III of the preamble sets forth the issues and questions raised by the public commenters, and HUD's responses to these issues and questions. II. Principal Differences Between Proposed Rule and Final Rule This final rule is substantially the same as the September 15, 1994 proposed rule. The principal differences are as follows: 1. Multiyear Plans The final rule provides that HUD may issue notices of funding availability that provide for a competition for applications that have multiyear plans (see §570.421(a)(2)).
