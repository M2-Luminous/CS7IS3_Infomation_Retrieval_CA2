"In the year 1994, we should move forward toward the world and the future on the foundation of what we achieved through last year's reform drive," Kim said. "I hope we can all be born anew this year after ridding ourselves of such vices as egoism, falsehood, idleness, vanity and extravagance," Kim said. "The ongoing anticorruption drive cannot be stopped or slowed at this point because it is my obligation to construct a just society," the President stressed. To survive in the new era of unrestrained international competition, he said, "We must concentrate our ability and creativity on building up national power. An opportunity, once lost, is lost forever. An opportunity always follows a crisis. We should take full advantage of the challenge stemming from globalization and opening to upgrade our national status," President Kim said. Saying that all people should join in the movement to strengthen national competitiveness, Kim stressed that each member of society should not forget that he or she has an important role to play in international competition. "We have to win," he asserted. "We are now at the starting point in our race toward the world and future. We can't afford to waste any of our precious time on conflict and enmity. Instead of pursuing meaningless arguments, we should seek after the practical," Kim said. Touching on the issue of the domestic agricultural market opening, the President appealed to the nation to give full support to the farmers. He asked the people to focus their wisdom and strength on helping the farmers regain hope and courage. "Let's work hard to make 1994 the year in which the foundation of a New Korea was firmly laid," Kim said. In conclusion, President Kim made a brief mention of the North Korean nuclear issue. "I hope the nuclear matter will be resolved this year so that true peace can come to the Korean Peninsula, which has been scarred by division for the past 40 years," Kim said. President Kim called for great efforts to help compatriots in the North join not only in the worldwide trend of opening and reform but also in the creation of a New Korea.
