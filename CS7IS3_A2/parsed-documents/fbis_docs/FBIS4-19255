Astonished but sticking to his guns is Giuliano Urbani, one of Berlusconi's closest advisors as well as the architect of the Forza Italia program on the institutions. "Berlusconi has changed his mind," said Urbani, "he has opted for the single-round system. I have not; I remain in favor of a two-round system as indicated in the Forza Italia program." Domenico Fisichella, the political expert elected in the ranks of the National Alliance [AN], is puzzled and also sticks to his original choice, namely a two-round uninominal system. The Popular Party is certainly not sparing its criticism, nor is the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], which is sticking very firmly to the two-round system. But far from revolving around which system to choose, the talk is about the Forza Italia leader's conversion. The most widespread opinion is that it is a tactical decision, a way for him to free himself from the troublesome accord with the League. The postelection polls show Forza Italia on the rise and the League in decline, and if this trend turns out to be a strong, long-term one, Forza Italia could sweep the League away with the uninominal, single-round system. Some point out that this way of looking at things is typical of a party with a relative majority, the same way of thinking practised by the Christian Democratic Party last summer. Except the League is not making any noise. Umberto Bossi's [Northern League leader] party has always been firmly in favor of a straightforward single-round uninominal system (i.e. without any proportional representation). The reason why Bossi and his party are so in favor of this solution is explained by Domenico Fisichella. "A single-round, uninominal electoral system," AN's political expert said, "requires a specific kind of party setup if it is to lead to a two-party situation, otherwise fragmentation becomes more accentuated. For example, if there were 10 parties in a single territorial area in Italy, a single-round system would result in a very fragmented parliament. If the League is deeply rooted in one area of the country, nobody could unseat it with a single round of elections." Since this is how things stand, one is led to believe that by opting for the single round at this time Berlusconi considers that the League's roots are being fast eroded and that the Right in its entirety could maximize its parliamentary representation to the detriment of the opposition parties. Fisichella's reasoning, on the other hand, is that of a scholar: "A single-round uninominal system is a drastic choice; it gives good results only if the party system is such that it can promote a rapid change to a two-party system. On the other hand, a two-round electoral system tends toward bipolarity, which is different from a two-party system, and nobody can swear that the former may not be better for Italy than the latter. The blend between the party system and the electoral system is like a chemical compound: If both components are suited to each other the desired result is obtained, otherwise there is an explosion." As for AN's electoral interests and the risk of being absorbed by Forza Italia if a single-round system is adopted, Professor Fisichella weighs his words: "It is not only a matter of numbers," he said, "but also of organization. We must see what sort of party structure Forza Italia adopts and what its relationship with the citizens will be."
