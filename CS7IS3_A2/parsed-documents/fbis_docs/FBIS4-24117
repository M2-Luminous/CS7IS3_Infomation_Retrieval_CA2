Several people have either been killed or wounded. Clashes between government and UNITA troops have also been reported. The situation has been worsened by an unprecedented shortage of food. An average of 10 people starve to death in Kuito daily. Thousands of undernourished people could have the same fate in the next few days unless relief operations resume. Meanwhile, UNITA continues to move men, including Zairian mercenaries, and war materiel to mount a large-scale offensive on the city of N'dalatando over the next few hours. Lieutenant General Manuel Jose Neco, commander of the Cuanza Norte Operational Area, says government forces continue to defend the city. UNITA's long-range artillery units are still shelling the city. Government forces have killed eight UNITA soldiers and captured assorted war materiel. Captured UNITA soldiers disclosed that Jonas Savimbi instructed Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola commando units from Huambo to retake the city of N'dalatando before the end of the month to further complicate the Lusaka peace talks.
