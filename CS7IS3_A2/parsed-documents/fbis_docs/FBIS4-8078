Krajisnik added that the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer trusted other mediators since they had been abusing the trust of the top leadership of the Srpska republic. Krajisnik also pointed out that it was a totally obvious fact that the Muslim forces had provoked the Serbs around Gorazde to shatter the cessation of hostilities and an agreement on peace. Instead of the Muslim forces bearing responsibility for the conflicts around Gorazde, the NATO aircraft bombed the positions of Serb units near Gorazde.
