You Be The Judge. Our proposals to address the fears of those who feel their needs have not been met: - Voters to cast two votes (one for national representatives; one for provincial representatives); - Provinces to largely control their own finances; - Provinces to determine their own legislative and executive structures; - A constitutional principle on self-determination providing for consideration of a volkstaat [homeland]; - Elected provincial representatives to decide on the name of their province; - Provincial powers not to be undermined when the Constituent Assembly drafts the new constitution. The ANC [African National Congress] is firmly committed to peace and democracy. Since the beginning of negotiations, we have always listened to other points of view. Our aim remains an inclusive settlement that has the support of all parties. We believe that our latest proposals remove all reasons for anyone to stay out of the elections. Of course, we recognise the right of any party or individual not to take part. But no one has the right to disrupt the elections. The elections will be held on April 27. And South Africa must remain a united nation. We have made concrete proposals. We have negotiated in good faith. A negotiated settlement is the only option for South Africa. The door is still open. A better life for all. Working together for jobs, peace and freedom.
