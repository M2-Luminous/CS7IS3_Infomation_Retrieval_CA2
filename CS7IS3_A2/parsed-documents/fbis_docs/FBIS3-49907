He pointed out that the main task of his ministry was to carry out the transformation of the army without threatening its combat and mobilization readiness and operability. "Significant reorganization took place. Changes occurred in certain high-ranking Defense Ministry posts," Baudys said. According to him, the officer corps has undergone an extraordinary screening. During the past year, 4,303 officers left the Army -- 45 percent of them were colonels and lieutenant colonels, and 20 were generals. He said, however, that personnel problems continue because the departure of young officers and NCO's could not be stopped. He reported that new operational levels of command have been established. These changes concern Hradec Kralove tactical air force command, the 4th air defense company, and Stara Boleslav logistics command (Logistics is the science of rear-echelon combat service support using modern methods). The Air Force and Air Defense Command has been abolished, and so was the command of the 2d and 3d air defense divisions. "A new mechanized brigade emerged in Susice as a new standard element of ground forces, and the organization of three more brigades is in the works. One of them will be a rapid deployment brigade, approximately 3,500 men strong," Baudys stated. In a discussion with reporters, he asserted that he maintains the statement he made last year, when he described as traitors to the country all the professional soldiers who approved of the 1968 USSR aggression against Czechoslovakia. "It is not possible in practice to bring about the departure from the army of all these people. There are so many of them that we would have to dissolve the Army, and organize a completely new one," Baudys added.
