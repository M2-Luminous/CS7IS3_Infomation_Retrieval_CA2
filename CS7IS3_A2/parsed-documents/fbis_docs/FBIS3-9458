Klara Stejskalova reports: [Stejskalova] The Czech foreign affairs minister welcomed, in the beginning, the visit of the Netherlands royal couple to our country. The two ministers then agreed that mutual relations between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were good. That is why questions of multilateral cooperation were the main topic of their conversation. They talked, above all, about the European Union [EU], which the Czech Republic intends to join in the future. According to the two foreign ministers, the EU is currently undergoing dramatic moments, as confirmed by the current crisis on the question of the lower blocking minority by percent required by Britain. The emergent crisis only confirms the need for discussion on the future philosophy of the EU. The agenda of the Dutch-Czech talks also included questions on the Partnership for Peace program and overall security in Europe.
