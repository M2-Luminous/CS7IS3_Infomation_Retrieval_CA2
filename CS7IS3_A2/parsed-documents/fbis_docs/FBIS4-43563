For the first time since 1945, a Western country has recognized, through the mouth of its foreign minister, the existence of a "right to intervene" in the case of genocide. Until now, one intervened "charitably," more to placate public opinion troubled by the images of the world's misfortunes on its TV screens than in the name of a "moral and political" imperative. But in calling publicly for such a step, Alain Juppe has broken a taboo and encouraged a number of states which were until now too pusillanimous. Belgium's Defense Minister Leo Delcroix welcomed the initiative, which "breaks the lethargy" of the international community. Among Alain Juppe's entourage, nobody is hiding the fact that this decision was made rapidly. It is also admitted that media pressure played a major role. "It is obvious," a senior official from the French Foreign Ministry recognized, "that last Saturday's [11 June] massacre of 160 orphans acted as a catalyst. It was too much!" Finally, one does not hide away when certain observers accuse France of seeking to "make good past mistakes." As the same official commented: "We were slow in reacting, but does that mean we should do nothing?" Many Questions Now it is time for action, or rather reaction. Because it is very late. The massacres began on 6 April. Reports and eye witness accounts flowed in. Unanimous conclusion: A genocide was under way and, far from hiding away, those responsible for this monstrous act were claiming credit for it. The silence of the different states became deafening and had to be broken. This has been done. But, in practical terms, this does not resolve anything. Moving from symbol to action raises a host of questions. First of all, about the form. Like Francois Mitterrand traveling to Sarajevo without warning his European counterparts, Alain Juppe moved ahead without consulting his partners. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali was warned by telephone, but Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Italians...were all caught off guard. London, Brussels, and Washington appear to reluctant to the initiative. Only the Italians and Spaniards appear to be ready to consider action with the French, who have become veritable "snipers," according to one of Juppe's close colleagues. With regard to substance: The French Government is starting out with a severe handicap, due to its blind support, since 1990, of a now totally discredited regime. A senior diplomat summed it up: "We have to get the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] to understand that we are not against it. We have no intention of intervening to stay. We are looking to push forward a reconciliation initiative." This is where the ambiguity lies. How far is Paris ready to go in the name of "reconciliation?" Is it ready to discuss with those responsible for the "genocide," or should it distance itself from the former regime in order to construct the future with the few moderates, Hutus and Tutsis alike, who have managed to escape the massacre? Despite its precipitousness, Alain Juppe's initiative represents a deliberate political choice. The time limit which the foreign minister has given himself before deciding, if necessary, on a purely French intervention, will therefore be very short. His entourage is specific: "In a few days, a week perhaps, if nothing has moved forward from an international viewpoint, a decision will be made." Alain Juppe is playing for high stakes. Africa, too, whose leaders this time have been able to merit Western interest in its fate. A few days ago, Salim Ahmed Salim, the secretary general of the Organization for African Unity (OAU), recognized at the Tunis summit that "the tragic lesson we have to learn from events in Rwanda is that Africa must prepare to assume its responsibilities. We need to have the courage to criticize our mistakes."
