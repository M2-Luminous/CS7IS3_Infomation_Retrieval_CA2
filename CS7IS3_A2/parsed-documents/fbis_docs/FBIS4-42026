Volodymyr Pylypchuk, member of the "Center" faction: "After hearing his program, I must say that Masol has changed. His program coincides with mine by 90 percent. Masol has seriously changed -- he engaged in business for four years. It is not bad that the left-wing forces have won. In the past, they came out as an active separatist force, and now they have got this state and must take care of it. Perhaps, today, they are the only ones capable of keeping it united." Serhiy Holovatyy, member of the faction "Reforms": "There is one positive aspect to Masol's election -- this is the first case when the prime minister was elected by the parliamentary majority alone." Oleksandr Yemets, member of the presidium of the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine: "With the beginning of the formation of a procommunist government and victory of communist forces in parliamentary elections, the `left-wing' forces must form a government of like-minded people, since it is impossible today to form a coalition government." Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Ukraine's people's deputy: "Masol is a good specialist and an industrialist. The government's policy will be maintained as long as he is in power. We had many meetings when I was the acting prime minister, and we could agree on the majority of issues." Vyacheslav Kyrylenko, leader of MoNR [expansion unknown] and former chairman of the USS [expansion unknown]: "A power which advances past leaders to the political proscenium, shows that it has no future."
