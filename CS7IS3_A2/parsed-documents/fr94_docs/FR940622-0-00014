FR940622-0-00014 FR940622-0-00006 (iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, L uses its capital loss carryovers to offset modified capital gain net income. The capital loss carryovers offset the $60,000 modified capital gain net income allocated to the pre-change period without limitation. Subject to the section 382 limitation, the remaining $90,000 of capital loss carryovers offset the modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period. Accordingly, L uses $60,000 of its capital loss carryovers to offset $60,000 of its $90,000 modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period. L has absorbed its entire section 382 limitation for the change year. (iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, L's $60,000 net operating loss allocated to the post-change period is offset by its remaining $30,000 of post-change modified capital gain net income, reducing its post-change net operating loss to $30,000. (v) From its 1994 taxable year, L will carry over $30,000 of capital loss and $300,000 of net operating loss to its 1996 taxable year. From its 1995 taxable year, L will carry over $70,000 of net operating loss ($40,000 pre-change +$30,000 post-change) to its 1996 taxable year. The $40,000 pre-change portion of that carryover is subject to the section 382 limitation. (g) Definitions and nomenclature.
