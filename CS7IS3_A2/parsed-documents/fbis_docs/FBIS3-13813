Is the word still appropriately placed in the above sentence? [Peres] I do not want to play down the UNSC resolution. There is a change, however, in the U.S. position -- and I think it is a change somewhat for the better. To date the United States on two occasions voted in favor of including Jerusalem in the definition of the occupied territories. This time it abstained, and the reason for this is that had it voted against, it would have in fact vetoed the entire resolution and the Security Council would have been left without any resolution. One of the reasons which caused the United States to abstain is that the Declaration of Principles does not even mention Jerusalem. The present U.S. Administration has also taken upon itself severe restrictions regarding Jerusalem. The solution which the United States thought most appropriate in the present case was not to vote in favor -- as in the past -- but rather to abstain.
