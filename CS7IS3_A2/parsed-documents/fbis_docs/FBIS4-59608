In a statement to be published in the 16 May issue of the newspaper MAYU, President Mubarak said: Stop the fighting. War terminates unity; it does not preserve it. The Yemeni people are paying the price with their own blood and their vital installations, which are being destroyed. War will solve no problem anywhere, even if one side triumphs over another. The basis is always dialogue. He added: We have always advised them not to resort to military force. We said unity must be achieved with the consent of the people. Regarding the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, President Mubarak said: The Palestinian people are happy with this agreement. We are also happy to see that our Palestinian brothers have begun to restore their land and return to it in accordance with this agreement, which was the result of long and exhausting talks. Referring to the crisis that occurred during the signing ceremony for the agreement in Cairo on 4 May, Mubarak said: What happened on the day of the signing of the agreement in Cairo--the dispute over the maps, their not being signed, and then our return to the stage after bridging the gaps--is the most eloquent proof of the efforts we all exerted and the strenuous talks that ended with the signing of the agreement.
