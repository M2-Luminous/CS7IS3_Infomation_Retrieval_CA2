According to official figures, foreign-financed banks have started up almost 100 business organizations in China. At the same time, there are almost 100 foreign-financed banks that have opened own offices in China. How, then, is China controlling this situation? Recently, the State Council promulgated "Regulations for the Administrative Control of Foreign-Financed Banking Organizations," which are in force since 1 April. Some representatives of foreign-financed banks stationed in Beijing voiced their opinions to reporters on such questions as the competition between foreign and Chinese banks, business in RMB, etc. Another Step Forward in a Systematic Progress Since the early years of the 1980's, China has admitted foreign-financed banking institutions, and for their administrative control has applied the regulations on special economic zones, and the Shanghai regulations for the administrative control of foreign-financed banking institutions. Now, the State Council has promulgated control regulations that have nationwide validity, and this event has generally been welcomed by all foreign-financed banking institutions. Ms. Rong Fenge [2837 7685 1230], chief Beijing representative of the Nanyang Commercial Bank, expressed the opinion that the promulgation of these regulations has newly provided rules that give guidance, and have enhanced clarity, be it regarding the state's administrative control or regarding procedures to be followed by foreign-invested banks that intend to enter the Chinese market. Mr. Guo Zhonghua [6753 0112 5478], chief Beijing representative of the Royal Commercial Bank of Canada said, this is another step forward in the systematic progress of China's reform of the banking system. Methods of operations on China's financial market have become more and more standardized and mature. He said, although China's financial market is rapidly becoming internationalized and increasingly open, the said regulations prescribe that foreign-financed banks that intend to establish business agencies in China are required to have had representative organizations for two or more years. When applying for permission to establish a bank branch, the applicant's total assets must be no less than $20 billion. These regulations restrict short-term operations by foreign-financed banking institutions, and reduce the chances to nil for smaller banks to come to China for risky speculative operations. China, in this way, achieved one objective in connection with the entry of foreign-financed banking institutions: lots and lots of capital, less and less risk. No Possibility for a Few Firms to Constitute a Monopoly It was still a unique affair in 1981 when the Nanyang Commercial Bank established the first foreign-financed bank branch in the Shenzhen SEZ, but today China has welcomed in a virtual flood of foreign-financed banks, it is like the "hundreds of flowers in spring vying with each other." According to statistics of the People's Bank of China, up to the end of 1993, banking organizations from 15 countries and territories have established 98 business agencies in China. They are mostly concentrated in such places as Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Dalian. Competition between foreign-financed banks is unavoidable. On this point the chief Beijing representative of the Bank of Tokyo, Mr. Isao Okubo, has a deep understanding. When the news spread in Beijing, in the middle week of February, that 2 to 3 foreign-financed banks will open offices, Mr. Takagaki, the president of the Bank of Tokyo--the bank had been first in setting up an agency in Beijing--flew into Beijing. He called on leaders in the Beijing Municipality and in the People's Bank of China and renewed his request to open a branch bank. There were 40, 50 other foreign-financed banks that equally intended to open branches in Beijing. At present, the bank that has most business in China is the Chartered Bank. Its Beijing representative, Mr. Bai Lian [4101 4409 1344], revealed that the Chartered Bank had already opened seven branches, in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Haikou, and had opened representative offices in another seven places, in Dalian, Beijing, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Qingdao. Bai Lian said that the Chartered Bank will in the future open up in a few more places. The First National City Bank of New York, also not to be left behind, is about to transfer its China head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai. These "roots" of foreign-financed banks seem to show no fear of competition in the market economy. Ms. Rong Fenge expressed optimism when she said, because each bank has its own clientele, each has its own particular work sphere. At present, business in China would essentially require to open one branch bank in every place, so that the situation of several banks forming a monopoly will not arise, as it will rather be a competition in coexistence. Trading in RMB is a Slow Train Affair In the said regulations there are ten paragraphs listing operations allowed to foreign-financed banks. Most reason for concern is the last paragraph: "approval for trading in local currency." During his interview with a Reuters correspondent on 26 February, Zhou Zhengqing [0719 2973 1987], a vice president of the People's Bank of China, said, conditions are not yet ripe to allow foreign-financed banks to do business in RMB in the interior of China. However, he indicated at the same time that conditions will be ripe when three preconditions will be fulfilled: 1) taxes and levies will be equal for Chinese and foreign banks, and their burdens will in this respect be identical; 2) the system of commercial banks will have been perfected; 3) financial laws and regulations, such as a "Law Governing Commercial Banks," will be in place. Most foreign-financed banking institutions have accepted the concept that for them "in the matter of business activities in RMB, there is nothing else to do but to wait patiently." The difference is that they believe that the crucial point in the matter of freeing RMB transactions is raising the competitiveness of the domestic Chinese-financed banks. Chinese-financed Banks Must Gain Strength In comparison with the Chinese-financed banks, the foreign-financed banks have five great advantages: Abundant strength, diversity of banking procedures, a broad information network, and perfect credit facilities that make for low banking costs; A wealth of expert personnel well versed in international banking practices and highly efficient in their performance; Structural elasticity that allows full use of methods of price competition, combined with complete sets of advanced equipment. The Chinese banks are evidently lagging behind in efficiency, attitudes, and quality of service. At present, Chinese and foreign banks are "in a fight at close quarters" in handling settlements and documentary bills in the import-export trade where risks are small and profits large, and in some areas the foreign-financed banks have gained the upper hand. According to statistics, import-export trade settlements through foreign-financed banks in Shanghai in 1992 accounted for one-fourth of the whole amount done in that city. Mr. Okubo, who had been concerned with this question all along, expressed: The "Regulations" that allow entry of foreign banks into the Chinese market constitute an external pressure on the Chinese banks to enhance their competitive strength. However, the actual work that still has to be done is to deepen the reform of the Chinese banks in the interior, get them become commercial banks, become international banks. When that will have been achieved, the ideal state will have been reached in that there will be no difference in business operations between foreign-financed and Chinese-financed banks.
