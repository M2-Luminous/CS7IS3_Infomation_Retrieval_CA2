FR941021-1-00044 FR941021-1-00009 Tests that measure the actual levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood are costly and not generally available in the aviation medical examiner's office. Careful clinical assessment of respiratory function, including medical history and physical examination ordinarily are used to separate those applicants requiring further evaluation of their pulmonary status from those who do not. The FAA is not proposing to add a new requirement for routine spirometric testing at this time. Spirometric testing would impose incremental costs on applicants for all classes of airman medical certificate and additional administrative costs on the FAA. AME's would be required to purchase the equipment necessary to perform the examination. Under current practice, individuals with potentially serious pulmonary disease are identified through existing procedures and referred for further evaluation, including spirometric testing, of their pulmonary status to determine their eligibility for medical certification. The AMA Report also recommends specifically disqualifying diseases and conditions of the respiratory system. These would include severe lung disease, poorly controlled asthma, sleep disorders, pulmonary hypertension, pneumothorax, pulmonary emboli, and carcinoma of the lung. The list of specific conditions that would disqualify a person is not proposed for inclusion in the FAR because the conditions are already covered in the general medical standards. Diabetes In its discussion of diabetes in the preamble to Amendment 67&hyph;11, the FAA stated that the Federal Air Surgeon would continue to deny certification to individuals who have an established medical history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes that is controlled by the use of insulin or another hypoglycemic drug (47 FR 16298, April 15, 1982). The preamble further stated, ``If, in the future, information demonstrating that medical technology has advanced to the point that diabetes can be controlled without significant risk of incapacitation from hypoglycemia or other complications becomes available to the FAA, consideration for special issuance of a medical certificate under §67.19 will be possible.'' As part of the review of part 67, the AMA Report made recommendations concerning individuals seeking medical certification who have an established history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes that is controlled by insulin or another hypoglycemic drug. The AMA Report recommended that persons whose diabetes is adequately controlled with oral hypoglycemic drugs and who show evidence of stability and freedom from adverse effects be considered for medical certification with proper medical monitoring. The Endocrine Committee assembled by the AMA believes that the likelihood of incapacitation from the effects of diabetes or its treatment with current oral hypoglycemic drugs, in those persons medically selected and monitored, is very remote. The AMA Endocrine Committee recommends that absolute prohibitions of certification of individuals requiring insulin for control of diabetes be continued. Informal surveys of agency medical consultants, comments by interested medical practitioners, and review by the FAA medical staff indicate general agreement with these findings and recommendations of the AMA Report. The more widespread use of technically advanced equipment and procedures has made it possible for physicians to better select those persons who should be allowed to use, or continue to use, oral drugs to control their disease. The increased use of simple equipment and tests for self-monitoring gives the diabetic and the physician a more accurate and timely picture of a person's immediate condition as well as his or her ability to control blood sugar over time. In view of the current consensus of the medical community, the FAA has determined that many individuals whose diabetes is without complications and acceptably controlled by diet and oral drugs, with appropriate monitoring and other conditions, can perform the duties authorized by their class of medical certificate without endangering public safety. Accordingly, though no substantive rule change is proposed to current requirements in paragraph (f)(1) of §§67.13, 67.15, and 67.17, the Federal Air Surgeon has determined that those persons who do not meet the medical standard of the FAR because their diabetes requires oral hypoglycemic drugs will no longer be categorically denied special issuance of airman medical certification.
