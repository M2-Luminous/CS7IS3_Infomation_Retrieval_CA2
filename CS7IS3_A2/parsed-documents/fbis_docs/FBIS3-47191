They added, "Japan has to say what it has to say to the United States." Such criticism was touched off by TCCI Vice President Oga, who said: "I was surprised at hearing Bentsen's remarks because the U.S. economy is improving." He added: "The United States' computer industry is one of the driving forces of its economy, but such computer parts as liquid crystal displays [LCDs] are all Japanese made. Unless industries producing such computer parts are established in the United States it has to continue to import them from Japan, and therefore its trade deficit with Japan will continue to increase if the yen continues to rise. The Japanese Government should make the United States understand this." He indicated that, not only for Japan but also for the U.S. economy, the yen's appropriate rate against the dollar is 120. JCCI President Inaba said: "The United States is an importing country. Its attempt to raise exports by making use of the appreciated yen is merely a partial effort." He stressed: "Japan, in its past relations with the United States, weakly threw back the ball cast by the United States. From now on, we have to cast back the ball properly." This indicates the verbal intervention into the yen's exchange rate by the U.S. high-raking official has irritated the industry leaders who seem to be nervous about the U.S. Government's move because Japan is still in a serious depression.
