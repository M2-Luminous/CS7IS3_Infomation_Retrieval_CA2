The political bureau of the New Party of the Congress for the Independence of Madagascar in a statement May 15 said the DPRK is making sincere efforts to remove nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula and defend peace and security in this part of the world. It is reasonable and judicious to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-USA talks, said the statement, adding that the party wants the continuation of the DPRK-USA talks and that impartiality must be ensured in the settlement of the nuclear issue. The Uganda-DPRK Friendship Association and the Ugandan National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea in a joint statement May 19 said the continuation of the dangerous state of ceasefire on the Korean peninsula is abnormal in every respect. If the United States truly wants peace and security in Korea, it must accept the peace overture of the DPRK side and come out to negotiation with the DPRK without delay, the statement demanded. Sayfuddin Chowdhry, member of parliament and floor leader (secretary-general) of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), in an interview with KCNA in New Delhi May 17 said: "We strongly demand the United States stop the reckless military provocations against the Korean people and immediately respond to the constructive peace overture of the DPRK."
