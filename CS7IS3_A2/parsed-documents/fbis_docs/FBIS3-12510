The state is above all, greater than all, safeguards the rights of all, and protects the future and unity of all Lebanese. I must reemphasize these points at the threshold of a historic period in our national life that demands we maintain the greatest vigilance and solidarity and anything that will spare the country's indulgence in petty disputes or one-upmanship. Lebanon is facing internal and external challenges demanding the mobilization of efforts on every political, economic, and social level. They also demand that we reemphasize the state's necessary and basic role in our national society. Any future role by Lebanon will remain the target of containment and attack unless the Lebanese state--society and authority--rises to the level of this role, the hopes being pinned on Lebanon in the coming years, and the aspirations of the Lebanese, who are seeking progress and who strongly believe that the elements of progress have become stronger than the elements of anarchy and uncertainty. I would like to emphasize the following main points: 1. The Lebanese state has primary responsibility for liberating the south and Western al-Biqa' from the Israeli occupation. It highlights the Lebanese people's right to use every means to achieve the goal of total and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal, the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425, and Lebanese authority over all the occupied territory. Foiling Israel's attempt to undermine progress toward peace is a national effort in which we must all be involved, because the resistance of Israel is not achieved only with weapons. It is also achieved by political, diplomatic, and social means. We must choose the time and place and mobilize all our resources for it. We are not alone in this field. The fraternal Arab states led by Syria stand by us, support our legitimate rights, and understand our situation. The results of the Geneva summit between the Syrian and U.S. presidents confirm that we are not alone and that the Lebanese constants are receiving support, because they express the conviction of a people and the choices of a country. The friendly countries also hasten to assist us and respond to our wishes when we ask them to intervene. Brothers, the delicate stage through which the Middle East, including Lebanon, is passing, together with the difficulties experienced in the Washington talks and the appearance of more than one trend in them, demand that the Lebanese people maintain their solidarity and unite their position in the face of the renewed Israeli ambitions. Efforts in any direction must be collective, not individual, objective, not random, and complementary, not partial, to achieve the desired results, utilizing all the legitimate means for an effective united endeavor. The responsibility is great and collective. May we be able to shoulder it together. God helps those who are united. 2. The Lebanese state is responsible for safeguarding the people's security and implementing the law. It will allow no party to usurp its role in this regard or harm the general and personal safety of the Lebanese. 3. The concurrence between the will to liberate the land from Israeli occupation and the will for development and reconstruction is a central policy in the process of specifying the role of the Lebanese state. The state that works for development is the state that can liberate its land from occupation. Development is synonymous with liberation and must not contradict it under any circumstance or for any reason. 4. The Lebanese national peace must be based on the principle of coordination with Syria and strengthening the relations between the two countries to fortify the Lebanese position in the face of regional challenges and prevent Lebanon from being isolated in the next stages of the developments, whether with regard to peace or steadfastness. [passage omitted] 5. Lebanon has made good progress in moving from a regime that handles the crisis to a regime that works to solve the crisis. The constitutional and legal institutions established as a result of the al-Ta'if Agreement are a sound national expression of the will for transformation, which we think there is urgent need to emphasize right now and in the face of any parties that wish to keep Lebanon swinging between crises and solutions. 6. Rebuilding the state does not begin by violating the law. In the face of this, we must not call for the revival of the state and compete to defend the democratic system and at the same time violate the democratic principles and laws. The just law of the state must prevail over all and be the judge among all. [passage omitted] 7. Balanced economic development is the principal policy according to which a fair country must act. It is the principal policy according to which we as a government act. We want our activity to cover all the Lebanese areas, particularly the areas that have historically been deprived of and isolated from state services and benefits. [passage omitted] Honorable audience, the common denominator among all the points I have mentioned is the state and its role. We will be making a big mistake if we think that usurping one part of the state's role to benefit a specific party could enrich that party and make it stronger against other parties. I am confident that the state will prevail, through your will and efforts, irrespective of opposition by parties that feel they have been harmed as a result. We will maintain our policy on reconciliation, unity, and development. [passage omitted]
