Charm of the Directors' and Generals' Budget"] [Text] On 11 May 1994, following the heartfelt speech in the State Duma by V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Federation Government, who declared that "the government has done the maximum possible to observe the fragile balance of everyone's interests in the draft that has been submitted," the most important indicators of the State Budget for 1994 were approved: income -- 124,477.0 billion rubles [R] expenditure -- R194,495.31 billion deficit -- R70,018.31 billion (36 percent of the sum of expenditure). Votes for -- 237; votes against -- 77; abstentions -- 12. Ten minutes after this vote it suddenly came to light that "there is a more than two-fold discrepancy in expenditure between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defense: 87 and 37. This "discovery" was made by A. Piskunov, deputy chairman of the Duma Defense Committee. What is this figure "37"? It is the sum of expenditure in Section V -- "National Defense" -- R37.126 trillion. It turns out that the figure of R37 trillion for expenditure in respect of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, which features in all the previous versions of the State Budget submitted by the government, does not suit the military department, which secured the creation of a special commission consisting of State Duma deputies and representatives of the government and the Security Council. In a closed session the commission decided on defense expenditure in the sum of R55 trillion, i.e. 50 percent more than proposed by the government and signed by the prime minister. It is curious that the commission's corresponding protocol on this subject supposedly even has a corresponding conciliatory resolution of the Russian Federation president, but the chairman of the government knows nothing at all about this protocol. He at once confirmed this: "...I do not know who discussed this question with whom or where. It is possible to examine everything not only within the limits of a 36-percent deficit." But since R55 trillion corresponds to 41 percent [figures as puiblished] of the budget deficit, the corresponding amendment to the Law on the State Budget did not get through. Despite repeated attempts to force through this additional expenditure. They decided to return to this subject later, and a closed plenary session of the State Duma was even planned for 27 May to examine secret [zakrytyy] subheads of the budget. The session did not take place. I will not repeat the sham grounds for deferring this examination until 8 June this year. I believe that the deep-seated reason lies in tactics, as is customary with the military. Undisguised agitation for an increase in military spending has been mounted in the pages of the press and on radio and television during these two weeks. Even deputies on the reforming wing have begun to frighten their other colleagues with the sociopolitical consequences of underfunding the defense sphere, with the loss of military technologies, with a shortfall in export proceeds, etc. The recommendation which the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly formulated at its closed session 2 June 1994 is also along the same lines. So /the adoption of a so-called compromise military budget, but essentially an astronomical one forcibly extorted by the bigwigs of the military-industrial complex, is virtually predetermined/ [passage between slantlines printed in boldface]. They will vote, like dear little deputies wishing to please the military, for R55 trillion for our generals and general directors [generaly i generalnyye]. Before showing what this is fraught with, I should, for purposes of a clearer comparison, decipher this colossal sum somewhat: maintenance of the Armed Forces -- R26.3 trillion purchases and development of armament and military hardware -- R17.4 trillion capital construction and expenditure by the Ministry of Atomic Energy -- R8.8 trillion servicemen's pensions -- R2.5 trillion. Let us note that the Ministry of Defense has 2.1 million servicemen. And yet there are also many other military people in Russia. There are approximately 300,000 in the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, approximately 200,000 in the Border Troops, and almost 80,000 in the Federal Counterintelligence Service. Expenditure on these departments "sits" in Section VII -- "Law-Enforcement Activity and Security Organs" -- and amounts to R12 trillion. Let us count up, dear reader, and add on to the R55 trillion the other expenditure on people who wear shoulder boards, as well as other expenditure connected with preparation for war and for other emergency situations. What used to be called "civil defense" has now acquired the name of the "Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations..." and is headed by generals, has thousands of servicemen, and uses up approximately R2 trillion in Section XII, including R344 billion on mobilization preparation. Does Section XI -- "Replenishment of State Stocks and Reserves" -- have no bearing on defense expenditure? Some R5.9 trillion is planned for this, plus almost R0.5 trillion under Section X -- "Reserve Funds." Section XIV -- "Financial Assistance for Organs of State Power of Components of the Russian Federation and Local Self-Management" -- contains the following interesting long line: "-- subsidies for budgets of closed administrative-territorial formations within whose bounds installations of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Atomic Energy are located." The small town of Shkotovo-17 in Maritime Kray, or the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy-50. You will not find them on the map, but this unexpectedly slipped through in the draft State Budget: "to transfer from the Federal Budget on account of the first quarter of 1994..." subsidies in the sum of almost R3 billion each. Line by line -- and R583 billion has been clocked up for a few dozen numbered cities. Is this military or nonmilitary expenditure? There is one more "nonmilitary" subhead of expenditure -- XIV [figure as published], entitled "Other State Expenditure." Military expenditure is also hidden here. For example: -- payment of allowances for dependants and children of servicemen -- R150 billion -- the Russian Defense-Sports-Technical Society (the former DOSAAF [Voluntary Society for the Promotion of the Army, Aviation, and Navy]) -- R9 billion -- rent for use of the Baykonur Cosmodrome -- R135 billion -- the Federal Railroad Troops Directorate -- R282 billion -- the Federal Road Construction Directorate under the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, and others -- R171 billion. This subhead is particularly rich in concealed additional expenditure of a military nature. It includes, in addition to that enumerated, military research by the Ministry of Health, the Committee for Convention Problems of Disarmament, the State Technical Commission, and other departments headed by generals. Also hidden here is expenditure by the Federal Directorate of Special Construction with its 100,000 military construction workers and multitude of generals, other military construction directorates, corporations, etc. I managed to dig up approximately R1.5 trillion in expenditure of a military nature concealed under this subhead. It is hardly worth denying the involvement with the military sphere of the R755 billion on the "defense industry conversion" line or the R837 billion under "realization of international treaties on the elimination, reduction, and limitation of arms." I could enumerate still more, but I have already clocked up a sum approaching R80 trillion. I am not sure whether the R4.2 trillion contained in line IV -- "Basic Research and Promotion of Scientific and Technical Progress" -- (much of which will, moreover, be used in military matters) will be realized or whether Moscow, which is stuffed with military structures, will get its R3 trillion in subventions to perform the functions of the capital. I am not sure whether VUZ's [higher educational institutions] and vocational and technical schools will get R5 trillion, and culture and art R0.86 trillion. But I do not think that anyone is in any doubt that the aforementioned R80 trillion will definitely be spent. For at the beginning of the year a soldier's complete set of uniform clothes along with synthetic leather [kirzovyy] boots cost R500,000. How many wearers of boots and uniforms we have! Not counting the generals' expensive stars. All this unproductive, nonreturnable, irreversible expenditure in the State Budget will certainly be passed. This is almost 65 percent of the revenue part of the State Budget. Truly a wartime budget. The author has gone too far, you will say. Not at all. I still have not added in expenditure on the current upkeep of military commissariats, on severance pay on being drafted for military service, on funding of military training in technical colleges and VUZ's, expenditure under the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" (running to many trillions of rubles), the average monthly wages of enterprise workers at the time of their participation in military training courses, etc. In addition, hidden funding of military expenditure is provided out of the income made from selling military property and from the economic activities of economically accountable enterprises -- for example, the 100 military state farms. This and other revenue is not taken into account in the budget. By the way. The government recently submitted to the State Duma information entitled "On the Implementation of the Federal Budget for 1993." Take a look, messieurs deputies, at this very curious document. It states, in particular: "Total revenue -- R17,124.03 billion." In the "expenditure" column: line "8. Defense -- R7,209 billion" (42 percent of the revenue part). Lines 2, 6, 7, 10, 16, and 21 also contain approximately R3,500 billion of additional expenditure of a military nature. Altogether, approximately 63 percent of the revenue part. This was the budget that was realized last year. In 1994 there was an attempt to lower this threshold just a little. But this attempt came up against very tough resistance from the military-industrial complex and its latter-day lobbyists in the Federal Assembly. They make everyone knuckle under: their colleagues at the voting desks, the government, the president, and you and me, the taxpayers. We are all hostages of our military-industrial complex. No military reform is taking place in the country. The switch to professional Armed Forces is being blocked with references to Russia's special geopolitical position, and there are still many millions of soldiers. Russia's technological backwardness is being conserved. All this behind closed doors. They use mystery to conceal lies. The economic consequences of the militarized nature of the budget and of the resumption of the arms race will be catastrophic. It is time to call a halt and look back. For Russia has been living throughout the 20th century under virtual wartime conditions and under the occupying regime of its own homegrown military-industrial complex.
