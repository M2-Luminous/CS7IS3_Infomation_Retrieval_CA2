The Indonesian hope was expressed by Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade Ir. [academic title] Hartarto in his speech read out by his assistant, Kosim Gandataruna, during the closing ceremony of the 10th International Apparel Federation (IAF) convention here on Wednesday. The minister said that in the next 10 years when the Uruguay Round is already completed, there would be stiffer competition in the domestic market. "But for Indonesia, he said, "it would not then be a new thing as the country has already made it as a policy." [quotation marks as received] He said we are only trying to resist now to be able to compete either in price or quality. "Industries should do their own homework, while the government gives support by providing a better climate for investment," Hartarto said. He also pointed out Indonesia's textile and its product (TPT) as one of the country's basic export goods and that it could well be improved for better international market competition. [sentence as received] The IAF convention which was opened by President Suharto was held from June 14 to 15. It was attended by some 300 participants from 20 IAF member countries.
