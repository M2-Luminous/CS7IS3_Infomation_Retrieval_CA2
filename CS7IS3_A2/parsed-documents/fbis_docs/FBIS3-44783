Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, said that the new quotas will be placed on imports of certain textile and apparel products from China in 1994 at levels 25 percent to 35 percent lower than in 1993. The move was seen as a retaliation to alleged "massive transshipment" and "significant overshipments" of Chinese textiles through third countries. Negotiations between Washington and Beijing in the last nine months failed to solve the issue before the bilateral textile agreement expired on December 31, 1993. The Chinese side made it clear that the problem of illegal shipments should be dealt with seriously through negotiations provided there is clear evidence, but the U.S. side insisted on its unilateral power to impose quota reductions. According to Kantor, the new quotas will be announced formally in a federal register notice, which will become effective on January 17, 1994, but it would apply to textile and apparel products that have entered into the United States after January 1 this year. The sharp cuts cover 88 categories of products, including sweaters, knit shirts, cotton trousers and shop cloths used to clean machinery, according to Kantor. The quota reduction is estimated to slash China's exports in those categories by 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.
