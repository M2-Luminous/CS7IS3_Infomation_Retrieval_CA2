Our correspondent Moti Amir reports from Taba: Over the last hour there were several developments here in Taba. At present there is a break in the discussions of the Security Affairs Committee. The Israeli representatives are holding consultations with Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, and perhaps with Jerusalem as well, over a new proposal submitted by Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short time ago. The Palestinian representatives in the committee were also summoned for consultations by Dr. Sha'th a short time ago. The only issue under discussion at the present time is the border crossings issue, which has been defined here as the key to all the security related issues under negotiations in Taba. A senior source in the Palestinian delegation noted the new proposal on the border crossings issue submitted to Israel includes all the understandings attained in Oslo and Cairo, and is also based on the joint working paper formulated by representatives of the two delegations on the agreements and disagreements on this issue. According to the source the new proposal provides answers to all the security problems on the border crossings. In his opinion the Israeli representatives are delaying their answer to the proposal due to internal debates within the delegation, or due to other reasons which have to do with their desire to prevent the continuation of the discussions in the Security Affairs Committee. According to the source, the Palestinian representatives in the committee have a full mandate from Yasir 'Arafat to attain an agreement on the border crossings issue. He added: This is precisely how we acted when we submitted the proposal and we do not need to ask Tunis anything. Altogether it appears that the negotiations over the border crossings are stuck. Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short time ago confirmed he will travel to Cairo for a meeting with 'Arafat tomorrow morning. Later he will travel with 'Arafat to Oslo, where they are slated to meet Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on Friday [21 January]. Sha'th said that as far as he is concerned the committees can continue their work tomorrow without the attendance of the delegation heads. Incidentally, Maj. Gen. Shahaq will apparently also travel to the Oslo meeting.
