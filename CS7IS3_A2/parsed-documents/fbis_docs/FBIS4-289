FBIS4-289 "drafr067_a_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Central African Republic French Troops Put on Alert After Plane Crash French Troops Put on Alert After Plane Crash AB0704095194 Paris AFP in English 0937 GMT 7 Apr 94 AB0704095194 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Paris, April 7 (AFP) -- French troops were put on alert in Central African Republic on Thursday [7 April] after the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed in a plane crash in Kigali, military officials said. The officials said there were no plans at the moment to send troops into either Rwanda or Burundi, where the situation was reported calm Thursday although firing was reported in the Rwandan capital Kigali. They added that French residents in both capital were under no threat. The Rwandan Defense Ministry said the plane, carrying the officials back from a regional conference in Tanzania aimed at settling ethnic strife in Rwanda and Burundi, had been shot down by "unidentified elements" as it prepared to land late Wednesday. The French officials said shots were fired Thursday morning in Kigali but said there appeared to be no major disorder there. Kigali residents as well as German and Belgian envoys there also reported sporadic shooting in Kigali, while the German ambassador there, Dieter Hoelscher, said the atmosphere there was "tense." The French source said French troops in Africa were put on alert each time there was a crisis in a nearby country. Rwanda and Burundi are located east of Zaire which neighbours Central African Republic. France pulled its last troops out of Kigali late last year after UN forces were deployed there. About 10 French military troops are in Burundi as part of an aid mission, the source said. Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprien Ntaryamira were killed along with government aides, including two Burundi cabinet ministers, when their aircraft crashed in Kigali late Wednesday.
