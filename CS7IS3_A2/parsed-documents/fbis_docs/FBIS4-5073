The European regional headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, in a statement, expressed a surging indignation at the introduction of patriots and other sophisticated weapons into South Korea by the United States, saying it is increasing the war crisis on the Korean peninsula. Kim Chong-su, chairman of the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification, said in a press statement: The United States is sending its military intelligence team and a large quantity of latest-type weapons to South Korea and scheming large-scale military exercises there. This is an unpardonable criminal act intended to keep hold on South Korea as its colony and military base and, furthermore, into its nuclear forward base, military information-gathering centre and to lead the situation of the Korean peninsula to the grave brink of war. The Federation of South Koreans in Japan for Democracy and Unification in a statement strongly urged the United States to withdraw at once the projected Patriots deployment in South Korea and stop all kinds of war games including the provocative "Team Spirit" joint military exercises.
