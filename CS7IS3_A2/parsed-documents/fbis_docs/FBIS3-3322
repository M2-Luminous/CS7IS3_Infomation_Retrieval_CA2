Trevor Wyatt reports: [Begin recording] Mr Liu said the Chinese Government had made it very clear that it was willing to discuss human rights with other countries, but it did not like one country imposing its values and positions on this issue on the other party. The United States is pressing Beijing to redress alleged human rights abuses and has threatened to withdraw China's most-favored-nation trading status if does not comply. Washington's threat not to renew MFN when it comes up in June has raised the specter of a rupture in economic relations that would not only hurt the two countries involved, but the rest of the Asia-Pacific region as well. Faced with that possibility, the American Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said last week that Washington needed to rethink its strategy for dealing with China in order to avoid a damaging breakdown in relations. Mr Liu agreed and said that he had heard the remarks by Mr Bentsen and appreciated them. He said if human rights and trade were linked together, then both countries would suffer. Saying that trade was mutually beneficial for both nations, Mr Liu urged the United States to renew MFN for China without any conditions. He said Beijing had the support of a number of other countries for its stance. [end recording]
