Among them are some Hong Kong Chinese who have contacted us and said they wanted to set up garment factories for export. Their main market, of course, will be the lucrative and low-tax United States. The under secretary of state went on: When the Hong Kong investors came to meet us, we were always glad to welcome them. The under secretary of state said that we need both local and foreign investors for Cambodia. We advised them to get ready to invest in the garment industry and we told them to make advance arrangements with American trading counterparts pending the signature of the agreement between the Cambodian and American sides, which will take place in the next two to three months. The Hong Kong Chinese are not the only ones to have expressed the desire to invest in the garment sector. Investors from the PRC and from other countries also have expressed interest. Each garment factory, according to the investors, would require a large labor force numbering in the hundreds or thousands. So, it would help absorb the now mostly idle excess state-employed personnel, as well as provide employment for the general public. The under secretary of state emphatically rejected remarks made by some administration officials who mistakenly feared economic colonization of our country by the United States following Cambodia's introduction into the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) and its acquisition of MFN status. He pointed out that in granting GSP and MFN recognition to economically weaker nations like Cambodia, the larger and stronger countries are the ones who assist the former by making many concessions to them, while the smaller and weaker countries will not be expected to return any favors. In Cambodia's case, the United States will impose the lowest taxes on more than 4,000 types of products that could be imported from our country. As for goods from the United States, our government will be asked to levy taxes equal to but not higher than those imposed on goods imported from other countries, such as Japan or Singapore.
