They issued a manifesto saying the democrats sustained a crushing defeat in last month's general elections. For the past two years, it says, pro-democracy groups have supported the new establishment and the president though being aware of their weakness and mistakes. "But we were also aware of something even worse than that -- the establishment's growing indifference to the electorate," says the manifesto. The authors of the manifesto speak of a dramatic change with "alienation between the government and the people reaching any acceptable limits." "Amid continuing hardships caused by economic crisis, this is fraught with social upheavals," it says. The authors called for an alternative policy of reforms to the benefit of the people. The manifesto says the country still has a chance to build a civilian society peacefully, create a robust middle class, redress the plight of hired workers, and give each honest man an opportunity to ensure a decent standard of living for himself and his family.
