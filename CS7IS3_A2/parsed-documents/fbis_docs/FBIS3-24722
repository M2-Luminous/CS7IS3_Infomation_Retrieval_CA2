On his campaign trail at the Boskop Agricultural Training Centre in Potchefstroom, Mr Mandela said his remarks on Sunday that Afrikaners could have a separate election ballot to vote for a volkstaat had not been accurate. "Afrikaners will not receive a separate ballot, but the ANC will devise a method through the election process where they will decide if the majority of Afrikaners want a volkstaat," he told the campaign rally. On Sunday, Mr Mandela warned rightwingers not to do anything to plunge the country into a conflict. "We know how to fight too," he told a rally in Stilfontein.
