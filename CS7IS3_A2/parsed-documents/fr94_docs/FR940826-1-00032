ACTION: Proposed rules. SUMMARY: These proposed regulations will exclude from income and resources under the supplemental security income (SSI) program, payments received by an individual (or spouse) from a fund established by a State to aid victims of crime and certain relocation assistance received from a State or local government.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 1612(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act), as amended by sections 5031 and 5035 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, effective May 1, 1991, excludes from income under the SSI program payments received by an individual (or spouse) from a fund established by a State to aid victims of crime, and relocation assistance provided by a State or local government which is comparable to assistance provided under title II of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Sections 5031 and 5035 also amended section 1613(a) of the Act to exclude these payments and assistance from resources for a period of 9 months beginning with the month following the month in which they are received. However, with respect to victims' compensation payments under section 5031, the resource exclusion applies to the extent that the payments were made as compensation for expenses incurred or losses suffered as a result of a crime. In addition, section 5031 amended section 1631(a) of the Act to provide that benefits under title XVI shall not be denied to any individual solely by reason of the refusal of the individual to accept an amount offered as compensation for a crime of which the individual was a victim. Section 13732 of Public Law 103&hyph;66 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993) amended section 5035 of Pub. L. 101- 508 by making permanent the exclusion of relocation assistance which originally was set to expire on April 30, 1994. These proposed regulations would amend §§416.210(b), 416.1124, and 416.1210 and create new §§416.1229 and 416.1239 to reflect these statutory changes. These proposed rules would also amend §416.1161 to apply these same income exclusions when victims' compensation payments and State and local government relocation assistance are received by the ineligible spouse or ineligible parent of an eligible individual or child in order that the deeming rules not reduce the SSI payment of, or render ineligible, the individual or child. The proposed amendments to §416.1210 would result in the application of the resource exclusions to these deemors. Not to apply the exclusions in such cases could thwart the Congressional intent underlying sections 5031 and 5035 that State victims' compensation payments and relocation assistance not be treated as income and resources and thus not adversely affect SSI eligibility. For this same reason, the proposed resource exclusions would apply to victims' compensation payments and relocation assistance received by an alien's sponsor whose resources are deemed to an eligible alien. Under section 1621(b)(1) of the Act, income exclusions are not applicable in determining the amount of a sponsor's income that will be deemed to an alien. Therefore, the proposed income exclusions for victims' compensation payments and relocation assistance would not apply to such payments received by a sponsor whose income is deemed to an alien. Section 416.1204 would be updated to reflect the inclusion of the resource exclusion for victims' compensation payments and relocation assistance as well as the other resource exclusions applicable to the resources of a sponsor. Regulatory Procedures Executive Order 12866 We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.
