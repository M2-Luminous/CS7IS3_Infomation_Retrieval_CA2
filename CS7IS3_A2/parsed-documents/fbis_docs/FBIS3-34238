A statement distributed by the two parties and printed by local Jerusalem newspapers said armed 'Arafat loyalists burst onto university grounds, smashing furniture and tearing up election posters. They then threatened the committee supervising the vote, saying that unless they left the campus within a quarter of an hour they would wreck their cars. The committee left to prevent infighting. The statement called this behavior a brazen violation of all our values. It is a flagrant breach of all democratic values and a form of terrorism, for which the 'Arafat supporters must be held responsible. We urge all nationalist and Islamic forces to assume their responsibilities toward such behavior, and we call on the committee to set a new election date for next Friday, 11 February, the statement said.
