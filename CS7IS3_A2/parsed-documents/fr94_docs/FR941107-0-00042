FR941107-0-00042 FR941107-0-00016 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 2, 15, 24 [GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, RM&hyph;7140, RM&hyph;7175, RM&hyph;7618; FCC 94&hyph;265] New Personal Communications Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule; order on reconsideration. SUMMARY: By this action the Commission addressed ten petitions for reconsideration that seek revisions to various service rules governing broadband Personal Communications Services (PCS). The changes adopted are limited to revisions in the cross-ownership restrictions, that will serve to expand participation in the broadband PCS spectrum auction scheduled to commence December 5, 1994, and to revisions of technical rules governing PCS radio signal transmission. The expanded auction participation will serve to increase the number of potential PCS licensees, while the latter, technical changes will enhance the flexibility of equipment manufacturers in designing products that comply with Commission regulations, and so reduce the ultimate cost of service to PCS consumers. EFFECTIVE DATE: Amendments to 47 CFR 24.204, are November 7, 1994. Other amendments adopted in this order shall be effective December 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stanley P. Wiggins, Common Carrier Bureau at (202) 418&hyph;1322.

Summary of Order By this order, the Commission amends in minor respects its broadband Personal Communications Services (``PCS'') regulatory structure to better achieve the four primary goals of this proceeding: competitive delivery, a diverse array of services, rapid deployment, and wide-area coverage. The Commission takes this action in response to ten petitions for reconsideration or clarification of policies and rules adopted in the Broadband PCS Reconsideration order. The Commission denies those petitions in major part because they principally raise issues the Commission has considered at length in previous orders in this Docket. By this action, the Commission modifies existing rules in only limited respects. First, the Commission permits entities with non-controlling, attributable cellular interests to bid on ``in-market'' 30 MHz PCS licenses, conditioned on post-auction compliance with existing cellular/PCS cross-ownership rules within 90 days of PCS license grant. Second, the Commission clarifies the requirements for isochronous devices operating in the 1920&hyph;1930 MHz sub-band. Third, the Commission clarifies its rule governing broadband PCS emission limits. Fourth, the Commission makes certain housekeeping amendments to the Table of Frequency Allocations. In denying the reconsideration petitions in principal part, the Commission: (1) Affirms existing license eligibility and ownership attribution rules in principal part; (2) denies without prejudice a proposal to require PCS licenses to share the costs of relocating microwave licensees from the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz PCS Band; (3) declines to change PCS service area definitions; (4) affirms an existing rule that divides Puerto Rico into two Basic Trading Areas for licensing purposes; (5) declines a request to interpret the meaning of correspondence between AIDE and Rand McNally Corporation regarding the latter's agreement to license the terms Metropolitan Trading Area and Basic Trading Area; (6) determines that the question whether to impose Open Network Architecture regulation on PCS licensees is outside the scope of this proceeding; (7) denies requests to modify the emission mask for licensed PCS bands and to make other changes to technical PCS rules; (8) determines that it is unnecessary to impose special technical requirements on PCS licensees in Block C in order to prevent their operations from interfering with adjacent Broadcast Auxiliary Service licensees; and (9) defers to a pending Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) proceeding the question whether to establish a secondary allocation of MSS in PCS Blocks F and C (1970&hyph;1990 MHz). Ordering Clauses Accordingly, it is ordered, that the petitions for reconsideration addressed in this order are granted to the extent described above, and Denied in all other respects. It is further ordered, the Parts 2, 15, and 24 of the Commission's Rules are amended as specified below, effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register , except that amendments to 47 CFR 24.204 as specified below shall be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register .
