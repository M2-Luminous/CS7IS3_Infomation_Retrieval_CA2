What does this mean in practice? [Horn] This means, first and foremost, that the real problems of the people have to be dealt with. This means that the new parliament and the new government should not deal with masses of abstract ideological questions. This really means that all questions, without whose solution we cannot ease the people's fate and life, must be put on the agenda on the first day after the formation of the new government, if possible. There are a lot of questions of this kind. [Gyuricza] Some examples? [Horn] I mean, first of all, the social strata in the most difficult situation -- pensioners, families with many children, young career-starters; we have to ensure that people are housed and that in practice these young people can get a job. Just look at the catastrophic housing situation. The new government cannot avoid establishing a credit system, with state participation, for the construction of homes or for the acquisition of homes. This is no longer just another of the many promises being made, since the elections are behind us. Concerning all this, I am convinced that we have to keep in mind -- since we could spend hours just listing all these necessary steps -- that people do not exist to implement a change of system; on the contrary, the change of system has to serve the people. There was some kind of misunderstanding here over the past months and years -- as though the change of system was regarded as an abstract aim. [passage omitted] [Gyuricza] [passage omitted] Will the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] be forced to form a coalition, or should we regard a coalition as a necessity? [Horn] There is no necessity for a coalition because we have an adequate majority, but we do want a coalition. We would like to form a coalition. [Gyuricza] At what price? [Horn] Not at any price, obviously. [passage omitted] [Gyuricza] Is it possible that you could be the object or the stake of the coalition talks? [Horn] I do not think so. Why should that be? [passage omitted] [Gyuricza] Before the elections you said you would not be short of coalition partners. What are you thinking of, or not thinking of, in addition to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]? [Horn] We also said that we are open about the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Well, Fidesz got far poorer results than they expected. [passage omitted] I naturally think there are a lot of valuable people there. We have asked the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] to get rid of its extremists. The election campaign showed that they have not managed to do this, or have not wanted to this. However, I do not think the KDNP would reject a coalition cooperation proposal if I offered it. [Gyuricza] You have said that your first journey will be to Bonn. Why? [Horn] On the one hand, because I consider Hungarian-German ties as being exceptionally important. On the other hand, I have personal links with the present German leaders -- including Chancellor Kohl and others -- and this will make it possible to conclude an agreement, or series of agreements, which would significantly ease the treatment of the acute and very serious illnesses of the Hungarian economy. [passage omitted] I am not planning to hand them an invoice. We are not talking about some kind of repayment of debts, which has not been completed yet. However, it has to be considered that our country is in a very serious situation and that Hungarian-German relations could ease these difficulties.
