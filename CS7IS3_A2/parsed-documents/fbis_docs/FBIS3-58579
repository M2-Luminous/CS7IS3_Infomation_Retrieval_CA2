Specifically, President Kliridhis stresses: The stance of these political parties makes his handling of policy more difficult and does not allow him to develop easily the policy he has in mind, especially in view of the expected acceptance of the confidence-building measures by the Turkish side and the beginning of talks. Political circles have characteristically said the message these parties have sent to the world creates a negative impression of the Greek Cypriot side's sincerity about the negotiations; and on the other hand, it gives the Turkish side material for propaganda. In light of the above, and despite the fact that he accepts the right of these parties to express their positions as they believe appropriate, President Kliridhis feels that their behavior makes it difficult for him to develop his policy on the issue of the confidence-building measures.
