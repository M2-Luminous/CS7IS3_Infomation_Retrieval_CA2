EAST-WEST MILITARY TIES: Launched Partnership for Peace, "an immediate and practical programme that will transform the relationship between NATO and participating states." Offers former Soviet bloc states and other "able and willing" countries cooperation in planning and joint exercises as well as crisis consultations. "Active participation in the Partnership for Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary process of the expansion of NATO." BOSNIA: "We reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of the United Nations Security Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9 August 1993, to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "In this context, we urge the UNPROFOR authorities to draw up urgently plans to ensure that the blocked rotation of the UNPROFOR contingent in Srebrenica can take place and to examine how the airport at Tuzla can be opened for humanitarian relief purposes." EUROPEAN DEFENSE IDENTITY: "The emergence of a European Security and Defence Identity will strengthen the European pillar of the alliance while reinforcing the transatlantic link and will enable the European Allies to take greater responsibility for their common security and defence." ASSETS SHARING: "We therefore stand ready to make collective assets of the alliance available, on the basis of consultations in the North Atlantic Council, for WEU (Western European Union) operations undertaken by the European Allies in pursuit of their Common Foreign and Security Policy." COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCES: Endorses a plan to create new "separable but not separate" multinational command units that could be detached from the main NATO structure for operations without U.S. participation if needed. The joint task forces could also be used for operations "with participating nations outside the alliance." NON-PROLIFERATION: Pledges to "intensify and expand" NATO efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which "constitute a threat to international security." Orders work on an overall policy framework "to consider how to reinforce ongoing prevention efforts and how to reduce the proliferation threat and protect against it."
