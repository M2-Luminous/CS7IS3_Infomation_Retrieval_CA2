These are the results of the public opinion poll carried out in February by Social Research Center of the National Academy of Armenia, among 600 citizens. Only 13 per cent of respondents are of the opinion that there is no need of entering the ruble zone, since Armenia introduced its own national currency -- dram. Moreover, the head of the Center Gevork Poghosian pointed out the fact, that only 4.5 per cent of Yerevan citizens believe in stability of dram. About the half -- 44.8 per cent -- are certain the national currency will devaluate, and 29 per cent think dram will finally yield to Russian ruble.
