His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Said led those who received President Salih upon his arrival in Salalah Civil Airport. [passage omitted] His excellency the Yemeni president made a statement to the press upon arrival in which he said: We are very happy to make this visit to the Sultanate of Oman to meet my dear brother His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id to discuss everything that concern our bilateral fraternal relations, which are eternal and warm relations based on amity, brotherly cooperation, mutual respect, and good-neighborliness. These relations are witnessing continued progress in a manner that serves and benefits our mutual interests. There are many subjects that will be discussed within the framework of continuous bilateral consultations, whether concerning developments in our country and the efforts made to contain the political crisis and safeguard Yemeni unity, or regarding regional and Arab issues and international developments that concern our two sisterly states or our Arab nation, foremost of which are the efforts to restore Arab solidarity. He added: We greatly appreciate the sincere fraternal efforts our brothers in Oman are making and the efforts of the Omani military team within the joint military committee. These efforts realized several good results, such as stopping the military deterioration in our country. We also appreciate the eagerness shown by the Omani brothers to contain the crisis and protect the march of unity and stability in our country based on the awareness that stability is something that concern all brothers and neighbors of Yemen, and that Yemeni unity is an important and vital factor for security, stability, and peace in the region. This unity is an element that consolidates our Arab nation, which is in need now, more than at any other time, of unity, solidarity, and a basis of joint interests for the Arabs. Oman has led the sisterly states that have supported and blessed the Yemeni unity. Probably, one of the positive elements realized by the unity was that it has made a solution to the border problem between Yemen and Oman possible. A border agreement was signed, and this agreement laid down a solid basis for developing fraternal bilateral relations to realize the joint aspirations of the two sisterly and neighborly peoples. The agreement demonstrated a model that can be followed in solving border problems and establishing strong relations between brothers and neighbors. We are confident that our Yemeni people, thanks to the support of their brothers, will be able, God willing, to overcome all the challenges posed by the crisis, in order to continue their march and work toward achieving their objectives of progress and development under the banner of unity, which is an umbrella of security and peace in our Yemeni homeland and the region.
