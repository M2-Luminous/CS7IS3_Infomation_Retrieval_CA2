A Government spokesman said Hong Kong would accept Chinese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) team leader Guo Fengmin's offer of expert discussions to pave the way for a full meeting of the JLG's airport committee. Britain has been pushing for such talks -- to resolve differences over land issues -- for several months. It also wants the airport committee to meet to discuss a new funding package for the project. Deputy British JLG team leader Alan Paul is expected to discuss the offer with his Chinese counterpart Hu Houcheng later this week. Mr. Guo said on Friday an airport committee session was now "inevitable" and that experts from both sides should "meet and exchange views to pave the way" for it. His comments constituted China's first official confirmation it wants to discuss the Government's recent fourth financial package for the Chek Lap Kok project and rail link, which proposes pumping more than $60 billion of public funding into the two schemes. "We agree with Mr. Guo's statement that a meeting of the airport committee should take place and we hope that this can be arranged as soon as possible to resolve outstanding issues on airport and airport railway funding," a Government spokesman said yesterday. "In the meantime we are, of course, willing to hold expert talks to help pave the way for what we hope will be an early agreement." Legislator and Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) members welcomed the news and hoped both sides could reach a comprehensive agreement on financial issues. "This is a good news," said ACC member Ho King-on. "The expert meeting may be able to narrow the differences between two sides." United Democrats legislator Chan Wai-yip also welcomed the possible resumption of talks, even though he expressed concern that the latest financial package might tax the Hong Kong Government's reserves. He said the Government needed to revise its estimates for revenue from 62 hectares of airport land sales, saying these should have been higher. He added that the amount should be enough to pay government equity and thereby eliminate the need to draw money from the reserve. But the legislator argued these issues would not seriously inhibit the talks, referring to them as "technical problems" only. Another ACC member, Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, urged both sides to treasure the new co-operative atmosphere. "If the British and Chinese really want to negotiate, they should make the best use of this opportunity before another major political dispute rises again in March -- when the Governor tables the second part of his political package in the Legislative Council," he said.
