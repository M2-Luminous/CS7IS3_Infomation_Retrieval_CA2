Master Sergeant Moussa Adamou of the Bonou Gendarmerie Brigade almost lost his life during the squabble. He was saved by his colleagues, who rescued him from the Fulanis. Here with the details is Isidore Zinsou: [Zinsou] Indeed, for a few days now there have been persistent rumors concering the movements of Fulani cattlemen and their cattle towards the pastures in Gnahui-Zume, in Bonou subprefecture in the Oueme District. We remember the incidents that took place last year during their crossing of the region, incidents that left bitter memories in the district. This time, it is during the end of year festivities that the Fulanis cattelmen settled in Ketou in the Oueme district. Informed of the situation, the Bonou Gendarmerie Brigade sent a four-member team to the locality on 3 January, along with two members of the Association for the Development of the Bonou Subprefecture. The presence of the team on the field has merely reactivated the aggressiveness of the Fulanis, who were armed with sophisticated weapons. The result of the clashes is four wounded gendarmes and a pair of handcuffs that were taken away by the Fulanis cattlemen. The gendarme master sergeant was wounded on his forehead and arms. As for the members of the team, they were all beaten up with clubs by the Fulanis. The gendarmes seized nine 12-caliber cartridges and a sophiscated French-manufactured gun. According to some of the region's inhabitants, the Fulani assailants -- some 30 Fulanis armed with clubs and guns -- stormed certain houses searching for gendarmes. The same sources said that the Fulanis were ready to fight back any attack from the people of Bonou. It should be recalled that such incidents between the people of Oueme Valley and Fulani cattlemen are frequent every year in December. Last year, several people were killed in similar incidents. Let us simply wish for calm to return to the region.
