Illegal producers of cassettes, records, or computer programs can now be fined or even receive prison sentences. Just last year, out of a total of 65 million records and cassettes sold on the market, as many as 90 percent were pirate recordings. [passage omitted] Illegally produced cassettes of Polish music cost 20,000 to 30,000 zloty. Cassettes with foreign music cost 60,000 zloty. Beginning today, all records and cassettes will have to bear special holograms, and they will cost two to three times more than before. [passage omitted] World record producers made over 30 billion dollars in profits last year. In Poland, such profits amounted only to 66 million [currency not specified]. The reason for such small profits was the activity of illegal producers. Record company profits were reduced even further by the existence of compact disc libraries, as records borrowed from the library could be rerecorded on cassettes. [passage omitted] The authors of literary or musical works, or their inheritors, will obtain royalties for 50 years, as opposed to the 25 years envisaged by the law until now. Offenders who break the copyright law--for example, by illegally producing and copying books, records, cassettes, or computer programs--may be punished with high fines or even sentenced to prison for up to five years.
