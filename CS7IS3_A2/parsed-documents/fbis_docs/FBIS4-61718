We have just received a recorded report by our correspondent Venediktov at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin Wall in the Aleksandrovskiy Gardens. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is answering questions from journalists. [Begin recording] [Yeltsin] In 1945, Russia, as a country, the former Soviet Union, did indeed save Europe and the world from the plague of brownshirts, and it is hard to imagine what would have happened had it not done so. The whole world should therefore bow its head first of all before our Russian soldiers, officers, commanders, that is, before those who took part in the Great Patriotic War, should honor the memory of those who perished and express gratitude to those who are alive. But now is a new stage, a stage of partnership between our previously conflicting countries, especially Russia and the United States of America. Now partnership is of course introducing an entirely different stage. Now there is no confrontation as such. But nor must we lose our vigilance. Therefore, while we are gradually lowering the threshold of armaments and armed forces, nevertheless we will constantly keep it in parity with the United States, with NATO, and so on. At the same time, of course, we will cooperate more, perhaps carrying out joint exercises, although they have not been carried out before, to make our partnership really that of comrades at arms [druzhestvenno-boyevoy]. I think that there are more guarantees of peace now than ever before, all the more so since this anniversary -- the 49th -- is being marked precisely at a time when the political situation in Russia is becoming stabilized, when there are grounds for calm, when there are grounds for different parties and factions sitting down at the negotiation table together to discuss questions and to hold a dialogue. It is the year when, as you know, the Social Accord Treaty was signed. I think it will give Russia a great deal, and not just Russia but the whole world, too. I am sure that Russia will still help the West. That will come. [Unidentified voice: "If God is willing"] [Yeltsin] If God is willing, yes indeed, since the hopes -- and belief and hope are the most important things -- cherished by every soldier during the war -- the belief, the belief namely in victory, was the decisive factor which brought about 9 May 1945. I think that Muscovites were very glad, specially those who participated in the Great Patriotic War, that the glorious museum on Poklonnaya Gora, which we will visit today, was finished in time. It is, of course, a unique building. It is truly a tribute to the memory of all those who took part, to all those who did not live to see this day. [Unidentified voice] Thank you to the press. We'll meet on Poklonnaya Gora [words indistinct]. Thank you Boris Nikolayevich. [end recording]
