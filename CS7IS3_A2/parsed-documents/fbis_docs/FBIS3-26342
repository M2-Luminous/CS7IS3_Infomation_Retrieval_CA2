Some 13 counties will take part in the first stage, according to official sources. And a restructured social security system will be set up for farmers. The pilot scheme will make the selected county administrations responsible for reforming the ways the State property rights are used. It is hoped the project will eventually extend to the more than 2,000 counties in China, said the official from the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System (SCRES). "Enterprises run by local authorities will be required to go further than large and medium-sized State firm so far have in the opening up of property rights," the official said. A working committee will be established to guide the reform of the pilot project counties. It will consist of SCRES and provincial and prefecture government officials. If the county reforms are successful, they will provide a working model for the larger and more intractable rural and urban administrations. Restrictions on the transfer of ownership will have to be abolished by the pilot counties. And State, collective and private enterprises will be encouraged to work together to develop industry and commerce in the pilot areas. The counties to be chosen all have economic reform experience. The working committee overseeing the project will provide specialist advice and help solve problems emerging from the local reforms. But local leaders will have to provide much of the impetus themselves, the commission said. The project's success will depend upon sound administration and economic development across the pilot areas. And the different counties will have to map out their own reform plans in line with local conditions and not blindly imitate others. About 350 counties have previously been chosen by provincial governments across the country to take part in pilot reforms. There are about 2,100 counties in China and one third of them are seen as "poverty counties".
