It is too bizarre a fact, especially for elderly people. This is why it will not be taken seriously yet for a long time. But still, this is a fact. The division of the two sovereign states has been made and cannot be undone. It dealt a hard blow primarily to the economy of the former Soviet Union. Enterprises tightly linked with each other started to lose their ground. The absence of a single center with its almighty State Planning Committee, the disruption of links to the quick, and chaos in settlements of accounts led to the present condition. What next? In eastern Ukraine, southern Russia, and the border-adjacent regions, attempts are being undertaken to somehow resuscitate economic relations based on the current situation in both countries. The press has already reported that border area leaders met in Belgorod and Kharkov to lay the groundwork for closer financial and economic cooperation. A similar meeting took place last week in Donetsk. It was held behind closed doors, and at a press conference held on 27 May, its participants were not too talkative, asking the journalists for questions without making any introduction. This is only natural -- everything is still in a "suspended condition" of preparations, initial work, etc. Besides, an unclear political situation at either side of the border offers no strong grounds to hope for success of the planned undertaking. However, there is a movement forward. A council of border area leaders was organized, and an agreement is in the works between Ukrainian and Russian Governments on cooperation among border areas. The status of those oblasts and specific routing of capital circulation is being determined. The gist of the responses from the press conference participants is that the main purpose of this unconventional bilateral body is to reduce, if not eliminate, border and customs barriers and to make cooperation on the border more profitable, efficient, and to improve the living standards of Russian and Ukrainian people. Of course, the intentions are good. But will they become a reality? This will depend on decisions made on the government level. Incidentally, the meeting was attended by representatives of Russian and Ukrainian presidents and governments. The following oblasts were represented: Donetsk, Lugansk, Sumy, and Kharkov (the delegation from Chernigov Oblast did not arrive). The Russian side was represented by Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Rostov, and Kursk Oblasts. At the press conference, it was particularly stressed that the entire work of the border oblast leaders' council is intended to solve purely economic and humanitarian issues, but not political ones. For example, the association for economic cooperation "Russian-Ukrainian Union" is being established. Work is being conducted on the implementation of Leonid Kravchuk's edict on free education for Ukrainian and Russian students at colleges and universities located in the border areas. In other words, the process has gotten off to a good start. The most important thing is that it is peaceful, based on mutual understanding, and that it pursues good intentions. The next meeting, or to be more precise, the meeting of the council, is scheduled for September in Rostov-on-Don.
