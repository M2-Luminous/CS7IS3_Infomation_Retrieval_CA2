There is no doubt that you will always find in society those who try to win political prestige by kindling hostility. There will be irresponsible politicians in the Federal Assembly too, and there will be such on the streets and squares. It is essential to seek civil accord by all possible means which exist in society. There have been enough attempts to "rock the boat." Otherwise the future of Russia, the future of our people, will be jeopardized. Unless we try to halt political emotions now, we are threatened with a repetition of the sorry and tragic experience of Georgia and Tajikistan, where blood is now being shed. Preventing bloodshed -- that is the main aim of the conclusion of civil accord. It is finally time our society realized and considered what happened 3 and 4 October. Those to blame for those events, those who called for violence, are now acting almost as judges. God forbid that an inversion should take place in public awareness whereby the innocent are called the guilty and the guilty avoid trial. That is dangerous for the moral climate of society. The guilty must be punished individually, they cannot be allowed to turn into defenders of justice. There is a kind of dialectic under way -- the combination of appeals for peace and accord on the one hand and on the other the refusal to accept under the slogan of accord those who want to live in a normal society, a society of civil accord.
