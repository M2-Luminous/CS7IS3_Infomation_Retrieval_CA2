De Leon said he would not allow the transportation sector to go on strike and that he would take legal measures, including intervention. A truck strike could lead to a lack of fuel and losses for the industrial and commercial sectors, but Energy Minister Jose Luis Terron has guaranteed gasoline and diesel supplies. Miguel Luna, president of the National Transportation Coordinating Board, reiterated today that the decision to stage a strike on Tuesday remains firm if the government does not find a solution to the sector's demands. Luna has not revealed the amount of fare increase they are demanding for cement and fuel transportation, but he reiterated that the decision to strike is firm.
