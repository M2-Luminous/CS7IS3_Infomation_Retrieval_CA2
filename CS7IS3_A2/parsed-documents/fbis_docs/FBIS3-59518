Mr. Waldegrave was speaking at the Chemical Industries Association annual dinner in London. Mr. Waldegrave announced that he was writing to over 900 key people in industry and the Research base. He said: "These people represent the first step in recruiting a pool of several thousand top technical and market experts who will together work to identify the priority markets and technologies of the future." Those experts identified by a process of co-nomination and invited to contribute to this important programme, will be asked to participate in workshops and share their views on markets and technologies. This process will start in Spring 1994 with final reports due to emerge early in 1995. Mr. Waldegrave went on to say: "The main aim of Technology Foresight - a key initiative announced in the White Paper `Realising our Potential; a strategy for Science, Engineering and Technology'- is to increase wealth creation and improve the quality of life through a close partnership between scientists, industry and government. As a result we hope scientists and industrialists will come together to forge new networks and contacts, to identify market trends and technological opportunities, from which we will all benefit." Mr. Waldegrave concluded: "Full involvement by scientists and industry will be crucial in making Technology Foresight a success." Notes to Editors 1. Co-nomination is the technique being used to identify the experts. It has been used successfully in the past to identify key, active researchers in particular scientific and technical fields. Co-nomination relies on individual experts identifying others whom they regard as experts. They are in turn asked for their own nominations in an iterative approach. Feedback from the OST [Office of Science and Technology] consultative seminars emphasises that equal weight needs to be placed on market needs (market pull) and technological opportunities (technology push). The co-nomination technique is attempting to identify people with knowledge about markets as well as technologies. Every effort will also be made to identify people working in Small or Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) and encourage them to participate in Technology Foresight. If the co-nomination process does not yield enough people in these groups we will consider alternative methods to ensure that they are adequately represented. The co-nomination process will also encourage respondents to identify `maverick' thinkers, as these may be particularly useful in the Technology Foresight programme. Participants are asked to categorise their expertise in one of 19 areas, some market based, others technology based. The final decision on how to divide the work into expert panel sectors has yet to be taken by the Foresight steering group. 2.The consultation phase of the Foresight programme is drawing to a close with the last `Focus on Foresight' seminar being held at the University of Birmingham on 23 November 1993. 3.Media copies of the questionnaire and further information on the co-nomination process and the Technology Foresight programme are available from the OPSS press office.
