Chien said it was South African, not Lesotho's, news media which first reported that the southern African country has decided to sever its diplomatic ties with the ROC. "We have ordered our embassy in South Africa to check the source of the report," Chien said. The South African Broadcasting Corporation reported Thursday that Lesotho has becided to cut its diplomatic ties with the ROC because two ROC citizens had attempted to bribe two Lesotho cabinet ministers. "The report was unfounded," Chien noted. "We extended financial aid to Lesotho last year when the nation was hard hit by drought," Chien explained. "Such aid should not be interpreted as bribe," he added.
