[Mubarak] It is not really a visit. It is a meeting with my brother and in the same country. I mean when I move from Cairo to Surt or Tubruq I consider myself moving in the same country. In fact I think that the meeting with the brother Colonel is something that will make both peoples happy because we are consulting each other, exchanging views, investigating any problems and helping development in both countries. All these things are for the benefit of the peoples. Our visits are always valuable working visits. The meetings with the brother Colonel are always for exchanging political views, exchanging economic views or for discussing projects for the benefit of both countries. [Correspondent] Does the presence of some ministers with you here in Libya have some definite significance. [Mubarak] When I come to Libya do you want me to come without ministers? Everyone of them has work here because there are existing links. For instance, there are agreements to establish a railway link across Libya to Egypt. There are operational joint companies. There are many things and a lot of work between us and Libya. [Correspondent] Are there any new developments in the Arab and international arenas which you are going to discuss today. [Mubarak] Naturally we will talk about all the problems in the Arab arena. We will talk about Yemen, perhaps we will talk about Somalia. We will talk about everything that concerns the Arab World because it concerns us. [Correspondent] What is President Mubarak's comment on the new developments of the so-called Lockerbie case, particularly the developments... [Mubarak] Let us not talk about Lockerbie on TV. Let me talk about such things with the brother Colonel. [Correspondent] But there are new developments which exonerate the Libyan citizens. [Mubarak] I do not want to talk about this issue now. Let me talk about this with the brother Colonel. In the media you always publish something and then he comes up with a reply and we get into bickering. Leave us alone. With the brother Colonel I will discuss these issues. [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. president.
