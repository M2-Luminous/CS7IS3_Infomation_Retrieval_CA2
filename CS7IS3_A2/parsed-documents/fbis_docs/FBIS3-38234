He noted that the Czech Republic had a normal political system without any ethnic problems. The pace and dynamism of privatisation is more important than the current share -- about 60 percent of privatised companies in the Czech Republic's total production, Klaus said, adding that the share of the private sector was nil in the 1980's.
