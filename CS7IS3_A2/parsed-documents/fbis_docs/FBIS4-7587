One cannot say that Magureanu's efforts in this respect are groundless, if we think of the immediate past and the overall context of suspicion in which the SRI was created and is now carrying out its activity. Therefore, on a scale of priorities, the problem of its public image is the SRI's number one problem, as Magureanu confirmed, in a way, at his latest news conference. "I can assure you that there has been a positive change in the image of our institution after the re-election of its director and the confirmation vote in Parliament. First of all, the attacks against the SRI, according to the old formula that it was the successor of the old Securitate, have ceased, if not totally, at least to a large extent. Moreover, Magureanu believes that the SRI's image, as reflected in the national mass media, will further improve in the coming months. "I would like to assure you that we have done and will continue to do all we can to make this image more credible and acceptable to the Romanian public." Tackling the subject of changes made in the territorial and central leaderships, Magureanu said that "this is the third stage of the changes." The first took place at the time of the SRI's creation, when "we took over only a third of the old Securitate." The second stage was completed in 1991, when some 25-30 percent of the SRI personnel was laid off, since their services were no longer needed. The third stage began after the vote in Parliament, that is after Magureanu's confirmation as SRI director. "We are not making any purges. It is just that 25 percent of the territorial and central command structures have been replaced." Asked why General Gheorghe Diaconescu, the former counterintelligence chief, was dismissed, Magureanu tersely said that he was dismissed "mainly for professional reasons," without giving any concrete details. Similarly, Magureanu denied the existence of compromising files about himself. "If anyone has any proof against me, he should not hesitate to bring it up. I am keenly waiting to see any files put together against me." Regarding the case of General Cristea [Major General Dumitru Cristea, the rector of the Higher Institute for Information Studies and deputy SRI director, accused of having an affair with a former female student], the SRI director said: "I took no decision in connection with General Cristea's departure from our structures." Calling him "a friend and colleague," Magureanu said the following in connection with the allegations of immorality against his deputy: "It may all be nothing but someone's concoction against someone else." Asked about the Pancea case [Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, former secretary of the Supreme Defense Council, accused of espionage], the SRI head said that "there is no proof that General Pancea has worked against Romania during his posting abroad." Similarly, the SRI has no proof that General Pancea would have spied for the KGB. Referring to certain documents and articles in the magazine ROMANIA MARE, Magureanu said that "someone is fabricating lots of material in our name. After the situation got out of control, everybody nonchalantly put the blame on the SRI. This is not true. We will make public the names of the people who leaked information and the way that the information reached the press, since their deeds harmed our institution." However, some documents are indicative of "yet unidentified leaks," which require further SRI internal investigations. Answering the representative of Russian Television, Magureanu said that the KGB has pursued intensive activity in Romania by also coopting several politicians, which was also confirmed during his visit to Moscow. He said that these people are still under the scrutiny of the SRI. In Magureanu's opinion, two of the dangers threatening Romania are the mafia-type structures operating in Russia and the states that used to make up the Soviet Union (structures which are involved in organized crime) and the Italian Mafia, which is laundering dirty money in Romania.
