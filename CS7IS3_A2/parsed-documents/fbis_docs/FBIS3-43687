Blaise Compaore, who traced the background of the Dakar meeting which led to the devaluation of the CFA franc, commented on the consequences of this measure on Burkina Faso. Here is President Compaore, speaking to Rock Patrice Ouedraogo. [Begin recording] It is true that generally speaking the devaluation will affect our debt. We will certainly have a bigger debt to pay. It will affect household spending, particularly certain goods which are consumed domestically but which used to be imported and, surely, there will be the problem of revamping the economy. But, generally speaking, with a number of backup measures geared toward reducing debt, preserving the industrial atmosphere, protecting the consumption of essential commodities, and also with the support of the international community in financing our investments and programs and in some employment generating sectors, we believe all this will restore a measure of credibility to our country. This will particularly guarantee a higher national production and put us in better position to export our products by, naturally, boosting agricultural output. And, of course, there will definitely be increased external investments. Domestic savings was also one area identified as one that should offer more support to our economies. In short, therefore, with all these measures, coupled with a system of safeguarding what I earlier referred to as the industrial atmosphere, we hope that our economies will be put in a better position to face international competition and sustain the welfare of our people.
