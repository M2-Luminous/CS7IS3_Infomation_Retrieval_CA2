The media pointed out that "China fever" is raging again in West European countries. The PRC has experienced some twists and turns in its relations with some West European countries in the 40-odd years following its founding, though on the whole bilateral relations with Western Europe have developed continuously. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in visits between Chinese and West European state leaders, key officials, and entrepreneurs, and traditional friendly cooperation is being restored and developed, especially in trade and economic cooperation, where the trend has been one of accelerated development. Both Chinese and West European leaders and entrepreneurs see many favorable conditions for developing bilateral relations and expanding economic cooperation and trade. First, China and Western Europe share the same or similar views on many key international issues and have a good basis for cooperation. China has consistently supported the integration, cooperation, and development of West European countries, which have supported China's reform and opening up and its effort to integrate its economy with the world economy. In mid-March this year, the GATT China Working Unit held its 16th meeting in Geneva to continue scrutinizing the issue of restoring China's GATT signatory status. EC representatives reiterated that they want to conclude the work of the unit swiftly so that China can resume its GATT's signatory status as soon as possible. French Prime Minister Balladur said during his talks with the Chinese premier that France supported the restoration of China's signatory status and allowing China to be a founding member of the World Trade Organization. China has much common ground with West European countries in safeguarding world peace and promoting world economic development, which is a good basis for developing bilateral ties and expanding trade ties and cooperation. Second, there is strong complementary economic and trade cooperation between China and West European countries. West European countries are stronger in capital, technology, and equipment, while China, in its pursuit of modernization, requires huge amounts of capital, technology, and equipment and is a potentially enormous market. The achievements scored by Germany's Chancellor Kohl during his China visit in mid-November last year have caught the attention of West European political and business sectors. During Kohl's visit, China and Germany signed 7 billion German marks of contracts and letters of intent in a wide range of sectors such as steel, transport, energy, chemicals, machinery, electronics, telecommunications, and environmental protection; over 3 billion marks were contracts. French industry and the foreign trade ministry officially unveiled this February "France's new Asia policy," its general spirit "firmly shifting toward Asia," and its direction of expansion being the East Asian and South East Asian counties, with China as its main target. Prime Minister Balladur said in talks with Premier Li Peng that there was great room for further cooperation between France and China. Longuet, the French minister of posts, telecommunications, and foreign trade, will later head a delegation visiting China to promote trade ties and economic cooperation with China. Statistics from Finnish customs show that trade with China jumped from 341 million markkas in 1992 to 2.935 markkas in 1993, with China Finland's largest trading partner among the developing countries. Finland has a great deal of experience in forestry, logging, and environmental protection. There are many opportunities for cooperation in these areas. Third, China has great potential for trade and economic cooperation with West European countries. Last year, Sino-Japanese trade hit $37.8 billion, 32 times the trade value recorded in 1972 when the two countries normalized their relations. Up to last September, Japan had invested $5.17 billion, one-third after 1992. Sino-U.S. trade last year amounted to $27.65 billion, 10.3 times the amount in 1979 when China established diplomatic relations with the United States. By the end of last year, the United States had begun 12,000 investment projects in China, worth $10.6 billion in agreed capital investment. Over 6,700 of these projects, commanding $6.8 billion in agreed capital investment, started only last year. Despite the high volume, there is still much room for growth in trade between China and Japan and the United States. The markets, investments, and export scale of the 12 EC nations greatly exceed that of the United States and Japan. China's trade with the EC in the first quarter of this year already exceeds its trade with the United States. The EC has become China's third largest trading partner. The EC has very great potential for trade and economic cooperation with China. There are broad prospects for trade and economic cooperation between China and West European countries. Cotti, chief of the Swiss Foreign Affairs Department, said at the annual convention of the Swiss-China Economic Society in Zurich this February that China's economy had become an important part of the world economy, "Chinese shareholders" were on the move, and the rapid rise of China's economy provided "enormous development opportunities for Swiss business." When talking with Chinese premier, Finnish Prime Minister Aho said that since economic growth in Europe is slow, Finland would like to strengthen economic cooperation with China. Equal, complementary, and mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade between China and the West European countries helps economic and trade development in both China and the West European countries, but also global peace, stability, and development.
