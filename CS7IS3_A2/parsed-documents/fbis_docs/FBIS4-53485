The ministry thus denied some reports that the government was studying the possibility of allowing CNN programs to be broadcast all day in Korea through domestic cable TV. So Chong-hwan, director-general of the ministry's broadcast bureau, said the issue will not be discussed any longer as the present laws do not allow all-day broadcast. "It is a matter to be discussed only after domestic cable TV takes root," said suh, referring to a government decision adopted at a meeting of officials from the Economic Planning Board and other government agencies related with trade talks with the United States on May 11. He stressed that all-day relaying of CNN broadcast cannot be permitted under any circumstances as "it is feared to cause serious cultural problems. TV viewers will be made to understand international issues through American points of view. The broadcast, if permitted, will adversely affect the development of the domestic cable TV," he said.
