The philosopher's stone, never found throughout history, is still nonexistent as we and the world stand on the threshold of the 21st century. The sanctions, however, do not mean that there are no means for a domestic struggle against its economic and social effects on the people and the nation, by focusing on agricultural production to provide the people's power and organize ration cards to put Iraq's house in order despite the political and economic conditions imposed on Iraq. [This could be done by] restoring life to the destroyed laboratories and factories and relying on the private commercial sector, especially to get the wheels of society moving for citizens as far as possible, if not to the point of providing all the necessities for a dignified life for citizens and achieving total comfort for the people in their present circumstances. All the measures and actions, as is well known, were accompanied by other measures and resolutions some of which have continued for the past few years, some of which were amended, with still others subsequently abandoned for various reasons. We do not want to keep talking about matters that have become facts of life for the people, because it is all already well known. But we do just want to allude to the fact that the sanctions have been used, by and large, as a peg upon which all the problems that existed before the sanctions have been hung, and these problems have thus been aggravated. We point this out, though some of us have fallen into the sanctions trap. Its resolutions have come on the basis of the interpretation and the proposition used by those directly responsible, reaching its higher authority in the office, institution, and ministry, mistakenly, not well studied, and in constant need of balance. We all know about the prices of domestic products, which have risen several times higher than their imported counterparts, before they were banned, even though the purpose was completely otherwise. Arab and non-Arab visitors paying in dollars at big hotels and other places, the sale of productive factories and state farms before the sanctions themselves, to individuals and the private sector, and the entry of ministries and institutions into dollar purchases from the market in one day, changed the distribution of the process among these parties waiting for days, weeks, and months, freeing large, well-known families and major merchants to speculate in dollars. This went on until price rises continued in line with dollar rates, then kept rising despite drops in the rate of the dollar at certain times, resulting in what might be described as the dinar's secession from the dollar. The withdrawal of the government from dollar-buying operations was an appropriate decision. Even so, the process remained the province of major merchants and rich and merchant families, who ruled by the dollar in the name of breaking the economic sanctions. Is the Central Bank capable of intervening to regulate dollar rates? Is it possible for the government to establish a large financial institution, under current conditions, to buy dollars when needed and maintain the market price? Perhaps the Central Bank has a limited opportunity to intervene by way of foreign exchange. However, the question of a financial institution at present is beyond the government's powers, because of the sanctions, the ban on exporting oil, and Iraq's frozen assets abroad. Achieving this now is not possible, though, unless we were to rely on domestic lending from private banks, industrialists, and merchants in exchange for certain concessions, guarantees, and facilities. The conversion of governmental industrial companies into joint stock cement and brick companies played a part in driving up the price of the dollar. The citizens' interest in buying shares seemed to be greater than their interest in supplying goods to market, and this, too, sent prices up. The people--non-merchants--were surprised at what the media was saying about purchasing dollars in the long term without prior assessment of the harmful effects of this kind of media presentation. There are possible solutions which, in my view, must be mentioned in this article. In brief: reviewing the distribution outlets for goods to citizens; a ban on hoarding and realizing profits based on hoarding; and enacting punishment as severe as execution for that, as happens in capitalistic America itself, and other countries. And on top of that, the cancellation of agents' security, as occurs with cigarettes, and subjecting domestic production to ration cards on the basis of "taking turns" for the regions. This would influence prices and reassure citizens that they can get batteries, tires, cloth, leather products, oils, and other goods and commodities at one time or another during the year. What might really cause surprise on this subject is the appearance of what might be called the secret purchase of a certain commodity in a company or institution, and the purchase of rebate receipts for cement, for example, on the part of some people afflicted with monopoly fever. Turning the central markets and social cooperatives into a mixed sector may seem to be an acceptable idea because it will give citizens a better chance to obtain various goods and commodities at prices that, whatever they were, would still be far below market prices.
