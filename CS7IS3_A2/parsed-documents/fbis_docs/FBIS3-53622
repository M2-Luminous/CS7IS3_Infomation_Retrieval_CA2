According to the memorandum, mutual benefits have been identified in such fields as heavy and light industry, mining, agriculture, rural and urban planning, petroleum and oil products, pharmaceuticals, medicine, telecommunications and education. Proposed are a whole set of possible initiatives through mutual investments, joint ventures, development projects, utilizing the capabilities of expertise, management skills, professional training and courses, holding seminars, conferences and exhibitions. During the holding of the second joint commission Wednesday and Thursday, Iranian and Irish officials expressed their satisfation with the ever-growing and deepending trend of relations that was attributed to the atmosphere of understanding developed between the two countries. To take advantage of the opportunities, both sides agreed to increase the exchange of information and contacts to acquaint themselves with each other's markets and expert industries and to maximize the potential offered. Proposals went as far as encouraging economic and trade enterprises to embark on joint activities for exports to third markets, such as to the newly-independent republics of Europe and Central Asia. Ireland itself has a population of only 3.5 million, but it has a projected GDP growth of 3 percent this year, higher than most countries in the European Union, of which it is a member. The major development in economic relations last year was in the reopening of Iran's beef market to Irish exporters, which has the potential of being the second largest after Britain. The move has the potential of creating a trade imbalance in Dublin's favor, but both sides recognized the need to correct this to expand the volume of business between the two countries. To this end, Irish officials welcomed the desire for Iranian enterprises to have an active presence in the Irish market and committed to help arrange `Iran weeks' and exclusive trade fairs to promote exports to Ireland. Dublin further agreed to consider favorably oil imports from Iran to meet its considerable needs, while the Iranian side expressed its readiness for cooperation in refining and jont investment for the construction of refineries.
