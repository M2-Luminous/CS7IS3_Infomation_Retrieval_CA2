FR940916-0-00070 FR940916-0-00018 (i) Immediately following a takeoff run of at least 5 minutes, each power source must simulate a failure, in turn, and apply the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-second OEI power to the remaining affected drive system power inputs for not less than 30 seconds, followed by application of the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 2-minute OEI power for not less than 2 minutes. At least one run sequence must be conducted from a simulated ``flight idle'' condition. When conducted on a bench test, the test sequence must be conducted following stabilization at takeoff power. (ii) For the purpose of this paragraph, an affected power input includes all parts of the rotor drive system which can be adversely affected by the application of higher or asymmetric torque and speed prescribed by the test. (iii) This test may be conducted on a representative bench test facility when engine limitations either preclude repeated use of this power or would result in premature engine removal during the test. The loads, the vibration frequency, and the methods of application to the affected rotor drive system components must be representative of rotorcraft conditions. Test components must be those used to show compliance with the remainder of this section. * * * * * 3. Section 27.1143 is amended by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: §27.1143 Engine controls. * * * * * (e) For rotorcraft to be certificated for a 30-second OEI power rating, a means must be provided to automatically activate and control the 30-second OEI power and prevent any engine from exceeding the installed engine limits associated with the 30-second OEI power rating approved for the rotorcraft. 4. Section 27.1305 is amended by adding paragraphs (t) and (u) to read as follows: §27.1305 Powerplant instruments. * * * * * (t) For rotorcraft for which a 30-second/2-minute OEI power rating is requested, a means must be provided to alert the pilot when the engine is at the 30-second and the 2-minute OEI power levels, when the event begins, and when the time interval expires. (u) For each turbine engine utilizing 30-second/2-minute OEI power, a device or system must be provided for use by ground personnel which_ (1) Automatically records each usage and duration of power at the 30-second and 2-minute OEI levels; (2) Permits retrieval of the recorded data; (3) Can be reset only by ground maintenance personnel; and (4) Has a means to verify proper operation of the system or device. 5. Section 27.1521 is amended by adding paragraphs (j) and (k) to read as follows: §27.1521 Powerplant limitations. * * * * * (j) Rated 30-second OEI power operation. Rated 30-second OEI power is permitted only on multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft, also certificated for the use of rated 2-minute OEI power, and can only be used for continued operation of the remaining engine(s) after a failure or precautionary shutdown of an engine. It must be shown that following application of 30-second OEI power, any damage will be readily detectable by the applicable inspections and other related procedures furnished in accordance with Section A27.4 of Appendix A of this part and Section A33.4 of Appendix A of part 33. The use of 30-second OEI power must be limited to not more than 30 seconds for any period in which that power is used, and by_ (1) The maximum rotational speed, which may not be greater than_ (i) The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or (ii) The maximum value demonstrated during the type tests; (2) The maximum allowable gas temperature; and (3) The maximum allowable torque. (k) Rated 2-minute OEI power operation. Rated 2-minute OEI power is permitted only on multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft, also certificated for the use of rated 30-second OEI power, and can only be used for continued operation of the remaining engine(s) after a failure or precautionary shutdown of an engine. It must be shown that following application of 2-minute OEI power, any damage will be readily detectable by the applicable inspections and other related procedures furnished in accordance with Section A27.4 of Appendix A of this part and Section A33.4 of Appendix A of part 33. The use of 2-minute OEI power must be limited to not more than 2 minutes for any period in which that power is used, and by_ (1) The maximum rotational speed, which may not be greater than_ (i) The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or (ii) The maximum value demonstrated during the type tests; (2) The maximum allowable gas temperature; and (3) The maximum allowable torque. 6. Section 27.1549 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: §27.1549 Powerplant instruments. * * * * * (e) Each OEI limit or approved operating range must be marked to be clearly differentiated from the markings of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section except that no marking is normally required for the 30-second OEI limit.
