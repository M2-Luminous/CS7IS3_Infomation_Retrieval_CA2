This was the aim stressed by the all-Army discipline inspection work meeting which was held yesterday. With the approval of the CPC Central Military Commission, the General Political Department and the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Central Military Commission decided to call the all-Army discipline inspection work meeting when the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was being held. According to the instructions given by leaders of the CPC Central Military Commission, this meeting was mainly to analyze and sum up the situation and experience of the Army in implementing, in particular, the work plans of the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Military Commission on combating corruption and encouraging clean administration and to discuss and draw up a plan for strengthening the work of building party discipline and clean administration in the Army. Xu Huizi, deputy chief of general staff and deputy secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Military Commission, presided over the meeting, and Zhou Ziyu, deputy director of the General Political Department and secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Central Military Commission, delivered a report entitled "Conscientiously Implementing the Guidelines Laid by the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Doing Well the Building of Party Discipline and Clean Administration in an In-Depth and Lasting Manner." In the report, Zhou Ziyu reviewed the greater achievements scored by the whole Army in the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean administration in 1993. After that, he said: If we take measures step by step, we will have clearer objectives, more appropriate demands, and more concrete measures, which help promote the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean administration step by step. The general response is good. Regarding the key tasks of planning the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean administration in the Army in 1994, the report pointed out: It is necessary to understand and grasp the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean administration in the Army from the high plane of the overall situation of state and army building, and the work must be subordinate to and serve the overall situation of state and army building. Leading cadres must take the lead in setting an example to their subordinates in the building of clean administration, and this is a demand which can never be altered. However, as far as self-discipline is concerned, efforts must be made to constantly add more concrete details to it and substantiate it in light of new conditions. We must continue to implement, in a conscientious manner, the five stipulations laid down by the central authorities last year on leading cadres' honesty and self-discipline. The Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection put forward and restated the five stipulations, and leading army cadres must carry out them in an exemplary manner. An important mark to profoundly combat corruption and encourage clean administration is to accomplish the work of investigating and handling cases. Party committees at all levels must enhance their leadership of handling cases, and discipline and law enforcement departments must handle cases in an impartial manner. We must buttress up and maintain mass enthusiasm for fighting against negative and corrupt phenomena and, at the same time, teach and guide party members and the masses to properly exercise their democratic rights and to present problems to party organizations in a down-to-earth manner. Regarding the five outstanding issues of ideology and work style mentioned by the CPC Central Military Commission in the decision of enhancing the building of clean administration, we must keep devoting every effort to solving them and to consolidating our achievements and scoring greater success. As stressed by the report, as far as the work of discipline inspection in the Army is concerned, we still have a very important task, that is, we must maintain our party's political discipline and ensure implementation and enforcement of the party line, principles, and policies as well as the decisions, instructions, and orders made by the CPC Central Military Commission. Party committees and party commissions for discipline inspection at all levels must teach and guide party members and cadres to uphold the principle of democratic centralism to conscientiously subordinate the whole party to the CPC Central Committee and to maintain a high degree of unity with the CPC Central Military Commission. When various reform measures adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Military Commission are introduced, we must conscientiously study and grasp their essence, analyze and predict problems which may arise, and set relevant demands of discipline on party members to guide their conduct. We must inspect the situation of implementing relevant reform measures taken by the CPC Central Committee and of the CPC Central Military Commission and resolutely redress and seriously handle misconduct which severely violates political and organizational disciplines, such as not implementing orders, not enforcing bans, or each going his own way. The report called for stronger leadership and a down- to-earth work style to ensure implementation of the tasks of combating corruption and encouraging clean administration. To carry out the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean administration in an in-depth and lasting manner, we must pay attention to education and take precautions against corruption, which is the way to get at the root of the problem. To do a good job in studies and education, the most essential thing is to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm party members' and cadres' minds, to foster a correct outlook on life and on value, to lay a solid ideological foundation against corruption and degeneration, and to enhance our capability of resisting the corrosive influence of money worship, radical individualism, and decadent life-style. All units and departments must proceed from reality and take such forms as sending teams for investigation to strengthen supervision and inspection. Units and departments at each level must be accountable to their immediate superiors. Supervision and inspection must be linked to cadre assessment, and whether or not a cadre is honest should be used as an important yardstick for promoting him. Under the unified leadership of party committees, all departments of leading organs must conscientiously bear responsibility for the task of combating corruption and encouraging clean administration in accordance with the principle that those who are in charge should be responsible for it, thus ensuring fulfillment of the task in their own departments and affiliated organizations. Members of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection coming from the Army, members of the CPC Central Military Commission, secretaries of commissions for discipline inspection of various major units and of the Armed Police Headquarters, and leading comrades of discipline inspection departments attended the meeting.
