In a statement from a two-day HZDS conference which ended today, the HZDS urged the government to halt dismissals of state functionaries for political reasons. HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar delivered a closing speech to the conference, but journalists were not briefed about its details. At a press conference earlier in the day, Meciar hinted his speech would analyze the situation in Slovakia since the June 1992 parliamentary election to date. He said that shortcomings which appeared in HZDS activities in that period were due to peoples' failures but also discrepancies in the system. Meciar said that the HZDS had approved a positive manifesto as a basis for a future government programme, and elected leading officials who would implement it. The HZDS conference approved new statutes whose wording brings the movement's activity closer to that of a political party.
