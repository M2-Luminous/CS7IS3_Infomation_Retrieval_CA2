At the same time, Ernesto Perez [Balladares], PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party] candidate, continues to lead the national voters preference poll with a 13.1 percent margin. The third CELA "Elections 94" poll was conducted throughout the country at the end of December 1993, and interviewed 2,681 persons. Of the population sample interviewed, 75.4 percent indicated they would vote during the coming 8 May presidential elections, 16 percent were undecided, and 9 percent said they would abstain. The results of the poll were made public yesterday during a news conference by CELA Secretary Marco Gandasegui who explained that the sampling reflects a 3 percent, more or less, margin of error. It was also reported that due to technical problems, the poll does not include the Provinces of Bocas del Toro, Darien, or the San Blas territory. The Electoral Tribunal has indicated that 1.5 million voters are eligible to select President Guillermo Endara's successor, two vice presidents, 71 legislators, 65 mayors, 510 corregimiento representatives, and several council members. CELA pointed out that voters most emphatic about abstaining are mostly senior citizens, while the undecided voters are mostly lower income groups and those with less education. According to the sample, Ruben Blades, presidential candidate for the Papa Egoro party follows Perez with 9.3 percent; followed by Arnulfist Party [PA] candidate Mireya Gruber with 5.3 percent; Guillermo Ford of the Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] Party, 3.9 percent; former Comptroller General Ruben Carles, 3.5 percent; and Ricardo Arias Calderon of the PDC [Christian Democratic Party] with 3.1 percent. In the metropolitan area of Panama City, Perez also leads voters preference with 13.4 percent, followed by Blades and former Comptroller General Carles. At the same time, Gruber and Arias Calderon improved in comparison with the last poll. Mrs. Gruber recorded 4.4 percent and Arias Calderon recorded 3.6 percent in the metropolitan area. In Cocle, Veraguas, Los Santos, Chiriqui, parts of Panama and Colon, Gruber came in second with 6.5 percent, Blades was third with 5.8 percent, while Perez headed voters preference with 12.7 percent.
