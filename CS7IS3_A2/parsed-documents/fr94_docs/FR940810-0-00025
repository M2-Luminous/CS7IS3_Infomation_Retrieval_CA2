SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LT S.S. BECKERMAN, Project Manager, Fourteenth Coast Guard District Aids to Navigation Branch, and CDR B.N. DURHAM, Project Counsel, Fourteenth Coast Guard District Legal Branch. Regulatory History On March 8, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register for these regulations (59 FR 10772). The Coast Guard did not receive any letters commenting on the proposal. The public hearing was requested, and none was held. Background and Purpose The anchorage for nitrate laden vessels off Honolulu Harbor was a hold over from World War II and no longer needed. It encompassed much of the area available for commercial vessels to anchor off Honolulu Harbor. Eliminating the nitrate anchorage allows the establishment of four new anchorages and better usage of the available anchoring area. This rule brings the regulations in line with current practice. Discussion of Comments No comments were received during the comment period. No changes were made to the proposed rule. Regulatory Evaluation This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The only effect of this rule is to formally establish anchorage grounds for commercial vessels off Honolulu Harbor in areas where they presently anchor. The rule does not restrict access to any fairway or channel, or limit access to any facility or area previously accessible to vessels. The primary intent of the rule is to designate anchorages for commercial vessels of Honolulu Harbor. Small Entities The impact of this rule on a substantial number of small entities is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principals and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 110 Anchorage grounds.
