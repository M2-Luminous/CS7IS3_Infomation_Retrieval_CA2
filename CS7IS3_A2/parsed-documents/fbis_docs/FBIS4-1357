FBIS4-1357 "drafr082_e_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Aide: Abiola Supported Abacha Military Intervention Aide: Abiola Supported Abacha Military Intervention AB2604221094 Paris AFP in English 2202 GMT 26 Apr 94 AB2604221094 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Lagos, April 26 (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of June's annuled presidential election, "endorsed and actively canvassed" for last year's military intervention in Nigeria, his deputy at that election charged Tuesday [26 April]. In a letter to the US Congress dated March 21 and published for the first time by the Nigerian press Tuesday, Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe said that following the annulment of the vote and the subsequent political crisis, the "widest possible spectrum of Nigerians" called for direct military intervention. Supporters of a military takeover included Abiola and himself, said Kingibe, who is now foreign minister. The letter was published after Abiola reportedly called on Washington to tighten sanctions against Nigeria following the Army's intervention, which led to the abolition of both the country's political parties and parliament. "Chief Abiola and myself were among those who endorsed and actively canvassed for this military intervention," Kingibe wrote. "We discussed the national crisis with various military caucuses, including (current head of state) General Sani Abacha." Abiola and Kingibe contested the election on the ticket of the Social Democratic Party. Four days after Abacha came to power last autumn, Abiola authorised his political aides to participate in the new government, Kingibe claimed. But Abiola, who has openly campaigned for recognition of his claimed victory at the polls -- whose annulment was slammed by the international community -- has denied ever supporting military intervention or submitting a list of his political nominees to Abacha.
