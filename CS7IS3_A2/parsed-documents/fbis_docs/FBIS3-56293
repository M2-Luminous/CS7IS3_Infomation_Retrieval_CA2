Ukraine gets compensation for battlefield nuclear weapons. "We have also secured smooth economic relations, confirmed territorial integrity, respect for each other, and partnership," Kravchuk said. "That, he added, can hardly be called a compromise because such relations are taken for granted as absolutely normal ties, only we have been getting used to them with difficulty so far." Talking to an Interfax correspondent, Kravchuk voiced confidence that parliament would ratify the accords as they offer a good solution to this very complex world problem. "The people and parliament of Ukraine will see that their republic is treated with respect as a country rather than a second rate nation and that all issues are being settled fairly." The president voiced readiness to risk his political career. "The career of a politician cannot compare with the global problem we are solving. I do not put my career above this global issue. I will do all I can so that Ukraine does not stand in the way of nuclear disarmament," Kravchuk stressed. He reported that Russia and Ukraine were working out a friendship treaty that would rest on a new basis and awareness of responsibility to people and history. "We will remove the acute issues dividing us. We will resolve the nuclear problem tomorrow. And then we will settle the problem of the Black Sea Fleet," the Ukrainian president said.
