Our compatriots have suffered constantly because of this war. I would like to ask that this fighting end and to have peace and security for our compatriots everywhere throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia. Some do not listen to me, to the king. They keep saying that they love and respect the king, but in words only not in deeds. Therefore, I would like to again beg them to stop fighting and turn to talk peacefully to solve the problem. Khieu Samphan, H.E. Khieu Samphan, has said that there is no security for him in Phnom Penh. H.E. Hun Sen, Samdech Hun Sen and Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh said they can give a 100 percent guarantee that there will be no danger to H.E. Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge members who attend the roundtable to talk peacefully. This is 100 percent guaranteed. Despite this, H.E. Khieu Samphan and his group do not trust it. They want me to take this roundtable to foreign countries instead of meeting in our country. The royal government replied that no, leaving our country would be a disgrace to our nation, which requires that this be held in our country. H.E. Khieu Samphan, please reply to my message, sent to you on 24 April. It is already 28 April and H.E. Khieu Samphan has not yet replied. Please reply quickly so that I may have enough time to organize the roundtable. If he refuses to come to Phnom Penh for the meeting, however, we will have to postpone it and discuss the matter if this cannot be done in Phnom Penh and about the place he wants the meeting to be held. In Siem Reap? It seems that he wants to go Siem Reap. But I am not sure. Wait until Khieu Samphan writes to me and is clear. Since he has not written yet, today I cannot inform our compatriots and the foreign and local newspapers. So, wait until he answers, then this answer will be disseminated. In fact, he wants to meet abroad, China, Korea, France, or Indonesia. I do not know. Wait until Khieu Samphan writes, then I will inform you. Thank you. [Passage omitted on remainder of audience]
