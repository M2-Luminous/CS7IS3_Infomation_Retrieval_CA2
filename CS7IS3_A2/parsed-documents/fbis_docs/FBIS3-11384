The White House's second most important man, who will be arriving from Bolivia this evening and will leave for Brazil tomorrow, will hold two meetings with Argentine President Carlos Menem and his advisers to examine the so-called Summit of the Americas, which is scheduled to take place in Miami, Florida, in December. Gore has plans for tours to other regional countries in April. It was this statesman who, during his visit to Mexico in January proposed, on behalf of President Bill Clinton, the celebration of the hemispheric summit. According to officials preparing this conference, the Miami encounter will be the main issue of the conversations Gore will hold with his hosts. The meetings in La Paz, Buenos Aires, and Brasilia will permit the U.S. Government leader to return to Washington knowing how the regional leaders with whom he will meet during his tour think. Government sources here have reported Menem will ask Gore at that summit that the continent be declared "zone [word indistinct] of agricultural subsidies." Menem will also seek support for his idea to participate in an effort he calls "white lines" to fight poverty in the world. Official spokespersons want to postpone for another occasion discussions on "points of discrepancy" so as not to mar the dialogue, but certain sectors fear during the visit these issues could crawl in to the center of attention. Before making the trip here, the U.S. President praised the Argentine economic model and other Menem administration initiatives, such as its active participation in UN military missions sponsored by the United States. An independent source has reported in addition to the announced summit and to the UN military expeditions, Gore and Menem will discuss regional integration and free trade agreement processes, such as the one signed by Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Argentina's forming part of that pact has become a top objective of the Argentine Foreign Ministry and Presidency. Despite this, the Clinton administration is conditioning that step to the approval of a medicines-patent law, which would negatively affect Buenos Aires. The U.S. ambassador in Argentina, James Cheek, said this week the patents issue is a "top priority" of his mission in Argentina. This statement drew criticism from opposition politicians who accused him of pressuring the South American country. Argentine observers have explained the law (on trademarks), whose discussion the Argentine parliament has delayed one year, would help the U.S. medical industry and harm 20 Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories. Local experts have said the market in question involves approximately $2 billion annually. They report, despite the fact there are no essential differences between Washington and Buenos Aires over Argentina forming part of the free trade agreement, time is against a quick solution. The U.S. side wants to have established by the end of April the countries with which it will negotiate their participation in the free trade agreement, but the Argentine Congress will debate the patents matter at the beginning of May, and there is no guarantee it will approve it, said Jose Genoud, president of the Senate Industries Commission. Gore and Menem, who will preside over the opening session of a world meeting on telecommunications tomorrow, will also discuss matters related to the strengthening of the struggle against drug-trafficking, a polemic issue considering the meddling attitude made evident in U.S. statements. In addition to suggesting a series of legal measures against money laundering and other similar issues, the United States has pointed to the suitability of Argentine soldiers fighting the scourge (drugs), something Argentine laws forbid. U.S. investments in Argentina are another important issue on the Gore-Menem agenda. Two U.S. giants, AT&T and GTE, among others, will invest $200 million at the end of this month to purchase the rights of Mobile Cellular Telephone in the country's interior. While waiting for Gore's visit, Menem met twice with U.S. millionaire David Rockefeller who said he has "much trust" in Argentina's future.
