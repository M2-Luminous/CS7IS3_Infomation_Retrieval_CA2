The U.S. Government formally informed Seoul in late December that it had decided to stop using Korean Air's Kimhae depot in the repair and maintenance of U.S. Air Force aircraft operating in the Pacific and the Far East. The South Korean Government responded with a request that the U.S. Government reconsider the decision in view of security cooperation between the two countries, but it is unlikely that the U.S. Government will comply with the South Korean request because of the U.S. industry's lobbying for buy-American policy, sources said. Korean Air built the depot in question in 1976 chiefly for the repair and maintenance of U.S. Air Force aircraft, as the U.S. Government, severing diplomatic relations with Taiwan for rapprochement with mainland China, wanted Korea to provide repair and maintenance services to its Air Force in the Pacific and the Far East. Until then Taiwan had provided the services. The depot, employing 700 workers, has once accounted for a maximum 75 percent of the turnover of Korean Air's aircraft and space department. A source close to Korean air said that although some quarters of the U.S. Government want to continue using Kimhae depot for the U.S. Air Force in preparation for an emergency, it would be very hard for the U.S. Government as a whole to change its mind because it is under heavy pressure of the U.S. aircraft maintenance industry. The U.S. Government is considering transferring the repair and maintenance services for U.S. Air Force aircraft in the Pacific and the Far East from Korean Air's Kimhae depot to an aircraft maintenance center in Georgia state which is now on the verge of bankruptcy.
