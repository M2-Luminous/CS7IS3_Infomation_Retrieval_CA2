The Israeli people and government do not believe in peace. Israel speaks of peace negotiations but thinks only of its security and trade agreements with the Arab countries. Fatah's stance is shameful, because they use guns only at festivities and weddings; it would be illogical for 'Arafat to agree to go to Washington for the negotiations. 'Arafat is a strange and crazy individual," Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, the current leader of Hamas -- the most feared Palestinian fundamentalist group -- told LA VANGUARDIA in an exclusive interview in Gaza city. "Hamas has a right to defend itself from Israel's existence. Thus it says frankly in its pamphlets, slogans, and graffiti, and on the streets, that it will seek out the Israelis and attack them," al-Zahhar asserted. Almost at the same time, the Israeli official radio station -- Kol Israel -- was announcing a lethal attack in Hebron by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military wing. [Cymerman] Is it true that the prophet Muhammad chose the fasting month of Ramadan for his holy wars -- more than any other month in the year? [Al-Zahhar] The most outstanding battles of the Islamic world took place during Ramadan. Following these battles, the spread of Islam was very rapid. It can be seen that most of Islam's victorious battles against the infidel were in the month of Ramadan. [Cymerman] A few days ago the PLO leader and the Israeli foreign minister signed an agreement in Cairo. How do you view this, in your capacity as leader of an Islamic movement? [Al-Zahhar] We said from the start that we would gain nothing from this peace process, which is just the achievement of security for the Israeli side and of the Palestinian side's capitulation. Now it means the presence of Israeli troops in 40 percent of the area of Gaza. According to the agreement, they are fully entitled to pursue those whom they call "wanted persons." They can come at any time to our homes and seek their "wanted persons." The Israelis will also be the only force on the approaches to Gaza and Jericho. Thus there is no difference between the current occupation and the implementation of the latest agreement. The Israelis will never carry out a withdrawal, since this interferes with anybody's daily life under the heading "security requirements." It can be seen that there is simply a justification of the occupation. That means settling the Israelis in the most comfortable areas of Gaza, while the occupation still exists in reality. [Cymerman] One of the results of the agreements will be the coming of Yasir 'Arafat and the establishment of a strong Palestinian police force.... [Al-Zahhar] If this police force is here to serve the community, we will receive it willingly, but if it becomes the hands of Israel to establish a tyrannical regime in this area, I believe that they will do what Israel wishes. The people will endure no more tyrannies. They have resisted the occupation since 1967 and paid a high price -- thousands of years of imprisonment, thousands of martyrs. We seek the elimination of any kind of occupation. [Cymerman] Do you believe that 'Arafat is a traitor? Do you believe that he has sold out Palestine? [Al-Zahhar] In the first place, I would like to remind you of 'Atnan Yasin, the traitor responsible for the events of June and July 1992 -- the conflict between Hamas and Fatah. He was the person most responsible for those clashes. We fear such people. Palestine does not belong to one man's organization or even to a state. Palestine does not belong to a generation. Palestine was and will be part of the Islamic world. [Cymerman] Will Hamas take part in the general elections for the autonomous entity? [Al-Zahhar] Hamas believes that the new situation will be more dangerous for the Palestinians than the occupation. The international attitude is opposed to the occupation, but through justification of the occupation through these agreements this will create many problems for the Palestinians. What will become of the millions of Palestinians abroad and of the hundreds of thousands of deportees? What will become of Jerusalem, with the rest of the West Bank? What will become of our rights over Palestine? 'Arafat and his colleagues must answer all these questions. Hamas will not take part in the elections and will not assume the role of opposition in the Palestinian autonomous entity. Hamas will continue to resist the Israelis' presence by all means. [Cymerman] That is, you see no future for the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.... [Al-Zahhar] This is no peace process. It is an agreement between the PLO and Israel. The occupation will be more legal from the international viewpoint. Israel will be the dominant force and the center of authority in Tel Aviv, and will give us Palestinians the right to self-control. That is what autonomy means; the same as the Kurds in Iraq. The central government -- the master of the land -- will give self-determination to a minority national group. With the signing of this agreement 'Arafat is saying that Israel is the master of all Palestine and that it is giving us the opportunity to set up an autonomous entity. This is the most dangerous point in the the agreement signed in the so-called peace talks.
