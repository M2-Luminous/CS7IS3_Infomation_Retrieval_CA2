PLO representative in France Layla Shahid said 'Arafat was breaking out of his "personalised style" and taking account of demands for democracy and greater accountability in nominations being made in the runup to autonomy. "I think that surely in the coming months all these requests for more delegation of authority to others will have to be be taken into consideration," Shahid told members of the Anglo-American Press Association here. She said this was already evident in nominations to the Palestinian Economic Reconstruction and Development Agency (PECDA) established to channel funds to the autonomous areas when negotiations with the Israelis on autonomy have been completed. Donor countries have pledged two billion dollars in aid over the next five years, 580 million of it this year, to Jericho and Gaza, and accountability and openness were essential to avert the threat of corruption, Shahid said. She added that planned elections would bring "major changes to the PLO's nature that will ultimately lead to a full parliament" taking over from the Palestinian National Council. Shahid said the democratic debate was taking place world-wide through petitions or in the Arab press because for the moment the PLO had no institutions and no capital. It was vital to "strengthen the beginning of this process of democratisation," she said. "All this part of the internal debate I find very healthy." She said PECDA, whose task will be to fund basic infrastructure, would be able to start functioning on the ground by next month. A Palestinian delegation led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi went to PLO headquarters in Tunis on January 2 to press for greater democracy, but said they failed in their mission. 'Arafat had agreed to meet the delegation after receiving petitions demanding change. Shahid said that economic autonomy talks being held here between Israel and the PLO would resume on January 18 and would be boosted by last week's monetary accord between the PLO and Jordan. A new meeting of donor countries under World Bank auspices would be held at the end of the month. The PLO representative said she hoped U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting in Geneva next Sunday with Syrian head of state Hafiz al-Asad would lead to an early resumption of bilateral negotiations between Israel and Syria on the Golan Heights.
