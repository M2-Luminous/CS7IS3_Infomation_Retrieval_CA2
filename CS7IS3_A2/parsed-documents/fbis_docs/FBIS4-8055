By liberating these two villages conditions have been created for units of the Herzegovina Corps to take control of these important Muslim strongholds in the area around Uhotic Hill and Bukovo plain, the last remaining Muslim strongholds on the right bank of the Drina, upstream from Gorazde. In order to prevent the withdrawal of members of the 31st Brigade of the so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who suffered a major military defeat in the Cindici area, their command ordered that the bridge in this village be destroyed. The command of the Herzegovina Corps claims that Serb army units engaged in a counteroffensive from the Visegrad direction are deployed just outside Kopaci, six km downstream from Gorazde. Serb military sources say that the Muslim army is still concentrating its forces in the area around Gradina, Volujaca and Uhotic Hill and that its members -- according to an imprisoned Muslim soldier -- have been threatened with death if they lose these strategic points.
