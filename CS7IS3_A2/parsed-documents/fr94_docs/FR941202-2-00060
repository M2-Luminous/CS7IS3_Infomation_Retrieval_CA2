Oral comments were also heard in four public meetings, and at numerous meetings with interested groups, organizations, and individuals. The four public meetings were held in Klamath Falls, Keno, and Bonanza, Oregon. In addition, numerous meetings and formal briefings were held by Oregon BLM State Office personnel. All comments provided were considered during the preparation of the proposed final RMP/EIS. Copies of the proposed final RMP/EIS and a summary of it may be obtained from the Klamath Falls Resource Area office.
