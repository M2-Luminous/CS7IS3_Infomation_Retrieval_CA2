"China: Persecution of a Protestant Sect," published Wednesday, focuses on an intensive clampdown in the central province since the group -- an outgrowth of an indigenous Chinese religious sect founded in 1922 -- was labelled counterrevolutionary in May 1983. Large-scale persecution began on May 5, 1983 when some 2,000 Shouters were rounded up nationwide for "re-education," the international human rights group quoted an unconfirmed account as saying. Some 50 Shouters in Henan have since been jailed for up to 15 years, the report said, adding 13 remained in detention while three had died in prison or on medical parole, the report said. Since 1990, the authorities have abandoned long sentences in favour of shorter administrative detention without recourse to trial, during which sect members are bound, beaten with electric batons and gagged "if they continue to call on Jesus," it said. Members are also subjected to other forms of persecution, including heavy fines and so-called "study sessions," it said. During the several-day sessions, Shouters are "bound with rope, forced to stay on their knees for extended periods of time, physically abused, and forced on pain of torture to renounce their faith, expose their leaders, and join the Three-Self Movement," it said. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement is the officially sanctioned Protestant Church of China. The continuing clampdown on the Shouters reflects official alarm over the rapid growth of the "evangelical, mystical, subjective, intuitive, apocalyptic and individual" sect, whose membership at its Lushan base in Henan had grown to 200,000 by 1983, the report said. Human Rights Watch/Asia said its report "provides further evidence that the number of known political prisoners and religious detainees in China is only a fraction of the real total," noting that only 12 Shouters had ever previously been listed as having been imprisoned. It called for the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining prisoners and "an end to persecution, harassment, arbitrary arrest and fining of religious practioners who do not identify with official churches." The counterrevolutionary label enabled the authorities in the 1980s to imprison Shouters for long periods while remaining within the Chinese law, the report said. But the group -- which stresses Bible study while eschewing involvement in broader social or political matters -- rejects the label. "The Shouters themselves maintained that their differences with the official church were confined to theological interpretation and style of worship and were in no way related to politics or counterrevolution," the report said. The authorities, which have long sought to prevent the spread of unregistered "house churches," object to the Shouters' evangelical creed, rejection of a professional ministry and private meetings. In 1992, officials put the number of Protestants and Catholics attending state-approved churches at some eight million, acknowledging the number of "secret" worshippers was far higher. The report called on Washington to continue pressing Beijing to release about 50 religious figures jailed or under house arrest who were included on a 1993 U.S. list. China's major trading partners should also push Beijing to invite the UN Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance to visit China to recommend specific reforms to enhance religious freedom, it said.
