"This is the first major step towards settling the matter. By this proposal, Russia admits in principle its obligations, offering a specific scheme for their payment," Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev said after the meeting. The Russians offer a translation of the transferable rubles balance into U.S. dollars using a definite factor and payment over five years after a five-year grace period, and rescheduling of debts denominated in the clearing equivalent of the U.S. dollar. The cabinet accepted all these proposals in principle but mandated Mr. Karabashev to insist on an immediate start of payments on the transferable ruble debt even if it would have to be rescheduled over a longer period. These arrangements do not involve the Bulgarian hard-currency debts to Russian banks, as they are subject to the negotiations with Bulgaria's London Club creditors, Mr. Karabashev specified. He hopes the negotiations with the Russians will start as soon as possible but the exact date has yet to be set. Mr. Karabashev said that the debts in question amount to about 670 million transferable rubles and $500 million U.S. (in clearing equivalent). Still, these are not the final figures as some Bulgarian debts to Russia in national currencies are yet to be deducted from these amounts and the balances will be translated using a factor which has to be negotiated.
