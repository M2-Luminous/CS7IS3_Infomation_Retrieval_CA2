This year is the year of a revolutionary upturn in which our country's socialist construction enters a new stage of development, as well as the rewarding year of struggle in which the entire party, the whole country, and all people should be mobilized to effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts. To make the New Year 1994 become a historic year of an upsurge in our country's revolution and construction, all party members and working people must continue to fight more strenuously and vigorously than ever before with revolutionary optimism. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Optimistically living and struggling with a faith in victory is a noble character of revolutionaries. Revolutionary optimism is an ideological and spiritual driving force, enabling the people to endlessly embark upon the revolutionary road. It is also a firm faith in the justness and invincibility of the revolutionary cause that the party and the leader [suryong] are leading, as well as a strong revolutionary spirit to overcome trials and obstacles with a smile without the slightest vacillation. For the people to endlessly carry out revolution, they should vigorously fight on with revolutionary optimism. Our people are the proud and revolutionary people who are creating the socialist heroic epic with revolutionary optimism under the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. The socialist road on which our people have embarked was the road of an ardent struggle leading to obstacles and trials. However, our people have vigorously struggled with a firm faith that one can surely win victory only if one moves forward under the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. As a result, they could defeat the strong imperialist enemies who were proud of their numbers and technologies. Also, they could establish strong, independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive socialist country on a lump of ashes in which everything was destroyed. The spirit of revolutionary optimism became a major spiritual source in leading the people to win a great victory and to perform a world-shaking miracle in the socialist construction. The more we face the difficult and heavy tasks, the more we make strenuous efforts to implement them filled with conviction and optimism. This is a traditional trait of our people. The spirit of revolutionary optimism, which was created from the beginning by the first generation revolutionaries of the Korean revolution, has been handed down to generation after generation. This spirit is also being displayed more highly in today's struggle in which socialism of our own style is consummated under the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. Last year, our people could resolutely smash challenges by the imperialists; firmly safeguard and adhere to the socialist cause of our own style; and highly demonstrate the might of chuche Korea. This is because all people are firmly united around the party and the leader [suryong] and fight on with full conviction and optimism. When the country and the revolution were faced with a stern trial, our people, without any vacillation, turned out as one to resolutely smash [chitpusida] the enemies' challenges and aggressive maneuvers with invincible conviction and roaring spirits, and brilliantly adorned the final year of the Third Seven-year Plan by vigorously accelerating the socialist economic construction. Through the last year's harsh trials and struggle, our people have come to cherish deep in their hearts the firm conviction that as long as we have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who possesses an iron will and seasoned leadership we wil easily win victory over any formidable enemy and will triumphantly advance toward the socialist cause. We have before us glorious yet heavy tasks of vigorously accelerating the general onward march of socialism so as to add luster to the socialism of our own style while upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address. We are building socialism in a sharp confrontation with the enemy. By thoroughly carrying out the revolutionary economic strategy of our party in this year, we should consolidate the foundations of the nation's independent economy solid as a rock and further improve the people's standard of living to meet the socialist requirements. Today's situation and enormous tasks lying before us call on all the party members and working people more than ever before to stir up themselves in a struggle to advance toward a new victory with revolutionary optimism. The conviction of victory and revolutionary optimism are our invincible ideological and spiritual weapon in the general march of socialism at the present time. The key to consolidating and developing the single-minded unity of our revolutionary ranks around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong- il as well as the way to create a history of great revolutionary upsurge by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self- reliance and arduous struggle lie the fact that all the people have the conviction of victory and revolutionary optimism. "Let us strive harder and advance toward a new victory with revolutionary optimism," this is an important militant slogan which our party and people must hold high now. When we strive harder and work militantly with revolutionary optimism, we can brilliantly fulfill programmatic tasks set forth in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address and further display the might of the socialism of our own style. What is important in winning a new victory, full of revolutionary optimism, is that the entire people have the unshakable will and faith that they will surely win when they advance under the leadership of our party. For those who do the revolution, there should a spiritual support. Those who have a strong will and conviction for their party and people do not waver in whatever circumstances and do not fear of any difficulties. The spiritual support for our people is the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. All the party members and working people must always keep in mind the conviction of victory and the future of the revolution, deeply understanding his greatness. Loudly singing the song "We Will Win Because You Are Leading Us," we must have a strong will, fearing no difficulty, adversity and formidable enemy as long as we have the dear comrade leader. All the party members and working people must also be firmly convinced of the invincibility of the cause of the socialism of our own style which is vigorously advancing under the banner of the great chuche idea. Our cause of socialism is a just cause that fulfills the most noble idea of the popular masses and an invincible cause that has been smoothly adhered to without a hitch by withstanding any upheaval of history. The fact that our country shines as a fortress of socialism at a time when socialism has been frustrated in some countries and anti-socialist foul winds sweep the world displays the invincibility and justness of our revolutionary cause. We should deeply realize the superiority of the popular masses- centered socialism of our own style which provides a creative and independent livelihood for the popular masses by comparing our proud reality with the tragic realities of countries where socialism has been frustrated. We must fight resolutely with hope for and confidence in the bright prospects of our economy, which is being developed vigorously according to the party's revolutionary economic strategies, and the future when more bountiful and civilized lives will blossom. Having revolutionary optimism is all the more important to guiding officials who command the revolution. Experience shows that when officials work with overflowing confidence and optimism, the masses will become enthusiastic and the entire country will be filled with confidence in victory. All guiding officials must thoroughly demonstrate, in their work and lives, the indomitable revolutionary spirit and revolutionary optimism of the fallen anti-Japanese revolutionaries who maintained their fidelity as the great general's revolutionary warriors, saying that they could see a revolutionary victory even though their eyes had been plucked out. Our officials must loudly sing songs of struggle filled with confidence and optimism when they sing; walk filled with enthusiasm and high spirits when they walk; and always lead optimistic lives. To live and fight with revolutionary optimism, our officials and workers must learn the ideological and spiritual world of Comrade Yi In-mo. Comrade Yi In-mo has genuine revolutionary optimism in that he firmly believed in the victory of our revolutionary cause led by the party and the leader [suryong], overcame horrible tortures and punishments and persistent appeasement, and maintained his fidelity as a revolutionary. Comrade Yi In-mo's noble spiritual world is fully shown in his poem dedicated to the dear leader. An idea contained in his dedicated poem is that the road to which the dear comrade leader is leading us and which he points is the most correct and just road on which we can always win. Such confidence and will signifies revolutionary optimism, which we must possess. Such devotedness is the philosophy of the revolutionaries and leads one to the revolutionaries' noble spiritual world. All party members and workers must live, cherishing deep in their hearts the idea contained in the poem Comrade Yi In-mo dedicated to the dear comrade leader with single-minded loyalty. For party organizations of all levels to strengthen organizational and political work is important for making all party members and workers strenuously live and fight filled with revolutionary optimism and confidence. In step with today's situation and environment, party organizations must give priority to strengthening education in revolutionary optimism and the greatness of the party and the leader [suryong]. Party organizations must positively carry out work to make party members and workers deeply embody the great leader's New Year address and the decisions of the 21st Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Party Central Committee. In this way, they must make the party members and workers speed up their onward march in the new year with hope for the future and confidence in the revolution's future. Revolutionary optimism sharply contrasts with corrupt and decadent antisocialist trends. Party organizations must keep reactionary trends -- which the imperialists and the betrayers of socialism spread -- from infiltrating into our society, and fill the entire society with vigorous revolutionary spirit. The people's struggle today is arduous, the future of the struggle is bright, and a victory is certain. At the vanguard of our revolution are the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the invincible great party, the invincible revolutionary Armed Forces, and the strong self-reliant national economy. When all people, filled with revolutionary optimism, courageously march forward with high spirits, the victory will eternally be ours. Let us all resolutely march forward to win a new victory after cherishing deep in our hearts the revolutionary optimism that they can win victory when they march under the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership and more single-mindedly unite around the party and the leader [suryong].
