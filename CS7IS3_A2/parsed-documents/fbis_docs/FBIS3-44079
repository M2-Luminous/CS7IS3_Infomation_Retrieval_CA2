The African National Congress concluded its National Reconstruction and Strategy Conference today, 23rd January 1994, at Nasrec [conference center], Johannesburg. The conference was called following a decision of the National Executive Committee [NEC] in October 1992. The conference involved delegations from ANC branches and regions, representatives of the trade unions and other sectoral organisations, the South African Communist Party, and parties and organisations from the Patriotic Front. Our national conference was the culmination of a process that grew up from the branch and regional level, entailing in-depth discussion and elaboration of a reconstruction and development programme, whose object is the creation of a coherent, integrated policy framework to mobilise the people and the resources of our country for the eradication of racial oppression. The ANC's reconstruction and development programme is directed at uprooting the institutionalised injustices rooted in our country's history of colonial conquest, racism and apartheid which have resulted in massive poverty cheek by jowl with wealth and power. The South African economy has been built by the efforts of all in this country. Over decades it has been systematically structured to serve the dominant white racial minority, which has employed its exclusive control over political power to enforce racial division in every facet of our national life. South African society is consequently deeply scarred by racially determined inequalities. A handful of white owned conglomerates dominate South African industry, finance and commerce. Legally entrenched cheap labour policies, a racist system of education and training, and studied neglect of adequate fiscal provision for black education have resulted in a virtual white monopoly of skills and the professions. Our country's workforce produces far below its potential capacity and is ill-equipped to cope with the rapid shifts in the international economy. Small business remains severely stunted and under-developed. Large corporations refuse to invest adequately in research and development. South Africa has been consigned to the status of a net producer and exporter of raw materials, its manufacturing sector remains uncompetitive. The undemocratic state structure that underpinned this is both illegitimate and unrepresentative of the diverse racial, cultural, class and gender composition of the South African people. The state is consequently unsuited to the absolutely necessary the purposes of reconstruction and social transformation. South Africa's approaching democratic elections, which are the outcome of more than a century of struggles waged by masses of our people, through their national liberation movement, the trade unions, women's movements, civic organisations, student bodies, the churches and other formations, hold out the promise of building a better life for all the people of our country. The ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme builds on this shared heritage of struggle and democratic yearnings for a just society. For this potential of our country to be realised the people of South Africa must harness the resources of our country in a comprehensive strategy to raise our country and its people out of the present crisis. The National Reconstruction and Strategy Conference centred on a study of the sixth draft of the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) in ten commissions stretching over two days. Conference also produced a number of resolutions, arising from commission discussions, which will form the basis of a policy thrust and legislative programme for our country's first democratic government. Conference agreed that the indispensable condition for the implementation and realisation of the RDP is a decisive victory for the ANC electoral front on 27th April. The attainment of political office by an ANC-led government of national unity, will be the first step towards the incremental and steady empowerment of all those who have been historically deprived and disadvantaged on the basis of race, gender or class in our society. The RDP posits an integrated, coordinated plan that combines reconstruction and development with a thorough democratisation of South African society to unleash the energies and creativity of our people. Fighting poverty and deprivation, with the active involvement of those most afflicted by it, will be the priority of the democratic government. The task of building one South African nation, made up of people united in their diversity, will remain elusive unless the inequalities and disparities created by apartheid are swiftly overcome. Conference affirmed that all participants will return to their branches, regions, organisatons and sectors, with the firm resolve to spare no efforts in working for a convincing ANC victory in the forthcoming elections so as to ensure the speedy implementation of this Reconstruction and Development Programme.
