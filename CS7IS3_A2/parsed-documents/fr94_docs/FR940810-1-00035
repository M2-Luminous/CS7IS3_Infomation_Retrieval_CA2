FR940810-1-00035 FR940810-1-00007 The Secretary also proposes to add a new paragraph (a)(4) to clarify the obligation of guaranty agencies to reflect accurately in their accounting records the computation of reserve fund balances in accordance with this section and to provide a mechanism for correcting those records. Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(iii) would restate the general obligation to maintain correct accounting records and to correct them when necessary. Paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iv) would establish specific mechanisms for the correction of erroneous credits to the reserve fund and for general accounting record reconstructions. In both cases, the Secretary would not allow a guaranty agency to change its accounting records if other parties, such as lenders or students who had relied on the guaranty agency's stated financial condition, would be unfairly prejudiced. In the case of general accounting record reconstructions, the Secretary intends to grant the required approval only on the basis of an audit plan submitted before any work on the reconstruction actually commences. The current paragraph (a)(4) limits the investment of reserve funds to low-risk securities and restates the fiduciary duty of guaranty agencies in making those investments. This paragraph would be redesignated as paragraph (a)(5) in the proposed amendment, and the wording of the paragraph would be rearranged for stylistic purposes. The Secretary understands that investment risk can arise from the maturity of securities investments as well as from the identity of their issuers and will deal with this subject in the subsequent rule proposal on misuse, misapplication and improper expenditures. The current paragraph (a)(5) requires proportionate reimbursement to the reserve fund when a guaranty agency derives revenue from an asset developed or purchased with the reserve fund or converts the asset to a use not related to the FFEL Program. This paragraph is based on the fundamental principle that reserve funds are to be used solely for the FFEL Program and retain that character when incorporated into other assets. It provides a remedy for any deviation from this principle in addition to disallowance of any payment that was not permitted by paragraph (a)(2) in the first place. The Secretary does recognize, however, that there may be economies in having assets shared by program and nonprogram activities. For example, purchasing a single computer with sufficient capacity for both the FFEL Program and an unrelated agency activity will ordinarily cost less than the total of separate computers for each, thereby creating a saving to be shared between the two activities. Such legitimate joint utilization of assets should not be stifled by regulation. The proper scope of this paragraph was discussed in the negotiated rulemaking proceeding at great length. The basic policy issue was whether the additional remedy provided by the paragraph should be limited to situations in which assets are acquired by the guaranty agency with reserve funds in a technical purchase-and-sale transaction or should apply to all asset-related transactions in which reserve funds are used. The basic legal issue was whether the use of the word ``purchase'' in section 422(g)(1) of the HEA precludes the latter result. The Secretary's position is that, although ``purchase'' and ``develop'' are not synonymous in their everyday usage, the word ``develop'' was added to this paragraph in a 1992 rulemaking proceeding (57 FR 60355) merely to emphasize the broad meaning traditionally given to the word ``purchase'' in the law. See, for example, 26 U.S.C. ยง338(h)(3); Dasho v. Susquehanna Corp., 380 F.2d 262 (7th Cir. 1967); U.C.C. ยง1&hyph;201(32). The industry negotiators argued, on the other hand, that ``purchase'' is a different term from ``develop,'' and the Secretary was not authorized to expand the statutory scope by rulemaking. In addition to disagreeing with this narrow reading of the statute, the Secretary's representatives expressed concern over attempting to accommodate the other negotiators' comments on its original rulemaking proposals only to have them undermine any consensus by later claiming that the Secretary was acting outside the scope of statutory authority in adopting the very regulation to which they had consented. After extensive discussion of these issues, all the negotiators agreed to substitute a more discriminating set of remedies for the current monolithic approach of the paragraph, to put aside their differences over the proper scope of the paragraph by using only the word ``develop'' in the rule, and not to question the Secretary's authority to promulgate a rule in this form. In current paragraph (a)(5), redesignated as paragraph (a)(6), the proposed revision would provide different consequences, depending upon the relationship between the initial cost allocation and the use for nonprogram purposes. If the use for nonprogram purposes was not substantial, no remedy at all would be necessary. If the use was substantial but the initial cost allocation was correct, the consequences of revenue receipts or subsequent conversion to nonprogram purposes would be governed by the reserve fund's recorded ownership interest in the asset. If the use was substantial and the agency had attempted in good faith to allocate the cost between the program and nonprogram purposes but had done so erroneously, the agency would only be required to correct the allocation. If there was no such good faith allocation attempt at the outset, however, the Secretary would be given a choice of remedies: The Secretary could either require the agency to correct the allocation or require it to correct the recorded ownership of the asset to reflect the fair proportionate interests of the Department. This proposed election of remedies for the Secretary is based on the traditional legal principle that a beneficiary has the choice of either disavowing or ratifying a misuse of assets by a fiduciary. An analysis of fair proportionate interests would utilize the criteria customarily used in the financial world with regard to the development of new businesses, would include both monetary and other contributions to the total development cost, and would consider both the magnitude and the relative risk of all of these contributions.
