FR940323-1-00069 FR940323-1-00008 2. Section 301(f) of the act prohibits the refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704 of the act. Section 704(e) of the act requires every person required under section 519 of the act to maintain records and every person who is in charge or custody of such records, upon request of an officer or employee designated by FDA, to permit such officer or employee to have access to, and copy and verify, such records. 3. Section 301(q) of the act prohibits, among other things, the failure or refusal to furnish any material or information required by or under section 519 of the act. In addition, section 502(t)(2) of the act deems a device to be misbranded if there is a failure or refusal to furnish any material or information required by or under section 519 of the act respecting the device. Sections 301 (a), (b), (c), (g), and (k) of the act prohibit several actions with respect to interstate commerce in misbranded devices. FDA may also seize misbranded devices under section 304 of the act (21 U.S.C. 334) as well as restrain or prosecute violations of section 301 of the act relating to misbranded devices. In addition to the criminal and civil enforcement mechanisms described above, the SMDA added section 303(f) to the act, which provides for the first time that any person who fails to demonstrate substantial compliance with section 519(f) of the act may be subject to civil penalties. These penalties do not apply to any person who commits minor violations of section 519(f) (only with respect to correction reports) if such person demonstrates substantial compliance with section 519(f). A civil penalty may not exceed $15,000 for a single violation, and may not exceed $1,000,000 for all such violations adjudicated in a single proceeding. VIII. Environmental Impact The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. IX. Economic Impact FDA has carefully examined the costs and benefits of this proposed rule in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). The agency concludes that this proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies that the proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The agency estimates that it will receive no more than 800 reports per year from device manufacturers regarding removals and corrections. For the estimated 800 reports the total cost would be $240,000. In addition, the agency expects that there will be other instances of corrections and removals that will not have to be reported to the agency, but will have to be maintained in files at the manufacturer's site. These records are to be made available to FDA inspectors upon request. The cost of preparing these records would be $120,000 per year. An assessment of the economic impact of any final rule based on this proposal has been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and may be seen by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. X. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains information collections which are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). The title, description, and respondent description of the information collection are shown below with an estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Title: ``Reports of Corrections and Removals'' for manufacturers, importers, and distributors of medical devices under Public Law 101&hyph;629_General Requirements. Description: FDA is proposing to implement provisions of the SMDA that require a manufacturer, importer, or distributor of a device to report promptly to FDA any correction or removal of a device undertaken by a manufacturer, importer, or distributor of a device if the correction or removal was undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the act caused by the device which may present a risk to health. The purpose of the proposed changes is to improve the protection of the public health by assuring that FDA has current and complete information regarding those actions taken to eliminate any risk to health caused by the device. Estimated Annual Reporting Burden 1␣ 1␣ Section 806.10: Annual Number of Responses 800 Average Burden per Response (hours) 10 Total Annual Burden (hours) 8,000 Section 806.20: Annual Number of Responses 400 Average Burden per Response (hours) 10 Total Annual Burden (hours) 4,000 As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA has submitted a copy of this proposed rule to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspects of these information collection requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Desk Officer for FDA.
