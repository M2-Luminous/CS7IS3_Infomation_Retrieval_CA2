FR940304-1-00021 FR940304-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;07&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes. This proposal would require various inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found. This proposal is prompted by an investigation to determine the controllability of Model 747 series airplanes following an in-flight thrust reverser deployment, which has revealed that, in the event of thrust reverser deployment during high-speed climb or during cruise, these airplanes could experience control problems. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure the integrity of the fail safe features of the thrust reverser system by preventing possible failure modes in the thrust reverser control system that can result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. DATES: Comments must be received by April 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;07&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;07&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;07&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion In May 1991, a Boeing Model 767 series airplane was involved in an accident in which a thrust reverser deployed inadvertently during flight. While the investigation of the accident has not revealed the cause of that deployment, it has identified a number of possible failure modes in the thrust reverser control system. Inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. The FAA and the aviation industry are conducting an in-depth investigation of the thrust reverser systems installed on various types of large transport airplanes. In particular, this investigation has focused on airplane controllability in the event of an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser, and thrust reverser reliability in general. Based on the data gathered from this ongoing investigation, the FAA has issued several airworthiness directives (AD) to require periodic inspections and tests of the thrust reverser systems on certain Boeing Model 757 and 767 series airplanes [for example, reference AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;09, Amendment 39&hyph;8043 (56 FR 46725, September 16, 1991) for certain Model 757 series airplanes; and AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8408 (57 FR 53258, November 9, 1992) for certain Model 767 series airplanes]. In addition, the FAA has issued or proposed several AD's to require an additional locking device on thrust reversers that are installed on Model 737&hyph;300/&hyph;400/&hyph;500, 757, and 767 series airplanes. This action was taken to enhance the level of reliability on airplane models that were determined to have unacceptable flight characteristics following an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser.
