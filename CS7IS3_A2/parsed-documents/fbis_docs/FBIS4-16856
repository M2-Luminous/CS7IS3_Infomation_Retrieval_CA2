As has already been reported, an armored transporter was blown up by an antitank mine in the Pyandzh [name as transliterated] detachment's sector. Lieutenant Aleksey Vladimirov was killed and four servicemen were injured. The mine was laid by subversives from the Afghan side, who had made a hole in the fence beforehand. Days earlier, this detachment's checkpoint had been shelled by four rockets fired from the direction of the village of Vandari Sherkhan [name as transliterated], which is controlled by units of the Afghan 54th Division. The border guards did not open fire in retaliation, so as to avoid casualties among the civilian population. The Tajik Government has pinned the blame for this provocation on the armed opposition, which, in official Dushanbe's opinion, wants thereby to wreck the talks under way in Moscow. General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the Russian Border Guards Group, put it even more sharply. He is convinced that this action was planned. And it would have played into the hands of both the opposition and the Afghans if Tajik refugees had suffered from the retribution. Incidentally, the leadership of Konduz Province recently proposed that Tajik refugees not be prevented from returning home in exchange for deliveries of electricity from Khotlon Oblast. In other words, the refugees have turned into a bargaining chip. The general noted that there is a limit to the border guards' patience. And they will provide a proper rebuff, even despite the fact that, as he put it, Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzod [name as transliterated], one of the opposition leaders, recently called for a jihad against the border guards. The former official head of the Tajik Muslims, who refused to go to the talks in Moscow, stated in Tehran that the opposition is indeed insisting on the withdrawal of Russian border guards from Tajikistan. Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzod explained his absence from the talks by the fact that Emomali Rakhmonov, the current head of the republic, had not gone to Moscow, nor had other major figures representing Kulyab, which played a decisive role in routing the opposition's combat detachments.
