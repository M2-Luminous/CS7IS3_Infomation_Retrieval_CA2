FR940406-0-00012 FR940406-0-00001 Section 342 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 affected farm households which quit farming. Accordingly, 7 CFR 273.8(e)(5) was amended by the interim rule to specify that property essential to self- employment of a household member engaged in farming is excluded as a resource for one year from the date the household member terminates self-employment from farming. A conforming amendment to 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1)(i) specified that any licensed vehicle which had been used over 50 percent of the time in the self-employment of a household member engaged in farming continues to be excluded as a resource for one year from the date the household member terminates his/her self-employment from farming. The Department received only one comment on the interim rule which supported the one-year extension of the above exclusion. Therefore, this action adopts the interim provisions as final without change. Implementation_7 CFR 272.1(g) Under the interim rule, the provisions addressed in this final rule were retroactively implemented effective July 1, 1989. The Department received several comments complaining about the short implementation time for the interim rule. While we sympathize about the short lead time given to State agencies to implement the interim rule, the Department had no discretion in this matter and had to implement the time frames mandated by Public Law 100&hyph;435. The provisions of this final action which adopt as final without change provisions of the interim rule or modify a provision of the interim rule for clarity only are retroactively effective to July 1, 1989. The clarifications do not represent any change in policy and, thus, do not require any special implementation efforts by State agencies. The provisions of this final action which require the alteration of State procedures, are to be effective May 6, 1994. State agencies must complete implementation efforts of new provisions no later than September 5, 1994. Any variance resulting from the implementation of the provisions of this amendment shall be excluded from quality control error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation date in accordance with 7 CFR 275.12(d)(2)(vii).
