This draft agreement modifies the Treaty for the Proscription of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, which was formulated in April 1969 and was ratified by Chile in October 1974. This international treaty, signed in the Mexican town of Tlatelolco, seeks to establish zones and environments free of nuclear weapons. It is the first of its type encompassing an extensive and heavily populated zone like Latin America and the Caribbean. The changes seek to include countries which obtained their independence since the implementation of said treaty (Belize and Guyana), to change in the treaty's name, and to include the Caribbean nations. Finally, by suggestion of Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, essential amendments are being made to make the treaty's control system more operational without affecting its essential political principles and objectives.
