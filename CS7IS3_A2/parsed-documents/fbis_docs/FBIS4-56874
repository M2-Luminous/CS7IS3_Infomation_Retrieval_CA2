Police said the university group was protesting a decision by transportation workers not to honor bus rates for students. Despite a vast police deployment along the streets of the capital in the wake of a strike by 35,000 drivers, demonstrators from the National University of Venezuela (UCV) marched to the entrance of Venezuela Plaza. After briefly blocking traffic, they closed in on the delivery vehicle and forced its occupants to get out. After that, they set the vehicle ablaze and fled. Student protests erupted last Thursday when students from Fermin Toro High School staged major disturbances near Miraflores presidential palace, which ended with the death of student German Sotillo.
