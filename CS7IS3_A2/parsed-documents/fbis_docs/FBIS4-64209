It would take place within the framework of Partnership for Peace. We intend to involve the NATO authorities fully in the planning and would hope to include arrangements for suitable participation by other interested partners. To reflect our strong support for the U.S./Russia/Ukraine trilateral agreements and our commitment to a successful outcome for this enterprise, Germany and the United Kingdom will continue to participate actively in the coordination of national efforts to help Ukraine achieve the elimination of all nuclear weapons on her soil. We will share with each other information and experience arising from our respective programmes of assistance, with a view to maximising the contribution we can make thereby to our shared goal of security and cooperative relations throughout this region. We will engage also in a close exchange of views about experience already gained, especially in German retraining and housing progranunes for Ukrainian military personnel. The structures already established in the course of these programmes lend themselves to future efforts in these fields. Our traditional Anglo-German Seminar of the two ministries of defence, which is scheduled with high ranking participation for next January at the Fuhrungsakademie in Hamburg, this time will also focus on our relations with Central and Eastern European countries. The theme for discussion will reflect the new quality of cooperation. It is our common intention and understanding that participation will include representatives from partner countries.
