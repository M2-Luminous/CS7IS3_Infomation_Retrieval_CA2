Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Sandzak, Western Thrace, and Albania are our outposts in the West. We must, in fact, it is our fate, to extend every possible kind of material and moral support to the more than 10 million Muslims living in the Balkans. Like the Balkans, Baku, Nagorno-Karabakh, Nakhichevan, Abkhazia and the countries in northern Caucasus, the Adzhar Republic, Crimea, Karkuk (Iraqi Turkmens), and Cyprus are Turkey's outposts and areas of interest. Anatolia can be defended only if these forts remain in the hands of the Muslims. In fact, Anatolia is the real target of the games and scenarios being played in the Balkans, the Caucasus, Crimea, Cyprus, and northern Iraq. Throughout history, whenever Anatolia was united and strong, the Islamic world had peace and security. Whenever Anatolia was weakened and its unity disrupted, not only was the entire Islamic world exploited by imperialist forces, but it was also subjected to great suffering as a result of massacres, genocide, and other cruelties. Anatolia is the center of the Turkish and Islamic world. Serbian martial music includes the slogan "Od Jadrana do Irana nece biti Muslumana," meaning all the Muslims from the Adriatic to Iran will be killed. This is not only the permanent wish of the Serbs but of the West; it is the hatred of the Crusaders. There is surely a reason behind the fact that the cultural heritage of the Turkish-Islamic civilization is being rudely destroyed while Christian works in Anatolia are being repaired. The "holy alliance" the West established in Vienna was the first stage of the plan to expel the Turks from the Balkans. The last stage is to expel them from Anatolia. Supporting the Balkans, the Caucasus, northern Iraq, Cyprus, Crimea, and the others is necessary to protect Turkey's existence today and in the future. It is certainly not a favor. [passage omitted]
