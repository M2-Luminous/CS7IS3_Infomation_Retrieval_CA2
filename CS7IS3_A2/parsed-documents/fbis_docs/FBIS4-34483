According to Chilean Mission sources, the condition is for them to peacefully abandon the building that they trespassed on Wednesday morning by jumping the fence that surrounds the two-story building located in the elegant neighborhood of Miramar, in western Havana. Chilean diplomatic officials told PRENSA LATINA that they would even be willing to escort them to their residences if they decide to leave. The Chilean officials said they decided to take in the occupiers strictly for humanitarian reasons. The group consists of six men and a woman, whose ages range between 20 and 30 years, and a 12-year old boy. "We hope that time will help us to convince them that as a consulate we cannot give them asylum and that their only option is to abandon the mission," sources close to the mission said. According to international conventions and norms, a consular mission cannot grant political asylum. "We have explained it to them on several occasions, but they insist they want to leave the country," the source added. Following a 17-year break in diplomatic relations, the two countries have maintained consular relations since 1991 as a result of an agreement reached between former President Patricio Aylwin and Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Guadalajara, Mexico, during the First Ibero-American Summit. The officials have emphatically ruled out the use of force to compel the group to abandon the mission's grounds. "The orders are not to use force at any time, the only road available is to convince them to leave," they said. The occupiers remain in the building's back porch, and the consular authorities are guaranteeing them food, including milk for the boy. They sleep outdoors on improvised mattresses, which is not that bad thanks to the high temperatures common to the Cuban summer season. Even though they have not specifically shown an interest in traveling to the United States as their final destination, some of them said they have money to leave the country and that they have relatives in Miami, the U.S. city where most Cuban immigrants live. Consul Patricio Pozo held an intense round of interviews this morning, apparently with Foreign Ministry officials, the contents and results of which are not yet known. Meanwhile, the Cuban authorities reiterated yesterday to the diplomatic corps accredited here its decision to help resolve the situation created in the last two weeks following the illegal occupation of the Belgian ambassador's residence by 128 persons, the German Embassy by 21 persons, and the Chilean Consulate. Likewise, the authorities reiterated Cuba's official position not to accept illegal entry into diplomatic installations as a pressure mechanism for leaving the country. The incident at the Chilean Consulate took place the day before the meeting between Fidel Castro and Chilean President Eduardo Frei in the framework of the bilateral meetings held by both presidents in Cartagena de Indias, site of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Last Monday, coinciding with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's visit to Havana, 21 Cuban citizens violently penetrated the German Embassy in a truck. "My personal impression is that there is something in these coincidences," a Latin American diplomat, who preferred not to be identified, said.
