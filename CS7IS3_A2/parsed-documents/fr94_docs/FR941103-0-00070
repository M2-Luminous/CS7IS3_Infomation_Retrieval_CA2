FR941103-0-00070 FR941103-0-00010 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [KY&hyph;069&hyph;6105a; FRL&hyph;5089&hyph;4] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Commonwealth of Kentucky AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: On November 13, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky through the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet (Cabinet), submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Lexington, Owensboro, Paducah, and Edmonson County areas from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O 3 ). The marginal nonattainment areas include the following counties: Lexington (Fayette and Scott), Owensboro (Daviess and a portion of Hancock), Paducah (Livingston and a portion of Marshall), and Edmonson County. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes and the redesignation request satisfies the criteria set forth in the Clean Air Act. In this action, EPA is approving the redesignation to attainment of the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas and the associated maintenance plans because they meet the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. EPA will act on the request to redesignate to attainment the Lexington and Paducah areas in a future document. In this action, EPA is also approving the 1990 base year inventory for the Owensboro and Edmonson County marginal O 3 nonattainment areas. DATES: This final rule will be effective January 3, 1995 unless adverse or critical comments are received by December 5, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register .
