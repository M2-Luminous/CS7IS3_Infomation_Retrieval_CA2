FBIS3-5070 "dreas042_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-042 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Mar 1994 North Korea N-S 3 Mar Working-Level Contact Reported SK0303124694 Pyongyang Korean Central Television Network in Korean 1125 GMT 3 Mar 94 SK0303124694 Pyongyang Korean Central Television Network Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] The fourth working-level contact for the exchange of the special envoys of the highest-level leaders of the North and the South was held in the South side area of Panmunjom today. The contact was held today because of our side's sincere efforts over the four months since the third contact held in October of last year. As was reported, our side proposed the exchange of special envoys of the highest-level leaders of the North and the South in May of last year, and have made every effort we can for its realization at the earliest date. If the South side had taken a sincere position for the exchange of the special envoys, as our side repeatedly demanded, such as suspending the dialogue-negating, provocative nuclear war exercise, not seeking the international joint cooperation system designed to harm the fellow countrymen under the pretext of the so-called nuclear issue; and apologizing, in particular, for the violent remark that they would not hesitate to take military countermeasures against the dialogue partner, the working delegates' contact would have been concluded and the special envoys of the two sides would have traveled between Pyongyang and Seoul. However, despite our side's just demand, the South side not only enforced the large-scale Hwarang and Eagle-93 war exercises one after another, but requested the United States not to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, even calling for so-called sanctions against us. Thus, continuously conducting the outside force-depending acts and antinational acts, the South side caused the working-level contact to be suspended. The contact today was held in camera. After the contact, the head of our side's delegation held a news conference for domestic and foreign reporters on the spot, and informed the reporters of the status of the contact. Our side first made clear our serious position [chinjihan ipchang] for the working-level contact, and said that in light of all the facts, the problem was that the South side has not had the proper attitude and position for the realization of the exchange of special envoys and attempted to crush [apsal] us with the outside forces under the pretext of the nuclear issue and putting the brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks. Our side made clear that the South side should feel responsible for long delaying the exchange of the special envoys of the highest-level leaders of the North and the South, which are aimed at bringing forth a turning point for peace and the peaceful reunification of the country. Our side stressed that the way of breaking through the difficulties most promptly and smoothly at a time when the threat of nuclear war is menacing the nation is exchanging special envoys of highest-level leaders of the North and South at the earliest date. Our side urged the South side to take immediate steps to remove obstacles lying in the way of the exchange of special envoys. Regarding this, our side insisted that the South side should stop all the large-scale nuclear war exercises against its dialogue partner, give up seeking an antinational international cooperation system, call off its attempt to bring in Patriot missiles to South Korea, and withdraw its remarks that it will not shake hands with its dialogue partner. Our side stressed that these four points are just measures necessary for successfully exchanging special envoys between the North and South under a good atmosphere and environment. Our side maintained that the two sides should wind up the discussions on procedural matters concerning the exchange of special envoys in an hour or so after the South side, at today's contact, gives a satisfactory explanation on its stance toward the four points in any form. After that, our side held, the two sides should realize the exchange of special envoys of the highest level leaders of the North and the South within the next few days. At the contact, the South side, however, declined to clear its stance on the principled demands of our side from the beginning, in a bid to justify its unreasonable stance toward dialogue, the South side rep. In connection with this, our side asked whether the South side truly has the intention to realize the exchange of special envoys and repeatedly urged it to clear its stance toward our just demands. Our side, most of all, stressed that a hostile large-scale nuclear war exercise is the biggest stumbling block lying in the way of exchanging special envoys and that the South side is assuming a stance of wait-and-see by saying empty words about suspending the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, violating the DPRK-U.S. agreement. Our side pointed out that the South side, moreover, attempts to stage another large-scale nuclear war exercise. Our side said that the South side should give deep thought as to what grave consequence the large-scale nuclear war exercise would bring to the nation if the South side enforces such a nuclear war exercise against us, and urged the South side to make clear without delay its clear position, in the first place, on suspending all hostile large-scale nuclear war exercises for the survival of the dialogue and the nation. Our side noted that the international joint cooperation system is not aimed at realizing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but is, instead, the system of harming the nation and hurting the national interests in collusion with the outside forces [urichugun namchugi chuguhango innun kukje kongjocheje yoksi minjogul sallinun tuksa kyohwangwa choltaero yangnip toelsu opsumyo, kugosun choson pandoui pihaekhwarul silhyonhagi wihangosi anira, oesewa hanchagi toeo minjogui iigul haechiryonun minjok mohae chejerago chijok haessumnida]. Our side stressed that the South side should abandon the policy of depending on outside force and return to the true road for the nation. Our side also noted that the South side's attempt to bring in such modern weapons as Patriot missiles is an open threat to the dialogue partner, and stressed that if the South side continues bringing in war equipment and force confrontation despite the consistent protests and denunciations of the people at home and abroad, not only the exchange of special envoys but also the situation on the Korean peninsula will proceed along toward a grave phase which no one can predict. Our side noted the fact that the South side, which absurdly took a dialogue-negating position in the past, saying that it cannot shake hands with the other side which has a nuclear weapon, is now mentioning the exchange of special envoys, saying that it cannot consider that we have a nuclear weapon. Our side then said that if the South side has the true desire to conduct the exchange of special envoys and the summit talks [choegowikup hoedam] with us, it should not shake hands with the outside forces with nuclear weapons but with the fellow countrymen without nuclear weapons. Saying that the North and the South are flesh and blood and fellow countrymen despite the difference in ideology and system, our side strongly urged the South side to make a decision to make a new start from the position of national independence and great national unity, in conformity with the demand of the present situation, instead of making the nation victimized by the outside forces. The South could not make any reply to this. The two sides decided to further study the other side's position and plan and discusst them at the next contact. The two sides agreed to have the fifth working-level delegates' contact at Tongilgak in our side's area of Panmunjom on 9 March.
