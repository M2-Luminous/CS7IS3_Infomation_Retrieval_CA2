Speaking to BBC's reporter in Sarajevo, Silajdzic firmly rejected claims that the Moslems had lost the war in Bosnia and said that the main reason for their losses so far is the international embargo on arms deliveries. The United Nations banned the delivery of weapons to the territory of the former Yugoslavia in September 1991. Addressing the Royal Institute in London on Wednesday Hogg said that the peace process in Bosnia would begin only if the Serbs give up a part of the territories and the Moslems admit military defeat. The Moslems must be reconcilled with this and realize that a foreign military intervention in Bosnia is out of the question, he said. Hogg warned the warring sides in Bosnia that in the next eight weeks a peace agreement should be reached because the alternative is the withdrawal of the U.N. peacekeepers and the halting of international humanitarian aid. The pullout of the international troops from Bosnia could seriously be considered if the Moslems continue nurturing hopes that the embargo on arms deliveries could be lifted, as the United States promised in the face of British and French opposition, Hogg said. The Moslem government in Sarajevo rejects a four-month ceasefire called for by the meeting of foreign minsiters of Russia, the United States, European Union and the United Nations held in Geneva last Friday. Hogg recalled that early this year Great Britain and France announced they would not forever keep their troops in Bosnia and had started looking for ways to withdraw them. According to Hogg, this was cut short by NATO's military scenario and the U.S. diplomatic initative for supporting the Sarajevo Moslem authorities. British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Wednesday that so far there does not exist a plan for the withdrawal of the British U.N. contingent from Bosnia.
