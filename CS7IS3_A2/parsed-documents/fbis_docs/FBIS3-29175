Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a statement that the Japanese Government welcomes the fact that Ayala Lasso officially assumed the post Monday, with the approval of the UN General Assembly. Japan has supported the creation of such a post since it was first discussed at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna last June, Terada said. He said the Japanese Government will actively support the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights so he could fulfil his important role to promote respect for human rights in the world. UN General Secretary [General] Butrus Butrus-Ghali on February 1 named Ayala Lasso to become the first UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, for a four-year term.
