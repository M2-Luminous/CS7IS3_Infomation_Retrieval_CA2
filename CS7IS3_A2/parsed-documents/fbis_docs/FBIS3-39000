Party Chairman M. Vos, who was initially on the 17th position, ended up in 5th position. This "safe" position is the result of the widely spread dissatisfaction among the party members, who felt that the list of candidates "was too much leftwing, and not green enough." As a biologist, Vos can act as an environmental expert within the party group. Former student leader S. van Geest moved from the 15th to the 11th position. This position might gain her a seat, if the party gets the 12 seats presently forecast by the polls. Former PvdA (Labor Party) Representative P. de Visser moved from the 30th to the 13th position. He left the PvdA because of his criticism on that party's WAO policy (Law on Labor Disability). A conflict between Green Left' various "blood groups" (CPN [Netherlands Communist Party], PPR [Radical Political Party] and PSP [Pacifist Social Party]), as feared by resigning party group Chairman P. Lankhorst and candidate committee Chairman A. van Es, was avoided. None of the three new candidates have been members of the old parties. As expected, the congress elected the tandem I. Brouwer and M. Rabbae at the head of the list of candidates. Rabbae's position within the party had been contested, after he had stated in an interview with this newspaper, that, as far as he was concerned, the book "Satanic Verses" by Salman Rushdie could be banned by the judge. He managed to convince his audience in Arnhem, that he had changed his mind since the novel had been released. "With hindsight, I must acknowledge that I expressed myself too vaguely in the interview with NRC," Rabbae said. "To be perfectly clear", the former manager of the Dutch Center for Foreigners stated that he regards Khomeyni's death sentence as a "horrible crime." The tandem P. Rosenmller and L. Sipkes, which lost the battle for list leadership last year, is on the third and fourth positions of the list of candidates. An attempt by some party members, including Senator W. de Boer, to relegate Sipkes to the ninth position, failed. The reason for this action, was the fact that Sipkes had approved the defense budget in the House of Representatives, against the congress' will.
