Here is Yuriy Sverko, our Minsk correspondent with the details. Bacharow did not rule out the possibility that this agreement could be signed by the prime ministers of the two countries during Viktor Chernomyrdin's forthcoming visit to Minsk. Nikolayev stated at a news conference in Zaslavl that this was the first such agreement between Russia and another CIS country. Replying to a question from the correspondent about the future of the Russian-Belarus border, Nikolayev said: If not just [Belarus] national interests but also Russian interests are protected on the borders between Belarus and non-Commonwealth states and the interests of Belarus are protected on Russian borders, if the heads of government sign the document that has been initialled, then totally new relations will begin and there will be no reason for having any special regime on the border between Russia and Belarus. In the opinion of the head of Russia's Federal Border Service, the border with Belarus should be open. This will require the drawing together of the two countries' laws and other normative documents, the coordination of customs services activities and health control. If the internal borders of the CIS are to be closed, Nikolayev noted, then the economic alliance between the countries of the Commonwealth will never begin to operate properly. At the meeting near Minsk there was also discussion on the question of creating identical border regimes on Russia's and Belarus' borders with Latvia and Lithuania. Nikolayev said that the Russian Federation was ready to carry out an expert examination of the work carried out in Belarus and to pay its share. This, Bacharow stated, would comprise up to 50 percent of Belarus' expenditure in building and equipping installations on the borders with the Baltic countries.
