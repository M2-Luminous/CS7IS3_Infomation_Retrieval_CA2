It was precisely thanks to the recent increase in Russian diplomatic activity, Yasir 'Arafat continues, that certain difficulties which arose in the negotiating process were overcome, allowing it to resume in Cairo.

He takes this opportunity to pass on the warmest and most sincere greetings to the peoples of Russia.
