FR941116-0-00065 FR941116-0-00012 18 CFR Part 348 [Docket No. RM94&hyph;1&hyph;000] Market-based Ratemaking for Oil Pipelines Issued October 28, 1994. AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations to adopt filing requirements and procedures with respect to an application by an oil pipeline for a determination that it lacks significant market power in the markets in which it proposes to charge market-based rates. This rule adopts procedural rules in order to implement the Commission's Order 561 market-based ratemaking policy, which was published in the Federal Register on November 4, 1993. In that order, the Commission adopted a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines, which is an indexing system to establish ceilings on those rates. The Commission also continued its policy of allowing an oil pipeline to attempt to show that it lacks significant market power in the market in which it proposes to charge market-based rates. However, an oil pipeline may not charge market-based rates until the Commission concludes that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeffrey A. Braunstein, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;2114.

Order No. 572 I. Introduction The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) hereby adopts procedural rules governing an oil pipeline's application for a Commission finding that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. The present rule is a companion to Order No. 561. 1 There, the Commission adopted a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines to fulfill the requirements of Title VIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Act of 1992). 2 That methodology is an indexing system to establish ceilings on oil pipeline rates. The Commission also will permit, under defined circumstances, the use of two alternative methodologies. These are the use of a cost-of-service methodology and the use of settlement rates. In addition, in Order No. 561, the Commission continued its policy of allowing an oil pipeline ``to attempt to show that it lacks significant market power in the market in which it proposes to charge market-based rates.'' 3 Under Order No. 561, however, an oil pipeline may not charge market-based rates until the Commission concludes that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. 4 The present rule adopts procedural rules in order to implement Order No. 561's market-based ratemaking policy. 1 Revisions to Oil Pipeline Regulations pursuant to Energy Policy Act, Order No. 561, 58 FR 58785 (November 4, 1993), III Stats. & Regs. ¶ 30,985 (1993), order on reh'g and clarification, Order No. 561&hyph;A, 59 FR 40243 (August 8, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 31,000 (1994). 2 42 U.S.C. 7172 note (West Supp. 1993). 3 18 CFR 342.4(b) to be effective January 1, 1985. 4 Id . II. Public Reporting Requirement The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the rule will increase the existing reporting burden associated with FERC&hyph;550 by an estimated 510 hours annually_an average of 255 hours per response based on an estimated 2 responses. The information filed by the oil pipelines will be collected by the Commission under FERC&hyph;550 ``Oil Pipeline Rates: Tariff Filings.'' FERC&hyph;550 is a designation covering oil pipeline tariff filings made to the Commission. The estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, researching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The current annual reporting burden is 5,350 hours based on an estimated 535 responses from approximately 140 respondents.
