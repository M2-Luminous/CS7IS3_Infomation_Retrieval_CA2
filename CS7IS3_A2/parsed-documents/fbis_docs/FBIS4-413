Patterton] [Text] Skukuza April 8 SAPA -- The summit of South Africa's four top political leaders was still underway in the Kruger National Park late on Friday [8 April] afternoon. The four -- State President F W de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela -- began their talks at 3.30PM and there was no indication when the meeting would end. A large contingent of journalists were restricted to the Skukuza area as they were not allowed into the Jakkalsbessie Camp, the venue for the talks, government spokesman Marius Kleynhans said. King Zwelithini was at Skukuza on Thursday night, while Mr Mandela, Mr Buthelezi and Mr de Klerk arrived on Friday morning. The ANC leader and the Zulu king met from 9.30AM to 2PM, Mr Kleynhans said. King Goodwill's delegation included about 20 indunas [chiefs], and the ANC was represented by Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa, Executive Committee member Mac Maharaj and Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo. The four leaders met to discuss the future of kwaZulu/Natal, violence, and whether elections would be possible in the province. Journalists battled to file stories as only one pay card telephone line was available at Skukuza for the media. While the government and other delegations earlier refused to disclose the venue of the talks, the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] had advance notice and arrived at Skukuza with an outside broadcast truck to provide coverage of the event.
