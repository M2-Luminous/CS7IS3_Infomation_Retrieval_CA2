Chubays believes that by the end of the year this figure will reach 85-90 per cent. Also 80 per cent of 20,000 large industrial enterprises subject to privatisation have changed hands, he said. Speaking at a closed-door session of the Russian Government Presidium on Thursday, the vice-premier said that the privatisation voucher has already paid off. As of April 1, 1994 105 million privatisation vouchers had been collected. That leaves about 45 million vouchers to be still collected. A total of 650 voucher investment funds have been set up in the country. The major result of privatisation is that joint stock companies and privatised enterprises remain open to foreign and domestic investors, Chubays said. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that the Russian Government will not backtrack on the course of reforms, adding, however, that "we must be sure that we are going the right way. Particularly, we must make sure that privatisation does not turn out to be a sham."
