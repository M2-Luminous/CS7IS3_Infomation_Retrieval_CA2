Gelbard warned the United States could reduce its aid to countries, like Panama, which have not curbed drug trafficking. "Expressing criticism that does not seriously reflect the true attitude and determination of the Panamanian Government in its fight against this powerful and international network of crimes is unacceptable," Mulino warned in a note sent to Deane Hinton, U.S. ambassador to Panama. On 10 February, Gelbard told the international press that the Clinton administration is studying the possibility of cutting aid to countries like Panama, Bolivia, Peru, and other drug-producing countries or countries where drug traffickers operate and where they have not been punished. Mulino recalled that since 1990, the Panamanian Government has been taking "serious and decisive" actions to fight the laundering of drug money. "I reiterate my concern for the inexplicable delay the U.S. Senate has experienced in ratifying the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty on penal matters, signed by the United States and Panama in April 1991," and which has been approved by the Panamanian Legislative Assembly. According to the diplomat, all these years of postponements with respect to this important legal instrument "undermines your government official's authority to criticize." In his letter, the foreign minister chronologically recounts at least 12 measures Panama has taken against drug trafficking as well as the agreements and treaties signed with other countries. Mulino adds that "not even the United States, with all its resources, has been able to effectively control drug consumption. But this real impossibility is not an excuse to carelessly say that this government is not working to control" this problem.
