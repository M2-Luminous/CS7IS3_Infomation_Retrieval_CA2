Mr Adams said the three-day ceasefire from Tuesday [29 March] created the opportunity to remove the stalemate that had developed around clarification of the Downing Street declaration. Its significance lay "in the potential it creates," he told a rally in Belfast. The British Government had brought about a stand-off in the peace process and "erected a roadblock around the issue of clarification." Now, the ceasefire initiative provided the chance "for Sinn Fein and the London government to remove the clarification roadblock so that the peace process can move forward." "We are not concerned to force a public climbdown by John Major," said Mr Adams. "We will be flexible. But we will not accept anything less after 25 years of hard, relentless struggle, than the right of our supporters to be treated like all other citizens. We ask for no more or no less." Mr McGuinness, speaking in Dublin, told supporters "the potential of the IRA's initiative must not be underestimated." It was a "significant and unprecedented initiative" which had created a substantial opportunity to move the situation "out of the current stalemate and on to the next phase of the peace process." Mr McGuinness said: "This is the beginning, not the end of the process. We in Sinn Fein have asked for meaningful discussions with the British Government. Discussion and dialogue are essential elements in any peace process." [passage omitted]
