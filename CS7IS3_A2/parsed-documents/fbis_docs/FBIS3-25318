The prime minister said this yesterday in his welcome speech on the occasion of the visit of President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and President Quett Masire of Botswana. Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle said their mission in Lesotho is a peacemaking one necessitated by an important recognition that African countries can no longer afford conflicts that have wrecked the continent. He noted with appreciation the rapid progress being made toward a non-racial democracy in South Africa, and the unwavering support of the Frontline States to the liberation struggle in that country. He said conflicts are the scourge that has bedeviled Africa for ages, adding that they are to blame for economic difficulties and poverty in which most African peoples find themselves. Meanwhile, the two presidents will be taken on a conducted tour to the Lesotho Highlands Development Project at Katse today.
