FR940124-0-00006 FR940124-0-00001 Additionally, restricting awards under W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to issues ``raised within the statutory time frames of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) or within an enforcement action'' would improperly limit the type of proceedings for which an award may be made. As previously noted, section 525(e) of SMCRA allows awards in connection with ``any administrative proceeding under this Act.'' Furthermore, the meaning of the new State statutory language is unclear since W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) does not establish timeframes for appealing agency actions. Instead, it merely specifies the time within which the regulatory authority must render a decision on a permit application. To be consistent with NRDC, supra, in which the IBLA found the plaintiffs eligible for an award of costs and expenses pursuant to section 525(e) of SMCRA as a result of their participation in an administrative appeal of a decision on a permit application, Wyoming must likewise authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative review of regulatory authority decisions on permit applications. Even if the State language were to be interpreted as including permit application decisions, restricting award eligibility to proceedings involving either enforcement actions or decisions on permit applications is inconsistent with Utah International, supra. Although the opinion accompanying the Utah International decision contains numerous statements that section 525(e) does not apply to nonenforcement administrative proceedings, the court ultimately awarded attorney fees to the plaintiffs in this case as a result of their participation in judicial proceedings concerning a designation of certain lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations. Decisions on petitions to designate lands as unsuitable for mining are not enforcement actions or proceedings. Therefore, the court clearly did not intend to limit attorney fee awards to proceedings concerning enforcement actions. In NRDC, the IBLA specifically rejected the argument that Utah International restricts the scope of section 525(e) in this fashion. 107 IBLA 359&hyph;60. The Board further stated that ``[t]here is no question that Congress intended to encompass more than section 525 enforcement proceedings within the bounds of section 525(e)'' (107 IBLA 356, emphasis in original), and that ``[a]t best, the legislative history supports a limitation of section 525(e) to adjudicatory proceedings'' (107 IBLA 357). Therefore, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i), which contains the provision in question, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA, and he is not approving it. The Secretary notes that the regulations submitted by the State do not contain this defect: Chapter V, Section 2.a.(3) of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure allows the award of costs and expenses to any person who ``initiates or participants in any contested case proceeding under the act'' (emphasis added). 4. Award of Costs and Expenses: Requirement for Separate and Distinct Contribution [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii)] Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to specify that a participant in an eligible proceeding who did not initiate the proceeding may receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if that person's contribution is separate and distinct from the contribution made by the person initiating the proceeding. Neither section 525(e) of SMCRA nor the corresponding Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1294(b) contain a similar provision. However, the preamble to 43 CFR 4.129(a)(1) clarifies that this requirement is implicit in the provision that, to be eligible for an award, the party must have made a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of the issues (50 FR 47223, November 15, 1985). Since 43 CFR 4.1294(b) contains a ``substantial contribution'' provision identical to that of paragraph (a)(1), the same rationale would apply. Accordingly, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii), which adds the ``separate and distinct'' stipulation, is not inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations, and is approving it. 5. Award of Costs and Expenses: Requirement for Establishment of Existence of Violation [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii)] Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to allow the award of costs and expenses from the State only if the person claiming eligibility for such an award establishes the existence of a specific violation of an applicable statute or rule. Neither section 525(e) of SMCRA nor the Federal regulations contain equivalent language.
