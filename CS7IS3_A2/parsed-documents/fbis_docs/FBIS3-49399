According to his classified letter, circulated in 300 copies down the military chain of command last November, the president's advisors in his military office will rank as deputy commanders of an armed service to deputy chiefs of General Staff. The daily quotes the letter in full and cites anonymous experts in constitutional law as describing the act as a flagrant violation of the Constitution. "They do not rule out the possibility of demanding the president's removal from office in pursuance of Article 103 of Bulgarian Constitution," TRUD adds. A signed commentary in the same daily stresses that if President Zhelev nevertheless survives this scandal, he will have to learn a good lesson. For its part, the Socialists' daily DUMA quotes a well-known anonymous politician as saying that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov was kept in the dark about the letter for several weeks. Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, declined to comment on the president's order for DUMA yesterday.
