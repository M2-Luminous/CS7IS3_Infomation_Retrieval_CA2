The meeting between the prime minister and the UGT [General Workers Union] and Workers Commissions leaders confirmed that the government will not be offering compromises following the 27 January general strike. Felipe Gonzalez told Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez directly the same thing that he had told them by letter: The negotiation on the labor reform will not be reopened, and he again referred them to an agreement with the CEOE [Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations], which the latter has rejected. Antonio Gutierrez and Nicolas Redondo did not conceal their tense faces following an hour and one-half meeting with the prime minister, which they described as "extremely serious." The Workers Commissions leader asserted that they went to the Moncloa Palace "devoid of any arrogant tone," and left with a "no" to their requests for negotiation. "There are several incomprehensible things which the country must know," Gutierrez asserted: "The prime minister is ignoring the strike: we came to discuss the labor reform, and he came out with the incomes agreement and does not wish to take part in the endeavor to extricate this country from the conflict." The two trade unionists forecast a future of considerable tension in collective bargaining and in labor relations. They also made this known in these terms to the prime minister, to whom they also set out all their arguments for rejecting the labor reform, including the argument that "only time will tell whether these measures will create jobs." "We believe that they will not, and that employers will dismiss many workers," according to Nicolas Redondo. They also informed him of their refusal to be referred to a dialogue with the CEOE, when its leaders have refused to negotiate these measures with the trade unions. The two trade union leaders met previously at midmorning in Redondo's office in order to prepare the messages that they were going to present to the prime minister. Their main aim was to prevent the Moncloa Palace meeting from becoming a mere "courtesy meeting," as it had been described by Marcos Pena, secretary general for employment and coordinator of the 33 meetings held by the administration and the social agents between last July and November, at which no agreement was reached. The Workers Commissions and UGT top leaders asked Felipe Gonzalez for "some gesture" in order to restore the dialogue so that substantial changes can be made to the labor reform -- the catalyst of the general strike. Method of Discussion The method of or framework for discussion is not the basic issue for the trade unions. They were seeking a direct dialogue with the government, although the parliamentary procedure is continuing its course, and in fact they will be holding contacts with the political groups in order to propose amendments to them. Gutierrez and Redondo reminded the head of government that negotiation was possible on other laws which were passing through parliament: The Workers' Statute, the Organic Law on Trade Union Freedom, and the abortive Strike Law -- the first under a Union of the Democratic Center government and the other two in the Socialist period. The prime minister's proposal for negotiating an incomes agreement was not accepted by the trade unionists, since they believed that it would be possible only if that agreement applied to all incomes -- wages and business incomes -- and if the government had provided some way to resolve the disagreements over the labor reform. Antonio Gutierrez stated that they told the prime minister "what we have said so far, which is that the country is certainly in no mood for compliments or courtesies, but rather for becoming involved very seriously in resolving a grave social problem. I believe that the prime minister should regard this not only as a duty but also, if you press me, even as an honor. A head of government cannot alter the fact that this country has just experienced a general strike. He must consider how to resolve matters." Difficult To Reconcile These assertions by the Workers Commissions leader are difficult to reconcile with the demand made by CEOE Chairman Jose Maria Cuevas to the head of government at a later meeting which had not ended when this issue went to press. Cuevas made it clear that the government must not backtrack on the labor reform. He also told him that the employers' confederation is not prepared to reopen the dialogue with the trade unions because it has already noted the enormous differences between them over the changes which should take place in labor relations.
