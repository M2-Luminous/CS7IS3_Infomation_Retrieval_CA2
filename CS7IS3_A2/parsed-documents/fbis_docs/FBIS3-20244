This is why we are waiting before we express our definitive reaction and satisfaction. We are waiting for these figures to become certain and final. We all hope they will be similar to the ones we know already. To tell you the truth, I hope that in the end we shall have even better figures. Given the enthusiasm of people and the consensus we have had so far, I think these figures will get even better. I think we can already reach some conclusions. We started, very frightened, many months ago. We made the decision to take part in the elections three months ago. The situation was completely different. There was the organized team of the Left, which was about to come to power. They were convinced they had power already. We saw before us an uncertain future, a future for our country which was leading to something resembling a regime, something which would have not been true democracy and true freedom. We then decided to participate, naming the alliance between Forza Italia, the League in the north, the Christian Democratic Center, the Union of the Center, some friends among the Radicals, and the National Alliance in the center and in the south the Freedom Alliance. Since we wanted to work in a different way in order to respond to Italy's real problems, we added the name of Good Government. It is now the Freedom and Good Government Alliance. I think that -- considering these figures -- we can already say that the Freedom Alliance has already reached its most important goal: to give our country a future of democracy and freedom.
