The coalition parties held a meeting of the Policy Affairs Council at the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] headquarters and began a final review of ministries' budget requests and details of the tax revenue plan, while excluding from it the matter of reducing the income tax and covering the shortfalls therefrom. The government is hoping to have a Finance Ministry draft of the 1994 budget completed [for submission to the cabinet] by 10 February. Party officials in charge of taxation are due to join this meeting in the afternoon. In the afternoon meeting, the parties are expected to exchange views concerning how the government and the ruling parties should adjust their stands on the question of financial resources to fund the cuts in revenue. Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], when speaking on a commercial television program this morning, said that even though the mass media have claimed that the public welfare tax came out of nowhere, it has been discussed time and again in following the appropriate steps in the coalition parties. He said that people should stop speaking out emotionally and instead should start discussing the substance of the matter in a calmer manner. On the other hand, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet Affairs Committee, spoke on a different television program and said: It is all right to discuss sources of revenue necessary for welfare, but the party's view is that two to three years should be allotted to such discussions. He said that the SDPJ has no choice but to quit the government should the latter insist on pushing ahead and going ahead with the plan.
