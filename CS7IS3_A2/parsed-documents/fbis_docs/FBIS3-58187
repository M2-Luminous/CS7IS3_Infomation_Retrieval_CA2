Imset; punctuation as published] [Text] Turkey last week found itself once again in the midst of a debate with regard to taboos over the country's Armed Forces and whether anyone had the right to call for the lifting of such taboos without ending up being branded as a traitor. Strongly-worded statements made by Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures were undoubtedly the highlights of the debate, in the form of a top level warning to all who dared to table and discuss such issues. On the one hand, there were reports of increased draft evasion spreading throughout the country. On the other, Gures' own son Serdar had become a target for criticism, suspected of using family influence to dodge compulsory military service. As if this was not enough, two journalists had even dared to put on a TV program about draft evasion. Coming one after another, these developments clearly disturbed Gen. Gures for, during a visit to Bolu, he departed from his official text and ended up delivering an ultimatum. According to him, the debate targeted the very command center of the Turkish Armed Forces and was the work of "dwarfs and miserable people," individuals and groups with the aim of inflicting damage on the Turkish military. It is still not clear which of the developments was the last straw for Gures but the general suspicion is that his latest statement, which put to flight many newsmen, was designed to defend Serdar more than the army itself. Those journalists who refused to be scared thus ended up defending their position in commentaries, and underlining that they had no wish to damage the armed forces but wanted only to deal with the deficiencies of the whole system. It quickly became apparent that what was debated was not military service and/or Serdar's conduct but the fate and functioning of Turkish democracy as a whole. What Gen. Gures did last week, in the words of one prominent columnist, was to slap the press across the face... A Blow to Serdar The whole debate actually started months ago with reports that Serdar Gures was a draft evader. News was that this bright new name of mischief in Turkish society, an apprentice actor climbing the ladder of success, was using family influence to dodge his military service. Serdar was not a new name for Turks fond of scandal or society pages. It was claimed that he had once been escorted by troops in a hotel raid which he organized as part of a personal vendetta. His name also surfaced in a holiday resort where he allegedly used a police pistol to bash the head of someone he had fought with. Then there were numerous reports of his alleged love affairs. This year, when his dog was said to have been killed by poisoning, there were even claims that the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was warning the father through the son's pet. Serdar, it appeared, was a focus for scandal reports and did little to keep out of the media's way. His name had surfaced as early as last year when a left-wing weekly magazine noted in its cover story that a majority of officers' children did not serve in the troubled Southeast region, where more than 2,000 security personnel have died since 1984 in Ankara's war on separatist terrorism. It resurfaced sometime last month immediately after Turkey's Defence Minister announced publicly that the number of draft dodgers in this country had reached an all-time high of 250,000--about half the current strength of Turkey's army. The statement led to debate on what could be done to fill this gap, and there was much speculation that the entire military service system would be reviewed and that the term of service could be increased despite Turkey's drive for a more compact and modern army. In the process, prison terms and fines for draft evaders were increased. As for Serdar, he was cited among the 250,000 and there were claims that he had evaded military service by extending his term in school. The report, however, was a mere claim until his teachers at the state conservatory, led by Ahmet Levendoglu, held a shocking press conference at which they disclosed the truth. Serdar, who had been attending the drama department at Istanbul University's State Conservatory for the last five years, allegedly was accepted by the school due to pressures exerted by his family, and although he was not even attending classes, had managed to graduate to the fourth year. Actor and director Levendoglu, who previously resigned from the board of education to protest at Serdar's special treatment, told journalists that Gen. Gures's son had been accepted into the school through the influence of then rector Cem'i Demiroglu. He was reportedly brought to the school by a senior aide of his father's and there and then became a student. But he failed classes for two years and did not fulfill his student requirements. He did not attend rehearsals but despite all of this, managed to continue his studies for the duration of five years. The Response The irony of the whole issue was that the incident emerged at the same time as Ankara's efforts for further recruitment and it was clear that what Serdar was doing was overshadowing these efforts. If--as the son of Chief of Staff--he was indeed evading military service, then how could the Chief of Staff's office explain to the rest of the Turkish people why they should go and fight for their country, and perhaps die in the process, in the troubled Southeast? Moreover, reports of Serdar's alleged draft dodging coincided with a strongly-worded statement from Chief of Staff spokesman, Col. Dogu Silahcioglu. At about the same time that Turkey was debating what Serdar had done, Silahcioglu made a statement referring to draft dodgers and said, "The nation will probably never forgive them...those who should really be sorry for what is happening are the families of the people who will do anything to avoid military service and thereby have lost their principal values." According to him, draft evaders would certainly be punished "the way they deserve, and will live with this disgrace for the rest of their lives." Arrested Newsmen Just at the moment when Turkey had Dogan and Serdar Gures as well as the overall draft dodging crisis on the operating table, the Chief of Staff took one step which further complicated the debate. Already, eyes were turned on Dogan Gures due to the behaviour of his son, and there were questions on what he was planning to do about his own family while calling on others to serve their country. Statements by Silahcioglu and the defense minister had further escalated the debate and, naturally, all reporters were interested in covering the issue in one way or the other. Draft evasion had thus become a highlighted issue on the country's agenda. All newspapers and television channels were covering it in one way or the other and it was getting as much attention as the PKK. At this juncture, two television newsmen made a crucial mistake and literally ended up as scapegoats. On one hand, the country's military was furious at the draft dodgers. On the other, they had too many problems to face in the Southeast where--despite all the rosy statements--there was no observable improvement. And there were the accusations against Serdar Gures. Under these circumstances, Turkey's highest level military official gave the necessary orders: two newsmen working for the popular Anten program on the private television channel HBB were arrested for broadcasting interviews on draft evasion. They were not only arrested but they were arrested by a military court. For the first time since the military coup of 1980, which put thousands of people on trial, civilians once again faced a military tribunal in Turkey. According to the prosecutor's indictment, producer Erhan Akyildiz and reporter Ali Tevfik Berder, had broadcasted material that encouraged Turks to evade military service. In their documentary on Turkish draft dodgers and deserters from the Army, two people interviewed were quoted as saying they were against compulsory military service and would not service in the military if given the choice. Akyildiz (46) and Berber (34) were arrested and hauled into the Mamak military prison, where once thousands of political inmates were detained by the military. Arrest warrants were also issued for the two Turks they had interviewed. The case took a turn for the worse when the Naval Forces Command court turned down an attorney's request for the release of the two suspects. Protests in the press started at once and the incident was highlighted in the newspapers, magazines and on television channels. There were numerous appeals to the President, Suleyman Demirel, to intervene on behalf of the newsmen. There was also widespread criticism of two civilians being tried at military courts. But, as Demirel said later on, this was the law and the law did give permission for "crimes" committed against the military institution to be judged by military courts--under military laws. Still, Akyildiz and Berber were released at their first hearing. The military prosecutor explained that their arrest had already served its purpose, possibly meaning: a warning. The chief judge, also a military officer, explained to the defendants that the prosecutor would not have acted on his own initiative but would have filed the case under orders from superiors. It was evident where the order had come from. How much this ordeal has helped Turkey and encouraged military service is yet to be seen, though it appears that instead of one single television news report on draft dodging simply losing its importance and fading from memory, what happened afterwards has eroded the military more than anything else. Gures Reacts It was inevitable that the debate on how much control the Turkish military has on the entire political system should resurface. And, accordingly, Gen. Gures spoke out. In his first statement, while inspecting Turkish commando forces in western Turkey, he reaffirmed that "the armed forces are a guardian of democracy... Everything will remain within the boundaries of democracy. No one should have doubts about this. Turkey will, until eternity, protect its unitarian structure," he said. His most interesting remark, though, was that the military was trying to keep out of politics. He also emphasized Turkey's increasing stature in the region and the growing importance of the Turkish armed forces. If he wanted to get support for this statement, he go it from Ciller whose own statement coincided with that of Gures. They are working 24 hours a day to protect us, it said. But what actually appeared to stir matters up, was another statement Gures made at the end of last week. According to sources, this was an unrehearsed speech and reflected the personal views of the Chief of Staff. Last Friday, while inspecting troops in Bolu, Gures lashed out strongly at those demanding the lifting of the taboos on the Turkish Armed Forces, and branded them as dwarfs and miserable people. Gures warned that in the "critical days" Turkey was passing through, there would be "accusations and attacks" on Turkish military commanders. For him, the Turkish Armed Forces were too powerful to be "eroded by the vociferous statements of the dwarfs. "These miserable people are hiding behind democratic remarks like the Turkish Armed Forces is not taboo and hiding their real intentions," Gures said. "We are living through critical days but we will overcome everything." Saying that the Turkish nation strongly supported the struggle of the Turkish military, Gures said, "But from time to time, and especially during critical periods, people who are vociferous and organizations that are low in figure and dwarfish in quantity, can appear and make baseless accusations and attacks on military commanders. I am saying we are surprised and sorrowed by this." Gures warned that such circles may have taken on a mission specifically against the interests of the country and added, "Some of those accusing the Turkish Armed Forces want to produce ideas without knowing what is happening, while some are after showing off and running after cheap heroism. Another group which is not aware of the threat is on the same tack." Gures added, however, that these were not the dangerous ones and pointed out that "those who are dangerous are people and organizations who have taken on duties for special purposes. The danger is the terrorist organization, it collaborators and its supporters in words and print. Don't worry, the Turkish nation is after them." Serdar Lashes Out Gures's statement was a strong one and met with a strong reaction in various quarters. Although a majority of Turkey's columnists held back from replying, it was interesting that a majority took the threats personally. There was an undeclared agreement not to turn the issue into a personal vendetta. Some, however, did push the matter a bit, and there were appeals from the bolder columnists for Gures to be relieved from duty. There was criticism of his conduct and demands for the Turkish democracy to work. Once again, the prestige of the military was being eroded from within. And this was not the end of the story. Immediately after his father's reference to the traitors, as if he had been waiting for the chance to get even, Serdar spoke out as the second-in-line of the Gures family. In an exclusive interview with the Turkish daily MILLIYET, conducted in a luxurious 21st floor suite at Istanbul's Harbiye Officers' Club hostel, Serdar not only voiced anger at recent press reports directed at him but gave his support to his father's accusations. He argued that such reports--that he was at the state conservatory through his father's influence and was evading military service--lowered the morale of Turkish soldiers serving their country in the troubled Southeast. He said that those who spread such "rumors" were "traitors" who were actually after his father but could not reach him directly. He also warned that the press was placing too much pressure on him and said, "I could kill a journalist." Serdar, clearly with the courage he received from his fathers statements, spoke not like an ordinary actor or the draft dodger he was accused of being, but as if he was a field marshal. His messages were clear: "Traitors are behind the rumors about me..." "The rumors are spread by those who cannot reach my father..." "Claims about me are damaging the morale of the solders in the east..." "They are pressing me too much. If they go on like this, I could shoot a journalist." The Days Ahead Today, no one truly knows what is in store for Turkey in the days ahead, but indications are that the Turkish Armed Forces will be on the agenda more than ever. Despite threats and warnings, an issue which was barely heard of now has a place high on Turkey's list of priorities. Also, many of the country's intellectuals are worried that the Turkish democracy, in this era of development, may actually be developing towards a secret authoritarianism. The most recent debate has clearly raised questions on the country's military apparatus, and the amount of authority it enjoys. And there are bound to be more questions in the future. What matters most, however, is for Turkey to get through this debate without damaging the prestige and morale of its armed forces, which is a crucial part of the overall system. Looking at the recent ordeal, it is abundantly clear that the military has to take more care over this than the civilians. Meanwhile, as part of the democratization drive, there is the need to lift all taboos on the armed forces even if it requires major amendments in the laws, in the constitution, and, most important of all, in the position of the Chief of Staff. Perhaps, the whole issue is the result of the fact that still, in the last decade of the 20th century, the Turkish Chief of Staff is not connected to the Ministry of Defence and is only "responsible" to the prime minister. What this could mean, we have seen thrice in our contemporary history. The last thing we need is another example...
