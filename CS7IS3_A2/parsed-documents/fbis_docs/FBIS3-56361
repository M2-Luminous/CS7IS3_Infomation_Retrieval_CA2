ROSSIISKIYE VESTI carries pronouncements by prominent state and public figures under the front-page banner headline: "A Cabinet Reorganisation All of a Sudden Resulted in a Sunday Governemtnt Crisis". The newspaper runs the text of Gaydar's letter to President Boris Yeltsin. In the letter, gaydar expressed regret over the fact that decisions, in the preparation of which he did not participate and which he categorically objected to, used to be adopted increasingly often recently. IZVESTIYA: Gaydar's resignation was unexpected but not more than an earthquake in a quake-prone area. One can take various views of the policy suggested by Gaydar two years ago, but "the liberalisation of prices..., privatisation -- all are directed associated with Gaydar and his team, just as, incidentally, the decline in the living standards of a large proportion of people, shut-downs of factories and other hard problems connected with attempts to cure the chronic totalitarianism by means of a shock therapy". TRUD queries whether the resignation of the first vice-premier signifies a cardinal change in the reform policy, pointing out that "if a future government will lack Gaydar, Fedorov, Chubays and Pamfilova (the latter three are ministers in charge of finance, privatisation, and social protection of the population), the world community would view that as a sign that radical reforms in Russia are done away with." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on First Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar's resignation: Noting that Gaydar's example is being followed by other members of the Russian Governemnt, the newspaper points out that this happens at a noteworthy moment -- elections to the Federal Assembly (parliament) were held recently and parliamentary and political blocs have undergone a considerable regrouping. Next crucial moment in the life of Russia will be not so distant presidential elections. "Since representatives of the blocs hurried to distance themselves from the present government, it is quite logical to suppose that this is more advantageous that sharing responsibility with it". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject: The newspaper believes that Gaydar's resignation "cannot change in any way the nature of an economic policy of the Viktor Chernomyrdin government, because the governemnt had no policy to this effect even after Gaydar's comeback". "The point is that reforms-related theorising receded into the background six months ago with regard to the cabinet's trouble- shooting activities". PRAVDA strongly criticises the shock therapy policy, at the rise of which Gaydar stood. "Is it not his policy of slashing credits to industrial enterprises that leads to their shut-down everywhere and a steep increase in unemployment? Was it not he who wanted a common rouble zone within the CIS when the International Monetary Fund wanted it? Why then does he lament this?" SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, touching upon the work of the State Duma, points out in particular: "Fully confirmed has been the forecast that not a single side in the duma would have a solid edge while political clashes would get exacerbated and become even keener than was the case in the Supreme Soviet". TRUD carries an interview with President Nikolay Fyodorov of Chuvashia. "I am convinced that Chuvashia can develop and really prosper only as part of Russia", he said.
