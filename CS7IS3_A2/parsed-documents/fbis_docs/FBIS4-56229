In making its decision, the CC overturned a lower court's decision to temporarily suspend TSE Decree 2-94 of 11 April, which scheduled nationwide district elections for congressional deputies on 14 August. In reviewing the events, the CC contended that the circumstances in this case neither warranted the granting of the amparo writ nor the issuance of such a writ ex-officio, as supported in Article 28 of the law on this matter. Therefore, a repeal of the controversial resolution was in order. Both sides were immediately informed of this decision, according to CC Secretary Manuel Garcia. In turn, the CC added, the TSE may continue preparing for the elections as originally scheduled. Regarding an appeal filed by Deputy Arroyave Cerna, the CC confirmed it must continue to go through the relevant appeals process without posing any obstacle to the electoral process.
