One of the occupiers, who identified himself as "Commander Piloto," read a communique on a Managua radio station to announce that the peaceful occupation is part of the actions being carried out by fomrer contras to demand that the government fulfill the obligations in 1990 demobilization agreements. "We are demanding that we be given land, credits for productive programs, housing, and security for our lives," the leader of the occupiers stated. The occupation of the INRA building in Chinandega, 120 km west of Managua, is "in support of other brothers who maintain their demands" in Managua, stated the leader of the group. The group consists of 20 people, including men and women. Since Tuesday, a group of former contras have occupied the headquarters of the International Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS). Six other former members of the Nicaraguan Resistance are occupying the Colombian Embassy, where they have requested asylum. Nicaraguan authorities said today that they will not negotiate with the former contras. Authorities consider these acts of protest dangerous for the country's stability.
