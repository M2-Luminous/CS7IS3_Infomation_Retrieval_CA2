Some 1,000 Gaza residents were today allowed to enter the Green Line boundaries through the Erez roadblock. Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar reports that entry permits were granted not only to laborers but also to family members of Palestinians who are detained in Qezi'ot, as per an agreement reached in negotiations between Fatah and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The IDF commander in the Gaza Strip also permitted PLO people to enter Israel. They had been allowed free passage in the past, but their exit from the Strip was restricted after the imposition of the closure.
