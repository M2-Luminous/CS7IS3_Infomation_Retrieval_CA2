The deputy director of Baku State Radio and TV, Nahid Hajif, offered the above reason for terminating the program and hoped that the broadcast of the program would resume in the near future. He added that in view of the power shortage in Azerbaijan, Baku TV began to reduce its broadcasting hours two weeks ago. For the same reason, he said, the one-hour TV program of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Azeri will be terminated. As the Iranian Azeri program was terminated from Channel 1 of Baku TV, the BMTI channel of the network began to relay the English super channel programs. The one-hour Iranian TV program in Azeri started broadcasting from Baku TV early this year; it had a large audience. An informed source from the Iranian Embassy in Baku said that the issue of the termination of the Iranian TV program is under investigation. Diplomatic sources believe that the measure was taken in view of the recent moves by Moscow to diminish the Iranian role and presence in Central Asia.
