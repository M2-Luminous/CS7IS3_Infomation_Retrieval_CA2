Faced with this commando-style operation, employees and customers need an updated map of the group. We review resources and assets. The myth of the national computer champion has vanished for good; the company must salvage what it can from the wreckage. There is no time to lose: Bull must become privatizable within two years and must again break even, while Brussels opposes the payment of state subsidies. The reorganization carried out briskly by Jean-Marie Descarpentries will give responsibilities to managers, but it disrupts habits, and employees have trouble getting their bearings. In the very short term, they must identify profitable activities and then follow the method already applied at Athesa: set up a joint venture with a partner and become a subsidiary. Large Systems: A Stepping Stone for Other Divisions As Bull's sales decline (by 6.4 percent in 1993, down to 28.25 billion French francs [Fr], with Fr1.9 billion in operational losses), large systems see their share increase -- 25 percent of the activity in 1993. Although it is no longer a growth vector (new sales dropped by 10 percent in 1993), the Enterprise Servers division has an important mission. "I must maintain GCOS activity at as high a level as possible, while also following customers evolution, and in doing so serve as a stepping stone for the group's other divisions, whether Unix, FM [facilities management], or systems integration," division manager Francis Ackermann explained. Bull relies almost exclusively on its partners for the development of its product line, in particular on NEC for the successors of the new DPS 9000/900 (eight machines sold so far). If NEC should decide to increase its stakes in Bull, it is that division that would most certainly benefit from its contribution. Open Systems: To Make a Mutation Possible The Open Systems and Software Business (OSS) division alone supports most of Bull's technological innovation. The OSF [Open Software Foundation] just selected Bull as leading integrator of the Network Management Option, one of the three building blocks of the DME, the distributed management environment. In addition, Bull contributed its multiprocessing knowhow to design Pegasus, the Unix server running on an IBM Power PC, which should be introduced in spring. A DPX/20 cluster (code named Mississippi) is also expected for 1995. In the future, these should suffice to improve Bull's Unix sales, which have been quite low although Alain Couder, head of the OSS division, claims that "the DPX/20 have achieved 50 percent growth since 1992." Finally, the OSS division is betting on the EDP [electronic document processing] card with its Imageworks offer. That division enjoys international fame for its work, but it must still learn how to sell its technology. PC: To Take Advantage of the Market Momentum Although ZDS [Zenith Data Systems] is still responsible for a large part of the manufacturer's losses, it reported increased sales for the first time in 1993, 31 percent by value and 47 percent by volume. Marking a pause last year, the agreement with Packard-Bell gave ZDS some purchasing leverage. In France, the appointment of Michel Aguerreberry (the former Agena CEO) was intended to mobilize channels (60 percent of sales are still achieved among Bull's installed base) and eliminate delivery problems. The Angers site will become the European distribution center of ZDS, and Packard-Bell will set up an assembly plant there. The portable computer line will be renewed this year and it will emphasize servers. PDAs [expansion not given] were announced and the Compuprint entity (printers) was integrated. Now they must become profitable... Systems Integration: Stressing Expertise Formalized at last, Bull's systems integration offer has the advantage of a methodology (Mosic) and an international organization, and its objective is to sign two major contracts per country in 1994. The new Systems Integration Services (SIS) division will target the branches aimed at in each country (banking, insurance, distribution, etc.) and distribute a few international expertise centers in some of them. It is through partnerships that Bull intends to develop its expertise in networks, images, telecommunications, or security. Barely a few weeks old, SIS will have to face fierce competition, especially in France, although George McNeil, the division head, claims that "Bull does not intend to become a service company." FM: To Open Government Doors Announced with a flourish, the creation of Athesa, the French subsidiary of which is a joint-venture between CISI [International Company for Data Processing Services] and Bull, ambitions to convert government offices to facilities management. For the time being, the board of Athesa International, the holding company in which Bull will have a 51-percent interest, is still not complete. "Let's not put the cart before the horse. Athesa must first of all meet the needs of Bull's clients," Thierry Breton, head of the Systems Operations division and in charge of strategy, explained. It will fall to Jacques Tordjman (the former CEO OF EDS France) to succeed in a belated offensive on a market where entry stakes are high. He inherited, in France, Bull's internal data-processing department and the CISI contracts. Customer Service: From Maintenance to Service A recurring asset, customer service must increase the value-added content of its services and help improve Bull's image. Herve Mouren, head of the Customer Service division wants to increase the share of services to 25 percent, although maintenance still accounts for 90 percent of sales. As a result, the following will be developed: micro FM (a contract to manage 6,000 PCs at Elf Aquitaine was just signed), network management, and multibrand maintenance. This should make for increasingly complex relations between the various Bull divisions dedicated to service. In spite of all, Customer Service has the advantage of having a captive clientele and of being the only division to make a profit, with Enterprise Servers. To Specialize Sales People in Order to Ensure Growth One priority: to increase efforts outside the installed base. One mission: to make sure that Bull breaks even in 1994. Sales people are now specialized by client, by service, or by product. Each division head (products or services) and the sales force in charge of selling the products of that division have signed an agreement concerning the sales amount to be generated in 1994 and the resources allocated to achieve that goal. In France, the sales force supports four national and sectorial networks as well as the regional market directorate created in 1993. "Each customer now deals with only one network so as to improve our productivity and efficiency," we were told by Herve Mouren, head of Bull France. Although it reformed its pre-sales modes in 1993, Bull France, which had several general managers within a few years, cannot manage to overcome the paralysis of its sales force. This is due to a large extent to the uncertainty that prevails concerning the future and to the difficult implementation of the reorganization.

The first one is symbolized by new relations with the State, which will pay a Fr8-billion settlement and give us a free hand. The second one has to do with the reorganization of Bull's expertise by branch of activity, and my job is to find 100 executives to manage the corporation. The third one will enable us to turn things around and restart sales growth through a decentralization that will give free rein to the employees' spirit of enterprise. The entire group is energized so that we can break even in 1995. We are implementing a program to achieve savings of Fr2 billion and, already by June 1994, we will make decisions concerning activities that do not show any progress. We could have disinvested from 40 to 60 percent of the group's activities in order to break even. In 1995, 90 percent of the activities will still remain within Bull's perimeter. Each division will have to develop its own partnerships. To those partners we deem of strategic importance, we shall offer an opportunity to acquire equity in the division(s) concerned, including the sales networks. Later on, the equity of both the employees and the public in the company could be increased to 20 percent.
