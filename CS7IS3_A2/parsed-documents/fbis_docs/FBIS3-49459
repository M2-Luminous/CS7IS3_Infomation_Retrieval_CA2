As homage to Roman Dmowski, about 120 PWN supporters lit lamps and laid red and white carnations at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Jan Matejko Square. Under the slogans "Boleslaw Tejkowski for Polish president", "Nationalists not fascists", "Romanians go home", and "Germans and Jews get out of Polish Silesia", the demonstrators marched along the streets of the city toward Market Square, where they burned the flags. B. Tejkowski, the PWN chairman, told the rally and Cracow residents gathered in Market Square that Poland's attempts to join the European Union and President Walesa's intention to invite NATO armies to our garrisons constitute the greatest dangers for Poland at the moment. The police, who did not issue an official permit to the PWN for the rally, did not intervene.
