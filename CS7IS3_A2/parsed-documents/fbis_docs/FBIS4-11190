FBIS4-11190 "drlat079_f_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador Zamora Concerned by Poor Voter Turnout Zamora Concerned by Poor Voter Turnout PA2404201494 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1908 GMT 24 Apr 94 PA2404201494 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the leftist coalition, here today said that he is worried by the poor turnout of voters this morning when the voting sites opened. "Very early this morning I toured the city and saw that the turnout of voters was poor and this worries me," Zamora said. Zamora is the presidential candidate for the leftist coalition headed by the former rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). "I ask the Salvadorans to think of what is happening and to go and vote," Zamora said when calling on the 2.7 million registered voters to consider the importance this election has on the future of the country and to go out and cast their vote. The presidential candidate admitted that the electoral authorities corrected the mistakes reported during the first election held on 20 March. At that time, none of the parties that participated in the election attained the necessary majority -- half plus one of the votes cast -- to become president of the Republic. For this reason, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] called for a run-off election between the two leading candidates. Thus, Zamora and Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] candidate Armando Calderon Sol confronted each other today to decide which of the two will be president for the 1994-1999 term. Zamora has said that the experience gained in the first round made it possible for the coalition to be more alert at voting sites and prevent irregularities and fraud attempts. The TSE called the 2.7 million citizens with voting rights to go to the 381 voting sites, spread throughout the country's 262 municipalities. The election started at 0700 local (1300 GMT) and will close at 1700 (2300 GMT). The TSE expects to release the results of at least 30 percent of the vote four hours after closing time.
