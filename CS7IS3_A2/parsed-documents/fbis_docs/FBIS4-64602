She said that the CSCE had appealed to Norway in March to take part in a planned peacekeeping operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. After studying this matter and taking into account the situation in Bosnia, where Norwegian servicemen form part of the UN peacekeeping force, Norway's Defense Ministry considered it impossible to allocate a military contingent for a peacekeeping mission in the area of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. Kirsti Skjerven stressed: "The Ministry of Defense of Norway believes that it is necessary to concentrate our peacekeeping forces in one place and not scatter them about. The funds earmarked by the Norwegian parliament for maintaining peacekeeping forces abroad can thus be used in the best way." [passage omitted]
