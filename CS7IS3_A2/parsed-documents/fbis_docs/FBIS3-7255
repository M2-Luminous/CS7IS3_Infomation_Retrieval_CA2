The prime minister said: [Begin recording] [Chuan] As a matter of fact, we can bar them from entering our country. We must look after them for humanitarian reasons. Those carrying arms must be disarmed before their entry. [Unidentified reporter] After the situation is safe, do we simply send them back? [Chuan] This means allowing them tp cross the border into their country. We will not put them on buses and send them home because they came here without an invitation. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] [Chuan] These Cambodians are not permanent refugees. If the problem drags on, however, we should coordinate with the UNHCR [United Nations High Commission for Refugees] because we might be accused of supporting the Khmer Rouge. It is better to have outsiders come here to see the problem themselves. The problem is not that bad at this point. The refugees will not remain here for a long period of time. After the situation is safe, they must go. [Reporter] It appears that the Cambodian Government is rather unhappy with the sudden repatriation of refugees without being contacted. The refugees reportedly returned to the areas under Khmer Rouge control. [Chuan] We have no right to tell them where to resettle. They came here themselves. They have the right to go where they want. They are not permanent refugees. If that were the case, they would have been taken care of by international agencies from the very beginning. If they are going to be here for a long time, however, we will have to seek help from international organizations. The presence of Cambodian refugees has already caused a financial burden to the agencies involved. I heard complaints about this last Tuesday. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Chuan] The food supplies they carried with them will last only a short time. We will have to feed them later. [Reporter] [Wordsindistinct] [Chuan] They can choose where they want to stay after crossing the border. We will not force them to leave. [Reporter] If the UNHCR asks Thailand to keep the refugees for an unspecified period, will we... [Chuan, interrupting] We must decide if this is necessary or not. [end recording]
