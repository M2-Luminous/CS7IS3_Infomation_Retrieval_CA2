FR940314-1-00006 FR940314-1-00002 Note: The FAA's normal policy is that when an AD requires a substantive change, such as a change in its applicability, the ``old'' AD is superseded by removing it from the system and a new AD is added. In the case of this AD action, the FAA normally would have proposed superseding AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 to expand its applicability to include the additional affected airplanes. However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by a supersedure action, and the consequent workload associated with revising maintenance record entries, the FAA has determined that a less burdensome approach is to issue a separate AD applicable only to these additional airplanes. This AD does not supersede AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01; airplanes listed in the applicability of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 are required to continue to comply with the requirements of that AD. This proposed AD is a separate AD action, and is applicable only to airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive.) The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,375, or $55 per airplane. The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $199 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $17,350 or $694 per airplane. Based on the figures, above, the total (inspection plus modification) cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $18,725 or $749 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Canadair: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;222&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive; certificated in any category. Note 1: Airplanes having serial numbers 5001 through 5098, inclusive, are subject to the requirements of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8026. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent loss of emergency power to the essential bus when the air driven generator (ADG) is deployed, accomplish the following: (a) Within 25 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, inspect to detect chafing of the wiring harness of the ADG in accordance with Canadair Alert Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0370, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1993. If chafing is found, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with the service bulletin. (b) Within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, modify the harness installation of the ADG in accordance with Canadair Alert Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0370, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1993. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on March 8, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
