The organisation, which held an extraordinary meeting in Beirut this week, said the Libyan authorities were most probably behind the abduction of Mansur al-Kikhya who vanished on December 11 in the Egyptian capital where he was attending a conference of Arab human rights group. The organisation invited Libya in a statement distributed to the press in the Lebanese capital to "counter these suspicions based on official Libyan declarations made around this date, calling for the elimination of the opposition and killing its leaders." The head of the Arab human rights organisation, Adib al-Jadir, told AFP that al-Qadhdhafi made such statements on December 12. Al-Kikhya, 63, served as foreign minister under Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in the 1970s and represented Libya at the United Nations between 1976 and 1980. He later became the leader of the main opposition movement the National Rally. The Libyan opposition has accused the Libyan government of kidnapping al-Kikhya. Tripoli denied any involvement in the affair, saying he was a victim of a feud between opposition groups. Friday's statement also urged Egypt to "pursue its efforts to guarantee the return of Mr. al-Kikhya." The human rights group is a Cairo-based non-governmental organisation, founded 10 years ago with members from all over the Arab world and offices in 15 Arab cities and six European capitals.
