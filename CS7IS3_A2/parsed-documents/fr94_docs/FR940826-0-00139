FR940826-0-00139 FR940826-0-00020 H. Unjust Enrichment Provisions 120. Petitions. AIDE requests that when the Commission recaptures the benefits accruing to a designated entity pursuant to the unjust enrichment provisions, the unjust enrichment penalty should credit the licensee's pre-sale investments in the license and should be based on the portion of the licensee's taxable gain on the sale allocated to the license, with appropriate adjustments. BET similarly requests that the Commission revise the unjust enrichment provisions to credit the designated entity for its pre-transfer expenditures on the license including construction costs. 121. Discussion. We deny the requests of AIDE and BET. In the Second Report and Order the Commission crafted unjust enrichment provisions designed to prevent designated entities from profiting by the rapid sale of licenses acquired through the benefit of provisions and policies meant to encourage their participation in the provision of spectrum-based services. These rules were intended to deter designated entities from prematurely transferring licenses obtained through the benefit of provisions designed to create opportunities for such designated entities in the provision of spectrum-based services. We sought through our unjust enrichment provisions to discourage designated entities who do not intend to provide service to the public from abusing our provisions by obtaining a license at a lower cost than other licensees and then selling the license after a short time to a non-designated entity at a profit. In addition, the unjust enrichment rules were intended to recapture for the government a portion of the value of the bidding credit or other special provision if such a designated entity prematurely transfers its licenses to an ineligible entity, thereby frustrating the government's efforts to encourage the inclusion of designated entities in the provision of new spectrum-based services. 122. We recognize that over time, a designated licensee may have made substantial investments in a license prior to transfer. In order to reward efficiency and encourage such investments in infrastructure development, we provided that we will generally reduce the amount of the recapture penalty as time passes or construction benchmarks are met. 169 We further provided that our recapture provisions would not apply to the transfer or assignment of a license that has been held for more than five years. 170 In addition, where a recapture penalty is assessed, we stated that the penalty will not prevent the transferring designated entity from recovering the depreciated value of its capital investment. Moreover, we indicated that in appropriate circumstances, we might waive recapture ``if the licensee has incurred substantial start-up costs or made significant capital investments with the intention of starting service, but due to circumstances beyond its control, was unable to provide service.'' 171 169 See Second Report and Order at Â¶262. 170 Id . 171 Id . at n.205. 123. We believe that these measures adequately account for a designated entity's pre-transfer investments in a license, including construction expenses. Therefore, we decline to adopt AIDE's proposal that we credit the licensee's pre-sale investments in the license and base the recapture amount on the portion of the licensee's taxable gain on the sale allocated to the license, because such provisions would require the government to undertake lengthy and complex accounting and allocation proceedings to determine the amount of the penalty. Similarly, we deny BET's request that we credit designated entities for their pre-transfer expenditures on a license because we believe that our recapture provisions adequately account for these expenditures by reducing the amount of the penalty over time. Moreover, the unjust enrichment provisions were designed to act as a penalty to deter premature license transfers by designated entities. Therefore we decline to modify the recapture provisions adopted in the Second Report and Order . We note, however, that because license terms and construction requirements vary by service, and because we may adopt different designated entity provisions for different services, we will set forth the specific recapture provisions in the service-specific competitive bidding rules of each auctionable service. Moreover, we modify our general recapture provisions to provide flexibility on a service-specific basis to extend the duration of the recapture provisions beyond five years. I. Upfront Payment Amount 124. Petitions. AIDE requests that the Commission reduce the amount of the upfront payment for designated entities. AIDE asserts that a reduced upfront payment would help ensure that capital constrained designated entities have the opportunity to participate in the competitive bidding process. According to AIDE, a reduced upfront payment is necessary to create opportunities for designated entities to participate in competitive bidding and will allow such entities to preserve their limited resources for post-auction infrastructure development.
