This negotiation team will enter North Korea tomorrow and have consultations over details of how it will go about witnessing the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon atomic reactor. Correspondent Yi Tong-sik provides us with this report from Beijing: [Begin recording] Two IAEA inspectors led by Inspections Bureau chief (Perry Corse) arrived in Beijing via Scandinavian Airways this morning. At the airport, he said only that he would enter Pyongyang via Koryo Airlines tomorrow afternoon and have discussions over technical matters in North Korea. He added that he would soon meet the team conducting additional inspections in North Korea, including Inspections Section Chief (Heinonen). Therefore, he is expected to be presented with a comprehensive report in North Korea, from Inspections Section Chief (Heinonen) on the status of witnessing and observing the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at the 5-MW atomic reactor in Yongbyon and the sample-taking at the radiochemical laboratory. Although the IAEA negotiation team says that it will only have discussions over technical matters, the main goal of the negotiations of this time is reportedly to ask the North Korean side to take necessary measures for confirming, and continuing to confirm in the future, too, whether nuclear material has not been diverted since the atomic reactor began operations in (?1986) until now. Those in diplomatic circles in Beijing predict, however, that these negotiations will not proceed smoothly, because although the IAEA teams are being allowed to visit North Korea to witness inspections, they will only be allowed to witness the sealing of the removed nuclear fuel under the pretext of North Korea being in a unique situation in which it has suspended the withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
