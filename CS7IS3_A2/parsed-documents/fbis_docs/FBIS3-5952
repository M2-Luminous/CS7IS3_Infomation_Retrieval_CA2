The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a recent statement said Japan has stockpiled a large amount of plutonium and completed technological preparations to make nuclear weapons any time. The statement warned that if Japan continued on the road of nuclear armament, it would invite curses and condemnations from the world people. The Yugoslav paper BORBA said although Japan laid down the "Three non-nuclear principles" banning the production, possession and introduction of nuclear weapons, it has been covertly ignoring the principles recently. Alejandro Solorzano, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly of Nicaragua, in a statement on March 3 said it is a big obstacle to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula that Japan is hastening its nuclear armament despite strong protests and denunciation by the world's progressive people. He stressed that the total elimination of nuclear weapons and a halt to their development should be realized worldwide and that Japan should discard its dream of becoming a nuclear power.
