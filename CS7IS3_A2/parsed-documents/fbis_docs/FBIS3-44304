In the second year after the end of the bipolar structure, the countries of the world are facing even fiercer competition in the advance toward the 21st century. A complicated situation has taken shape as this competition has unfolded in the process in which various forces of the world are realigning and regrouping and are striving to grab favorable strategic positions for themselves. However, taking an overall view of the world's situation and international relations, both detente and turbulence still exist in the world. In 1993, global detente has continued and developed to some extent in the following ways: First, the big nations, especially the big powers, are formulating or enforcing the strategy of "economic priority," and a tendency toward international economic regionalization and economic blocs has come to take shape distinctly. The U.S. Clinton administration, after it was formed early this year, first mapped out "a plan to revitalize the U.S. economy," and in a strong belief that the possibility of a world war is decreasing, it shifted its defensive emphasis "from preparations for nuclear war to tackling regional wars." Meanwhile, the integrated European Common Market was officially inaugurated at the beginning of this year; the North American Free Trade Agreement was ratified at the end of this year; the informal leadership conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization was convened; and various regional economic organizations among Asian, African, and Latin American countries were formed and consolidated. Second, more importance has been attached to coordination and dialogue in international relations. The Chinese and U.S. presidents had their first formal talks in more than four years, while the Uruguay Round of the GATT multilateral negotiations, which had dragged on for seven years, eventually reached an agreement in December. All this indicates the desire for and capability of coordination between concerned parties. In 1993, a major breakthrough was achieved in solving the Middle East, South African, and Cambodian issues -- the three hot spots whose problems had remained unsolved for a long time. The people's yearning for peace and hatred of war have prompted many troubled areas of the world to seek political solutions instead of military confrontation. Third, international arms reductions and arms control have made some new progress. The United States and Russia formally signed the second stage of START -- the START II Treaty -- and 115 nations including the United States, China, and Russia signed the convention banning the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The United Nations began to implement the agreement on transparency in armaments which was passed in 1991. Although problems remain regarding the implementation of the agreement and the convention, the moves are conducive to detente. Besides, the world's total spending on the military in 1993 decreased for the sixth successive year, and the decline in this spending is continuing. On the other hand, the world of 1993 has been plagued with contradictions, wars, and conflicts. Regional disputes, collisions, and unrest have been on the rise and have combined to form interference that kept pounding at the international environment, thus creating an unstable world. This can be seen in the following manifestations: The contradiction overshadowed by the struggle for hegemony between the two superpowers in the past came to light further; frictions were frequently triggered by new changes in the political, economic, and military forces in the world after the end of the bipolar structure; economic recessions affecting the Western powers, except in the United States, Canada, and Britain, have not ended, and the contradictions among them have increased to some extent; some members of the CIS are still struggling in crises, as highlighted by the situation in Russia; quite a number of countries failed to do a good job of adjusting their national policies, thus leading to the downfall of governments, to social unrest, and to armed conflicts; and there are many hot spots of various degrees in the world which cause military unrest in several countries. Some big Western nations have resorted to power politics abroad, which has angered lots of developing nations. In the field of economic competition, the inferior situation in the South is becoming more obvious, and the gap between the South and the North is widening. The principal factors causing regional turbulence and unrest are the shock wave stemming from the end of the bipolar structure, the U.S. attempt to dominate the world, and the ever- fiercer economic competition throughout the globe. -- The end of the bipolar structure has shaken the traditional alliance formed by Western countries and maintained by their joint efforts in dealing with the Soviet Union; the contradictions between them have been sharpened. The United States and Europe have become divergent and have quarreled over the trade issue, aid to Russia, Somalia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, bombing raids on Iraq, and the trade embargo against Cuba. The feelings of "Cold War victory" in the West have been replaced by unbearable endless worries. NATO's plan to recruit East European members has met with setbacks and boycotts. Meanwhile, an "earthquake belt" has emerged from the Balkans through the outer Caucasus to Central Asia. Turbulence and uneasiness have arisen in Europe, a continent which has remained stable for a long time. -- President Clinton has emphasized: "The United States must lead the world, for which we have to pay much." [sentence as received] In an attempt to dominate the world, this year the United States has decided on its "three pillars" foreign policy (economic security, military backing, and support for democracy and freedom). While scaling down the size of its armed forces, the United States is heightening the mobility and casualty-inflicting power of its armed forces and is meddling in conflicts elsewhere in the world. Wielding the "human rights" club, it is attempting to place the rich and colorful world under the rule of Western values. This has led to contradictions and confrontation. In economic competition, although there have been efforts to strengthen economic cooperation and to promote balanced benefits, the rise of "priority for national interests" and trade protectionism has triggered more and more contradictions. No matter how we look at it, this competition is unfair because "the poorer you get the more losses you suffer." It has become the major factor leading to the world's instability. Judging from the current situation, the unrest in some parts of the world will not bring disaster to the entire world. The coexistence of detente and turbulence and of collision and coordination will continue in the years to come. The world will surge ahead in the midst of contradictions and struggles.
