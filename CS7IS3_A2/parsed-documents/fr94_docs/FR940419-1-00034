FR940419-1-00034 FR940419-1-00008 Tuesday April 19, 1994 Part V Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 Endangered and Threatened Species; Saltwater and Nile Crocodiles; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 75␣/␣Tuesday, April 19, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC30 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Reclassification of Saltwater Crocodile Population in Australia From Endangered to Threatened and Listing of Saltwater Crocodile Population in Papua New Guinea as Threatened by Reason of Similarity of Appearance; Special Rule for the Saltwater and Nile Crocodiles AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes reclassifying the saltwater crocodile ( Crocodylus porosus ) in Australia from endangered to threatened, and the Papua New Guinea population as threatened by reason of similarity of appearance under the provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. The saltwater crocodile has been listed as endangered throughout its range since 1979, except the Papua New Guinea population, which has never been listed. A special rule is also proposed that would allow for the importation of certain specimens of saltwater crocodiles from Australia and Papua New Guinea into the United States in the course of a commercial activity provided that such import is consistent with the requirements of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and certain other provisions. This proposal also reproposes the special rule for the Nile crocodile ( Crocodylus niloticus ) and will be consistent with the proposed special rule for the saltwater crocodile. When the Service previously proposed reclassifying the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened status, the comments received on the proposed special rule that accompanied that proposed reclassification led the Service to repropose the special rule. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by July 18, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments, information, and questions should be submitted to the Chief, Office of Scientific Authority; Mail Stop: Room 725, Arlington Square; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Washington, DC 20240. Fax number (703) 358&hyph;2276. Express and messenger delivered mail should be addressed to the Office of Scientific Authority; room 750, 4401 North Fairfax Drive; Arlington, Virginia, 22203. Comments and other information received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the Arlington, Virginia, address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Charles W. Dane, Chief, Office of Scientific Authority, at the above address, or by phone at (703) 358&hyph;1708. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This proposal is organized by first presenting a full discussion of the saltwater crocodile, then a brief listing history on the Nile crocodile reclassification, followed by a review of available conservation measures including a description of and effects of the proposed special rule for both the saltwater and the Nile crocodiles.
