In a communique, the opposition claims that supporters of the presidential group continue to fire gunshots in the M'filou District in the southern part of the city, and continue to "kidnap and murder people suspected to be close to the opposition." The opposition further asserts that in February more than 20 of its supporters were "kidnapped or killed" by members of the ministerial reserve, a unit that is directly under the head of state. This reserve is "responsible for the insecurity in the northern district of the city" and on the Tsieme road leading to the northern part of the country, the communique adds. The opposition also adds that it has respected the cease-fire agreement by helping to restore traffic and the "gradual return" of displaced persons in the Bacongo and Makele-Kele districts which it controls. On the other hand, the CONGOLESE NEWS AGENCY claimed yesterday that some 20 young men were enrolled in the opposition militia controlled by the former head of state, General Denis Sassou Nguesso, at Gamboma, in the center of the country, while five cases of ammunition were stolen from the Gamboma Non-Commissioned Officers School and sent by two soldiers to the northern part of the city, an area under the control of the opposition militia. An official of the opposition has denied these reports.
