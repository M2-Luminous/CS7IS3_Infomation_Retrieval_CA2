Neither is it correct to think that the whole issue is a scheme to discredit any political party. The very question that we should raise now is why the story has been kept under wraps for at least a year. The U.S. had attempted to get in touch with the accused MP through the Thai Government since January last year. Nothing was leaked to the general public. In practice, the Thai Government, especially the agencies and ministers concerned, should expeditiously reciprocate the request for cooperation in the suppression of narcotics trafficking from any foreign government. However, this case had been covered up for some time probably because it involved politicians and influential connections. Official confirmation from the U.S. embassy about the seizure of the MP's property in the U.S. has led many to believe that there could be many Thai MP's engaging in the illicit business. Research conducted six to seven years ago also revealed that as many as eight MP's were involved in the marijuana trade. Up to this point, one will find it rather difficult to turn a blind eye to the drug scandal. Moreover, several reports following the outbreak of the scandal on international drug trafficking connnections reveal that government officials, politicians, and local businessmen have been involved in exporting marijuana to the U.S. The government's suppression operations have so far been aimed only at small planters and traffickers, while the real chieftains of the criminal syndicates are left undisturbed to continue with their lucrative trade until the shameful fact is exposed by a foreign country. Therefore, it is imperative to call on the House of Representatives to make serious endeavors to quickly finalize the investigations into the marijuana trafficking charge against the MP. The House of Representatives must defend its reputation. This is not the personal affair of the accused MP because it can also have negative effects on the entire legislative institution. Not only the House of Representatives, the Senate should also try to do something as a contribution and by so doing, more people will come to realize its significance.
