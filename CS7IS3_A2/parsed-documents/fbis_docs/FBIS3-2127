[number as published] My Budget this year will once again reflect the solid performance of the economy and its robust prospects for the year ahead. 1993 was the 27th successive year in which the economy grew in real terms since the start of the GDP figures in 1966. A whole generation has grown up in our community which has never known anything other than unbroken economic expansion. It is a staggering fact that GDP per head has more than trebled in real terms since 1970. [passage omitted] The Economy 1993 Performance 8. I turn now to our economic performance and prospects. In 1993, Hong Kong's economy once again performed handsomely. We achieved a satisfactory growth rate of 5.5 percent in real terms. I say satisfactory because this is a good level of growth for an economy as mature as ours. We are not rising from a low economic base, as are many of our neighbours. We are now a service-based economy, and what we have to offer is our expertise, not low-wage factory labour. Our role in the Asian economic miracle is to provide the expertise which countries in the region need in order to raise their own standards of living. I will have more to say about this later this afternoon, when I describe the remarkable transformation which has been achieved over the last fifteen years. A transformation which has taken us to an advanced service economy based increasingly on our skills in management, design, marketing, finance and communications. 9. Let me start by giving you the basic facts of how well we did last year. -- As I said, GDP grew by 5.5 percent in real terms, the fastest increase since 1988. -- GDP per head in 1993 reached US$18,500. -- Total exports grew by 13 percent in real terms, led by re- exports. -- Exports of services grew by 8 percent in real terms. -- Inflation retreated still further, to 8.5 percent for the year (compared with 9.4 percent in 1992). -- Median household income grew in real terms by 3.8 percent. -- Unemployment remained at around 2 percent, a very low level by any international standard. 10. In producing this performance, I have no doubt that the business community has been looking beyond current political controversies to the long-term growth potential of both Hong Kong and China, and indeed to the promising economic outlook for the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. This bullish attitude affects foreign investors too. For example, investment from around the world has continued to flow into our asset markets, and more foreign companies continue to establish their presence here in Hong Kong. 1994 Prospects 11. 1993, in short, was a very good year, and we have no reason to be any less confident about our prospects for 1994. I say this because the factors which led to last year's success will persist, while recent developments in the world economy offer additional encouragement. -- The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round has boosted trade potential and blunted protectionist pressure. -- Prospects in our major overseas markets have improved. The U.S. and UK economies are set to grow by around 3 percent in the year ahead. -- Even more important for Hong Kong, the Chinese economy should have little difficulty in continuing to achieve an annual growth of about 10 percent in real terms. -- Our other neighbours in East Asia are likely to maintain their dynamic growth, with trade within the region expanding by around 15 percent in 1994. 12. We have entered 1994, then, in better shape than we might have expected. Inevitably, however, we also face some uncertainties. The annual battle for the renewal of China's MFN status in the United States will have to be fought yet again. Hong Kong must hope that politics is not allowed to damage this important trading relationship. For our part, we shall do all we can to emphasise to our friends in Washington the importance of trade between China and the United States. We will go on arguing that politics should not be allowed to damage trade. 13. This is not only a matter of Hong Kong's self-interest, although this is clearly a key factor. And for good reason. We estimate that failure to renew MFN would slash Hong Kong's GDP growth by up to three percentage points, and employment by up to 75,000 jobs. But there are wider issues at stake too. It is trade which generates growth, the growth essential for economic and social progress. The avoidance of trade discrimination -- the encouragement of a level playing field and the virtues of free trade -- are aims which underlie the GATT. It is for this reason also that China's wish to rejoin the GATT is of such significance. 14. Another factor bearing on our prospects for 1994 will be the success of the Chinese Government in managing high rates of economic growth while avoiding serious overheating. The Chinese Government has recognised the dangers of inflation and has announced measures to deal with it. We must hope that these measures are successful. 15. In producing our forecasts for the coming year, while we have to bear in mind these downside risks, we must also give due weight to our underlying strengths. For 1994, I am forecasting: -- GDP growth in real terms will again reach 5.5 percent, -- GDP per head will reach some US$20,600, -- Total trade will increase by around 17 percent in real terms, and -- Inflation will keep to an average of around 8.5 percent. 16. The continuing development of the Chinese economy matters considerably to the whole international community. But to us in Hong Kong, it is increasingly the key to our future economic success. Through servicing and investing in China, we continue to find new markets for our expertise in manufacturing, marketing, banking, communications, tourism and professional services. 17. Already, we play a vital and increasing role in China's economic modernization. -- China accounted for 35 percent of our total external trade in 1993. -- Hong Kong accounted for around two-thirds of total external investment in China. In turn, China is probably the largest external investor in Hong Kong. 18. The relationship is not simply about the flows of goods and services. There is also an enormous flow of people. -- Hong Kong residents made no less than 23 million visits to Chinese destinations in 1993. -- In addition, nearly 2 million foreign visitors used Hong Kong as their gateway to China. -- There were 7.4 million road crossings by cars and lorries. -- Hong Kong handled 34,000 flights to and from China. 19. But this momentum is our trade and traffic with China cannot be taken for granted. It has to be nurtured. As I shall describe later, it is crucial that we continue to develop our road, rail, air and sea links with Guangdong province, and the rest of China. We must match the flows of people, trade and investment with the infrastructure to support them. [passage omitted] Challenges Ahead Air and Sea Links 48. It is vital that we forge ahead with our airport and port development, if Hong Kong's growth is to be sustained beyond 1997, and with it the growth of southern China. Latest indications are that both air and container traffic are increasing faster than previous forecasts had anticipated. 49. It is painfully clear that Kai Tak is an airport working beyond its capacity, despite the considerable improvements being made. Even if you never travel, but are one of the 300,000 or so people living nearby, Kai Tak is becoming a more and more noisy neighbour to live with. 50. The economic benefits of the new airport can best be described by looking at what Hong Kong would stand to lose if we did not have the new airport in 1997. Economic losses would be HK$3 billion [Hong Kong dollars] in the first year after 1997, another HK$6 billion in the following year and a massive HK$10 billion the year after that. 51. We shall do all we reasonably can in dialogue with the Chinese Government to ensure that the expansion of the container port and the financing of the Airport Core Programme can proceed as swiftly as we would all wish. It is because of these economic benefits, and the good financial position we now find ourselves in, that we made our fourth financing proposal to address the Chinese Government's concerns. I shall refer again to this proposal in discussing the Medium Range Forecast. The Land Links 52. Every day, more than 20,000 goods vehicles pass through the border crossing points. The figure is growth by about 15 percent a year. This traffic is the life blood of our economic growth. But the road arteries are becoming increasingly clogged by a volume of vehicles far beyond what they were designed to handle. 53. As I have explain in previous Budgets, we must invest heavily in improvements to the road and rail links which serve our trade, tourism and investment in China, as well as the everyday needs of our population. Much work is already in hand. -- In September this year, the Yen Long Southern Bypass will be completed at a cost of HK$400 million. This will bring more relief to the Western New Territories. -- In August, we shall be awarding the HK$3.7 billion construction contract for the Ting Kau Bridge. When it opens in mid-1997, traffic will be able to bypass the container port and its bottlenecks in Kwai Chung. -- By the end of this year, we hope to award the franchise to construct and operate the Country Park Section of Route 3. When it comes into operation in late 1998, it will provide a fast new route linking the border, the container port and the urban areas. -- We have reached agreement in principle with the Chinese authorities to open the Lok Ma Chau crossing point round the clock, for implementation, we hope, in the first half of this year. Meanwhile two additional channels have just been opened. -- A major expansion of the Lowu Station will be completed early next year at a cost of HK$280 million. 54. Much of the cross-border freight is far more suited to be moved by rail than road. But existing rail capacity simply cannot cope with demand. Last year, the Railway Development Study was completed. This set out ambitious but costly proposals, including the construction of a new rail track to link up with the Chinese national rail system, which itself is being rapidly upgraded. We are not yet in a position to make a firm decision on the best way forward. But I suspect a consensus will emerge that high on the list of our long-term transport priorities should be a new railway to the border through the Northwest New Territories. [passage omitted] The Medium Range Forecast 147. As in previous years, I have published the Medium Range Forecast in Appendix A to the printed version of this Speech. Before I discuss the forecast, I should like to make four points. 148. First, in accordance with our normal practice, this forecast covers the current financial year, the estimates year, and three further years, Hence, my forecast will for the first time include the 1997-98 financial year, a period most of which follows the transfer of sovereignty. I should emphasise that this is a forecast only, presented today solely to provide the appropriate context for Hong Kong's planning. It is no way imposes any commitment on the future SAR government. 149. Secondly, in previous forecasts, we have allowed for the financial implications of the first airport financing proposal put to the Chinese Government. And specifically, in addition to public works expenditure, for equity injections of HK$20.3 billion from the reserves. Whilst the financing arrangements have yet to be agreed, it is clearly desirable to make our forecasts as realistic as possible. Without going into details of the fourth financing proposal at this stage, in our latest forecast we have allowed for a further equity injection of HK$20 billion from the reserves. We have also estimated the likely additional revenue to be obtained from airport railway-related land, and how much of that sum would be used as a further equity injection. Notwithstanding the great increase in land values since 1992, no more than about HK$40 billion in gross premium from airport railway-related land is expected to be received in the limited period up to June 1997, half of which would of course go to the Land Fund. These estimates are reflected in the new forecast. [passage omitted] 153. Now for the Medium Range Forecast itself. Two different factors are at work. -- First, revenues have been buoyant over the past three years. And revenue forecasts have been increased to reflect this. -- Secondly, on the expenditure side, the forecast reflects a more realistic estimate of our capacity on public works. 154. On this basis, I forecast that we shall add HK$7.7 billion to our fiscal reserves in 1994-95. Throughout the forecast period, we shall continue to see a healthy surplus on the operating account. However, in 1995-96 and 1996-97, we are forecast to draw on our reserves to take account of an increasing spending capacity on public works, as well as increased investment in our physical infrastructure, including most notably the Airport Core Programme. 155. I forecast that on 31 March 1997, our fiscal reserves will stand at an impressive HK$120 billion. This is a dramatic increase over the figure of HK$78 billion which I forecast in my Budget last year. This HK$120 billion is all the more remarkable an achievement when you remember that it takes into account both the spending proposals and the tax concessions I have announced today. And it also fully allows for the proposed additional equity injection into the Airport Core Programme, and explains my willingness to make such a large investment. 156. Moving to the last year of the forecast, namely 1997-98, the Medium Term Forecast predicts an overall surplus for the year of HK$21 billion. This very satisfactory figure reflects the fact that, in accordance with the Joint Declaration, the SAR government will receive the full proceeds from land sales, and will collect rents for the extension of New Territories leases. The end result is that the forecast predicts that the fiscal reserves will total HK$141 billion at the end of 1997-98. 157. Nor is this the full picture, as these figures do not take into account the position of the SAR government Land Fund, which represents a significant asset for the future SAR government. Members will recall that a senior Chinese official has been reported recently as indicating that the fund was likely to exceed HK$100 billion in 1997. Our own estimate of HK$105 billion, before taking into account the disposal of sites along the airport railway, is broadly in line with this. But when account is taken of the fund's share of the likely additional receipts from these sites the balance of the fund in 1997 should reach HK$125 billion. 158. Thus, at the end of 1997-98, the SAR government is likely to have combined reserves, including interest, of about HK$269 billion, incorporating both the fiscal reserves and the Land Fund. Fortunately, therefore, we are able to continue to build up reserves greater than our annual expenditure. This is something we have been able to achieve in recent times. And something that few other communities have been able to do. Conclusion 159. To a considerable extent we are engaged in managing the prosperity we have achieved, and in ensuring that it continues. In practice this has involved me in striking the right balance between spending and savings: -- Spending, both to improve the quality of life for the community as a whole and to create the infrastructure for our future growth, and -- Savings, to meet future liabilities and unforeseen contingencies, because economic success cannot be taken for granted year after year. There will always be a temptation to spend a little more and save a little less. It might sometimes seem tempting politically to bow to some of the inevitable pressures to do so. But it would not be responsible government. And it would risk increasing consumption and fuelling inflation. 160. I hope that this Council will agree that we have found the right balance this afternoon. My Budget proposals will: -- Put HK$38 billion back into the taxpayer's pocket over the next five years, -- Implement the ambitious expansion in social services set in motion by the Governor's first two Policy Addresses, and -- Put an additional HK$8 billion into our fiscal reserves next year and put us on course for total fiscal reserves of HK$269 billion by the end of the forecast period. 161. It is not the Government which has made today's Budget possible. This has been achieved by the hard-working men and women of Hong Kong. It is, first and last, their success and their money on which we rely, and it is their way of life, their livelihood we are all trying to secure. 162. Mr President, I move that the debate on this motion be now adjourned.
