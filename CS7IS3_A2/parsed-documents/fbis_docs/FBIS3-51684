The Colombian Government believes this victory has no practical effects, given the GATT members must unanimously approve the ruling. In this respect, no one expects the 12 EU member countries or their former colonies in Asia, Africa and the Pacific to vote in favor of a resolution that goes against their own interests. Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos has lamented the fact a consensus favoring a withdrawal from the GATT lawsuit had not been accomplished. This requirement had been established by the EC as a precondition to improving access for banana imports. The foreign trade minister has insisted Colombia was always willing to withdraw the lawsuit and that four of the five complainant countries had also agreed. At 1055 (local time), five minutes before the results were made public and the deadline to withdraw the lawsuit had expired, Costa Rica and Nicaragua changed their minds, however, and had decided to continue with the action. In this respect, they both decided to join Guatemala, which from the beginning refused to withdraw the lawsuit. In other words, Colombia and Venezuela were left on their own. According to Santos, Costa Rica justified its shift in position by saying the EC had not given any assurances that it would maintain its proposal in light of Guatemala's refusal to withdraw the legal action. This division among the growers could result in the EC withdrawing its proposal to improve conditions of the current banana regulations. In other words, Latin America's banana quota would continue to remain at 2 million tons, and U.S. as well as European market companies would retain marketing control. There is still the possibility, however, of increasing the 2.1 million tons and the EC maintaining its offer until 15 February, according to information disclosed by a European official. The proposal consists of increasing the banana quota to 2.1 million tons and leaving 70 percent of the quota in the hands of the governments; in other words, managing the market would once again be in the hands of banana growers. Santos has said the Latin American countries had to confront all sorts of pressures, saying the multinationals have aided in boycotting an agreement among growers. "I am aghast at the pressures applied by the marketing companies over certain countries," he said. Moreover, Santos has disclosed the U.S. trade office had summoned the Colombian ambassador in Washington to express its concern, because steps taken by Colombia were harming the interests of several U.S. marketing companies. Considering accusations of the cowardice thrown against Colombia by certain countries, Santos has said there is no cowardice in fighting to defend the 500,000 jobs the banana industry provides, or in challenging the multinationals. The minister has reiterated that Colombia maintains its willingness to dialogue with the EU and the Latin American countries involved in the issue to search for a solution satisfactory to all parties involved.
