FR940706-0-00003 FR940706-0-00001 This action has also been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). William E. Ludwig, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Only State and local welfare agencies will be affected to the extent that they are involved with appeals of Food Stamp Program quality control claims. The procedures to appeal quality control claims are being changed by this rule to streamline and reduce the time and resources State and local welfare agencies previously devoted to such appeals. Potential and current participants in the Food Stamp Program will not be affected. Paperwork Reduction Act This rulemaking does not contain recordkeeping and reporting requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) and falls within the exceptions to coverage. Background On January 19, 1993, the Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) at 58 FR 5188 to implement section 603 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (HPA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435). The HPA amended the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (the Act) (7 U.S.C. 2011&hyph;2032) regarding the Food Stamp Program's administrative review process for QC claims (7 U.S.C. 2023(a)). A total of eight comment letters were received on the proposed rule. One commenter subsequently advised the Department that it considered its comment letter to be inappropriate to the subject of the NPRM and withdrew its letter. The following analysis is based on the remaining seven comment letters. Since issuance of the proposed regulations on January 19, 1993, Congress has enacted Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66 (Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act) (Leland Act) to further streamline the appeals process for QC claims established under section 16(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2025(c). Section 13951 of the Leland Act amended sections 13(a)(1), 14(a) and 16(c) of the Act to: (1) Provide that State agencies will be assessed interest on outstanding QC liabilities if the administrative appeals process takes more than one year to resolve these claims; (2) to establish timeframes for the administrative review process and (3) to provide that an administrative law judge (ALJ) shall consider a State agency's contention of good cause when considering whether to waive all or part of a State agency's QC liability. A full explanation of the rationale of the proposed rule is contained in its preamble. It is suggested that interested parties refer to that preamble for additional background information (58 FR 5188). Following is a detailed discussion on the comments received on the proposed rule, non-discretionary revisions based on the Leland Act and the provisions of the final rule. The Department has determined that, with respect to the revisions based upon non-discretionary provisions of the Leland Act referenced above, notice and comment are unnecessary since the Department has no discretion with respect to these provisions. accordingly, such revisions have been made through this final rule. Discussion of the Regulations In the following discussion, we have identified each section of the regulation being addressed and have interspersed comments and responses as appropriate. The regulatory language from the NPRM was retained except where indicated. Section 283.4: Filing Appeals for QC Claims of $50,000 or More This section of the NPRM contains the procedures which State agencies are to follow in appealing the bill for collection from the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) for QC claims of $50,000 or more.
