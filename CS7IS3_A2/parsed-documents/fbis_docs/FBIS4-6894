In a response to a message sent by Kang Sok-chu, North Korean vice foreign minister and chief of North Korean delegates to U.S.-North Korean talks on 19 April, it was learned in the United States that U.S. delegation head Galluci delivered a reply to the North side last week. The two sides exchanged basic proposals regarding the mutual practice of additional inspections and high-level U.S.-North Korean talks. It was learned that the two sides will begin full-scale working negotiations to reach an agreement on these items within this week. A well-informed source on the nuclear issue said that North Korea withdrew its previous stance stating it has kept all the agreements reached with the United States by disclosing that it was compelled to break the agreement last month because of a precondition that the special envoys of the North and South should be exchanged. The source said that this hints at a positive change in the North Korean stance. It was also learned that the United States, through Gallucci's reply, informed the DPRK of its stance over the suspension of Team Spirit and high-level U.S.-North Korean talks.
