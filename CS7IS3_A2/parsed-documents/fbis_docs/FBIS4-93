In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana yesterday, the CDR did not beat around the bush. It reaffirmed that its participation in the Transitional National Assembly had already been decided in accordance with Articles 61 and 62 of the power-sharing protocol of 19 January 1993 and the annex to the text of the code of political ethics to which the CDR was a signatory. The CDR letter stressed that since negotiations are over, there is no more room for verification of respect for the conditions stated in Article 61 of the protocol (?to) which the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] refers [passage indistinct]. Concerning the [name indistinct] criticism of the peace accord, the CDR party stressed that no text can be perfect. It is normal for the Arusha accord to be submitted to criticism but that is in no way a prerogative of the CDR party. Despite the criticism, the CDR has decided to adhere to the agreement and to respect it in order to contribute to the restoration of real peace and national reconciliation. The CDR also stressed that the recent reaction of RPF Leader Titus Rutaremana reflects an ethnic [words indistinct] RPF officials. According to the CDR, the RPF is not interested in the problem of the war displaced and the need for a change in mentality in order to generate durable and real social peace between Hutus and Tutsis. However, the CDR ideology is pacifist and realistic because it recognizes the ethnic problem which has been eating away at our country for centuries. The CDR furthermore denounced the ideology of ethnic purification preached by many extremist RPF members. In its letter to the prime minister, the CDR also pointed out that the RPF is not at all empowered to demand the exclusion of the CDR from the Transitional National Assembly and urged the RPF to renounce once and for all its ideology of power struggle based on vengeance and revenge. The CDR said it could obviously not accept joining the Transitional National Assembly later simply based on a decision by the RPF which is exceeding its powers. The CDR reaffirmed that it has to enter the institution from the very first day and under the same conditions as those of the other political parties. CDR First Vice President Sylvestre Nahimana signed for his party. The entry of the CDR in the Transitional National Assembly is also recommended by 11 political parties which were registered at the time of the Arusha peace accord on 4 August 1993. The 11 parties, which signed a motion of support for the entry of the CDR in the Transitional National Assembly, said they were motivated by a spirit of justice and fairness, and were concerned with strict respect for the Arusha accords and the speedy return of durable peace in Rwanda and national reconciliation. The entry of the CDR in the Transitional National Assembly has to be on an equal footing with the other political forces and under the same legal conditions in accordance with Articles 61, 80, 81, and 82 of the protocol on power-sharing signed in Arusha, the parties stressed. [passage omitted] Only the Social Democratic Party, the Rwandan People's Democratic Union, the Rwandan Socialist Party, and the Democratic Party did not sign the motion of support for the entry of the CDR in the Transitional National Assembly.
