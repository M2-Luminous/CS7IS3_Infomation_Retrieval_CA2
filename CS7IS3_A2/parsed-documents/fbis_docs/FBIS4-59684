Sanaa stressed that its forces had captured the city and opened a new front in Shabwah Governorate, and that its forces were advancing in the Bab el Mandeb area with a view to encircling Aden from various directions. But the Socialist Party completely denied the capture of al-Dali', a stronghold for a large number of southern army commanders. The party yesterday presented a political initiative which included the following: 1. an immediate halt to the war; 2. the formation of a national salvation government to eliminate the effects of the war; 3. measures to safeguard what is left of the Armed Forces, reorganize and regroup them, disengage the warring forces, and withdraw attacking forces to their positions before the war; 4. measures to safeguard citizens' lives and property, fairly compensate those harmed by the war, and consider victims of the war -- military and civilians -- martyrs. 5. the release of military and political prisoners; no arrest, pursuit, or torture of any political or military elements; measures to prevent the looting of citizens' property; and the return of looted property to the owners, or compensation; 6. no backtracking on the democratic option and political pluralism, and recognition of the parties' right to engage in political action in accordance with the Constitution and the law; 7. no backtracking on implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document. 8. action by the national salvation government to investigate who caused the war, with the conclusions to be announced to the people. In Damascus, former [South] Yemen President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad has told AL-HAYAH that he met yesterday with Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah and Oil Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin Husaynun. Both had met with President Hafiz al-Asad and he had asked them to work to halt "aerial bombardment involving scud missile strikes against cities." 'Ali Nasir added that he had discussed with them "the latest developments in the military and political situation in the country. And they spoke with me about their contacts with Arab leaders" during their tour of a number of Arab states. The former Yemeni president pointed out that he had agreed with a number of "important" Yemeni figures to launch an initiative guaranteeing "a cease-fire and a swift solution to the crisis." He added that the initiative is based on a number of "clear points" aimed at finding a way out of the current situation. However, he declined to talk about these points in detail, "in order to ensure its success, as we will be moving to Yemen after the contacts." [passage omitted]
