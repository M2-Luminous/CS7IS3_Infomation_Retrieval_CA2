A Ugandan daily newspaper the NEW VISION said today that a former major, Mr. (Bernard Busokoza) and a lieutenant, Mr. (Paul Kamana), had secretly crossed the border from Uganda to Zaire between late February and early March. It said the two were suspected by authorities in Burundi of masterminding a coup attempt last October in which President Melchior Ndadaye was killed by renegade troops. About 100,000 people died in the ensuing ethnic bloodletting. Burundi had said in December that the two men had fled to Uganda and President Yoweri Museveni ordered their arrest but said they could not be extradited, as the two countries have no extradition agreement.
