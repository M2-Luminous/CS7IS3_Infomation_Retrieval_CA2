[Rifkind] I do not accept the premise of your question. We announced last August, the NATO Council said last August, that in certain circumstances, particularly in order to ensure that aid got through, it might be necessary to contemplate air strikes. We have the particular problem at the moment in Srebrenica where a Canadian unit is due to be replaced by a unit of another country -- that is being prevented, it is right and proper that we should take action if necessary to achieve that. [Paxman] But why should Radovan Karadzic take it any more serious this time than experience has shown he should take it in the past? [Rifkind] On the contrary, I think after the announcement by NATO last August about the possibility of much tougher action if steps were not taken immediately by the Serbs and other parties to stop unacceptable behavior, the situation improved. [Paxman] But it is the case isn't it that any individual country within NATO would have a right of veto on any bombing mission? [Rifkind] I think what you want to see is two things. First of all there has to be a request from the United Nations itself. Now NATO -- the countries of NATO -- have agreed that if we are requested by the United Nations, if it falls within the mandate that has been laid down, then it is right and proper that we should respond, particularly if it is the only way of getting aid through in the circumstances that have been outlined. [Paxman] A particular concern is expressed by the Canadians who have troops as you say in Srebrenica, and they are distinctly lukewarm as far as one can see about the idea of bombing, because it is their troops that are at risk. [Rifkind] Well, clearly we would have to take into account the nature of the situation, and if the people whom we trying to help were people, who for very understandable reasons, were unattracted by that particular solution then obviously their views would carry great weight. We are not talking about veto's, we are talking about common sense. [Paxman] Now, for the last few weeks, we have had both British and French Government's making no more than exploratory noises about the fact that we cannot keep troops in Bosnia indefinitely. Now you are talking about possible military operations in the air. Is the bombing campaign some sort of prelude to withdrawal? [Rifkind] We have made it abundantly clear we have every intention of continuing throughout this winter. It is absolutely important that we do all within our power to try and ensure that tens of thousands of people do not starve over the next few weeks, over the next two or three months.
