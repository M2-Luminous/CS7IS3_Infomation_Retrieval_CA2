V. Ikramov, I. M. Roshchupkin and A. G. Safronov, KOMPOZIT Scientific Production Association, Kaliningrad, Moscow Oblast; UDC 535.87] [Abstract] The efficiency of use of a large bimorph adaptive mirror with compensation of large-scale low-frequency distortions is demonstrated. The theoretical approach to achieving efficient compensation of wave front distortions is outlined. Computer simulation of the correction of low-order optical aberrations with this mirror is described in detail. A comparative analysis is made of the efficiency of a large bimorph mirror and an adaptive mirror with discrete electromechanical drives. The results, revealing a high efficiency of such a mirror in the compensation of large-scale low-frequency wave front distortions, were obtained for a controlling mosaiced piezoelectric layer 1 mm thick (with a thickness of the mirror plate 78 mm). This relation of thicknesses evidently is not optimal and was selected only to demonstrate the possibilities of a large bimorph adaptive mirror. It is proposed that a multilayer mosaiced piezoelectric structure be used for reducing the controlling voltage (which in the experiments was about 300 V). A similar approach also is applicable in selecting the optimum thickness of the piezoelectric structure. A simple and effective method is proposed for forming a mosaiced bimorph structure. It involves using a multilayer structure with the least possible thickness of the piezoelectric film and optimized total thickness. In this case the controlling voltage can be reduced to several tens of volts and the individual piezoelements need not be in contact with one another. Figures 4; references: 2 Russian.
