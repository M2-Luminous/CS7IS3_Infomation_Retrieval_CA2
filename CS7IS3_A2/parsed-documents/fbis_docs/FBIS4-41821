In his opinion, such a move would appease a wide spectrum of political forces, including the opposition which he believes would support the idea of postponing elections in the absence of a realistic contender to Boris Yeltsin and in hope that such a contender will at some point emerge in the ranks of the opposition. He also said that the Civic Accord Pact was "a document based on a certain balance of political interests and forces." "Given political will, it can easily be prolonged by amending the Constitution and by prolonging the powers of all branches of authority," he said. He welcomed the political forces' newly acquired skill for coming to terms with one another, but noted that in the current complicated situation, early elections could also help to ease political tensions. He also expressed the opinion that the proposal to put off elections was the Russian political elite's attempt to prolong its term in office.
