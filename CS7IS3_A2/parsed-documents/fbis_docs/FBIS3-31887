The planes were downed as a result of them violating the no-fly zone that was imposed under the UN resolution last year, and it has no direct connection with the NATO ultimatum that, as our listeners are certainly well aware, led to the peace that reigns in Sarajevo at the moment. However, what is alarming is that the violation of the no-fly zone happened after the ultimatum. In my view, it is this aspect that transforms the violation into a deliberate provocation aimed at testing out [the no-fly zone] and establishing to what extent the international community, represented by NATO, is firm in its intention to use force in the event of an action that contravenes the categorical conditions specified in the key documents -- the UN resolution on the no-fly zone and the NATO ultimatum. The point of the sounding-out operation was to find out the following: If, in the event of a violation of the no-fly zone, the monitoring forces limited their reaction merely to a warning, then if the NATO ultimatum was breached, one might also be able to get off scot-free, speaking figuratively. It is now clear that this will not be the case, and the people who continue to look for loopholes in the firmly adopted stances should draw the proper conclusions, namely that they [the NATO forces] will act firmly, that is, use weapons, in the event of any attempted violation. Regarding the issue of the identity of the planes in question, at the moment it appears that they belonged to the Bosnian Serbs, according to NATO claims. However, the Bosnian Serbs hastened to deny that this was the case, and Belgrade also says it knows nothing. There has been no official reaction from the Croatian and Muslim sides. Accordingly, all this has to be further investigated. Nonetheless, it is most likely that the planes belonged to the Bosnian Serbs, who are in the best position to deny the fact. It is very doubtful whether anyone in Pale, or wherever else their military command is located, would allow himself to conduct such an experiment without first consulting Belgrade and without carefully considering the possible consequences if the planes were downed, as in fact was the case. Since the attempt did not come off, the position of denial or possibly shifting blame to some third-level commander is now the only possible alternative, to prevent an escalation of the international military pressure on the Bosnian Serbs.
