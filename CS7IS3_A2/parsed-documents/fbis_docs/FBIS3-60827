According to the first details, three terrorists were killed in the clash as they tried to cross the border fence near the village of Arajah in the eastern sector. It is approximately in the area of Kibbutz Dan in the Upper Galilee region. Israeli soldiers were alerted to the infiltration attempt, arrived quickly at the scene and opened fire at the terrorists, killing them. There are no reports of any casualties on the Israeli side, and apparently the head of Northern Command, Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, has arrived at the scene to check out the situation, and has already praised the action of the soldiers, and particularly their speedy arrival at the site of the infiltration.
