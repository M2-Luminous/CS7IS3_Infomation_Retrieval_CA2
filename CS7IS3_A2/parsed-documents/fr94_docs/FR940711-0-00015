FR940711-0-00015 FR940711-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 981 [Docket No. FV93&hyph;981&hyph;2FIR] Almonds Grown in California; Finalize Revision of Administrative Rules and Regulations Concerning Creditable Promotion and Advertising Requirements AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, with modifications, the provisions of an interim final rule that changed the focus of the Almond Board of California's (Board) advertising and promotion program by broadening the scope of creditable advertising and promotion activities available to handlers and expanding the Board's ability to engage in a significant generic advertising and promotion program to benefit the entire industry. This action provides for more effective and efficient use of industry advertising and promotion funds. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathleen M.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 981 [7 CFR Part 981], both as amended, hereinafter referred to as the ``order'' regulating the handling of almonds grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary will rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 115 handlers of almonds that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately 7,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the almond handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. This action finalizes an interim final rule which revised ยง981.441 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations and is based on recommendations of the Board, comments received in response to the interim final rule, comments received in response to the reopening of the comment period of the interim final rule, and other available information. The interim final rule was published in the Federal Register [58 FR 43500], on August 17, 1993. The rule amended ยง981.441 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order. It provided a 30 day comment period which ended September 16, 1993. During this period, one comment was received from Cal-Almond, Inc., an independent almond handler. On December 22, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California issued a ruling on a district court order involving an action against the Department by three independent almond handlers wherein such handlers alleged, among other things, that the Board's advertising program during the 1980's was unconstitutional because the program violated the handlers' First Amendment Rights. The district court had ruled that the advertising program was constitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged the substantial public interest in designing effective advertising and promotion programs to stimulate demand and to increase returns to growers but concluded that the almond program in place during the 1980's was sufficiently flawed in that it did not meet the constitutional standards. In light of the potential effect of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's decision on the newly established Credit-Back advertising and promotion program and on the almond industry as a whole, the Department determined that it was in the public interest to reopen the comment period for the interim final rule. Accordingly, the comment period was reopened on January 31, 1994, [59 FR 4247]. Reopening of the comment period provided interested persons an opportunity to review the rules for the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program and to submit additional written opinions and information regarding the potential effect of the Court's decision on that program. The Department also sought comments on how to best address the issues raised in the Court's decision. The second comment period closed on March 2, 1994. Seven additional comments were received. All of the comments received on the interim final rule will be discussed herein.
