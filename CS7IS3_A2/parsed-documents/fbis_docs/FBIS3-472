A spokesman for the force said that reasons for the resignations varied from domestic problems to dissatisfaction with conditions at the base. About 70 members of the force resigned last week after a strike over salaries. However, the spokesman said that conditions at the base had returned to normal and that training had been resumed. He said a delegation from the Transitional Executive Council would visit the base this afternoon to help solve the problem.
