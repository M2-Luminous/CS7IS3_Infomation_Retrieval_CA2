FBIS4-4444 "dreas063_l_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-063 Daily Report 28 Mar 1994 Philippines Reactions to Government's Amnesty Program Noted Reactions to Government's Amnesty Program Noted Sison: Proclamations `Necessary' BK0104115894 Manila PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER in English 28 Mar 94 pp 1, 10 BK0104115894 Manila PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER English BFN [By Jerry Esplanada] [Text] Malacanang [presidential office] yesterday appealed to communist and military rebels to take advantage of the government offer of a general but conditional amnesty. The leftist National Democratic Front and the rightist Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance] have rejected the amnesty proclamations signed by President Ramos last Friday. They said any such plan should be the result of peace talks between the government and the rebels. But Press Secretary Jesus Sison said the amnesty proclamations were necessary because "we have to have peace," adding that the president has issued them "in good faith." Leaders of the Moro National Liberation Front and other Muslim rebels have yet to issue their position on the amnesty program. Speaker Jose de Venecia yesterday acknowledged that some rebel leaders were likely to reject the president's amnesty offer but that their followers were ready to apply. De Venecia also said there would be another amnesty proclamation after the conclusion of the peace talks between the government and the various rebel groups. At least 25,000 rebels are expected to apply for amnesty, he said, adding that the Ramos proclamations are sure to pass the House of Representatives. "The realpolitik of the amnesty is that there is a wide-scale acceptance from the lower and middle echelons because they are the ones fighting the war, they are the ones dying, famished, and unable to see their families," he told a news conference. "The other leaders who are more adversarial to the amnesty can wait until the completion of the peace talks, but they should not prevent their comrades from availing themselves of the amnesty now," he added. Sison said Mr. Ramos, in issuing Proclamations 347 and 348, "reached out to unify the divided forces of the nation." "The next step is up to the rebels to take advantage of them amnesty proclamations," he said. Proclamation 347 grants amnesty to all persons who in pursuit of political beliefs may have committed crimes punishable either by the Revised Penal Code or special laws. It applies to all rebels, but it requires them to apply first. Proclamation 348 grants amnesty to military and police personnel who may have committed acts punishable under the Revised Penal Code, the Articles of War or special laws. Leftist groups rejected the amnesty program, saying it did not result from peace talks. Renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan said amnesty was not the answer to the problems that gave rise to military rebellion. Rightist rebels are more interested in pursuing their call for electoral reforms, reforms in the military, social justice programs, and good government, "not amnesty," he said. Mr. Ramos, in issuing the two proclamations, said "the time for talking is over" and "the time to decide and act has come." "These grants of amnesty are only part of the actions contemplated by the government in its unrelenting quest for a just and enduring peace for our country and people," he said. "This does not preclude and is without prejudice to any legal arrangement that may result from a negotiated settlement which the government is still pursuing with the various rebel groups which I am hopeful will materialize soon," Mr. Ramos added. But rebel leaders and other sectors cited several objectionable features of the two proclamations. -- The amnesty program is placed ahead of social reforms "which should be the government's primary concern." -- It does not guarantee that the rebels will be granted amnesty because their application can be opposed by anyone. It is at best a long, tedious process. -- It does not cover common crimes which most of the political prisoners are charged with or convicted of. -- The amnesty plan for soldiers and police allows human rights violators among them to be freed from liability as long as their offenses were committed in the course of the anti-insurgency campaign . Under both proclamations, an amnesty extinguishes any criminal liability for acts committed by the grantee. But it does not free him from any civil liability or damages inflicted on a victim. The amnesty also does not cover crimes such as torture, arson, massacre, rape, and robbery. Rebels may apply with the newly formed National Amnesty Commission within six months after Congress concurs. The Senate and the House of Representatives are on a two-week Lenten recess since last Thursday. Congress resumes sessions on 11 April. De Venecia dismissed speculations that the proclamations might face rejection in Congress. "Amnesty is a popular issue, why should we reject a program wanted by tens of thousands of people who are asking for peace?" he said.
