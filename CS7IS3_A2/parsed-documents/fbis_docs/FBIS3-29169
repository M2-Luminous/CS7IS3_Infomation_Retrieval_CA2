The discolored rice was found in six 50-kilogram bags of the rice with the tainted rice occupying only a small part of each bag, the agency's Gifu office said. Officials suggested that the rice may have become wet during its transport to Japan, adding they plan to check the rest of the rice stored in Gifu. It is the first case in Japan of mold being found in the imported California rice. The rice is part of a shipment of 7,200 tons from California that arrived in Kobe last December 13. A total of 850 tons of that rice was delivered to Gifu and 238 tons was sold to wholesalers on February 10. Denshiro Kugo of the agency office said that it is likely the mold developed during the shipping since the mold was already dried out. "We want to do our best to check the quality of the rice in storage as soon as possible so consumers can feel at ease," Kugo said.
