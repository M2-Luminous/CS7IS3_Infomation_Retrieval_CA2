Cela: "Caution and Speculation Over the Kosova Issue -- Serbs Propose Dialogue Between Foreign Ministers"] [Text] Something is moving in Serb Albanian relations. This time, as TANJUG reported on 2 June, it is the self-styled Yugoslavia that wishes to suggest to Albania the start of a dialogue at foreign-minister level. The Yugoslav Government outlined relations between the two countries and entrusted the Foreign Ministry with "renewing the proposal for dialogue." Dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade began to take up column inches in the press especially after the visit of the British minister Douglas Hogg, who announced after his talks with the Serbian leader Milosevic that the latter was ready to talk with representatives from Kosova about the restitution of some kind of autonomy similar to that of 1974, while stressing again that he categorically cannot allow a change in the borders of Yugoslavia. The two Albanian leaders Rugova and Berisha showed a readiness for dialogue months ago, but always conditional on the presence of a third party. Meanwhile, Rugova is continuing his visit to a series of European countries, holding meetings with high-level officials of these countries, and holding fast to the view of an independent and neutral Kosova. Rugova proposes a civil protectorate as a transitional phase in order to avert conflict. In this situation, when a gentle, softening breeze has begun to blow across the diplomatic landscape, daily life in Kosova has not changed in the least. In Prishtina, the Serbian police continue to beat and maltreat Albanian political activists. Rugova, speaking to Deutsche Welle, called this repression an attempt to publicly weaken the position of Kosovar diplomacy. Rugova also stressed that it is unlikely that dialogue with the Serbian side will be imminent. Meanwhile, some British and Serbian newspapers have recently reported secret meetings between some Albanian and Serbian representatives at a foreign embassy. According to these newspapers, these talks have involved the Serbian Socialist Markovic, the Kosovar journalist and intellectual Veton Surroi, and Fehmi Agani, deputy Chairman of the Kosova Democratic Alliance. It is said that Markovic proposed to these two Albanians talks about education and health, etc., with the aim of normalizing relations between the Republic of Serbia and the Albanians of Kosova. All these proposals contradict what is happening in Albanian everyday life, and it seems that Rugova is right when he says that "The Serbs want to publicly weaken our position." The British newspaper THE GUARDIAN quotes one Western diplomat as saying "There are movements of several kinds, but it sometimes seems to me that we are trying to bore a tunnel with a needle." The Kosovar leader Agani, said to have taken part in the secret talks, nevertheless recently said that "If we are told that we must be part of Serbia, this is the same as telling us to continue to suffer under Serbian rule. This idea has no future." Agani thus conclusively proved that he continues to be Rugova's right-hand man. In the meantime, Albania, although its parliament unanimously recognized the Republic of Kosova, is showing itself to be increasingly cautious in its statements. The only joint statement issued by Albanian and Kosovar leaders and diplomats is that "Albania favors Albanian-Serb dialogue, in the presence of a third party." This caution in Albanian policy is a result of a kind of pressure exerted by international diplomacy on Albania, so that Albania may exert influence in softening the Albanian radical factions across the border. At a news conference one week ago, the Albanian Sooialist leaders called the policy over the issue of Kosova pursued by the leaders in power today a failure. However, this cannot be said now that Tirana is following from behind the steps of international diplomacy concerning the destiny of Kosova, and has conflict avoidance as the foundation of its policy.
