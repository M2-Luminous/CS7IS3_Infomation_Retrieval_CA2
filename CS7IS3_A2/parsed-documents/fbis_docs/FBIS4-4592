The coalition had wanted to reduce the number of Senators as part of a larger package of proposed political reforms, purportedly to make the constitution more democratic. But coalition leaders did little homework in terms of lobbying or coordinating with members of the Upper House. So when the full parliament convened its extraordinary session last Thursday, the Senators pulled the rug out from under the Government and threw their full support behind an alternative charter amendment draft submitted by the Opposition which contains most of the previously agreed to amendment points but minus the contentious Senate down-sizing. And when the Government's own draft on this very subject was raised the following day, it was -- not surprisingly -- scuttled by wholesale Senatorial abstentions. But what is at stake here is not so much a case of the Senate flexing its muscles in an over-zealous exercise to protect its own turf. No one in his right mind would expect the Senators to vote in favor of a charter amendment draft that would reduce the number of their own peers and scale back their powers. Even with the increasing public scrutiny over the legitimacy of their existence, most probably still hold on to the constitutional edict that they remain the 'representatives', albeit non-elected, of the people. What is far more disturbing is the combination of the insincerity and internecine bickerings among the elected members of the House, both coalition and Opposition. Their collective mishandling of this entire constitutional amendment episode has reduced the sanctity of the parliamentary system to naught. The Democrat Party highlighted constitutional reforms as one of its main political platforms during campaigning for the 1992 general elections. Indeed, many of the voters who cast their ballots for the Democrats at the time had probably expected the party to initiate changes in order to make the Constitution more democratic. But despite its successful post-election emergence as the core party of the coalition, the Democrats did little to fulfill this electioneering pledge. Rather than exerting leadership and guidance, the Prime Minister instead passed the burden of constitutional amendments over to Parliament. What followed was a lengthy series of deliberations by a special parliamentary panel, interspersed with squabbling among the MPs of both benches. When the coalition was finally forced to take action in the face of mounting public pressure for constitutional reforms, it decided to take the easy way out by tabling what it perceived to be the less contentious points to ensure smooth passage -- instead of picking substantive issues that would otherwise be needed to make the Constitution truly democratic. If the efforts by the coalition were insincere and half-hearted, the fickleness by the Opposition alliance calls for stronger condemnation. It may be recalled that representatives of the coalition and Opposition originally agreed to amend only eight of the total 25 proposed changes, but the Opposition side subsequently broke ranks and insisted on tabling the total package in one go. Acting once again under the apparent impulse of public pressures rather than genuine determination, the Government decided on the eve of the extraordinary parliamentary session to go along with the Opposition demand, but only to find out that the Opposition changed track at the last minute by proposing a different, alternative draft. It has become all-too apparent that, through its constant changes of heart, the fickle Opposition was more intent on out-scoring the Government and forcing a drastic political change such as the Government's resignation or parliamentary dissolution in the process -- rather than entertaining any genuine desire to make the Constitution more democratic. After all, the 1978 charter on which the Opposition draft is based is probably one of the least ideal models to follow. Mr. Chuan and his Democrat colleagues can continue to try distancing themselves from the constitutional-amendment charade by blaming it on Parliament. But having been handed two humiliating defeats on two successive days, the Government has run into a political dead-end. The legitimacy of its existence as much as its ability to govern effectively is put into serious doubt. Under these circumstances, the most logical option for the Government is to dissolve Parliament and return the mandate to the people.
