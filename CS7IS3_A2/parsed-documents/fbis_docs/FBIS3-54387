The national conference which opened in Algiers today is national in name only. The major parties are boycotting it. Our guest, Hocine Ait Ahmed will tell us why. [passage omitted] Hocine Ait Ahmed, you are in Paris, and not in Algiers. Why are you boycotting the conference? I recall that you are the secretary general of the Socialist Forces Front. [Ait Ahmed] Listen, we started to take part in the dialogue aimed at organizing this conference. It appeared that there was no dialogue, neither on the form nor on the substance; it was a monologue. Those who were in charge of conducting this dialogue did not want to make concessions. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Why don't you take the opportunity of this conference to say it openly and publicly in front of all the media? [Ait Ahmed] We said a long time ago that missing the opportunity offered by this conference was an enormous political mistake. It was we, if you remember, who called for a national conference two years ago. The way we perceived the conference was that it should be composed of the army, which is the real power with the power of decision, and the representative parties. It was up to the conference to establish the new structure and the presidential body. As soon as we were certain that all the transition structures and the form that the presidency would take were already decided upon behind the scenes, and that we would be there for the sole purpose of being a rubber stamp... [Announcer, interrupting] What you say means that dialogue is impossible. So does this mean that you are giving a free hand to extremists of all kinds? [Ait Ahmed] Listen, the jokes...[pauses] It is the regime that is giving ammunition to the extremists. They have showed the most stunning disdain of the people in staging a farce in the name of a national conference. [Correspondent] Is Algeria in a civil war? [Ait Ahmed] Algeria is not in a civil war but it is running the risk of getting there. It is not in a civil war because the Algerian people do not wish to embark on such a path. One side of the Algerian population is not taking arms against another, whatever the effort of the regime to involve the population. [Correspondent] Still, could it happen? [Ait Ahmed] Well, all the ingredients are there, above all the high cost of living and a social situation whose extent one cannot imagine. [Correspondent] You are asking for democratic elections. [Ait Ahmed] Yes. [Correspondent] What if these democratic elections result in favor of the enemies of democracy, that is, the fundamentalist militants? [Ait Ahmed] The whole problem lies there. This is the pretext the regime used to justify the coup d'etat, to say there will not be civilian peace without us. Well, not only have they failed to establish civil peace but they also indefinitely postponed the return to the democratic process. Now it is clear that after a two-year transition resulting from the democratic process, they want to extend it to another three-year transition. This is proof that they do not want any democracy; therefore the country is running a higher risk of total collapse. [Correspondent] What do you expect from France and Europe? [Ait Ahmed] Listen, we expect Europe to apply the law. The principle of respect for human rights and the democratic principles are for everyone. We have seen big movements of solidarity with the people of eastern Europe in the West. As far as Algeria is concerned, it is as if its people do not deserve any attention. It is true that the Algerian problem should be solved by the Algerians, by all sides. We notice that the regime has not ceased asking for financial and economic aid. It cannot ask for favorable treatment for itself and at the same time for a discriminatory one for the people. Human rights and democracy should triumph in the country. [Correspondent] In one word, Mr. Ait Ahmed: Are you pessimistic? [Ait Ahmed] I am pessimistic if the international community continues to be fooled by the regime. But I am completely optimistic if the means to establish democracy are given to us. There are democratic forces in Algerian society. All they need is the means to express and freely organize themselves. I am ready to commit myself. [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. Ait Ahmed for the interview.
