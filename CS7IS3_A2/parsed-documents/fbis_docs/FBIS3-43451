The PRO, which was launched yesterday, will campaign for amnesty for rightwing political prisoners. In a statement, PRO Chairman (Avril Budd) said task groups have been formed to investigate the conviction of rightist political prisoners. The task groups will also investigate the reasons for the release of ANC [African National Congress] and PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] prisoners who were arrested for crimes such as the King William's Town Golf Club attack and the St. James Church massacre. The statement says PRO intends to draw public attention to the plight of hundreds of policemen who were imprisoned and will also demand their immediate release. (Budd) says PRO wants the government to either charge or release right-wingers being held under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. It will also ask for right-wing prisoners to be removed from the Soweto Prison where (Budd) claims they are at the mercy of the ANC-alligned police union, Popcru [Police and Prison's Civil Rights Union].
