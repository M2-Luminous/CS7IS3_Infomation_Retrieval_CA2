Apparently it has access to some information which is not available to Pakistan. So far as Pakistan is concerned, it has just the latest pronouncements of the Indian Foreign Secretary, Dixit and the Indian Defence Minister [title as published] Chavan, before it. Mr Dixit, in reply to a question said that the UN Resolutions on Kashmir are irrelevant. Mr Chavan has said that Kashmir can neither be given independence or allowed to join Pakistan. Although the words used by the two are different, they both refer to the redundance of the UN Resolutions. The U.S., however, has reiterated that these Resolutions remain valid. That may or may not amount to a positive factor, but Pakistan's Foreign Secretary himself has said that India had conceded Kashmir's disputed status and the right of the people of Kashmir to have a say in the future of their land. The question then is that if the people of Kashmir have a say in the future of their land. The question then is that if the people of Kashmir have a say, then how can they express it? According to Mr Chavan they cannot ask for freedom nor can they favour Pakistan, they can only be allowed to say that they want to be with India. How will they say it, assuming that they will be allowed to do so, is not clear. Curious as the logic of the Indian position is, the explanations given for it are even more ludicrous. Mr Dixit is quoted as saying that how can a small number of freedom-fighters (dubbed secessionists) be allowed to determine the fate of the whole of Kashmir, and why should Pakistan risk the peace of the sub-continent for a small piece of land? The assumption behind the assessment of the number of freedom-fighters is that had they not come on the scene, the people of Kashmir would have liked to be with India. It is easy to test that assumption. When Cambodia went to polls under UN supervision, people did not vote for the Khmer Rouge. Therefore bring the UN in and let the world see for itself what the Kashmiris want: India or Pakistan. That would be the end of the problem once and for all. So far as the importance of that small piece of territory to Pakistan is concerned, it is based on the founding principle of Pakistan's creation. Pakistan's economy and security also depend on it. It is a Muslim majority state, all Pakistan's rivers flow from it and it is vital to Pakistan's defence. None of these factors apply so far as India's claim is concerned. Also, if it is small and insignificant, why does India want to hang on to it? It was because of U.S. pressure that Pakistan withdrew its resolution on human rights from the UN agenda, letting India off the hook. Now that is clear that India has no intention of giving the people of Kashmir the opportunity to decide its future, it is the responsibility of the U.S. to make India see the light. And if it refuses then use its considerable economic and other clout against it in the interest of peace in the sub-continent.
