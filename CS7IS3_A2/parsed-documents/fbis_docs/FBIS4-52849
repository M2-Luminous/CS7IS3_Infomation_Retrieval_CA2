Hata told a plenary session of the House of Councillors that the next election should be held under the new system, a mixture of 300 single-seat districts and 200 others chosen through proportional representation. Holding a general election under the current system would "make the efforts so far toward political reform retrogress," he said. A government panel is drawing up the electoral map in line with a political reform package passed in January, which mandates the replacement of the multiseat constituency system with the new one. Hata rejected a call by Shoichi Ichikawa of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) for dissolving the House of Representatives and holding a snap election under the current system, which Ichikawa said is fairer than the proposed new system. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest opposition party, last week called for early elections to restore stable government. Hata faced a series of attacks by opposition lawmakers in the threee-day Diet plenary sessions that ended Monday over the fragile political standing of his minority government. The premier repeatedly expressed readiness for dialogue with the opposition parties and sought their cooperation to cope with a heap of pending issues. Hata pledged policy continuity from the administration of his predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned in April over dubious management of his personal finances, and appealed for the opposition's cooperation to tackle some "historical tasks" carried over from the previous cabinet, such as tax and political reform. Hata tried to reassure the nation that he will stick to the government's traditional view of the constitution, which restricts Japan's military to a "minimum necessary" self-defense. Hata, however, skirted the vital issue of possible involvement by Japan in international sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms program. He said he would not comment on any problems concerning the issue since such sanctions are not being discussed at the UN Security Council. But he said that in general terms, Japan's cooperation with the United Nations or the United States over an international crisis should be "within the framework of the constitution." Hata also made a renewed vow to seek Japan's permanent membership in the Security Council. Japan should obtain a permanent seat in the key UN council to break the monopoly by the victors of World War II, he said. Hata said there is a growing call in the UN for Japan to play a larger role in the council in which he says many important global issues are decided.
