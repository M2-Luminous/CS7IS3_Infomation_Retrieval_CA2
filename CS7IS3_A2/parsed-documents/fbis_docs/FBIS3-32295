This morning sanitation workers were removing debris left from the barricades erected by demonstrators in the streets. Activities were returning to normal as urban buses began providing service. On Thursday the buses paralyzed a large part of the country when they stopped operating to avoid being damaged by demonstrators. There were no major incidents as rightist Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen confronted the third workers strike in the first 18 months of his administration, which will conclude in August 1996. On Saturday Duran-Ballen implemented a price increase from 1,460 to 2,500 sucres (from $0.71 to $1.22) a gallon (3.785 liters) for the most widely used gasoline in the country. This measure was rejected by political, social, student, and labor sectors. More than 12 demonstrators and 20 policemen were injured during the clashes, which also caused heavy damage to public and bank buildings in Quito and the port of Guayaquil. The United Workers Front (FUT), which includes the most powerful labor federations, ordered the 24-hour strike to demand wage increases and the cancellation of the fuel price hike. It announced it is planning another nationwide strike in the next few days for an indefinite period, as well as an empty-pot march by housewives and an Indian uprising [levantamiento de indigenas], scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.
