This was disclosed on 14 February by a Chinese specialist on North Korean affairs who contacted North Korean officials concerned in North Korean external economic affairs. He added that the residents of the Sinuiju area, to be opened as a special economic zone, were relocated last year, and that harbor and railroad construction work is now underway in this city. The Chinese specialist said: An economic zone with an area of three square kilometers will be established in Sinuiju, and another economic zone with an area of two square kilometers will be established in Nampo, respectively. The opening of these two cities will be officially announced on 9 September, the day of the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean regime, after being passed by North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly. The specialist said: "I understand that there was some objection to opening up among North Korea's highest leadership, but the leadership decided to promote openness in a phased and limited manner, believing that it is an inevitable trend of history." Stressing that "China has played a great role in leading North Korea to openness" the specialist said that "with the opening of Sinuiju, the industrial zone linking Dandong, located on the opposite side of Sinuiju, and Shenyang, the central city of the three northeast provinces of China, is ready to be linked with Sinuiju. At the same time, North Korea also attaches great importance to the opening of Sinuiju, which will contribute to increasing trade with China. The specialist said that a mutual cooperative system has already been established between China and North Korea for the opening of Sinuiju. Thus, he expressed a strong desire to develop, through this cooperative system, a West Sea economic sphere including North Korea. The specialist also said that in addition to the 380 kilometer-long Shenyang-Dalian expressway, a direct Shenyang-Dandong expressway is scheduled to open in October and that the Shenyang-Fenghuangcheng-Benxi linking railway, which was used as the main supply route for the Chinese People's Volunteers during the Korean war; the second railway bridge on the Yalu River leading to Chongsumyon in North Korea; and other roads will be rebuilt to use as routes for transporting underground resources. The specialist said that Sinuiju, the second largest city of North Korea with a population of 700,000, forms an industrial zone in Puksinuiju [north Sinuiju] District, located in the city's Yalu River riverside. He said that the depth of the water of the present harbor located in the estuary of the Yalu River is 20 meters, that the construction work of expanding this harbor from the present facilities capable of anchoring only a 5,000-tonne ship to the facilities capable of anchoring a 10,000-tonne ship is underway, and that the construction of the Sinuiju-Pyongyang railroad and an 8 km-long railway leading to the harbor is also being accelerated.
