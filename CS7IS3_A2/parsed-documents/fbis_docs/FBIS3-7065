Kim U-sok, who is accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on a three-day visit to Tokyo from Thursday, made the request in a meeting with Kozo Igarashi, Japan's construction minister. Igarashi said that Seoul has to join in a government procurements agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and open its market before being allowed to make bids for Japanese public works. "If South Korea joins the GATT treaty and liberalizes its market, it will be treated like others," Igarashi said. At the GATT-sponsored Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, completed in December last year, South Korea expressed its willingness to sign the government procurements pact, to come into force in January 1996. To do so, however, requires the country to liberalize its market first. The country has so far banned foreign contractors from making bids for its projects on their own.
