Development is an aim, reform a motive force, and stability a condition; none of them is dispensable. Our country now has entered a new historical period of development. The entire party and people throughout the country are implementing the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and are struggling hard for the establishment of the socialist market economy system. The whole country is experiencing political stability, economic development, nationality solidarity, and social progress. Just like various parts in the whole country, the situation in Hunan is also gratifying. However, we must realize soberly that factors of instability still exist in society. Internationally speaking, peace and development are the main theme and trend of the contemporary world, and this is beneficial to us. However, owing to the fact that the imperialists have not given up their designs for the subjugation of our country, and that they hate to see the rise of powerful China, they always have treated economic invasion, cultural infiltration, and political subversion as fixed policies against our country. They have tried to compel us to submit. A handful of hostile elements at home and a tiny number of sabotaging elements within society coordinate with reactionary forces abroad in an attempt to create trouble. In society, local ruffians, despots, and criminal elements are swollen with arrogance. Various kinds of criminal activities are rampant, and the number of gang crimes has increased. In some areas, the ugly phenomena of prostitution and the patronizing of prostitutes cannot be eliminated, despite repeated bans. Drug taking and drug trafficking also are spreading. As far as potential trouble is concerned, at present state-owned enterprises are suffering from severe losses, and the number of enterprises in a state of suspended or partially suspended production is rising, while the prices of goods are increasing by a fairly large margin. Some workers and staff members are encountering difficulties in their daily lives. Last year, our province suffered from the severe calamities of floods and waterlogging. In spite of the fact that various localities have taken active measures, and have done a solid job in providing disaster relief, and that the situation in those affected areas is good as a whole, many people there still have difficulties in their livelihood. In addition, we also face the historical problems of migration in the reservoir area, and of making proper arrangements for the placement of demobilized servicemen. If we fail to solve these problems well, they too might become factors for instability. For this reason, we must on no account treat them lightly. On the contrary, we must be prepared for danger in times of peace, and must attach importance to these factors of instability. In the meantime, we must take powerful measures to eliminate these factors so as to ensure the smooth progress of reform and development. Some comrades ask: Since our present central task is to grasp reform and develop the economy, how can we spend time and effort on reform? This kind of understanding is incorrect. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has stressed repeatedly that the overriding issue in China is to maintain stability. It is, of course, correct to grasp reform and development wholeheartedly. Leaders at all levels must concentrate their efforts on reform, and must grasp economic construction. However, this does not mean that it is unnecessary for us to grasp stability. Stability, reform and development complement each other. Only by seizing on the fine opportunity, deepening reform, and speeding up development can we consolidate the political situation of stability and unity. Only by safeguarding social stability can we guarantee the smooth progress of reform and development. It is a completely wrong view to set stability against reform and development. The feelings of the masses are the key to social and political stability. This is what we call "popular feelings," or "people's will." At present, the problem of public order is a factor that affects the feelings of the masses. With regard to the problem of public order, public security departments, of course, must grasp it. CPC Committees and governments at all levels, and the number-one men of the party and government in particular, must treat the work of stabilizing public order as their own responsibility. If a place is always in a mess, if something happens here today and there tomorrow, if the masses are devoid of a sense of security, and if foreign businessmen do not dare to come, can the economy of the place develop? Can the reform there be deepened? If the secretary and county magistrate of the place are always busy dealing with these issues, can they concentrate their energy on economic construction, reform, and opening up? Therefore, it is imperative to grasp public order well, and to maintain social stability. Ensuring safety in each place should be regarded as a target for the term of office of our party and government leading cadres. This target should be linked directly with the assessment of their achievements in work, and their promotions and awards. Leaders at all levels must adopt forceful measures to grasp public order well, and to remove various kinds of instability factors and hidden dangers. They must make greater efforts to severely and strictly crack down on criminal, economic, and other offenders in accordance with the law. On no account should they be soft on them. This year, nine major reform measures are to be promulgated in our province. They are unprecedented in terms of scope, depth, dynamics, and degree of difficulty. They definitely will touch on people's ideological concepts, and on the vital interests of the masses and cadres as well. Those who have a lower tolerance may be disgruntled in this way or that. This requires us to do the work of getting their thinking straightened out. For example, while carrying out housing reform, a number of people may have no money to buy their own houses for a period of time; they will complain about this. With regard to the reform of the medical system, some people who see doctors frequently must pay part of the medical expenses. Those cadres and masses who currently enjoy free medical care may feel more inconvenienced now than the past. They will have complaints about this. With regard to the masses who were affected by fairly serious natural disasters last year, and have encountered difficulties in their life, they will be disgruntled if we fail to help them solve these difficulties promptly. In particular, the problem of commodity prices can directly affect the "food baskets" and "grain bags" of the masses. Currently this is a hot topic for conversation among the masses. In addition, public transport is also a problem that can affect the feelings of the masses. If we fail to take expeditious and decisive measures to curb price hikes and straighten out transport order, stability and unity will be affected. If we do our work well in this regard, it will play a very great role in maintaining stability. If we fail to handle this matter well, it will encourage the growth of those factors of instability. Therefore, leaders at all levels not only must set their sights on the development of reform, but also must pay attention to and make efforts to grasp social stability. They must go deep among the masses, listen to their voice, and understand their demands. They must be truly concerned about the weal and woe of the people, and must promptly help them solve difficulties arising in production, work, study, and livelihood. If their difficulties cannot be solved for a period of time, it is necessary to explain this to them. The masses are reasonable; as long as we keep them in our hearts, always think of them, and do our work for them in their households so that it strikes a chord in their hearts, the broad masses of people will conscientiously safeguard stability and unity. If the people's minds are at rest, and they unite as one to advance courageously, stability and unity can be ensured. There is no doubt that it will be beneficial to speeding up reform and accelerating development. Today's situation of stability has not come about easily. All of society must conscientiously value and safeguard it. People's organizations and various circles in society must give play to their own strong points so as to help the party and government do mass work well, and make contributions to maintaining stability. As long as several hundreds of thousands of cadres, tens of thousands of party members, and millions upon millions of the masses can conscientiously safeguard stability and unity, social stability definitely can be consolidated day by day, and there will be fine conditions for reform and development. In this way, we can concentrate our efforts on promoting the economy, make a new leap forward, and advance to a new height by the end of this century.
