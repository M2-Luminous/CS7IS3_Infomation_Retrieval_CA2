Hence our first question. [Sabic] Is the Washington Agreement perhaps being sabotaged? [Akmadzic] It is obvious that we will not be able to meet all the envisaged deadlines, but I do not think that the Washington Agreement is being sabotaged. There are simply still too large differences in the views on some issues and we need time to bring these views closer. [Sabic] Why has the Bosniak side persisted with the nomination of Alija Izetbegovic, even after the Croatian side made a major concession by withdrawing the nomination of Mr. Zubak? [Akmadzic] The Bosniaks hold the view that because their people have experienced the greatest suffering, they have the moral right to have their man as the head of the federation first. They claim that Mr. Izetbegovic enjoy enormous trust among his people, while our argument is that his second term of office had already expired in 1992 and that, according to the rotation system, it is now the turn of a Croat, and that since the setting up of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1974, the Croats have held this post for only three years. In our view. Mr. Izetbegovic also bears certain political responsibility for the people's lack of readiness to defend Bosnia-Herzegovina. I nevertheless believe that reason will prevail, that both sides will still think it over and that we will reach an agreement. We Need To Create a Climate of Trust [Sabic] Nevertheless, some things appear to have been agreed on successfully. [Akmadzic] The talks are actually running quite successfully. We have achieved peace, people are moving freely, we have reached a very important agreement of the government of the future federation, on the ministries and departments that will work for the government. We have also reached agreements on regulating imports and exports, the transit of goods within the federation, setting up of telecommunication links, and the supply of electric power. Prisoners have been exchanged. True, there are still a number of misunderstandings, but these are gradually being eliminated. We have agreed on the pace of return of the refugees and the evicted and displaced persons. The election of the leading people of the federation is the key issue, because it encroaches directly on the equality of the peoples. However, I think that it is more important at present to talk about what we have achieved. We need to create a climate of trust, as stipulated by the joint declaration that was signed by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic in September last year. [Sabic] It is often said that an agreement on the leaders cannot be achieved without the intervention of the representatives of the United States, without those who mediated in the signing of the agreement? [Akmadzic] I do no think that we will be forced to seek the help of the United States or anyone else to solve the leadership issue. We simply must resolve this ourselves. The issue of electing the first president of the federation is difficult, but once this has been resolved, the rest will be considerably easier. [Sabic] What are the arguments of the Bosniak side against the election of Mr. Zubak? [Akmadzic] The Bosniak side is presenting arguments in favor of its candidate, but is not interfering in the nomination of our candidate. This is what was agreed in principle and applies to all candidates. Therefore, the Bosniak side has not presented any arguments against Mr. Zubak personally. [Sabic] The statements made by some Bosniak officials give the impression that, despite the fact that the constitution of the federation is very clear, an attempt is being made to secure some advantage for the more numerous nation. [Akmadzic] The constitution of the federation does not go into the size of individual nations. We do know that the Muslim nation is considerably more numerous and therefore we do not demand parity at all levels, but only in the leadership, where the equality of the peoples is reflected. The size of the nation "argument" has appeared among the Bosniaks, but this has never affected the talks directly. The United Nations does not recognize factors such as the size of a nation nor the size of a country. [Sabic] There are some fears in the public that the agreement could be seriously affected as a whole if no agreement is reached on the leader of the future state. Was there any indication of that during the talks? [Akmadzic] So far, the agreement and the implementation of the federal constitution have never been brought into question for a minute. We have some objections regarding the release of prisoners, we demand greater flexibility in the election of leading people, we demand that the media campaign calm down, especially in Mostar, and we demand that they themselves remove those individuals who are against the constitution. I think that in this respect we are making more resolute moves than the Bosniaks. Ethnic Criterion Is Main, But Not Only Criterion [Sabic] Regarding the removal of the individuals who oppose the constitution, one should also mention that the Bosniak side claims that in the Croatian leadership there are those who are responsible for crimes and that they cannot be involved in the implementation of the agreement. [Akmadzic] We agreed that the representatives of both nations, each one in its own house, clear this problem, that we do not accuse each other, and then, when we finish this, see what to do next. [Sabic] Is this agreement respected? [Akmadzic] Yes, it is at present. However, neither side has carried out the necessary investigation as yet, and therefore we do not have enough information of the conduct of responsible persons at all levels, but know what the situation is in the leadership. [Sabic] How is the work on setting up cantons going on? There is a mention of great opposition by the Bosniak side to the cantons being based on the ethnic criterion? [Akmadzic] The federal constitution clearly states that the federation will be made up of federal units and that these units will not bear national attributes in their names. The federal law will regulate the methods and ways of determining cantonal borders, whereby the ethnic criterion will be the main, but not the only criterion. We have already asked our representatives in the expert team to establish detailed criteria. At our recent meeting in Sarajevo we jointly concluded that this work should be speeded up. [Sabic] In some parts of the free territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, such as Mostar and Travnik, there are a large number of Muslims who were expelled from the parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina currently occupied by the Serbs. Will their presence have any influence on the borders of the cantons. They are not foreign citizens and many of them have been issued personal documents in these new places of abode. [Akmadzic] The constitution is taking into account the results of the last census. We have agreed with the Bosniak side, and we have also said this to the international community, that all refugees and displaced persons must return to the places they had to flee from. We spoke to the Bosniak side about this at length and agreed that if the refugees, if they cannot return to the parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina under Serbian control, should go to the cantons in which their nation constitutes a majority. However, there will be no forced eviction from any region, nor forced return of refugees. It Is Not Time for Politicking [Sabic] Can a process similar to the one taking place in the HDZ of Croatia be expected in the HDZ of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Some HDZ deputies in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina have allegedly been preparing the founding of a new party? [Akmadzic] It is understandable that events in Croatia most directly affect the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are already organized in several political parties, which is good. It is a known fact that the HDZ is the strongest party among them, that it has practically won all Croat votes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, unanimity cannot reign in the HDZ either, which is also good. Differences in views do exist, but the majority of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly those in the HDZ, want the war to stop and the federal constitution implemented. This is in the interest of us as a nation and not as a party. I do not know whether anyone will decide to form a new party for one reason or the other, but if he does, I do not think that this will affect the HDZ much. No one has ever been ruined because someone else has become strong, but because he has become weak. I think that this is not the time for politicking. This generation of Croats has the task and the opportunity, after 900 years, to create and preserve a Croatian state and Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is also the state of the Croatian people. [Sabic] How many HDZ deputies are, presently, three and half years after the elections, willing to carry through the party policies? How many votes can you count on with certainty? [Akmadzic] The Croats have a total of 49 deputies in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of these, 44 have been elected as HDZ candidates. A great majority of them voted for the federal constitution, which contains fundamental principles of our policy, which means that they support the policy of the HDZ. We also count on this political orientation in the future. There used to be some misunderstandings about the existence of Herzeg-Bosna, allegedly ambiguous attitudes toward the Muslims people, and about relations among the Croats who live in the parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina where they constitute a majority and those in their regions where they are a minority. Some of these problems will be solved with the implementation of the federal constitution. We will find out what people really think only at the next elections. I personally believe that the people will again extend their support to the HDZ.
