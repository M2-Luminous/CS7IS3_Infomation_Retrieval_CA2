Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech entitled "Clearly Understand the New Situation and Seize the New Opportunity to Win New Victory in the Second Pioneering Program." In his speech, he set forth general demanda for this year's economic work, that is, to deepen reform, expand opening up, and improve the quality of economic operations by accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economy in order to ensure that the national economic plan is fulfilled and new victory in the second pioneering program is won this year. Yue Qifeng said: The most conspicuous characteristics of this year's economic situation are: The province is about to make a big step in reform; in macroeconomy, the state is about to carry out reforms in finance and tax, banking, foreign trade, investment, and management of state-owned assets; and in microeconomy, the province is about to make a substantive step in changing the mechanisms of enterprises with the purpose of establishing a modern enterprise system. This year, we will not only face the old problems of conspicuous structural contradictions, stagnated technological transformation, heavy historical burdens, low economic efficiency, and extensive management but will also meet new problems in carrying out new major reform measures. The mix of new and old contradictions will impose a rigorous test on the province's economic development. Yue Qifeng said: Whether we can achieve new and even greater progress in the economy this year depends primarily on whether we can make a big breakthrough in reform. Therefore, in conducting economic work in 1994, we should not only give prominence to reform by regarding it as the major line running through the whole process, but also persist in the idea that only development constitutes the essential criterion, seize the new opportunity, face up to new challenges, and achieve new progress. We should not only give prominence to grasping the focal and difficult points of economic work and continue to run large and medium-sized enterprises well but also energetically cultivate and develop new economic growth points. Yue Qifeng said: The tasks on reform, opening up, and economic construction we face this year will be very arduous, and the reform measures to be set forth this year will be more numerous, extensive, profound, and difficult than those set forth in any of the past dozen of years. This has set on us a demand higher than those set on us in the past. To adapt ourselves to the new situation, leaders at all levels must conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and must further emancipate the mind, enhance spirit, change the style of work, and truly attend to work. So long as our minds are emancipated, our road of development is set correctly, and our work is practical, we will certainly realize sustained, rapid, and sound development in the national economy and win new victory in the second pioneering program. The conference was presided over by Xiao Zuofu, vice governor of the province. Vice Governor Wen Shizhen relayed the guidelines of the national economic work conference. Attending the conference were provincial leaders Gu Jinchi, Wang Huaiyuan, Shang Wen, Li Guozhong, Yu Junbo, Cong Zhenglong, Gao Guozhu, and Xu De.
