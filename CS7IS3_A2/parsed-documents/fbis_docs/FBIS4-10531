An attempt was made to drown his cry of Land and Liberty! through the betrayal of Venustiano Carranza. Today, the usurper Salinas de Gortari, the self-described "president of the Mexican republic," lies to the Mexican people, saying his reforms of Article 27 of the Constitution reflect the spirit of Gen. Zapata. The supreme government is lying! Zapata will not die over such a haughty decree. The right to land for those who till that land is irreversible, and the war cry of Land and Liberty! still has not found rest in these Mexican lands. Under the blanket of liberalism that has darkened our lands every peasant who fights for his agrarian rights is jailed and murdered. Salinas' reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution represent a betrayal of the fatherland, and the usurper of federal executive power in Mexico should be prosecuted for this crime. Brothers, today is the 100th day of the new dawning of our voice; from the mouths of the rifles of faceless men and women spoke the voices of landless peasants, farm workers, small landowners, and Mexican Indians. The voices of those who have nothing and deserve everything had to follow the path of their smallest men, the most humiliated, the most persecuted, the most forgotten. The voices of true men spoke for the Mexicans who are dispossessed of their lands, dignity, and history. Everything seemed lost during our people's long night. The land gave nothing but pain and death, but 10 years before this day certain good people sowed in our grieved land the hope that true men would return to life. The seed of their words found a good place to be born in the Mexican mountains. Their silence was cultivated. Their passage was night which turned to day. At the dawning of our cry of "Enough!" the land yielded the fruits that had been sown. Instead of grief, anger was born; instead of humiliation, dignity emerged; instead of regrets, we reaped weapons. Thousands of men and women unearthed, from the very land that only gave them poverty, the tender fire that would fill their hands; they covered their faces, erased their pasts, left behind their names and lands and followed the steps of war. None of us men and women of nocturnal passage will have a tomorrow. There will never again be peace for our yearnings. Never again will our bones and blood have rest. For whom are these men and women walking? Who drinks their blood? For whom is the light in their words? Who will gain life from their death? One hundred days. Ten years. Whose hands, besides those of the men and women who cannot be here with you today, will pick up the flag their blood tore from the hands of the powerful? Who will fall in with their dignified stride? Who with them, with us, can speak with only a look, a voice and fierce tenderness? Who cries out with us? Who does not abandon us? Who struggles with us? Who listens to our dead? Not the usurper, who sells his pride at the National Palace. That pride is not the pride he sells to us. It is not pride that is murdering us. It is not pride that is dispossessing us. It is not pride that humiliates us. You do, brothers. For you, our blood. For your night our timid light. For your life our death. Our war for your peace. For your ears our words. Your grief, brothers, will seek relief in our struggle. For you everything, brothers; for us, nothing. Brothers, before you, in that palace where lies reign today, lives he who denies us and whom no good person has asked to be there. The powerful gentleman who snatches our lives away everyday should leave. He must go, brothers. His voice should not be a mandate for us. Nothing good comes from his doors. There are lies in his face and deceit in his words. He must go, brothers. This is the cry coming from the mountains; this is what our blood is saying; this is what our dead are requesting. He must go. Tell him that, brothers: He must Go! Let no one else arrive at that palace you have in front of you if it is not by the mandate of the others; he who sits in that chair must give orders while obeying; he who speaks from that balcony must have the truth in his words; he who calls himself our chief must be that while obeying. Tell him that this, brothers, is what we want. We cannot be with you on this day, brothers; our steps follow the night into the mountains; our faces are still gagged, and our words are very distant. Take us for one moment, Mexican brothers! Give us your voices a moment and allow your mouths to speak our words. At this very instant, in the mountains of southeastern Mexico, thousands of men and women who have been rejected, who have no names or pasts are reviving in their chests the first cry of the beginning of the year. Our hearts are happy, because Emiliano Zapata has come again, in your steps, to the square [zocalo] in Mexico. We, small and forgotten, raise the image of Zapata in the other heart of the fatherland: the mountains of the Mexican southeast. Cheers, Mexican brothers! Let our cry be yours: Long live Emiliano Zapata! Death to the supreme government! Freedom! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully, from the mountains of the Mexican southeast. Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the Zapatist Army of National Liberation. Mexico, April 1994.
