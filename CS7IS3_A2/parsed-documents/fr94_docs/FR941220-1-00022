FR941220-1-00022 FR941220-1-00008 At the monitoring sites used to evaluate the attainment status of Monterey County, there has been only one exceedance of the ozone NAAQS. This exceedance was monitored in 1991 at the Pinnacles site. There have been no violations of the ozone NAAQS during the 1991&hyph;1993 period. Based on ambient air monitoring data for the years 1991&hyph;1993 (including data from the Pinnacles site which helped form the basis for the Monterey County nonattainment designation of 1990), it is clear that additional reductions of NO X would not contribute to attainment of the ozone standard. For further information regarding the monitoring sites data, please see attachments 1 and 2 to the Technical Support Document, dated October 1994. The EPA is proposing to approve the Monterey Bay Area section 182(f) NO X RACT exemption request based upon the evidence provided by the MBUAPCD and the MBUAPCD's compliance with the requirements outlined in the EPA guidance. Continuation of the section 182(f) exemption, once granted, is contingent upon the continued monitoring and continued attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS in the affected area in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Monterey Bay Area (consistent with the requirements contained in 40 CFR part 58 and recorded in AIRS), EPA will provide notice in the Federal Register . A determination that the NO X exemption no longer applies would mean that the NO X general and transportation conformity provisions would again be applicable (see 58 FR 63214; 58 FR 62188; 59 FR 31238) to the affected area. The NO X RACT requirements would also re-apply, although some reasonable time period after the EPA determination may be provided for sources to meet the RACT limits. EPA expects this time period to be as expeditious as practicable, taking into account any current and applicable State or Federal regulations. If a nonattainment area is redesignated to attainment of the ozone NAAQS, NO X RACT is to be implemented as provided for in the EPA-approved maintenance plan. This action proposes to exempt the Monterey Bay ozone nonattainment area from implementing the NO X RACT and the applicable general and transportation conformity requirements for NO X . The final action on this proposal serves as a final determination that the finding of nonsubmittal for the NO X RACT requirements has been corrected, and that on the effective date of the final action on this proposal, the 24-month Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock is stopped. The 18-month sanctions clock was stopped on October 21, 1994 when EPA made a completeness determination for the second of two rules submitted to meet the NO X RACT requirements. Upon EPA's final approval of the NO X exemption, MBUAPCD will recind the two NO X RACT rules previously submitted to meet the CAA requirements. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future implementation plan. Each request for a section 182(f) exemption shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000. This exemption action does not create any new requirements, but allows suspension of the indicated requirements for the life of the exemption. Therefore, because the proposed approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by January 19, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such a rule. This action may not be challenged in later proceedings to enforce its requirements. Section 307(b)(2). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Nitrogen dioxide, Nitrogen oxides, Ozone, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Volatile organic compounds. Dated: December 9, 1994. Felicia Marcus, Regional Administrator. Part 52, chapter I, title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 52_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 52 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Subpart F_California 2. Subpart F is proposed to be amended by adding new ยง52.235 to read as follows: ยง52.235 Control strategy for ozone: Oxides of nitrogen. EPA is approving a Section 182(f) exemption request submitted by the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District on April 21, 1994. The approval exempts the Monterey Bay ozone nonattainment area from the oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) control requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the area from implementing reasonably available control technology (RACT) for major stationary sources of NO X and the NO X related requirements of general and transportation conformity regulations. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS occurs in the Monterey Bay area, the exemption shall no longer apply. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31230 Filed 12&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
