The marchers, including leaders from Shayk Hasina Wajed's main-opposition Awami League (AL) and the left-wing Workers Party, carried coffins of the dead to the downtown Baitul Mukarram national mosque. They silently carried black flags and a banner demanding the punishment of the killers, and prayed for the dead. The marchers were mostly from the Lalbagh area, in the old parts of Dhaka, where six people were killed and more than 30 injured Monday when AL's victory procession was fired on by unidentified gunmen, a day after the country's first mayoral city elections, police and witnesses said. A policeman on duty said the number of mourners could be as high as 30,000. The mourners later buried the dead without incident in a nearby graveyard, but under heavy security, witnesses said. Security was intensified Tuesday as the residents staged a half-day protest strike, and the atmosphere was tense, with shops, schools and businesses remaining closed. "We have strong police and BDR (para-military Bangladesh Rifles) forces deployed in the area," one police officer at the Lalbagh police station said. No violence was reported during the stoppage. Witnesses and police had said earlier that unidentified gunmen opened fire on supporters of AL mayoral candidate Mohammad Hanif, who took a commanding lead in weekend polls, killing six. Eighteen supporters were reported to be in stable condition Tuesday. But Dhaka newspapers reported Tuesday that the attack was carried out by Abdul Aziz, a member of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party and a losing candidate for city commissioner, and his supporters. The mass circulation Daily ITTEFAQ newspaper said Abdul Aziz had gone into hiding, and one resident said unidentified people ransacked and looted his home late Monday. The government, in a press note late Monday said six suspects from two rival groups have been arrested in connection with the "unfortunate incident." Angry mourners Monday also had attacked three government ministers when they went to the hospital to pay homage to the dead, but police rescued them unscathed by throwing tear gas and using batons. During Sunday's first ever mayoral and city commissioner elections, one school boy was killed and more than 200 were injured in sporadic clashes between rival groups. Hanif is leading Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's BNP nominee ex- mayor Mirza Abbas, by 75,200 votes, in 704 out of 737 districts in Dhaka. In the port city of Chittagong, AL candidate Mohiuddin Chowdhury was unofficially declared mayor, based on preliminary election results. While BNP clinched victory in the cities of Khulna and Rajshahi. Because of the violence, the election commission cancelled voting in 26 centres and withheld results in three others. The official BANGLADESH SANGBAD SANGSTHA News Agency said the results in four districts "could not be traced," but the total number of votes cast there was 72,080. BSS did not elaborate, but there was a report that a recount would be held. The elections were crucial, as it was considered the first popularity test of the two main political groups since the 1991 parliamentary elections under a caretaker government.
