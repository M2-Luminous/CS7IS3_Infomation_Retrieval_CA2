This fact was disclosed at a Monday news conference in Alma-Ata [Almaty] by the Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister for Science Galym Abilsiitov. He said Russia will also pay a monthly rent of $115 Mn partly in cash and partly through mutual settlements. Abilsiitov said the head of administration in Leninsk where the cosmodrome staff lives will be appointed jointly by the presidents of the two countries and the chief of the cosmodrome by the Russian head of state with the consent of his Kazakh counterpart. A special envoy of the Kazakh president is supposed to be present at the cosmodrome. Abilsiitov said that Kazakhstan and Russia should work out the contract on the cosmodrome in three months. The Kazakh government shall act as lessor and the Russian as lessee. Abilsiitov will head the Kazakh side of the commission. In his opinion the work has only begun and will be quite difficult. The deputy prime minister also said that the national aerospace agency will be moved to Leninsk from Alma-Ata. Commenting on Abilsiitov's statement one of the drafters of the agreement on Baykonur told INTERFAX that the size of compensation for the use of the facility has not been approved, while under the agreement it should not exceed the size of Kazakhstan's debt to Russia. He said he could not understand what compensation can be in question, "as Russia has actually covered all the spending on the maintenance of the cosmodrome alone." In his opinion, "if Russia had stopped spending on Baykonur two years ago, there would have been nothing to rent today."
