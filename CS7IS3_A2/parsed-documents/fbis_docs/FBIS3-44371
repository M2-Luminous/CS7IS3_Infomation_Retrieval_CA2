He stressed during the discussion: Party organizations at various levels across China should earnestly implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; further strengthen party building; and make fresh contributions to expeditiously establishing a socialist market economy, and to enhancing a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. The three-day eighth party work meeting of central government organs ended today. Luo Gan, state councillor, secretary general of the State Council, and secretary of the Work Committee for Central Government Organs, chaired the discussion meeting. At the meeting, Liu Zhengwei, deputy secretary of the Work Committee for Central Government Organs, reported on the eighth party work meeting of central government organs. Responsible people of party committees of organs under the Ministries of State Security and Water Resources and the China National Petroleum Corporation successively spoke on ways to strengthen leadership in the party organizations of government organs, reform and operations in their respective departments, and giving play to the roles of the party organizations of government organs. Li Peng said: In 1993, the party organizations at various levels of central government organs and the vast number of personnel handling party affairs have done a lot of work in conscientiously helping departmental party organizations and administrative leaders. They have played an important role and achieved relatively good results in promoting reform, accomplishing departmental work and missions, and waging anticorruption struggles. Li Peng expounded the current situation and missions, and pointed out that central government organs shoulder important responsibilities to deepen reform, develop the economy, and safeguard social stability. He said: We must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, unify our thinking with the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the National Economic Work Meeting, and maintain a high degree of unanimity with the party central committee so as to ensure the smooth implementation of government orders. Li Peng stressed: In the process of establishing a socialist market economy, we should correctly handle relations among reform, development, and stability to ensure successful implementation of various reforms and a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy in 1994. He said: Party organizations at various levels should give full play to their roles as fighting bastions, give full play to the roles of party members as vanguard models, lead the broad masses of cadres, staff, and workers; help the leading party groups and administrative leaders of various departments to complete all missions, and work hard to accomplish various tasks laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Li Peng said: Throughout the course of carrying out reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, we should persistently pay attention to reform and economic progress on the one hand, and launch an anticorruption campaign and step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization on the other. We should persistently uphold the policy of "building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both." He urged the leading party groups in various departments to provide better guidance for the party work of government organs, to earnestly improve the thinking and work style of government organs, and to wholeheartedly serve the people with down-to-earth, efficient and honest work. He pointed out the need to intensify the cultivation of middle-aged and young cadres, to strengthen the development of grass-roots party organizations, and to implement various tasks all the way down to the grass-roots level. Luo Gan said in his speech: In 1994, the party organizations of central government organs should understand the situation, specify their tasks, and mobilize and organize the broad masses of communist party members to lead the campaign to deepen reform, develop the economy, safeguard social stability, and to play their roles as vanguards and models. They should uphold the policy of building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both. They should continually deepen the anticorruption struggle, and earnestly improve the thinking and work style of government organs. While establishing a socialist market economy, they should further strengthen and improve the party building of government organs. Attending the discussion meeting were responsible comrades of the leading party groups of various departments of central government organs, responsible comrades of the party committees of government organs, and responsible people from relevant departments.
