The government is committed to this objective. Because of the government's efforts to ensure that the people take part in drafting the future constitution, more than 16 million people have debated the draft constitution. [passage omitted] I want to confirm that the transitional government will take all the necessary steps to ensure that the transitional period is democratic and successful and that it will create a conducive atmosphere for parties to participate in the constitutional congress. Although it is clear that the government's and peace-loving people's desire and efforts are to make sure that the constitutional process is a success, there are people who are still opposed to it. These people, who are living abroad and within the country, are struggling to halt or change the direction of the transitional path. There is a basic issue which we want to confirm to these people once and for all. The programs and structures set up to end the transitional period victoriously will not be changed under any circumstances. The transitional period will end in accordance with the time and direction determined. The struggle to change this is nothing but a daydream, so I call on these dreamers to change their ideas and to declare publicly that they want to pursue their objectives in a peaceful way, and participate in the May elections and other programs of the transitional period. The democratic path embarked on in our country does not seek to isolate others. The legal and democratic participation of all will rather strengthen the transitional process. [passage omitted] It must be clear that although the government is ready to help dreamers if they publicly declare their readiness to pursue their objectives peacefully and to participate in the elections, it will not accept any kind of attempt to halt the transition programs or structures, whether directly or indirectly. Concerning the economy, it is no secret for the Ethiopian people that our economy has problems because of mismanagement by the previous regime and civil war. However, because of the steps taken by the transitional government and the people's efforts, the economic situation has improved in the past two years. It may be recalled that last year alone the economy grew by 7.6 percent. This progress was achieved because of the progress made in the agricultural and other economic sectors, especially the increase in production in the industrial sector. The various economic policies of the government also played a major role in development. This year, although the government had planned that the economy would grow by 5.6 percent, according to the prevailing situation the expected growth will not exceed 3.5 percent. The main reason for this is because of the prevailing drought which has seriously affected agricultural production. [passage omitted] As a result of the government's efforts it has been possible to limit the displacement and death of our people. However, it is very difficult to contain the situation by the efforts of the government and the people alone. It requires the assistance of the donor (?agencies). In this regard, on behalf of the victims and the Ethiopian people in general, I would like to extend my appreciation to the donor countries and agencies for the assistance they have rendered so far, however, the extent of the assistance and the (?means) of delivery are not helping us to contain the situation. We call on the donor countries to extend their assistance, bearing in mind the dangerous consequences at stake. The other issue which should be raised in connection with our economic activities is the ongoing restructuring process in the civil service. It may be recalled that after the formation of regional administrations, these regional administrations had problems regarding expertise. As a result of this, and the huge number of civil servants in the (?cities), it was necessary to carry out a restructuring in the central government's offices. [passage omitted] The objective of the restructuring process is not to suspend employees, but to transfer employees from the central government's offices to regional administrations. However, some people are being dismissed because they refused to work in regional administrative offices. So conscientious employees should not fear that they will be affected by the restructuring process. Dear Ethiopians, the remaining tasks for the fulfillment of the transitional process are no greater than those we have achieved so far. We have managed to overcome the difficult ones in a proper and positive way. The major remaining task is the adoption of the draft constitution which will enable us to form a people's government. So far, the process is going smoothly and I am sure that it will be concluded successfully. The transitional government is, more than ever before, on the side of the people concerning the above key issue, and concerning the improvement of the economy and combating the problem of drought and, in general, maintaining the prevailing peace and further strengthening the democratic system. Thank you.
