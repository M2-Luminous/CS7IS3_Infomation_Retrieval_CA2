In its first statement on the next administration, the MMR said that it will demand that Frei "pay the immense social debt contracted by the government of Patricio Aylwin." Cesar Quiroz, deputy coordinator of the MMR National Board, who in June 1991 abandoned the armed struggle to join politics, said that the level of violence would depend on the situation in the country and on the people's acceptance of it. About its links with the Autonomous Manuel Rodriguez Front (FMR-A), which has remained underground, undertaking subversive actions, the MMR said that it had no plans for joint actions, though adding that it respects them in their capacity as former companions in the armed struggle. [passage omitted] Quiroz, who said that the current state of law is "highly repressive," made these remarks during a press conference that he and MMR National Board member Marco Riquelme hosted yesterday at the MIDA [Allendist Leftist Democratic Movement] headquarters. The members of the political group said they do not expect any change for the future, adding that the police state would become more intense during this period. They also emphasized that during the "new times" Socialists will be in charge of repression, thus alluding to the designation of the Socialist German Correa to the Interior Ministry. The leaders read a statement to the press saying that the Aylwin government did not resolve the problem of political prisoners or of human rights. [passage omitted]
