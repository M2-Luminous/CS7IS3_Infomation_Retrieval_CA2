The statement notes that the police of Japan which styles itself a law-governed country breaks into lawful Chongnyon organisations in broad daylight and commits outrages and gangsters, running about in packs, openly commit murder and violence against Koreans in Japan. "This is an intolerable infringement upon the human rights of the Koreans in Japan, legitimate citizens overseas of the DPRK, and outrageous acts violating the international law," it notes and stresses: "The Japanese authorities must promptly stop suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for it". It strongly demands that the Japanese authorities give up immediately their hostile policy against the DPRK and stop forthwith nuclear armament directed against it.
