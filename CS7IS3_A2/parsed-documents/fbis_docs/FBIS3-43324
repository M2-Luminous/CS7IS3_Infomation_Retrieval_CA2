Among issues raised were the 1994 appropriations bill and the validation of powers for hearing the reports of parliamentary audit missions. The ceremony offered an opportunity for deputies to recall the country's political and social situation. Here is our report: [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The October 1993 session which closed on 3 January was not characterized by intense activity, as was the case in the past owing to the country's general political climate and the failure of the government to present the 1994 appropriations bill in a timely maaner. To date the bill has not yet been presented at the National Assembly. It would have provided answers to queries from deputies by explaining how the people's confidence in the state is going to be stimulated and enabling the effective revamping of the country's economic activities. All that the National Assembly had to do was to place on record a bitter note of the situation in view of the serious budgetary legislation lapses for the 1994 financial year. Second Deputy Speaker Maneng Makong stressed that the monetary reform which had at the time been considered inevitable has just experienced a boomerang that has been sharply felt among all the social strata. He also spoke of the actions taken by parliament both inside and outside the country. The National Assembly was not indifferent to the unfortunate bloody coup attempt in Burundi and the death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire. Turning to the crisis in this transition period, the second deputy speaker observed that people had confused democracy with anarchy and democratic process with revolutionary process. To resolve this crisis, Zairian politicians must strive to draft the constitution of the Third Republic within the shortest possible time. Mr. Maneng Makong concluded with biblical verses as a way of appealing to the conscience of all politicians. [end recording]
