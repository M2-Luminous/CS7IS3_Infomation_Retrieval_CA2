In an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System, KBS, today a U.S. scholar, who has reportedly played a behind-the-scenes role for former U.S. President Carter's visit to North Korea, revealed that former President Carter's nonofficial package offer contains the improvement of U.S.-North Korean relations and the measures for guaranteeing the overall security of the Korean peninsula in return for guaranteeing North Korea's nuclear transparency. This scholar, who did not want to be identified, said that if former President Carter achieved no success in his visit to North Korea this time, public opinion in the United States would quickly turn toward imposing sanctions against North Korea within or without the framework of the United Nations.
