This was one of the conclusions reached yesterday at the company's general assembly. The RDP Group's aim is to create a system of mutual cooperation involving the Czech Army, the central bodies of state administration, and the arms manufacturers and to participate in the modernization of the Czech Army. According to officials from the Defense Ministry, the suppliers of final equipment for the Czech Army should, on principle, be domestic entities. Roughly 30 percent of the 2.5 percent of the state budget earmarked for the Defense Ministry has been set aside for modernizing the Czech Army. The ministry is now drawing up the priorities of the program for the Army's modernization. The modernized T-72 tank and the Aero L-59 aircraft, for example, with all probability will be among the new military systems.
