El Chacal; place and date not given; from the "This Morning" newscast] [Text] Mr. Jose Angel Talavera: The socioeconomic woes you say prompted all of you to take up arms will not be resolved by following a bloody path, because instead of creating the necessary conditions to overcome the dire poverty our peasants live in, fighting will worsen the situation because of the mourning, hatred, and pain that every war triggers. There are more convincing and effective means, if they are well-organized with the definite support of the peasants, to demand and defend the rights that we all have as Nicaraguans. I, as well as those around me, will never allow you to be neglected or ignored once you disarm, as is the case with former Army members and with former Nicaraguan resistance members. The stability we are all striving for must not solely benefit the traditionally powerful and wealthy people from the countryside and the city. Instead, it must basically benefit the workers who, along with the heroic Nicaraguan peasants, constitute the essential foundation of the Nicaraguan nation's life. On behalf of the General Staff and the Military Council of the EPS [Sandinist People's Army], I guarantee respect for and protection of the lives and assets of all those who disarm immediately to rejoin the country's everyday life. We will support the mechanisms agreed upon with you in order that you will feel truly certain that the personal safety of each one of you will be guaranteed. The Nicaraguan fatherland and people require absolute peace. I am sure that you will contribute to achieving this absolute peace by disarming with dignity and by later striving in a civilized manner for peace, which is in jeopardy because of the severe unemployment and socioeconomic inequalities that all Nicaraguans face. [Signed] Sincerely, Army General Humberto Ortega Saavedra, Commander in Chief of the EPS
