What this is: traditional submission to fate and recognition of its impotence or, on the contrary, some subtle calculation, is unclear. The East is, as always, enigmatic and obscure for the European mind. The formerly firm ties with Arab world have come to be regarded--even though this has not been recorded in official documents--as the onerous legacy of the ancien regime and as communist geopolitics. Truly, there was in these ties that which is not usually greatly to the liking of the public at large--indirect participation in regional conflicts, arms trade, and support for rulers unpopular in the world. But there were undoubted pluses also--mutually profitable economic relations and influence in the vast region. All this has been sacrificed to ideological changes. But it would be an exaggeration to say that the door to Russia was suddenly slammed shut in the face of the Arab countries and to place the whole responsibility with the Russian side. It is simply that the West was better able to take advantage of the favorable political conditions. The Arab world failed to display the necessary mobility, yielding important strategic positions practically without resistance. And this in a situation where its interests were objectively very close to Russian interests. Russian producers, desperately in need of currency receipts, are prepared to sell their products for a pittance even. The result is a catastrophic fall in the price of oil and many types of mineral raw material. Farsighted emissaries of the West are penetrating Russia's oil and gas complex ever more deeply and endeavoring to participate in the control of the extractive sectors. Considering the calamitous position of the latter, it is clear how easy this is--all investments are seen as a blessing. It is not hard to foresee in the near future a further decline in the influence of the Organization of Oil-Exporting Countries and a fall in the revenue of the traditional producers of mineral raw material. And a further strengthening of the positions of the West and an increase in the gap between North and South. And although Russia is geographically a northern country, economically it will shortly be somewhere around the Equator, but without an improvement in climate. Arab investments in Russia's oil and gas complex of the appropriate scale offered on favorable terms against subsequent partnership could appreciably adjust this joyless prospect. But the East remains silent. Another sphere of the concurrence of the objective interests of Russia and the Arab countries is the arms trade. In the Russian Federation the manufacture of weapons is one of the few competitive industries. It is in a state of the most profound crisis in connection with demilitarization and the loss of a number of traditional markets: Iraq, Libya, Palestine. The Arab world remains the most attractive partner for our arms manufacturers. But the Atlantic orientation of our foreign policy and the growing direct dependence on the West are becoming an insurmountable barrier to mutually profitable relations. Here also the Arab world, having aroused the direct producers' interest by investments, could rectify matters. But dealers from the East are not to be seen at the defense plants, which are being forced to halt their production lines one after the other. In a social and cultural respect the Western world is closer to Russia than the Arab East. But the structure of economic interests should be a far more important imperative for politicians. How is the situation to be changed? Serious political changes and the renunciation of the one-sided Atlantism of foreign policy are needed for this in Russia. But such changes, in turn, are possible only with the more active position of the Arab world. Assistance to Russia and investments in its economy are at the present time a risky and overhead-laden business. The West is, nonetheless, agreeing to this in the name of its future and its strategic interests. The Arab world, which possesses considerable spare financial resources, should put them to use if it wishes in the future also to be a pronounced factor of geopolitics and to retain the possibility of participation in control of the world oil market. This means not only replacing the West where this is possible--in the investment process--but also offering better terms. And if the West declines assistance programs in the face of this reorientation of Russia, being prepared to compensate the losses connected with this. Whether the proposed scenario proves another oriental legend will depend solely on the capacity of Arab and Russian politicians for recognizing imperatives dictated by the national interests of both parties.
