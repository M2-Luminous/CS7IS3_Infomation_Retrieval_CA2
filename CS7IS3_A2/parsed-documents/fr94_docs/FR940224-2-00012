FR940224-2-00012 FR940224-2-00004 Response: The Department disagrees with respondent. According to our practice as expressed in section 355.48(b)(3) of our Proposed Rules, (54 FR 23384, May 31, 1989), the benefit from a loan occurs when a firm is due to make a payment on the loan. The questionnaire response clearly states that in the case of EPC pre-shipment loans, the entire loan must be repaid in full within two days of shipment, whether or not this occurred before the due date on the note. Further, in the case of EPC post-shipment financing, the loan must be repaid on the earlier of the date on which the loan was due or the payment for the shipment was received. In both types of loans, provision is made only for the payment of the entire loan and no provision is made for partial payments. Therefore, we consider each payment listed in the questionnaire response to be a repayment of a separate loan and according to our practice, have countervailed all those loans repaid within our POR or with penalties refunded during the POR. Comment 4: Respondent contends that the loan disbursements from three domestic price stabilization programs_CPD loans to ACFT, BAAC Paddy Mortgage Program and BOT Agricultural Purchase Project_should be allocated over the crop-year during which the funds were available rather than allocated entirely during the calendar year covered by the review. Respondent argues that the allocation of the disbursements should be made by calculating a ratio of crop-year months falling within 1989 to total crop-year months which includes months in both 1989 and 1990. For calculating the benefit from this program, the 1989 benchmark should be used for the portion of loans equivalent to the ratio of months falling in 1989 and the 1990 benchmark used for the portion of loans equivalent to the ratio of months falling in 1989. Response: The Department agrees in part. The questionnaire response shows all CPD loans to ACFT, the provincial federations, and district-level cooperative societies were disbursed in 1989 and repaid in 1990. Therefore, we have adjusted our calculations to reflect the use of the 1989 benchmark rate of 12.23 for loans disbursed under this program (see Comment 2). The revised net subsidy under this program is 0.05 percent ad valorem. Although the RTG allocated the funds to BAAC and BOT in 1989 at the beginning of the crop year, respondent submitted no information as to when the individual loans to farmers under these programs were disbursed by the BAAC and BOT. Therefore, we continue to consider the aggregate amount of BAAC and BOT loans to be disbursed and repaid during the POR. Comment 5: Respondent asserts that the Department's best information available (BIA) rate imposed on the four companies not submitting EPC loan information is overly punitive. Respondent argues that a more reasonable method for calculating the benefits for this program should be adopted because complete EPC loan information was submitted for eight companies accounting for 95.31 percent of rice exports to the United States for which EPCs were received. Response: In its questionnaire, the Department requested information on all EPCs granted, paid, or on which interest was paid or due on rice exports to the United States during the POR. In its supplemental questionnaire, the Department requested complete loan information for all 12 companies exporting to the United States who utilized EPCs during the POR. Respondent submitted complete loan information for only eight of the 12 companies but stated in their supplemental questionnaire response that the loan charts for the four exporters would be submitted as soon as they were available to counsel. No loan information was submitted for the four companies. Section 776(c) of the Act requires the Department to use BIA whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce the information requested. Furthermore, ยง355.37 of the Department's regulations gives the Department broad discretion in the use of BIA to calculate benefits for non-cooperating companies who do not submit a complete response. In light of respondent's failure to respond to our request for complete loan information, we are continuing to use the highest individual company benefit found in this review to calculate the benefit of the four companies not submitting complete responses. However, in accordance with our utilization of different benchmarks for 1989 and 1990 loans ( See response to comment 2), the revised net subsidy from this program is 0.32 percent ad valorem.
