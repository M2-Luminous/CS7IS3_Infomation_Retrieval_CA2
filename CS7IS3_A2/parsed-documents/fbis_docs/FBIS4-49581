Although market supply in the mainland remains stable, inflation will become this year's greatest problem, slowing down various reforms and economic development. Figures from the State Statistics Bureau show an average of more than 25 percent price increases from the same period last year in the first quarter in 35 cities across the country, with Haikou (34 percent), Urumqi (30.6 percent), and Nanjing (30.1 percent) as the top three. Even Beijing's 24 percent, Shanghai's 23.3 percent, and Guangzhou's 24.3 percent, which are lower than average, are higher than the national average. In general, when the inflation rate in a country rises higher than 20 percent, dire consequences inevitably follow: economic recession, serious losses and factory shutdowns, massive unemployment, panic buying in the market, and other such chaotic phenomena. But Western experts are surprised to find that none of the above have happened in mainland China, where market supply has remained normal. The truth is, incomes in the mainland rose even higher during the steep price hikes. Figures provided by the State Statistics Bureau show that the income of township and town residents in the first quarter of this year rose an average of 31.1 percent from the same period last year, a net growth of 9.3 percent allowing for price increases. Another survey showed that increases in urban residents' income came mostly from bonuses, allowances, part-time jobs, and extra money from odd jobs. This explains why people have been able to withstand soaring price increases. However, constraints and the negative impact of inflation are being felt in various areas in the mainland. Mainland experts pointed out: First-quarter GDP grew 12.7 percent from the same period last year, of which total industrial output value grew 16 percent from the same period last year. A large increase in fixed- assets investment was the primary engine of economic growth, of which fixed-asset investment by state-owned enterprises alone increased 36 percent from the same period last year. This, plus the 50 percent or more increase in fixed-assets investment last year, was a massive dose of new investment which generated a tremendous pull on goods, and, in turn, social demand and supply, forcing up prices for raw materials, energy, and transport and, therefore, enterprises' production costs, which in turn raised prices for daily necessities. Experts estimate that fixed-assets investment this year will rise by about 25 percent to 1,500 billion yuan, higher than the State Council's projected 1,300 billion. Inflation will inevitably worsen if fixed-assets investment runs beyond the scale set by macroregulation and control. According to official announcements, increased bank lending in the first quarter amounted to 35.1 billion yuan and was mainly fueled by increased lending for working capital and fixed-assets investment. Expansion of the credit scale has undoubtedly been one of the causes of deteriorating inflation. What merits attention is the continued drop in production efficiency among state-owned enterprises in the first quarter of this year. Close to 50 percent of these enterprises are losing money, and they absorbed 15.7 billion yuan of government subsidies. Because these loss-sustaining enterprises will not go bankrupt, all wages, bonuses, and allowances were paid as usual, in effect turning government subsidies to these enterprises into bank loans and bonds, while there was no respite in social consumption power. Such a situation only drives inflation ever higher. Price deregulation, rising procurement prices for agricultural products, and adjustments in petroleum and coal prices since last year, together with price increases by shops taking advantage of tax reform, are no doubt related to the price hikes. The recent tightening of price management by provinces and cities might cool things down to some extent. However, if we cannot maintain control over the two big valves of fixed-asset investment and the scale of credit, it will continue to be difficult to curb rising prices and the inflationary trend.
