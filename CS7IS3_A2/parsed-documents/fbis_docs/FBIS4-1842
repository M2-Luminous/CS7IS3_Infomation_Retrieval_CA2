They earnestly fulfilled their responsibility of legal supervision; fully exercised their procuratorial functions of investigation, arrest, and prosecution; relentlessly cracked down on embezzlement, bribery, and other types of economic crimes; dealt heavy blows to serious criminal offenses; strengthened the fight against infringement of people's rights and dereliction of duty; and stepped up law enforcement. As a result, new progress was made in procuratorial work and in building the ranks of procurators. 1. Resolutely Cracking Down on Embezzlement, Bribery, and Economic Crimes and Promoting In-Depth Progress of the Anti-Corruption Struggle During the past year, relying heavily on party and government organizations at all levels and on the broad masses of people, procuratorial organs in the municipality successfully deepened their struggle against embezzlement and bribery. A total of 1,189 cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other economic crimes were uncovered last year. Of the total, 935 were major and important cases, an increase of 69.7 percent. The total amount of money involved in all the cases reached 253 million yuan, 4.3 times the amount in the previous year. Some 92.09 million yuan of illicit money and goods were recovered, and some 89.77 million yuan of economic losses were avoided, representing an increase of 200 percent and 230 percent, respectively, over the previous year. Last year's struggle against corruption had the following major characteristics: First, the masses became more and more enthusiastic about informing on crimes. Taking advantage of the good opportunities, procuratorial organs at all levels strengthened the work of informing on crimes by actively carrying out propaganda work to mobilize the masses. A total of 11,544 cases were reported by the masses, of which 2,730 were reported in the first half of 1993, averaging 455 cases a month; 8,814 were reported in the second half, averaging 1,469 cases a month, and 3.2 times that of the first half of the year. Cases of embezzlement and bribery cracked by procuratorial organs based on information provided by units and the masses accounted for 60 percent of the total number of cases on file, a percentage higher than the previous year. Second, the number of major and important embezzlement and bribery cases notably increased. For the whole year, procuratorial organs cracked 900 major cases -- cases involving bribery of more than 10,000 yuan and embezzlement of more than 50,000 yuan -- and 35 important cases -- cases involving cadres at the departmental level. Major cases accounted for 78.6 percent of the total number of cases on file, an increase of 27.7 percent. Of this number, 280 were mammoth cases involving more than 50,000 yuan in bribes and more than 100,000 yuan of embezzled funds, an increase of 300 times that of the previous year. Three of the mammoth cases involved bribery from 500,000 yuan to 1 million yuan; seven involved bribery of more than 1 million; and five involved embezzlement of more than 10 million yuan. Third, a number of cases were uncovered inside party and government organs, and judicial, administrative law enforcement, and economic management departments. The number of such cases on file reached 143 for the year, accounting for 12 percent of the total number of cases on file. Of the 143 cases, seven involved party and government organs, nine involved judicial departments, 40 involved administrative law enforcement departments, and 87 involved economic management departments. After review, it was decided to arrest 75 people. Using his position in charge of urban construction, real estate management, and housing construction, Zhu Wenqing, Luwan District's former deputy head, accepted 140,000 yuan in bribes in the course of approving joint land development projects and in connection with commercial housing purchases by units inside and outside Shanghai. His case topped the list of uncovered crimes committed by Shanghai's bureau-level cadres in terms of the amount of money involved. Although people committing such crimes accounted for only a very small percentage of state functionaries, they seriously damaged party and government images, disrupted the normal work order of state organs, and seriously endangered society. Seriously investigating and sternly handling such cases are very important to promoting the building of clean and honest government and forging closer ties between the party and government and the masses of people. Fourth, we investigated a number of embezzlement and bribery cases in some fast-growing economic sectors. In the process of establishing a socialist market economic structure, Shanghai's markets of such production factors as banking, stocks, foreign exchange, and housing and real estate have developed rapidly. In order to ensure normal operations and healthy development of these markets, procuratorial organs earnestly investigated and handled in good time economic crimes of embezzlement and bribery in these sectors. Last year, they uncovered 87 cases involving 59.91 million yuan in banking and stock departments; 67 cases involving 15 million yuan in foreign exchange regulation markets; and 54 cases involving 5.97 million yuan in housing and real estate markets. Timely efforts to crack down on economic crimes and to stop them from spreading in these sectors was conducive to improving Shanghai's investment environment, protecting and expanding the fruits of reform and opening up, and establishing a sound socialist market economic structure. Fifth, we pursued and captured a number of perverse criminals who absconded with big sums of money. Last year, we arrested 21 criminals on the wanted list who absconded with a total of 18.34 million yuan. Sixth, we stepped up investigation and prosecution of embezzlement and bribery cases. Throughout the year, we indicted in courts a total of 614 economic cases involving 680 criminals. Of these, 487 were major and serious cases, accounting for 70.6 percent of the total. Especially since last August, in conjunction with the central and municipal party committees' strategic arrangements for the anticorruption drive, we concentrated efforts to indict, in four groups, 262 serious embezzlement and bribery criminals involving 46.98 million yuan. Through publicity by the mass media, we kept the masses and various quarters of society informed of the results of anticorruption work, thereby expanding the social effects of the anticorruption drive. Seventh, we strengthened the prevention of criminal offenses in embezzlement and bribery. We established and perfected special bodies for preventing embezzlement and bribery, and set up 38 grass-roots preventive networks of all kinds. Based on investigations of some 40 major cases, we made proposals for supervision, and urged and assisted the relevant departments to plug loopholes, and enforce preventive measures. 2. Striking Severely at Serious Criminal Offenders To Maintain Public Order and Social Stability In the past year, procuratorial organs at all levels in Shanghai closely coordinated with judicial and public security departments in launching preemptive strikes at, and swiftly and harshly punishing serious criminal offenders for murder, robbery, rape, explosion, and theft and robbery of guns; and criminal gangs of the nature of underground societies. Last year we handled a total of 12,302 criminal suspects whom public security organs had requested approval for their arrest. Of these, we completed investigations on 11,597, and approved the arrest of 10,897, including 4,437, or 40.7 percent of the total, on wanted lists. We also handled a total of 11,580 suspects forwarded by public security organs for investigation and prosecution; of these, we completed investigations of 10,957, and prosecuted 10,245. We actively cooperated with judicial and public security departments in launching special campaigns to tackle such social maladies as taxi robbery, unlawful growing of poppies, destruction of telecommunications equipment, and prostitution, which were rather serious during a given period of time. Under the municipality's unified arrangements, we took part in concerted campaigns to crack down on theft, train robbery, criminals on the run, and pornography, approving the arrest of 6,841 suspects, and prosecuting 832 cases involving 1,265 suspects. All of this had a positive impact on deterring crimes and maintaining public order and social stability. Procuratorates at various levels seriously implemented the guidelines of the party Central Committee and the NPC Standing Committee's "Decision on Strengthening the Comprehensive Management of Public Security," and further strengthened procuratorial work related to comprehensive management of public security. Over the past year, procuratorates at various levels used legal cases to publicize the legal system more than 300 times. In light of loopholes in the management of public security and prevention of crimes, those organizations put forward 419 suggestions. According to special characteristics of crimes committed by juveniles, procuratorates at various levels adopted effective measures to improve work, and increase results in handling those cases. They formulated rules for supervising and controlling reform activities for juveniles; and strengthened education and helped juvenile law offenders change their behavior by persuasion. They revisited 1,400 people who were exempted from prosecution, and inspected the situation of more than 3,900 people whose sentences were executed outside prison. Various procuratorates supervised the work of helping those people improve themselves. They unfolded activities of "joint construction of civilized units" with enterprises and other business undertakings by providing legal consultations, and urging them to administer in accordance with the law. In coordination with concerned departments, various procuratorates laid stress on improving the situation of some places and units with conspicuous problems of public security, and worked hard to ensure social stability and reduce crimes. 3. Seriously Investigate and Handle Cases of "Violation of Lawful Rights" and Crime of Dereliction of Duty To Protect Citizen's Lawful Rights and Benefits and the Normal Operation of State Organs Over the past year, procuratorates in the municipality handled 645 cases of "violation of lawful rights" and dereliction of duty, and filed 279 cases for investigation, an increase of 64.1 percent compared with the previous year, and recovered 9.38 million yuan's economic losses for the state and collectives. Among those cases filed for investigation, the five major categories of self-seeking misconduct, using torture to coerce statements, unlawful detention, dereliction of duty and responsibility for major accidents increased by 63.3 percent compared with the previous year. Of these, 25 cases were "hostage type" unlawful detentions, eight cases were dereliction of duty by financial workers, six cases were crimes committed by public security cadres and policemen to seek self-interest by misconduct and to coerce confessions by using torture, and 94 cases were related to responsibility for major accidents. In investigating various cases, procuratorates paid attention to using legal cases to publicize the legal system. This has enhanced citizens' consciousness of law and self-protection, and played a positive role in improving public security and preventing crimes. 4. Actively Investigate and Handle Crimes of Evading Tax and Resisting the Payment of Tax and Imitating Trade Marks To Protect State Tax Income and Economic Order on the Market Over the past year, procuratorates in the municipality further strengthened their work of cracking down on crimes of tax evasion, and resisting the payment of tax, and imitating trade marks. Over the past year, various procuratorates investigated and handled 473 cases of tax evasion and resisting payment of tax, and recovered 20.86 million yuan for the state. First, various procuratorates attached importance to handling major cases. Over the past year, they discovered 50 especially serious cases of tax evasion each involving an amount of more than 100,000 yuan, an increase of 72.4 percent compared with the previous year. The biggest personal tax evasion case involved 2.27 million yuan of tax money. Second, various procuratorates firmly investigated and handled tax evasion by legal persons. They handled 14 such cases in the past year, or 470 percent more than in the previous year. Third, various procuratorates struggled against specific crimes in light of special characteristics of different trades. They publicized education on the tax law 63 times while investigating cases of tax fraud. Meanwhile, they helped concerned units establish and improve operational and tax management systems. Fourth, various procuratorates worked in coordination with taxation organizations to improve tax collection. They ordered some "stubborn" units to pay taxes and fines for delaying payment. Procuratorates at various levels strengthened their efforts to "crack down on fake and shoddy products." They stressed handling major and serious cases of imitating trade marks, and producing and selling fake and shoddy products, which involve large volumes and have a very bad impact on society. They also seriously investigated and handled criminal groups which manufactured and sold fake and shoddy commodities. Over the past year, they filed 80 cases of imitating trade marks, an increase of 60 percent compared with the previous year. Of these, 48 were serious cases, accounting for 60 percent of cases. The total amount of illegal operations reached more than 29 million yuan. They cracked down on and destroyed 56 "criminal nests" which manufactured fake commodities. Cases of imitating trade marks discovered by procuratorates involved 20 categories and 39 kinds of commodities, including automobiles, auto parts, household appliances, bicycles, medicine, beverages, and medical apparatus. Investigating and cracking down on those cases played a positive role in protecting consumers' lawful rights, and maintaining economic order in the market. 5. Strengthening Law Enforcement Supervision, Vigorously Launching Inspection of Investigation and Trial Activities and Law-Enforcement Activities of Prisons, Detention Centers, and Reeducation-Through-Labor Camps During the past year, procuratorial organs paid closer attention to law-enforcement supervision. First, they strengthened supervision over investigation and trial work. They arrested and prosecuted 182 criminals who had slipped through the net, turned down 776 cases for further investigation on the ground of insufficient evidence, and gave verbal or written comments to public security organs and courts on 88 cases rectifying violations of law. They also decided not to approve the arrests of a total of 700 people and not to prosecute 14 others on the grounds that their actions did not constitute crimes, or because there was no need to hold them for criminal responsibility. In addition, they protested court judgment on 22 cases on the grounds that the judgment was inappropriate. Second, they strengthened inspection of prisons and detention centers. They gave their views on 391 cases of violation of law by prisons, detention centers, and reeducation-through-labor camps [jian guan gai zhao chang suo 4148 4619 2395 6644 1034 2076]. They organized special task forces to conduct special investigation into law-enforcement activities and prominent problems in enforcing criminal verdicts and judgments. They presented views to rectify action on a timely basis, and pressed law-enforcement departments to strictly enforce the law and conduct business in accordance with the law. Third, they vigorously conducted inspection into civil action and administrative cases. During the year, they set up files on 88 civil action and administrative cases following the parties's appeal, protested verdicts and judgments on six cases which appeared inappropriate, and presented views to rectify mistakes on eight cases. Fourth, they made earnest efforts to investigate charges and appeals. They accepted 29 appeals over verdicts and judgment on criminal cases, and presented views to courts in six cases to rectify mistakes. In addition, they accepted appeals over 111 non-prosecution decisions and reversed decisions on 29 cases out of 61 concluded cases. Fifth, they strengthened internal checkups in case handling work. They improved the system of separating arrest from prosecution, and strengthened checkups on cases investigated by procuratorial organs themselves. Following the review process, they decided not to arrest a total of 45 people after the cases were investigated and forwarded to them by their own criminal departments. They also issued orders to arrest and prosecute seven suspects after the criminal departments decided not to arrest and prosecute them. 6. Strengthening the Ranks of Procurators and Promoting Efficiency and Integrity Among Procuratorial Organs A contingent of procurators who are politically conscious, professionally competent, highly disciplined, and superior in workstyle serves as an important organizational safeguard to the fulfillment of procuratorial organs' responsibilities in supervising law enforcement. Over the past year, upholding the policy of "strictly managing procuratorial personnel and operating procuratorial offices in accordance with the law," procuratorial organs simultaneously attended to procuratorial work and the building of procuratorial ranks, and worked hard to push the work of building a procuratorial contingent to a new stage. Procuratorial organs strengthened education in political theory and persisted in using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm procuratorial officers and men. They regarded using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory to arm procuratorial officers and men as the central link of their ideological-political work and the paramount task of education in political theory. They worked hard to raise procuratorial personnel's political integrity and theoretical standards so that they would be more conscientious and determined in implementing the party's basic line. They took further steps to promote spiritual civilization, beginning with building civilized units. They launched emulation activities in a down-to-earth manner and deep-going way to inspire vast numbers of officers and men to make progress, take the overall situation into consideration, fight with an indomitable spirit, and make selfless dedication. During the year, the municipal procuratorial system selected 85 advanced collectives and 115 individuals for performing meritorious services. In addition, 30 collectives and 42 individuals received commendations. Four collectives and four individuals received commendation and awards from the Higher People's Procuratorate while 18 of the 20 district and county procuratorial offices were commended as "civilized units." Among them, Zhabei district procuratorial office and a branch of the municipal procuratorate were commended as municipal- level "civilized units." Study on reforming the cadre personnel management system has been actively carried out with a responsibility goal-setting system being adopted in procuratorates at the municipal, district, and county levels, under which scientific management was introduced to enhance work efficiency. Eleven procuratorates at district and county levels experimented with the system of "exchanging, waiting for, and experimenting with duty points." Some district and county procuratorates even studied such things as the "chief investigator's responsibility system" and the "system of accounting for wrongly investigated cases." Work on promoting clean administration among officers and men has been intensified. While following arrangements made and meeting demands put forward by the central authorities, the municipal party committee, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and taking into consideration the reality of procuratorial work, procuratorial organs at various levels in the municipality held meetings on democratic life, and appraisal meetings for office level and above, during which officers and men would seriously screen their own actions against relevant central stipulations and make necessary self correction. The municipal procuratorate has formulated and promulgated the "Code of Clean Administration for Police Officers and Men of the Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate;" republished telephone numbers on clean administration supervision, enhanced clean administration awareness among officers and men; and conducted massive inspections on law and discipline enforcement where wrongdoers would be seriously dealt with. Voluntarily Submit to Leadership of the Party Committee; Accept Supervision of the People's Congresses In performing our duties, we persisted in making timely reports to the party committees on serious conditions and major cases, and sought their support and guidance. We have been conscientiously implementing the "Regulations on Judicial Work Supervision" adopted by the Standing Committee of the municipal people's congress and adhered to the system of submitting work reports to the people's congresses and their standing committees. We have been seriously handling cases handed over or assigned by the people's congresses and their standing committees, and relevant motions and proposals put forward, and criticisms made by the people's deputies with prompt replies on their outcomes. We took the initiative to invite the people's deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to inspect the procuratorates and conscientiously heard their appraisals and opinions on effectively improving work and enhancing the law-enforcement level. The major tasks for Shanghai's procuratorates this year will be: To persist in being guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and conscientiously implement the guidelines set by both the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Second Plenum of the Sixth Shanghai Municipal Party Committee; to unshakenly uphold the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points;" to unswervingly implement the guiding principle of making procuratorial work serve economic construction; to uphold the principle of "being firm in attending to both material progress, and cultural and ideological progress;" to strengthen the functions of law supervision through stricter law-enforcement and thorough investigations into all cases; to persist in waging struggle against corruption and bribery; to severely crack down on serious criminal activities; to conscientiously investigate cases involving "infringement of rights" and dereliction of duty; to conduct inspections on all fronts to preserve political and social stability and protect the on-going reform, opening up, and economic construction; and to make new efforts to promote the establishment and perfection of a socialist market economic system.
