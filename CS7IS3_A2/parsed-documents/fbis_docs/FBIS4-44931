Har'el Fish: "Eretz Yisra'el and the Question of Preserving Life"] [Text] The religious community in all its diversity is split on the issue of its duty regarding Eretz Yisra'el in these days of historical decisions on which depend the future of the people and the state. In truth, the disagreement on this subject is not between the parties: the NRP [National Religious Party], Shas [Torrah Observing Sephardim], Degel Hatora, and Agudat Yisra'el, rather it is more correct to say that it exists within each of these parties. In each of them, there are at least two schools of thought that are opposed on this subject. Often, the split passes even within the religious family unit, when the son (or the father) believes that peace as a high Jewish value is preferred over all else, and that this is what is on the agenda, and the father (or the son) is convinced with all his heart and his soul that there is no holier duty today than the duty to ensure the territorial integrity of the country as it is now held by us. Such a disagreement on principles is, perhaps, legitimate. Everyone can bring evidence from our forefathers to strengthen his position, and the things are known. At the time of one crisis, it was said of Abraham "and he mustered his retainers" and then he smote the four kings; and on another occasion he made an alliance with Avimelekh, King of the Philistines, over the division of the country; Jacob, our father, struggled all night with Esau's man and overcame him, but in other circumstances castigated Shim'on and Levy for the deed against Shechem. I do not seek first of all to establish which way suits the situation to which we are now subject, even though I have a clear opinion on the subject. I seek to argue against posing the question as an ordinary Halakhic question of what is permissible and what is forbidden, which can be resolved with the customary tools. In fact, both of the schools of thought rely on Halakhic arguments. The "hawkish" school of thought links the question with a positive commandment (according to the Ramban's system) "to inherit the land" and with the injunction against transferring ownership over the land of Yisra'el to foreigners. And the conclusion is that one must not relinquish portions of Eretz Yisra'el that returned to us in one way or another, and on the basis of these commandments, the State of Israel must continue to maintain its rule over all areas of the country that were conquered miraculously in the Six-Day War. The "dovish" school of thought does not deny the validity of the two aforementioned commandments, but the rabbis of this school do not view themselves as authorized to conclude from them a clear military or political conclusion, on account of the calculation of "the sanctity of life," which, as is known, supersedes all the commandments of the Torah except regarding the shedding of blood, incest, and idolatry, about which we were warned, "be killed and do not transgress." As for the transfer of the ownership over areas of Eretz-Yisra'el to foreigners the rule of the sanctity of life applies, that is, "transgress and do not be killed." Moreover, if the subject is "the sanctity of life of the community," that is, a danger to the entire people or a large part of it due to the observance of the commandment, then of course the Torah does not require of us such a price to hold on to all of Eretz-Yisra'el and to prevent the transfer of this or that area to foreign owners. According to this school of thought, only one question remains: who will determine whether in our situation today there is a fear for "the sanctity of life of the community" that must bring us to a withdrawal? And the answer is that on this the various experts will decide, experts on politics and experts in military matters, and according to the teaching that they tell us, we will act. If they decide to relinquish, we will relinquish, and if they decide to stand firm, we shall stand. To what is this similar? To a sick person for whom the Shabbat must be desecrated. The doctor determines whether the law of "the sanctity of life" applies to his illness or not. Military men and politicians are, as it were, the doctors of our situation. Between a Verdict and a Torah Opinion I present these views in general terms as they have been understood among the broad religious public and without going into all of the Halakhic details (and without going into the difference between "a verdict" and "a Torah opinion," which, of course, is important), and my question is: what is the nature of this disagreement? From the Torah-religious viewpoint, has the question been posed properly? Do the rules of this legal debate indeed apply to the problem at hand? First, let us ask the "hawkish" school of thought. Is there really a complete correspondence between the subject of the sale of lands and the transfer of the ownership over them to foreigners, which is a simple, ordinary question, and the defense or the relinquishing of areas of the homeland, which is an existential-national question? It seems that in the time of monarchy in Israel such fateful questions were handed over to the decision of the king, who was to consult about it with the High Priest and with the Sanhedrin according to the "decision of the Urim" (see Numbers 27:21, and see Tractate Yoma, page 73). And such matters do not belong to the regular Halakhic level, but are instead much more serious. If the Sanhedrin decides on war, it decides on life and death, on existence, and its decision is definitely liable to result in a heavy price in human life. And if the Sanhedrin decides in the decision of the Urim on "withdrawal" at a certain moment of danger, it does not appear that such a decision transgresses the ordinary injunction against selling lands and transferring the ownership to foreigners. In short, there are two levels here, one governmental-existential, and the other legal-Halakhic, and an emphasis on the legal-Halakhic aspect weakens the arguments of the "hawkish" school of thought in the eyes of many, both religious and secular, who do not regard our big political question today as an affair that belongs to the ordinary sphere of what is allowed and what is forbidden, regarding which one may ask a learned question and act according to the Halakha laid down in the Shulkhan Arukh or in the "Yad Hahazaka." Here, as was said, is the weak side of the "hawkish" school, but the great advantage of the members of this school of thought is that they view the question of Eretz Yisra'el and its protection as mainly a religious question. A question that must not be removed from the realm of faith and abandoned to ordinary politicians, and ordinary military men. Even though we said that questions of this kind belong to a level called "the decision of the Urim," that, too, is an institution among the institutions of the Torah and belief, where the calculations are not solely political. While this institution does not exist in our time, this does not mean that the approach is invalid, that the principle of "the decision of the Urim" is invalid for the Jew who believes in the Torah and the Prophets. This Jew feels in the nature of things that his faith obligates him precisely on the fateful questions of today, and that the trust in Hashem [God], who is the savior and redeemer of Israel, is a foundation that must be reflected in practical decisions and in political and military moods. And here is expressed not only a legitimate religious calculation, but even the main points of his belief. The "dovish" side in the disagreement starts, as it were, with the assumption that here there is no ordinary Halakhic problem, and as it is connected with political-military calculations, it hands over the operational responsibility to "experts" in this matter. But, in fact, the Halakhic calculation is narrower for them than it is for the "hawks." For them, the whole matter is reduced to the question of "the sanctity of life," that is, the legal permission that is given to violate injunctions for the sake of saving lives. And it may be asked: does the Halakhic mechanism of "the sanctity of life" apply to the question at hand? Is the question whether to withdraw from Jerusalem and the cities of Judaea really on the same plane as the question whether to violate or not to violate the Shabbat for a seriously ill person?! Should not the question of "the sanctity of life" have been kept in mind by, for example, the rebels of the Warsaw Ghetto when they decided what they decided, or by the defenders of Kfar 'Etzyon during the War of Liberation? If we pose the problems in that manner, we will arrive at absurdities. Perhaps it would turn out that Mattityahu and his sons should not have risen up against the Greeks, and that during the siege of Jerusalem in the time of Hizkiyahu, the King, they should have surrendered to Sennacherib and not endangered the life of the nation by a stubborn stand for their independence! It is clear that here we have again arrived at the sphere called "the decision of the Urim," or, more correctly, the commandment to martyrdom, where the mechanism of "the sanctity of life" does not apply in its ordinary form. The Sanctity of Life and the Sanctity of the Life of the Nation There is no doubt that this aspect of the problem was not obscured to the rabbis, including the luminaries of the generation who studied it and determined here the foundation of "the sanctity of life of the nation." They know well that on fateful questions the Jewish people always puts its life at stake "for our people and for the cities of our Lord," and that the path of redemption is also the dangerous path. If that is the case, why are they not ready to relate to the question of Eretz Yisra'el and its borders today as such a question, a question of faith, that is, a religious-creedal challenge of the highest order? And why do they not come out with the traditional call: "Be strong and let us get stronger for our people and for the cities of our Lord"? Their answer will surely be that the whole matter of "the decision of the Urim" is simply not customary today, as it depends upon institutions such as the Temple, the Sanhedrin, and the High Priests, that do not now exist. And for that reason, the religious leadership has no status in decisions in the political sphere. Such an answer, as I have formulated it, seems logical. It is correct that we do not have a Sanhedrin and there is also no chance that this institution will soon reappear. But the answer is nevertheless evasive, and cannot satisfy the believing public that lives the events of today. We must first of all ask, who are "the diplomatic and military experts" who are to be relied upon in the present crisis? One division of statesmen and military men will tell us that the great danger to our existence will come if we do not withdraw from Jerusalem and from Judaea and Samaria. A different division of military men and statesmen, no less honorable and impressive, will tell us that the danger of extinction lies in wait for us precisely if we give in to the pressures and withdraw from the territories. So, who are the right experts whose opinion we are to accept? If we examine the qualifications of the various "experts," we shall see that there is not and it is not possible for there to be a scientific and objective approach such as in the case of the doctor and the sick person. Everyone brings to the question under discussion his ideological baggage. The men of the left determine their position according to their outlook, which--if we formulate it briefly--is peace and brotherhood with the Arabs as a supreme goal. The men of the right determine their position according to their ideological position, which gives preference to national honor and independence. The chasm yawns on either side of the thin rope upon which we tread. One tells us to step in this direction, and one tells us to step in that direction--each one according to his ideological considerations. Because the situation is exactly a situation of astonishing uncertainty regarding the results of either step, but, nevertheless, we are not exempt from the obligation to decide. Is it precisely in this situation that the voice of the basic Jewish faith will be silenced? Must the great ones of the Torah close their eyes in this situation and pass the decision to the would-be "experts", that is, to the men of the secular parties---who, in the final analysis, will make a determination according to their ideological considerations? Will only the place of the faithful Jews be empty when these great questions are decided? I would be surprised! The transfer of the decision to experts also means ignoring the way that decisions are made in a democratic society. Here there is no king or ruler that is all-powerful. The citizen must participate in the decision. He bears responsibility for the future of the nation--a responsibility that he cannot shift to experts. Or, if you will, we are all "experts." What is under discussion is an international and military situation whose main components are known to all of us. We all feel the dangers, and we shall all pay the price of mistaken judgements. And, if we speak in more concrete terms, some of the religious parties that are sitting today in the Knesset are known to have tremendous, and even decisive, influence over the course of diplomatic affairs. I refer mainly to Shas, but also to Agudat Yisra'el. Even though they are not for the moment sitting in the government, it is clear to everyone that in the given parliamentary situation, the coalition is not capable of functioning and implementing its withdrawal plan without the support (or, at least, their nonopposition) of the many members of Knesset from these parties. This means that they and their leaders have an unprecedented responsibility for the fate of the people and of the state. To Fulfill the Religious-Jewish Faith Can it be that in such a situation they will shift their responsibility over to "experts"? What is this like? It is like the question whether to accept or not to accept the opinion of the 10 spies who asserted that it was not possible to conquer the country and to hold it. These were without a doubt the first "experts" of that generation. Not only that as a matter of course they were chosen for their public qualifications and their defense knowledge, but their status as experts was strengthened after they had travelled through the land and examined it thoroughly for forty days! There is also no doubt that the data that they gave on the security-military situation, about the difficulties, and about the character of the natives, had a foundation. It was only that their conclusions were mistaken due to a lack of faith and trust in Hashem. As Yehoshu'a Bin Nun and Caleb Ben Yefune asserted afterwards. Yehoshu'a and Caleb did not deny the data that their colleagues had provided. They rejected only their conclusions, and insisted that the decision making had to take into account also the factor of trust in Hashem and of fear of Hashem: "If Hashem wants us and he will bring us to this country and will give it to us!" It is clear that we must today, as believing Jews, be guided by our ideological considerations, and among these the great principle of "Hashem is with us, do not be afraid." If all the men of the secular parties bring their ideological baggage, we can take into account the foundations of the Torah and the faith, and it is even our duty to do that. Because it was for that that the representatives of the religious parties were elected by their voters. Their representatives were not elected in order to decide according to the weltanschauung of Karl Marx, and not even according to the position of Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Rather it is their duty to fulfill their religious-Jewish belief in the everyday life of the state, including the great questions of foreign affairs and defense, and, perhaps, first and foremost regarding those questions. Because among them, "security" can never be just security, rather security with a double meaning. And if nevertheless the esteemed rabbis who stand at the head of these parties prefer to evade their responsibility and to hand it over to others--that is, to "defense experts"--there will be no avoiding the conclusion that they are not ready to ascribe a religious significance to the great redemptions of our times, including the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War. They are not ready to see in these events "a way to pass to redemption," something that requires us to take a stand on the diplomatic questions. This approach is reminiscent of the approach of some of the Torah greats in Eastern Europe at the beginning of Zionism, who were not willing to view the Zionist Movement and the beginning of the renaissance in Eretz Yisra'el as "a way to pass to redemption." And for that reason, they actually abandoned the whole matter of the return to Zion to the hands of the secular camp. This comparison is depressing and unfortunate. In retrospect, it may be determined today that the reservation of the chiefs of "Agudat Yisra'el" from the year of 5672 [1912] until World War II did not exactly bring a blessing to the people of Israel. And, therefore, it is to be hoped that in the end, Shas will not repeat the same tragic mistake of the early days of Zionism. If we have learned to hear the voice of the Lord of Israel speaking to us from the tempest of history, let us not today seal our ears and behave as if there is no religious significance to the great events of our times, including the ingathering of the exiles in tremendous proportions, and including our return to Jerusalem, to the cities of Judaea, to the Temple Mount, and to the Western Wall. Here there is no fata morgana, rather a revolution in the life of our people. Our eyes see voices, and our eyes see the pillar of fire that lights up the night for us. If we do not respond as a religious public to this great challenge, it is as if we were agreeing with the haters of Israel who assert that the Torah and its scholars belong to the past, and that we do not have a part in the future of the nation. And to such a version, the vast majority of the religious public will not lend its hand.
