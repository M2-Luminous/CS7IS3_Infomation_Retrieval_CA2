A statement issued at the conclusion of the meetings held by the UINC and the Presidential Council in the town of Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq criticized the Syrian-Turkish-Iranian ministerial meeting held in Istanbul last Saturday [5 February]. The Iraqi opposition's joint meetings were held 1-6 February and were boycotted by the opposition's pan-Arab faction based in Damascus. Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati had pledged to "confront any attempt to fragment Iraq." In a telephone statement from Salah-al-Din, Sami 'Abd-al-Rahman, member of the UINC Executive Council, said that "the tone of the ministerial statement in reference to the fragmentation of Iraq was the strongest" issued by al-Shar', Cetin, and Velayati, "and it very much surprised the UINC in its emphasis on this issue, for neither the Kurdistan Front nor the UINC is calling for the division or partition of Iraq." He added: "We do not know if these fears are a result of dissatisfaction with the democratic experiment in Iraqi Kurdistan." But he also said that "the ministerial statement contained some positive points such as the call for an end to the internal (Iraqi) blockade against Iraqi Kurdistan and the south and for the restoration of the power supply to Dahuk, asserting that it should be left to the Iraqi people to determine their own future freely." He drew attention to the Iraqi opposition's statement that "the regime of (President) Saddam Husayn and its continuation are the real threat to the country's unity. We Iraqis care most about the unity of our people and homeland." In his view, there was no connection between the Turkish raids on positions in northern Iraq the day before yesterday and the results of the Istanbul meeting. He stressed that "these raids will never settle anything" as regards tackling the issue of the Kurdish Workers Party which is waging a war against the Turkish state. Sami 'Abd-al-Rahman emphasized that the opposition "is not contemplating setting up an army to fight the Iraqi Army." He said that the Salah-al-Din statement "renewed its appeal to the military and to the members of the ruling Ba'th Party to join the ranks of the people to escalate the struggle to overthrow the regime." He added that over 300 figures took part in the joint meetings, which were also attended by tripartite Presidential Council Members Muhammad Bahr-al-'Ulum, Mas'ud Barzani, and Major General Hasan al-Naqib and which "passed resolutions dealing with all organizational and financial problems." He said that the conferees also concentrated on ways of handling the issue of the Kurdistan Islamic Movement [KIM] after the clashes which broke out between its fighters and fighters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by Jalal Talabani. "The UINC's view is that the solutions should be based on the principle of reconciliation and that the KIM should be treated like any other party in accordance with the Kurdish parliament's laws including the law prohibiting possession of arms." The opposition also renewed its call for "the expansion of the air exclusion zone to include all Iraq and for the creation of safe havens in the south." The statement of the UINC Presidential Council and Executive Council "called for the deployment of UN guards throughout all Iraq" and for the dispatch of UN observers to "watch out for violations of human rights, lift the internal blocade imposed on liberated Kurdistan and southern areas, and exclude Kurdistan from the international embargo to ease the people's suffering." It praised the "steadfastness of our people in the south, the center, and the rest of the country," and it "saluted the third anniversary of the popular uprising" in southern Iraq which followed the Gulf war. The conferees also discussed development of ties between the UINC and the neighboring states and the Arab and Islamic states.
