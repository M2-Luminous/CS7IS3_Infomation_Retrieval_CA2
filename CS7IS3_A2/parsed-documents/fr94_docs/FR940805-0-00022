FR940805-0-00022 FR940805-0-00008 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 16 CFR Part 305 Disclosures Regarding Energy Consumption and Water Use of Certain Home Appliances and Other Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (``Appliance Labeling Rule'') AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Trade Commission amends its Appliance Labeling Rule by publishing the ranges of comparability to be used on required labels for central air conditioners and heat pumps and by updating the annual national average cost figure for electricity to be used in the cost calculation formula required on fact sheets and in directories. These cost figures are for consumers to use to calculate their own heating and cooling costs. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Mills, Attorney, Division of Enforcement, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580 (202&hyph;326&hyph;3035). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) 1 requires the Federal Trade Commission to consider labeling rules for the disclosure of estimated annual energy cost or alternative energy consumption information for at least thirteen categories of appliances. Central air conditioners (including heat pumps) are included as one of the categories. The statute also requires the Department of Energy (``DOE'') to develop test procedures that measure how much energy the appliances use. In addition, DOE is required to determine the representative average cost a consumer pays for the different types of energy available. 1 Pub. L. 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 871, 42 U.S.C. 6294 (Dec. 22, 1975). On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final Rule covering seven of the thirteen appliance categories that were then covered by DOE test procedures: refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, freezers, dishwashers, water heaters, clothes washers, room air conditioners and furnaces. 2 On December 10, 1987, the Commission amended the Appliance Labeling Rule by extending its coverage to central air conditioners and heat pumps. For these products, the Commission adopted a disclosure scheme that consists of labels showing simple energy efficiency and range information, together with a requirement to disclose further efficiency and cost information by means of either fact sheets or a listing in a general directory containing such information. 3 2 44 FR 66466, 16 CFR Part 305 (Nov. 19, 1979). The Statement of Basis and Purpose for the final Rule describes the reasons the Commission declined to cover the other categories of covered products. Id. at 66467&hyph;69. 3 52 FR 46888. Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers, after filing an initial report, to report annually by specified dates for each product type. 4 These reports, which are to assist the Commission in preparing the ranges of comparability, contain the estimated annual cost or energy efficiency rating for the appliances derived from tests performed pursuant to the DOE test procedures. The reports also contain the model number, the number of tests performed on each model, and the capacity of each. Because the costs for the various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models to their lines, improve existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated is constantly changing. To keep the required information in line with these changes, the Commission is empowered, under ยง305.10 of the rule, to publish new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data indicates that the upper or lower limits of the ranges have changed by more than 15%. Otherwise, the Commission must publish a statement that the prior range or ranges remain in effect for the next year. 4 Reports for central air conditioners (including heat pumps) are due by July 1. The annual reports for central air conditioners (including heat pumps) have been received and analyzed by the Commission. New ranges based upon them are herewith published. These ranges will supersede the current ranges, which were published on September 25, 1992. 5 5 57 FR 44331. In addition, this Notice provides an updated figure for the annual national average cost of electricity. This figure, along with national average cost figures for natural gas, propane, heating oil and kerosene, is published annually by the Department of Energy for the industry's use in calculating the cost figures required by the Commission's Rule. The cost figure for electricity must be used in the cost calculation formulas that appear in Appendices H and I. These formulas must be provided on fact sheets and in directories so consumers can calculate their own costs of operation for the central air conditioners and heat pumps that they are considering purchasing. The updated figure, which DOE published on December 29, 1993, 6 and which the Commission published on February 8, 1994, 7 is 8.41 cents per kilowatt-hour. The formulas (and calculations) in both Appendices have been changed to reflect this. 6 58 FR 68901. 7 59 FR 5699. In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission revises Appendices H(1) and (2) and I(1) and (2) of its Appliance Labeling Rule by publishing the following ranges of comparability and cost figures for use in the labeling and advertising of central air conditioners and heat pumps beginning December 28, 1994.
