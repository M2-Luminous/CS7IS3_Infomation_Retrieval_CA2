Jonker and R. Winkel report on interview with Carlos Westendorp, Spanish secretary of state for european affairs, in Brussels; date not given: "Spain Is Not Rejecting EC Enlargement Altogether"] [Text] Brussels -- By enlarging the European Community to include the three Scandinavian countries and the alpine Republic of Austria, the political focus of the Community will be shifted to the north. For Spain, which managed to wrest itself out of lengthy political and geographical isolation on the basis of its EC membership, this is not an attractive prospect. Consequently, Spain certainly wants to be seen as the driving force behind a discreet front comprising EC member states that are endeavoring to slow down the accession of new member states by making their entry to the Community subject to the fulfillment of absurdly harsh preconditions. Nothing could be further from the truth, contends Carlos Westendorp, Spanish secretary of state for european affairs -- every inch a Spaniard despite his Netherlands grandfather -- in the third of a series of interviews on Europe and the enlargement of the Community. "The EC is becoming a community of blond, blue-eyed people. All along we have resigned ourselves to this. If we still want to remain part of it, then we shall have to bleach our hair and start wearing blue contact lenses. And above all quit our bad economic habits." "We are a satisfied power," says Westendorp, with a broad grin, when asked about the manna that will fall over Spain from heaven if the rich Scandinavian countries become member states of the EC. Unlike Spain and Portugal, which joined the Community in 1986, the new member states will consolidate the core of so-called net paying member states in the EC. However, their contribution will not be at all sufficient -- merely somewhere in the region of ECU1 or ECU2 billion, according to Westendorp. The real negotiations on contributions to the Community budget, on the one hand, and receipts in the form of agricultural and regional subsidies, on the other, have not yet begun. In the Council of Ministers, Westendorp is playing a ruthless game, as diplomats and politicians from member states which are more inclined to embrace enlargement assure us. Enlargement? OK, but not over Spain's dead body. If some Arctic regions are fighting to overcome their own structural problems, then their struggle should be financed out of other people's pockets. As Westendorp puts it: "We are playing an honest game. In order to qualify as a less well-developed region, per capita GDP must be less than 75 percent of the EC-wide average. In the province of Teruel that is indeed the case, but unfortunately the average for the region as a whole is 80 percent, so we receive no EC support. We are merely asking that the same criteria be applied in the far north." According to the Spanish negotiator, the problems concerning the financing of agriculture and regional policy are insoluble. He has more doubts where fish are concerned. Spanish fishermen have an eye on certain rich Norwegian fishing grounds that they had to leave in the 1970's, but the Norwegians have so far failed to budge one centimeter. "We are asking for 7,000 tonnes of cod. If the Norwegians continue to insist that they cannot part with even one fish, then we will run up against serious problems." The institutional reservations that Westendorp has attached to the result of the negotiations on behalf of his government seem much graver still. The Spanish Government does not want the new member states to be counted when the member states look in 1996 to see whether a majority of EC countries is in sufficiently good economic condition to proceed with the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]. A second hiccup concerns decisionmaking within the Council of Ministers. At present, 23 votes are required in order to block a decision. Between them, either two large and one small member state, or one large and three small member states, or even five small member states can come up with this number of votes. Spain is recommending that the blocking majority be raised to 27 votes if a number of small countries joins together, but wants to stick to 23 if this number of votes is attained by a combination of only three countries. In practice, this constitutes an elegant way of boosting the relative clout of the larger member states within the Council of Ministers. Westendorp explains: "The 23 votes usually represent something like 115 million people. You cannot make decisions that go against the wishes of one-third of the EC's population. The lower number of inhabitants in the candidate member states would mean that in some cases the 27 votes would represent the wishes of no more than 40 million citizens of Europe." In its attempts to gain acceptance for such an approach, Spain proposed -- in vain -- that the influence of the Netherlands within the Council of Ministers be increased, reveals Westendorp. "With 15 million inhabitants, the Netherlands is not getting its dues with just five votes. It is a question of democratic legitimacy; we are all equal, but some are more equal than others." For Spain, this constitutes one potential reason to take a rain check on the accession of the candidate member states, and the fisheries problem constitutes another. However, Westendorp let it be known that the situation is different regarding the demand that the new member states be excluded from the decision on whether or not to proceed with EMU in 1997. "We have tabled that proposition, and expect a certain degree of understanding from our partners. However, it is not some kind of breaking point." However, Spain is by no means ruling out the possibility of the hard core (France, Germany, and the Benelux countries -- HET FINANCIEELE DAGBLAD editor's note) -- possibly with the addition of Denmark and Ireland -- daring to take the step toward a single currency in 1997, after all. Under the terms of the Treaty of Maastricht, a majority of the member states must fulfill the criteria regarding inflation, budgetary deficits, and exchange rate stability. And that is where the shoe pinches. The new member states will above all push down the average rate of inflation, thereby increasing the gap for existing member states like Italy and Spain, which will most certainly not succeed in coming up to the new mark. "We, too, want to make the leap in 1997," says Westendorp: "We are also capable of doing so." Westendorp continues by saying that there was no mention of the role of the new member states when the criteria for Maastricht were laid down. Westendorp is pessimistic regarding the possibility of, say, seeing the approval of the treaties of accession go hand in hand with that of modifications to the Maastricht Treaty, a course which the European Parliament (including future member Piet Dankert, who is currently still a secretary of state in The Hague -- HET FINANCIEELE DAGBLAD editor's note) now appears to be steering. "We have always been in favor of giving the European Parliament more extensive rights, but I think that many member states have no sympathy for this idea at present." For his taste, even the agreement to meet again at government level in 1996 in order to review the treaty is too much to ask. "That date is too close, unless the economy makes a spectacular recovery, and the whole climate in Europe changes." Westendorp still has an unpleasant aftertaste following the difficulties surrounding ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. "We will only make progress if we turn the thing around. There should be no more negotiations between technocrats, followed by the submission of proposals to the European Council in fearful trepidation of referenda in certain member states. We must go straight to drawing up a European constitution, and then put it to the European Parliament and the national Parliaments." If no constitutional foundation is laid, says Westendorp, then within a few years the EC could become unmanageable. "We cannot stop enlargement at Malta and Cyprus; we must also admit the new democracies in Central and East Europe. That will be unworkable if no far-reaching reforms are implemented." He sees a hard core emerging, which will make further progress on defense, foreign policy, and the fight against crime. Cooperation in these areas, formally included within the scope of the European Union, must then be integrated into the EC proper. Outside this core of states, there will then arise a number of countries in favor of a looser form of primarily economic cooperation. British (and German -- HET FINANCIEELE DAGBLAD editor's note) involvement in EMU will constitute a test case. Westendorp claims that the Greek-Netherlands desire to entrust these institutional questions to a committee of wise men is not acceptable to everybody. "Nobody is wiser than the governments. We should set a group of intelligent government representatives to work with a view to preparing the 1996 conference. Complemented by one representative from the European Parliament, and one or two independent experts, this would strongly resemble the Delors Committee which set the EMU ball rolling back in 1988." There is one thing with which this group should not meddle at all, says Westendorp. Spain is no longer ready to contemplate making do with just one member in the European Commission. "Having 17 commissioners means that, together, the five larger countries have 10 votes, i.e., a majority. If there were 20 commissioners this would no longer be the case. We certainly cannot put up with this any longer. In addition, if each member state had just one commissioner, then the European Commission would be a purely intergovernmental affair, like the meetings of national ambassadors." Westendorp finds it "interesting" that British Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is currently publicly touting himself as a candidate to succeed Commission President Jacques Delors. However, he believes that the Briton has no chance against Ruud Lubbers. "There is a consensus about Lubbers. He comes from the circle of heads of government, and is therefore a logical choice. Mr. Brittan will only be able to offer him his hand as a good loser."
