Papoulias said that Albania showed signs of goodwill but he stressed that many problems remain unsolved. Papoulias stressed the issue of five Greeks being held by Albanian authorities, an issue that Serreqi said is in the hands of Albanian justice. Serreqi raised the issue of the Tsamidhes [Muslims living in Greece south of the Albanian border drawn at the end of WWII and who assisted the communists during the Greek civil war] but Papoulias replied that Greece considers them to be war criminals. The meeting also discussed the latest border incident at Episkopi, which the Albanian foreign minister described as a terrorist act. [Athens ET-1 Television Network in Greek at 1500 GMT on 3 May carries a related recorded report from Zurich. Correspondent Foivos Karzis notes that "a first step toward normalizing Greek-Albanian relations, a step mainly directed at changing the climate between the two countries, since no specific commitments were made, was taken today in Zurich with the meeting between the two foreign ministers, Karolos Papoulias and Alfred Serreqi. In substance, this meeting reexamined the whole topic of bilateral relations. A positive point to emerge from the meeting is that Tirana appears to recognize the importance of having good relations with Athens. But the distrust between the two countries is widespread and Papoulias' hesitation shows the Greek side's reservations." [Papoulias is then cited as saying: "Goodwill was ascertained today at the negotiating table but it should be turned into practice. There are many unsolved problems in Greek-Albanian relations."]
