The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and was expanded in 1991 to include Afghanistan as well as the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. On the sidelines of the two-day meeting, organised to discuss economic cooperation, the ministers of 10 Muslim countries in the region put forward several "practical proposals" to help end the conflict, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said. Speaking to reporters, Velayati acknowledged the difficult task of restoring peace to Afghanistan, but added that Iran and other countries in the region "were determined to continue their search." He declined to explain what the "practical proposals" were. Several participants in the meeting revealed that "a certain number of ideas" have been put foreward by the ministers, among which is establishment of a regional conference under the auspices of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which comprises 50 Muslim countries. The OIC's Secretary General Hamid al-Qabid, who took part in the seminar, said an OIC delegation was currently in the Afghan capital to try and secure a ceasefire. He said that he would himself go to Kabul if asked to start mediation among rival Afghan forces. Qabid told AFP that the accord reached between the factions in Islamabad last spring, at the prodding of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, was no longer effective but could be used as "a basis for future discussions". Afghan Foreign Minister Hedayat Amin Arsala told AFP that he favored a comprehensive solution searched for by the United Nations or OIC rather than mediation efforts undertaken by Afghanistan's neighbors, whose "objectives are not clear so far." "After all, finding a solution is primarily the responsibility of Afghans themselves," he said. The ministers also addressed other regional crises, namely the civil war in Tajikistan between the pro-communist government and the Islamic opposition, as well as the Armenian-Azeri conflict. Azerbaijan did not appear to have gathered the solid support it expected in a bid to impose widespread economic sanctions against Armenia, according to participants. The Tajik minister, for his part, categotically rejected mediation offers by several ECO members, saying his country prefered wider efforts undertaken by the United Nations. On the economic front, the countries agreed to cooperate on setting up a regional trade and development bank, establishing insurance links and creating a joint airline and shipping company. Cooperation in transportation and communication were also given priority during the conference, as many of the ECO member states are land-locked and need access to the sea and outside world, Velayati said. The ministers also discussed cooperation between the ECO and several international organisations. Memorandums of understanding were signed Tuesday between the ECO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as well as United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).
