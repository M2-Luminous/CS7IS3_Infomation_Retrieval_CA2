FBIS4-38970 "drsov107_f_94020" FBIS-SOV-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 National Affairs Sevastopol Official Against Dual Stationing of Fleet Sevastopol Official Against Dual Stationing of Fleet LD0206201294 Kiev UNIAN in Ukrainian 1645 GMT 2 Jun 94 LD0206201294 Kiev UNIAN Ukrainian BFN [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Viktor Semenov, head of the Sevastopol city council of people's deputies, stated at a news conference on 2 June that two fleets cannot be stationed in Sevastopol. He backed up his opinion by saying that the servicemen of Ukraine's naval forces and those of the Black Sea Fleet are "biologically incompatible." Also, Viktor Semenov referred to the statements by the defense ministers of Ukraine and Russia, in which they called relations between the servicemen of the two fleets normal, as misinforming journalists and the public. In this connection, the press center of Ukraine's naval forces made public a statement, which, in particular, says: "Admitting the fact that Semenov has the right to express his personal opinion, the press center of Ukraine's naval forces is at the same time authorized to declare that such statements by an official, who is a member of the military council of Ukraine's naval forces, are of a provocative nature and they do not promote the negotiating process on the Black Sea Fleet. Objectively, the servicemen of Ukraine's naval forces and the Black Sea Fleet, who have for many years been serving together, cannot have differences; moreover, relations between them cannot be brought down to a "biological" level. The above statement can turn political problems between Ukraine and Russia relating to the Black Sea Fleet into interethnic problems whose consequences can hardly be predicted." The command of Ukraine's naval forces is also surprised and indignant over a statement by the head of the city council to the effect that "the Sevastopol naval institute is vacant" and over the "groundless proposals" concerning the further use of its base. The statement by the press center of the naval forces of Ukraine indicates that the educational process is now under way at the institute and all the institute's funds will be further used in the interests of building Ukraine's naval forces. The statement by the press center of Ukraine's naval forces expresses the conviction that "no ill-considered statements by politicians can stir up enmity between the servicemen of Ukraine's naval forces and the Black Sea Fleet. As far as political issues are concerned, these are to be tackled by politicians."
