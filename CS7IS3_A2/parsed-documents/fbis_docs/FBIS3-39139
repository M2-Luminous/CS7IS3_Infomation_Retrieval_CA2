Dario Carrella reports from Milan: [Carrella] There was another sensational development this morning in the clean hands offensive. Another qualitative leap forward was made. Paolo Berlusconi was arrested on the order of the Milan public prosecutor's office, which had made him the subject of a warrant for preventive detention. Examining Judge Italo Ghitti and Prosecuting Judge Antonio Di Pietro will question him this afternoon. The arrest warrant is within the framework of investigations into kickbacks paid to encourage the Cariplo [Cassa Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde] pensions fund to purchase several buildings. Berlusconi has been accused by one of those under investigation-- broker Giuseppe Clerici, who was formerly a Cariplo employee--of paying a bribe of more than 1 billion lire. News about Berlusconi's involvement in this chapter of the clean hands investigation has been making the rounds for several days. The clean hands judges have also ordered two other arrests, but this time related to illegal financing of political parties. Giovanni Donigaglia, chairman of the Argenta building cooperative has been arrested. The Milan judiciary had already investigated Donigaglia within the framework of possible illegal contributions to the Italian Communist Party. This time Donigaglia is accused of having illegally paid 350 million lire to former Christian Democratic Party treasurer Severino Citaristi during the 1992 general election campaign. Antonio Mosconi, former managing director of Toro Assicurazioni, part of the Fiat Group, has also been arrested. He is accused of having illegally given 200 million lire to Cesare De Piccoli, the former communist deputy mayor of Venice. The Milan public prosecutor's office has sent a cautionary warrant to De Piccoli, who is currently a PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] member of the European Parliament.
