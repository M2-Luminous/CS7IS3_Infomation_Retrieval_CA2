These policies are linked more to international factors than to internal Lebanese factors. He added that if the pope had come to this country, we would have welcomed him. We welcome all Lebanon's guests, more so the pope because he espouses the issue of coexistence. However, since he will not come, he knows better the justifications that have prompted him to postpone the visit. Fadlallah said the situation in Lebanon requires it to be an oasis of freedom so that the region's problems can be aired in Lebanon. Freedom will survive but it might receive some scratches, depending on the political conditions outside Lebanon.
