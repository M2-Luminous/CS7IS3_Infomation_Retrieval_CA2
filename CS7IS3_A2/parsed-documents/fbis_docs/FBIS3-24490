Zhmako; UDC 621.373.826] [Abstract] Nonlinear-optical properties of glasses with microcrystals of a semiconductor compound CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] (belonging to the A[.sup]1[/]B[.sup]3[/]C[.sup]6[/][.sup]2[/] type), whose edge of the fundamental absorption band lies in the near infrared spectral region (1-1.4ï¿½m), were experimentally examined in this paper. The relationships of energy transmission as a function of peak intensity of the incident ultrashort pulses (USP), and the kinetics of changes in absorption of the exploring USP at different intensities of the excitation radiation and the width of the prohibited zone were also studied. Single USP of the fundamental and second harmonics of YAlO[.sup]3[/]:Nd laser with a passive synchronization of the modes were used as the excitation source and for probing. The USP duration was about 15 ps. CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] microcrystals, dispersed in a silicate glass, with 1.06, 1.14,, 1.17, and 1.22 eV width of the prohibited zone were examined and the results are shown in a graph. The experiments demonstrated that in glasses containing semiconductor microcrystals CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/], the character and time parameters of the kinetics of the absorption changes, induced by picosecond light pulses, depend on the excitation level, and also on the photon energy of the excitation and probing pulses.
