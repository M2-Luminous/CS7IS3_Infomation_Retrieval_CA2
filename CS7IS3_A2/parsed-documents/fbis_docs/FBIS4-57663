The meeting is trying to establish a new alliance among all the party's factions, since the fissure in unity is threatening even the presidential candidacy of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano. We will be in direct contact with our colleague Maria Martinez de la Vega from PRD offices for all the details on this meeting. As Heberto Castillo said this morning, the PRD urgently needs to make a clean sweep of procedures, not people. Speaking this morning to ACIR, Heberto Castillo said the problem inside his party is not [as heard] that PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo has lacked the discipline to heed the mandate of the National Executive Committee. [Begin Castillo recording] What we have here is a problem that arose because of Mr. Porfirio Munoz Ledo's disrespect for the decisions of the National Executive Committee. In the political reforms, a plan submitted to the Government Secretariat and voted on, but the vote [words indistinct] even comrade Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. He had to distance himself from that position in his 18 March speech at the Zocalo. The fundamental difference is that we, as the PRD, have proposed that electoral authorities be independent of the executive branch. The political reforms retain the government secretary as chairman. [end recording] As Heberto Castillo reiterated, the problem within the PRD is the indiscipline of Porfirio Munoz Ledo. This morning, we interviewed PRD presidential candidate Cardenas. A little more at ease, Cardenas said the problems within his party are normal for a democratic institution that does not hide its differences. [Begin Cardenas recording] I see no major problem. I believe this a normal arrangement in a party where we openly and publicly hold our discussions. We do not resolve our problems behind closed doors, but in public. [end recording]
