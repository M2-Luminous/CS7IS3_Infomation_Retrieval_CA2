He believes the title of a declaration would mean a milder political approach to the agreement being concluded. Shaymiyev, a deputy of the Federation Council, said this in an interview to ITAR-TASS during a break in the council's meeting where the draft treaty on civic accord is being discussed today. The Tatarstan president believes the agreement refers above all to parties and movements, but for comprehensive accord it should be joined by all republics, territories, regions. Stability in the country for the implementation of the economic reform should be achieved within definite political frameworks, Shaymiyev said.
