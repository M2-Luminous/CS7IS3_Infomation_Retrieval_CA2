The communist Vietnamese puppets' state authorities had gathered their invading forces from diverse areas in Moung District at the district's township and railway station, from where they were to be sent as reinforcements to the Pailin region. When the people learned about this, they joined hands with the NADK to attack and disperse the soldiers. As a result, we killed 15 enemy soldiers and wounded more than 40 others. Taking that opportunity, many soldiers freshly recruited by the communist Vietnamese puppets' state authorities fled for home. The people and NADK also destroyed five barracks, eight vehicles, and 300 meters of railroad. On the same day, the people and NADK attacked and destroyed the communist Vietnamese puppet' invading forces. They regrouped at Bakan District's township of Trapeang Chong on Route National 5, killing 17 enemy soldiers and wounding more than 20 others. The state authorities of the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government in Moung District and at Trapeang Chong were terrified and fled for their lives. Some run away to the Pursat provincial town, while others hid themselves at Boeng Khna in Svay Don Kev. National Route 5 and the railway lines have been cut off since 28 and 29 March.
