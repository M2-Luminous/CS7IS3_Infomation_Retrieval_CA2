King Norodom Sihanouk, speaking to an audience of monks at the Royal Palace, said he had received the long letter from Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan which criticized previous ceasefire calls while at the same time saying the king had a good idea. "He did not say clearly whether or not he supports my proposal," King Sihanouk complained. The letter released here said the king's proposal was a good one and that the Khmer Rouge fully support it. But it warned that the previous ceasefires proposed by the Cambodian government as a precondition for peace talks are "poisonous tricks they used repeatedly" to get the guerrillas to stop fighting so that government troops could capture more Khmer Rouge territory. It also pointed to the failure of the ceasefire dictated by the 1991 Paris peace accords, formally ending Cambodia's civil war and bringing a UN peacekeeping operation to Cambodia to maintain the peace. The United Nations blamed the Khmer Rouge for most of the ceasefire violations during its 18-month mandate in Cambodia. The war, still continuing primarily in the northwest, has caused 60,000 refugees to flee their homes. "Phnom Penh is a place in the hands of the Vietnamese communists, the entente, the Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed (Cambodian) government, all of whom have a policy to destroy (us) permanently," Khieu Samphan wrote. "Therefore, a ceasefire or a non-ceasefire depends on the situation," he said. "The Vietnamese communists do not need a ceasefire, do not need national reconciliation, unity and peace." Khieu Samphan said he hoped peace talks also proposed by the king could be organized abroad as soon as possible. The Cambodian government has agreed to go to North Korea for the talks, but only if the ceasefire is complete. The Khmer Rouge maintain that Cambodia remains occupied by the Vietnamese, who invaded to oust the Khmer Rouge regime in 1978 and ruled Phnom Penh for a decade.
