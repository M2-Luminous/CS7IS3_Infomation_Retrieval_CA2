A hypothetical negotiated solution was further postponed by a vote on 10 April for implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution by one of the antagonistic blocs in the Senate. This Senate bloc is not acknowledged by the international community. The article they propose provides for the appointment of a provisional president and new general elections, which must result in the installation of a new president on 7 February 1995. Washington has already warned that this kind of solution is not acceptable. The United States and the United Nations is still supporting a parliamentary compromise inspired by the Governors Island agreement and widely approved by the moderate deputies supporting President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, by the socialists, and the centrists. President Aristide has rejected this plan. Despite parliamentary and diplomatic pressures, the Senate bloc acknowledged by the international community and presided over by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, who is close to the president-in-exile, has so far not approved it, provoking a vacuum that is being exploited by the bloc of adversaries of the president headed by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq. The latter spoke of a letter from the military high command acknowledging him as legitimate president of the Senate. This document has so far not been made public. Neither has the Army taken an official stand on this parliamentary issue. Its chief, General Raoul Cedras, has always, since the beginning of the crisis, found a way out, allowing the military institution to save face and to preserve its unity. While awaiting a solution in which fewer and fewer Haitians believe, the gruesome detailed accounts by victims of repression, partisans of Father Aristide, and victims of the international sanctions, are increasing daily. According to the latest figures, communicated to AFP by the international civilian mission in charge of ensuring that human rights are respected in the country, 111 cases of extrajudicial execution and suspicious death were recorded in Port-au-Prince between February and March. Six similar cases were already recorded between 1 and 10 April. The mission has also denounced the existence of clandestine detention centers and cases of rape of a political nature. For the same period, the Haitian Platform of Human Rights [Plateforme Haitienne des Droits Humains], PHDH, which encompasses several organizations, has reported 162 people wounded by gunshot or beatings; 153 illegal arrests, and 297 cases of illegal search or destruction of property belonging to individuals or organizations. The civilian mission and the PHDH accuse civilian police auxiliaries; members of the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, the main neo-Duvalierist formation, which has rejected these accusations; and the Armed Forces. A doctor, who wishes to remain anonymous, told AFP that an average of 12 people are admitted to the Port-au-Prince general hospital with gunshot wounds (?per day), where the sanitary conditions, previously precarious, are now disastrous. Half of these survive surgical operations, according to this doctor. The victims of the international commercial embargo, effective since October 1991 and intensified in 1993 by an oil embargo that has quickly affected the most deprived members of the least advanced country in the American hemisphere, have added to this assessment. The sanctions have created over 10,000 victims within the most vulnerable groups, including women, children, the elderly, and the ill, according to independent religious and humanitarian organization officials who wish to remain anonymous. One of them, a priest working for 34 years in peasant circles, has denounced the tragic continuation of a collective punishment for the poorest of people, and the morally inadmissible use by the international community of the suffering and death of thousands of children for political ends.
