FR940119-1-00033 FR940119-1-00011 Both gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators indicated that neither RCVs nor ACVs were installed as shutoff valves as standard practice. They indicated that RCVs and ACVs had little effect to mitigate the extent of the spill because often, especially in populated areas on gas pipelines, ignition occurred before either type of valve could shut down a pipeline. The specific concern of false closure of ACVs was identified in these comments. There was substantial agreement by both gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators that ACVs should not be used as EFRDs because of their unreliability. This unreliability was due to the inability of ACV sensors to distinguish between a leak and normal operating fluctuations. Pipeline operators indicated numerous documented cases of unintended closures of ACVs. A false closure of an ACV on a hazardous liquid pipeline can cause an immediate pressure buildup or surge which may result in a pipeline rupture. On September 23, 1987, the ANPRM was discussed at the joint meeting of the RSPA's Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee. (Both technical committees were established by the Secretary of Transportation to advise the Department on the technical feasibility, reasonableness, and practicability of all proposed gas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety standards and all amendments to existing standards.) The committees recommended that the Department study the selective use of RCVs and ACVs. Emergency Flow Restricting Devices Study_1991 Section 305 of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;561), enacted on October 31, 1988, directed a study of the safety, cost, feasibility, and effectiveness of requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators to install EFRDs in existing and future pipeline systems in varying circumstances and locations. In March 1991, in response to this Congressional mandate, the Department issued the study titled ``Emergency Flow Restricting Devices Study.'' One of the conclusions in the study was that RCVs and check valves 4 are the only feasible EFRDs. Another conclusion was that requiring the retrofitting of all existing manually operated valves to RCVs on hazardous liquid pipelines in urban locations, as well as new valves in urban areas appeared to be cost effective. Still another conclusion in the study was that for an RCV to be effective, a modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system with a well-designed leak detection subsystem was necessary to reduce spills from hazardous liquid pipelines. The study found that there was no significant benefit from installing EFRDs on gas transmission pipelines. 4 Check valves are valves that permit fluid to flow freely in one direction and contain a mechanism to automatically prevent flow in the other direction. SCADA systems utilize computer technology to analyze data (e.g., pressure, temperature, and delivery flow rates) that are continuously gathered from remote locations on the pipeline. Computer analysis of this data is used to assist in day-to-day operating decisions on the pipeline and to provide input for real-time models of the pipeline operation which can identify and locate leaks. SCADA-based leak detection subsystems are composed of hardware and software programs that employ a real-time modelling procedure to compare the current operational conditions of a segment of pipe to an ``ideal'' operating state. This ideal state is sometimes recalibrated during operations to accommodate variations in conditions (e.g., temperature or pressure fluctuations in the pipe that occur due to changes in the materials in transport or external environmental conditions). An ``alarm'' is sent to a central operator when the software model detects a condition that is ``substantially'' different from the idealized state. What makes the condition ``substantially'' different, thereby triggering the alarm, is determined by the model designer and the conditions imposed on the model, as well as by the amount of data available on the ``ideal'' state and its normal operational variability. An RCV can operate without a SCADA system installed. However, for an RCV to be used effectively in reducing a spill, the dispatcher must be able to determine that a pipeline failure has occurred, identify the location of the failure, and then quickly initiate closure of the valve. Accomplishing these actions in a timely manner requires the installation of a SCADA system including a well-designed leak detection subsystem. The extensive pollution which resulted from a 1988 pipeline failure in Maries County, Missouri, to be discussed later in this ANPRM, might have been avoided if a leak detection subsystem had been installed with the SCADA system allowing operator personnel to detect the leak.
