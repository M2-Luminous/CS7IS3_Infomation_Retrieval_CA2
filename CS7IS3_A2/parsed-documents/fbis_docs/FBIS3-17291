There is no end to attacks by armed gangs demanding large ransoms for hostages taken from among the civilian population. Schools and apartment blocks are being set on fire. There have been plenty of killings. Muggings alternate with car thefts. The armed formations looting and pillaging in South Ossetia and Abkhazia seem to now be exploring new territory -- parts of Georgia that have been settled since time immemorial by the 500,000-strong Azerbaijani community. In the past Zviad Gamsakhurdia was keen on Georgianizing this area, freeing the hands of the "bandit formations" who began getting rich by looting and pillaging. The Azerbaijanis suffered least during the Georgian wars of the last few years and were partially able to retain their possessions. But, in the past year alone, 65 Azerbaijanis from Dmanisi, Marneuli, and Bolnisi have been abducted. The fight against the armed gangs has been stepped up following intervention by the Azerbaijani leadership and vigorous measures by Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze. However, Georgia's Azerbaijani communities think that one-shot actions cannot solve these problems since it is not only radical nationalists, but also outside forces trying to complicate the situation in Georgia with "another Karabakh" that have an interest in the confrontation. The situation in the region has had a palpable impact primarily on the Georgian economy. Azerbaijanis cannot cultivate the land under the barrel of a gun and the fields have not been sown. The market has lost an appreciable amount of food. Gangs are active on the highways linking the "Azerbaijani" regions with Tbilisi and Baku, and the Georgian militia itself is not averse to exacting dues from the peasants and confiscating produce. Observers think it extremely dubious that the Georgian authorities are capable of imposing order in the region given the chaos reigning in the country. The Azerbaijanis are asking Heydar Aliyev to help and vigorously defend his compatriots. The situation has not improved even after Eduard Shevardnadze received a group of Azerbaijani elders. Leaders of Azerbaijan's political parties are voicing fears that the situation itself will force the Azerbaijanis to take up arms in order to defend their families.
