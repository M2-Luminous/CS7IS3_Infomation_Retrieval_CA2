The veto imposed yesterday by Foreign Minister Antonio Martino on the inclusion of Slovenia on the waiting list to join the EU provoked a bitter reaction from Slovenian Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle. He said it would be difficult to have good relations with Italy. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman was also harsh. He said Croatia was faced with a renewed Italian imperialism. France and, above all, Germany support Croatia and Slovenia. However, the Italian Government prefers to concentrate on the positive aspects of the meetings Martino had yesterday. The minister stressed he had received an invitation to visit Croatia. There is also the diffidence of the European partners because of the presence of members of the National Alliance in the government. On 30 May the welcoming ceremony for the minister of posts, Giuseppe Tatarella, will be boycotted by Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, who said he would not shake hands with a neofascist. Finally there is also great embarrassment in light of the forthcoming visit to Rome by President Bill Clinton. Because of his role as chairman of the Chamber of Deputies foreign affairs committee, Mirko Tremaglia from the Italian Social Movement could be invited to the luncheon scheduled to be held at the Quirinale Palace on 3 June. This promises to be the most delicate moment in the whole trip.
