Located at the foot of the southern Himalayas, Zham has served as a political, economic and cultural passageway between China and Nepal since the Sino-Nepalese highway opened in 1965. However, the annual border trade volume was worth only seven million yuan (800,000 U.S. dollars) in 1979. Along with China's reform and open policy, Zham has become prosperous as hotels, power stations, post offices, banks, and industry and commerce offices have sprung up and more business people have been flocking there. Now the port boasts 3,000 residents, most of whom are businessmen from the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Chinese provinces, and Nepal. According to local officials, ten percent of the local trade volume is done in U.S. dollars, 30 percent in Nepalese currency and 50 percent in renminbi. The rest is barter trade.
