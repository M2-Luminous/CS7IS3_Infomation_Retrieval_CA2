The enemy has begun to demand its share of land and water and to weasel its way out of Resolution 425. After meeting with a delegation from the photographers' union, he added that the forced military service campaign practiced by the occupation and its agents in the occupied border strip is an attempt to justify introducing Lahd's army within the ranks of the Lebanese Army. Speaker Nabih Birri discussed some changes that have taken place on certain matters: the revival of sectarian grudges in sports, for example, as happened between the teams of al-Ansar and al-Hikmah; Rabin's visit to the border strip; and the introduction of Israeli reinforcements. He noted that this is not mere coincidence. He said the Lebanese have once again proven that adherence to unity is the best kind of action and one of the conditions for resistance. He stressed that there is a Lebanese problem before a problem with Israel. There might also be a Lebanese-Syrian problem and a Syrian-Jordanian problem. He adds: I believe that efforts should be made on the internal front to clarify these conspiracies. The Lebanese people are capable of taking a united stand. He drew attention to the fact that there are many villages that have been wrenched away from Lebanon such as al-Mtullah and the seven villages. Talk about Israel's owning 400 dunums (approximately 1.4 acres) of al-Mtullah is an Israeli attempt to circumvent Resolution 425 and deceive the public.
