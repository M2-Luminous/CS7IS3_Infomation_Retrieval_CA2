Speaking at the Bundestag's Trust Agency Investigation Committee, she said that gross losses will be DM345 billion, of which DM68 billion in revenues must be deducted after the conclusion of privatization. So far, 75,000 privatization contracts and 100,000 leases have been concluded. By the beginning of the year sales of DM49 billion had been agreed on, of which a "double-digit billion-mark sum" had not yet been received by the Trust Agency. During her first appearance at the responsible investigation committee, which took about eight hours, the Trust Agency head defended the agency's method of privatization and closing down. Without any experience and, at the beginning, only "with a law as a tool," it was necessary to transform the GDR economy, which was generally in need of improvement, into a market economy. The mistakes that were made in the process are normal. These mistakes and a number of decisions, which are difficult to explain to the public, gave rise in the east to the accusation that the agency was "ruining everything" and in the west that it was "wasting money." However, the Trust Agency has always tried to save as many companies and thus as many jobs as possible. Through privatization alone, about a quarter of the 4 million jobs existing in the Trust Agency companies in 1990 were preserved. According to Breuel, in many cases it would have been easier for the Trust Agency to send companies on to a summary execution. However, in the interest of the companies, one decided in favor of time- and cost-consuming liquidation "to save what could be saved." So far, about 3,200 Trust Agency companies have been closed down. The president estimates the costs for closing down at DM45 billion and the revenues from closing down at DM2 billion. Committee chairman Otto Schily, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], doubted the information provided by the Trust Agency concerning the preservation of jobs in the course of closing down companies. In his view, it was not 30 but less than 15 percent of the approximately 200,000 jobs, taken over in the course of the proceedings, which have been preserved. On the fringe of yesterday's meeting in the Red town hall in Berlin, Schily also accused the Federal Government of massively hindering the work of the investigation committee. Files are released with delay or are blocked entirely. Impediment of Work Schily thus indirectly commented on the demand of the Federal Government, which has called on the Federal Constitutional Court to reject the SPD group's suit for releasing the minutes of the meetings of the Trust Agency Administration Council. In late March the SPD had filed a suit, upon initiative by the SPD members of the Trust Agency Investigation Committee, in line with Article 44 of the constitution, because they see locking up the minutes as impeding the work of the committee.
