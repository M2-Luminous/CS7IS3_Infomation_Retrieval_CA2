FR941020-1-00008 FR941020-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food and Nutrition Service 7 CFR Part 273 [Amendment No. 360] Food Stamp Program: Resource Provision From the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act of 1990 AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This rule proposes to amend Food Stamp Program regulations to implement a provision contained in the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act of 1990 (the Leland Act) to expand the criteria by which a resource can be considered inaccessible. The Department originally published a proposed rule concerning this provision on August 13, 1991 at 56 FR 40164. After reviewing the comments received, the Department elected to withdraw the provision as originally proposed and amend its proposal. Subsequently, on December 13, 1991, the Food Stamp Act of 1977 was amended by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 which refined the Leland Act provision concerning inaccessible resources. In this proposed rulemaking, the Department is addressing both statutory provisions dealing with inaccessible resources. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 18, 1995, to be assured of consideration. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted to Judith M. Seymour, Supervisor, Eligibility and Certification Regulations Section, Certification Policy Branch, Program Development Division, Food Stamp Program, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia, 22302. Comments can also be sent via datafax to Ms. Seymour at (703) 305&hyph;2454. All written comments will be open to public inspection at the offices of the Food and Nutrition Service during regular business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday) in Room 718 at 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith M. Seymour, Supervisor, Eligibility and Certification Regulations Section, at the above address or at (703) 305&hyph;2496. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12372 The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the final rule and related Notice(s) to 7 CFR 3105, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983; or 48 FR 54317, December 1, 1983, as appropriate), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or Part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) For retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8. Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has also been reviewed with respect to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). The Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has certified that this proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and local agencies that administer the Program will be the most affected. Food stamp applicants and recipients will be affected due to changes in excludable resources for purposes of the Food Stamp Program. Paperwork Reduction Act This action does not contain reporting or record keeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Background The Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act (Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, Title XVII, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, 104 Stat. 3783); (hereinafter referred to as the Leland Act) made several changes to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2011, et seq. ) (the Act). This proposed rulemaking pertains to Section 1719 of the Leland Act which amended Section 5(g) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2014(g)(5), to expand the criteria by which property can be considered inaccessible to households in the calculation of their resources for purposes of food stamp eligibility. The Department originally published a proposed rule on August 13, 1991 at 56 FR 40164 regarding, in part, this Leland Act provision. The Department received twenty comments on the proposal to amend 7 CFR 273.8(e) to incorporate this provision. On December 13, 1991, Section 904 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;237, 105 Stat. 1818); (hereinafter referred to as the 1991 Technical Amendments) further amended Section 5(g)(5) of the Act. In light of the additional legislation, and after full consideration of the comments received in response to the earlier proposed rule, the Department has elected to re-propose the rule on the inaccessible resources provision. Following are explanations of current rules, the Department's earlier proposal and the comments received, the 1991 Technical Amendments, and the new proposal. We believe understanding these items will lead to a better understanding of the re-proposal. Current Rule
