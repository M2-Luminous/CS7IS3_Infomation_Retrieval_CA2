Today, in the renovating efforts, as the task of socioeconomic stabilization and development is placed at the top of our agenda, the task of firmly defending the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the socialist fatherland, and stopping and defeating every enemy destructive and aggressive plot and act remains the strategic task of all our people, army, and political system. Maintaining peace and political stability has a decisive significance for the fate of the nation and the development of the country. On the other hand, socioeconomic development and improvement of the standard of living are the topmost conditions for strengthening our ability to defend the fatherland. In the face of complex international and regional changes, the fact that the country is encountering new challenges and new opportunities requires that we thoroughly understand the party's views and line and apply them to our locality in an appropriate manner. The Ha Tay Provincial CPV Committee always adheres to this leadership thinking and carries out the task of leading the efforts to consolidate national defense in the locality. These are the major issues that Ha Tay Province always attaches importance to and concentrates its leadership and guidance on: I - To try to stabilize production and the living standard, to create the people's political and spiritual unity as the invincible line of defense in defending the fatherland. In the economic field, the characteristics of the province -- nearly 80 percent of the population lives on farming in rural areas -- requires that we concentrate our efforts on achieving total development of agricultural production, with the central point of interest being grain production. In 1993, our production was 810,000 tons, exceeding the goal (800,000 tons) set for 1995. The per capita average production increased from 317 kilograms/year (in 1990) to 365 kilograms/year (in 1993). Our province granted the people the right to have long-term steady use of land as early as mid-1992. Although land was a pretty complicated issue due to many years of war and numerous changes in the sizes of cooperatives and in land and rural population, the fact that we assumed tight leadership over the efforts to grant farmers the land right ensured maintaining of stability and avoiding of disturbances and troubles. The people who lived in rural areas and did not have any other occupations, including active military personnel and workers and civil servants transferred to the locality, all received land. That was an important factor that enabled farmers to have peace of mind and the enthusiasm for doing productive work. In addition to agricultural production, the people of Ha Tay have many handicraft occupations. In 1990 and 1991, because of many difficulties, our production declined. Recently, the province has strengthened its leadership; consolidated, developed, and promoted all economic sectors; stepped up industrial, small industrial, and handicraft production; and succeeded in boosting the latter to account for more than 30 percent of the total value of agricultural and industrial output, thus creating more jobs, raising the people's income, and gradually increasing accumulation of wealth. In the social field, in addition to correctly implementing the social policies, we pay attention to gradually building the new countryside: achieving "happy villages, harmonious families." We do realistic work depending on the abilities of individual villages and aimed at three goals: raising the people's intellectual standard, strengthening community welfare, and protecting national culture and the environment. The province has so far remodeled 60 percent of its schools to make them more good-looking; 100 percent of villages now have their own dispensaries; more than half of village roads have a brick or concrete surface; nearly 100 percent of villages have provided homes with electricity and have installed wired radio loudspeakers in their hamlets; some villages are creating their own new cultural models, and so on. These are the realistic measures aimed at creating the people's confidence in the party's new positions and policies, and stopping and defeating the enemy's "peaceful development." In addition to caring about production and the standard of living, we expand democratic activities among the people. We have succeeded in urging wide and democratic participation of the people in the periods of soliciting public opinion for contributions to party congress documents, the Constitution, state laws, National Assembly elections, and so on; we have clarified, resolved, and dealt with in a timely manner the people's petitions and issues of concern raised by the public. As for the complicated cases, the "hot spots," the province has provided all sectors and echelons with guidance in regard to how to correctly evaluate the reasons behind any problems, particularly behind any contradictions among the people, so as to correctly handle them in accordance with the following principle: As to all matters having to do with the people, they must persistently rely on the people to resolve them at the basic level, with cadres having to apologize to the people and to behave accordingly after committing some mistakes. The key leading cadres need to hold direct conversations with the people. As a result, the "hot spots" were all safely resolved, thus preventing the bad people from taking advantage of them and avoiding quarrels among the people and a loss of their solidarity. The fact that the rural areas became more stable and the standard of living was improved has been a positive contribution to the common stability in the province as a whole. II - To build defense areas, to strengthen the all-people national defense potential and combat posture. 1. The first job is to educate and mobilize all the people and the entire political system for having the necessary concept and knowledge regarding today's task of consolidating national defense and maintaining security. In various forms and with appropriate measures, Ha Tay has gradually made its cadres, party members, and people clearly see the enemy's wicked plots and tricks and at the same time grasp the characteristics and new needs of the current task of defending the fatherland. On this basis, it has been trying to heighten vigilance and the spirit of responsibility and to build a strong base so as to turn every village into a "fortress" and every citizen into a warrior devoted to the defense of our native land and the defense of the fatherland. It has plans for closely linking national defense and security with the political system to create a combined force and to be ready to successfully deal with any peaceful-development tricks, subversive and overthrowing action, or any daring acts on the part of the enemy. 2. To do good planning for economic development through the year 2000, to closely link economic development plans with consolidation of national defense. We all know that the economy and national defense have close relationships and act on each other. How do we build the economy in order to both strengthen the national defense potential and create favorable conditions for national defense? In our economy today, the state is the social operator and manager and at the same time the major customer of economic units. It uses the law to operate; policies and other tools to act; and inevitably development plans to limit the negative aspects, to make the people rich and the country strong, and to hold steady the socialist movement. To achieve this, it requires that the planning for economic development, now and in the long term, be closely linked with national defense, with the two strategic tasks being truly combined. This is an extremely important issue in the planning and plans for socioeconomic development. As to Ha Tay, a large province having over 2.2 million people, specific resources, and many good historical monuments and natural sights, and being adjacent to the capital city of Hanoi, it has planned and will plan for becoming a province having an economic structure suitable for its capabilities and conditions (concentrating on three main sectors, namely, agriculture, industry, and tourism) and at the same time being capable of maintaining national security and creating favorable conditions for further strengthening national defense. We have been paying attention to making economic installations thoroughly understand the party views and avoid being interested "solely in economic matters," going after income at any cost, pursuing joint business and alliance in an unprincipled manner, and thus weakening national defense and the security of the locality and the country. 3. To build our armed forces strong in every way. In the last few years, as we contributed to building a well-trained regular revolutionary army being gradually modernized, we set quality as the first requirement in our recruiting and calling up people and at the same time made sure that we fulfill the goals that the state had assigned to us. In the years of 1992 and 1993, nearly 80 percent of our recruits were in the good-health category; 94.3 percent of them had cultural background of levels 2 and 3. In addition, we also overfulfilled the goals set for recruiting people for military schools. The numbers of people having passed the examinations in Ha Tay accounted for 10 percent of the national total in 1992 and 11.3 percent in 1993. To build the reserve force ready for mobilization was considered a regular and long lasting important task. This was a rather demanding job because it had to do with 25,000 people in almost all villages and production installations; it required a close combination; reasonably tight, neat, and professionally correct arrangement; and good quantity and quality in regard to both soldiers and cadres. Each year about 3,000 reserve officers and soldiers were involved in periodical training and exercises. Consequently, the party organizations and administrations at all levels had to adhere to tight leadership and management, to follow appropriate procedures and policies, and particularly to do a good job in regard to providing the people and members of the reserve force with good political and ideological education. The militia and self-defense forces were further strengthened, with quality being the main goal to be achieved; they were organized in such a way as to be closely linked with administrative headquarters and production units (hamlets, villages, organs, enterprises) and to be of the right size (about 1.5 percent of the population). Training had to be realistic. The activities of these forces had to be linked with protecting production and maintaining security and order at the basic level; fees had to be paid by the collectives and people to allow them to operate effectively and to strengthen their organization on a regular basis. 4. To correctly implement the army's rear-area policy. Because this was a job that would directly affect the building of the armed forces, party organizations, administrations, and mass organizations at all levels, from provincial to basic, attached a proper importance to it. The province as a whole had more than 37,000 dead heroes and nearly 25,000 wounded soldiers. As the right to use land on a steady and long-term basis was granted farmers, close-by and good ricefields were given on a first-priority basis to families of dead heroes and wounded soldiers, who were exempted from paying any contributions. On the 45th anniversary of the 27-7 event (in 1992), people in the province contributed money and energy to repairing and building hundreds of cemeteries and a number of monuments, built 500 affection-and-devotion houses and awarded more than 10,000 savings books to the families of dead heroes and wounded soldiers who had encountered difficulties, and took 100 percent of the seriously wounded soldiers (more than 500 of them) into their homes and provided for them. Although there still were shortcomings, the above-mentioned deeds reflected a good effort and a total moral affectionate behavior toward those people who had sacrificed their lives for the independence and freedom of the fatherland and the happiness of the people; they have brought a degree of peace of mind to the people who are and will be fulfilling the military obligation and to their relatives. 5. To closely coordinate the work between the locality and the main-force units stationed in the province so as to maintain security and to strengthen solidarity between the army and the people. At present, there are in Ha Tay Province many units of the main-force corps [binh doan], arms and services, institutes, officers' schools, storehouses, and national defense enterprises. Both the locality and the army are paying proper attention to the close coordination among them. Party committee echelons at all levels, from provincial to district, city, and village, have plans for coordinating their work with these units in order to maintain security under any circumstances. Local party committee echelons and administrations, along with the heads of these units, hold annual meetings to exchange ideas about realistic work aimed at strengthening solidarity between the people and the army in the new situation. Many units have wholeheartedly helped the people to fight natural disasters, to protect production, to build schools and affection-and-devotion houses, to get medical treatment, and so on. On the other hand, many localities have helped the army units to protect their barracks, storehouses, and lines of communications, and to uncover and handle in a timely manner any misuses of army properties. For the time being, the localities and units are checking the areas and boundaries of land so as to report them to the government, which will legitimize the right of the army to use land and at the same time will put aside some land where it is available for the construction of military families' residential areas, and thus to create favorable conditions for gradually stabilizing the family life of cadres of those units being assigned for long-term stationing in the province. Because national defense work is very important and has to do with many aspects and many fields of activities, we must ensure the party's absolute and total leadership, first of all in regard to national defense views, line, and policies. As we assume the national defense leadership in the locality, we pay attention to taking the following key steps: - To correctly apply the party's renovation views on the construction and defense of the fatherland so as to devise the ways to strengthen national defense in the locality. - To build the armed forces to make them truly clean and strong, suitable for peacetime military organization, and ready to satisfy wartime needs. - To make plans for and train military cadres to make them loyal and reliable people having strong determination, good background, and the necessary knowledge of economic and foreign-policy affairs. - Through party building, to strengthen and fully control party bases. To consider building party bases the important part of the efforts to build and strengthen national defense and security in the locality. The state relies on the party line and policies, which are formalized in the form of documents serving as laws and regulations to be abided by all people, including party members, as they fulfill their sacred obligation toward the defense of the fatherland. The state must also take care of more important practical matters, such as balancing the budget, and the procedures and policies having to do with national defense and create favorable conditions for the locality to be stronger and stronger in terms of doing its national defense work.
