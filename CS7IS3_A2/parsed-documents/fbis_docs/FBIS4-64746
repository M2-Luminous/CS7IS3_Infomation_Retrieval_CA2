With German aid, five local organizations for water supply and sewage plants will be set up. In addition, a project to improve waste disposal in the Gaza Strip is being prepared. By the end of 1992, the territories occupied by Israel were granted development aid totaling 173 million German marks [DM]. In addition, there is Germany's share of DM185 million in aid granted by the European Community. Last year, the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development made a new pledge of DM36.2 million. Of this sum, DM15 million will go to drinking water supply projects in Nablus and Ramallah. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) received DM14.5 million from Bonn. The current projects include a vocational school in Beit Hania, a polytechnical school in Hebron, and a waste disposal project in Bethlehem. Projects of church and private organizations and of political foundations are also promoted. Development cooperation has in the past been faced with the problem that, because there is no state as a partner, communities must be won over for individual projects. The Bonn Development Aid Ministry says, however, that this has restricted the volume of possible aid. Bonn's new pledges this year include DM10 million for technical cooperation and, for the first time, DM10 million in capital aid. Germany also helps finance European Union aid programs totalling DM500 million and a World Bank aid program totalling $2.4 billion.
