Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri is to put the proposal to the Cabinet at its meeting on Tuesday, the sources said. The proposal is that 39.6 million baht be allocated for the purpose from the fiscal 1994 budget and 39.6 million baht from the fiscal 1995 budget. Both allocations should come from the Highways Department budget. The bridge is to be built over the Moei River to connect Mae Sot district, Tak province with Myawaddy town in Kachin state. The proposal has been approved by the Budget Bureau and the Finance Ministry, sources said. However, the ministry said Thailand should have full rights over the bridge and the collection of tolls. The secretary-general of the National Security Council, Charan Kunlawanit, wrote to the Cabinet approving the Thai-financed construction of the bridge. Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut backed the project in a report to the Cabinet, saying the area around the proposed bridge is a "temporary passage" between the two countries which should be upgraded into a "permanent" one, sources said. It should be made clear whether goods transported over the bridge can reach Rangoon, because those that go over the Tachilek passage point in Mae Sai district, Chiang Rai are only allowed to be transported as far as Chiang Tung [Keng Tung] town in Shan state, he said. Defence Minister Gen. Wichit Sukmak wrote in his report to the Cabinet that the the bridge will benefit both countries and will not affect security, sources said. The project was initiated by the Chatchai Chunhawan government when his cabinet adopted a resolution in its favour on August 1, 1989. The Foreign Ministry was to set up a committee to study the issue and seek capital from the UK, Japan and other countries. The estimated cost of the bridge in 1989 was 60.5 million baht.
