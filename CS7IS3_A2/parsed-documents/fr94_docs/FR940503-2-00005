Comments were due by March 2, 1994. FGIS received no comments. FGIS evaluated all available information regarding the designation criteria in Section 7(f)(1)(A) of the Act; and according to Section 7(f)(1)(B), determined that Memphis was able to provide official services in the geographic area for which they applied. Effective June 1, 1994, and ending May 31, 1997, Memphis is designated to provide official inspection services in the geographic area specified in the December Federal Register . FGIS also determined that, pursuant to the provisions of the Act, there is insufficient need for official services in Alaska to designate an agency. Alaska's designation ends May 31, 1994.
