That is, the opposition proposed an urgent motion to advance its draft amendments covering the entire Constitution to the top of the National Assembly agenda. The opposition and government had previously proposed drafts that would amend only eight and 25 items in the Constitution. A heated debate preceded the vote on whether the opposition's draft should be moved to the top of the agenda. The government cited procedural regulations in its argument, while the opposition cited tradition and previous decisions by the parliament president. The reasons cited by both sides seemed acceptable, so the parliament president called a vote, which the opposition won overwhelmingly thanks to support from nearly the entire Senate block. The government could only muster the votes of the coalition parties. Certain people believe the government's defeat in the first round was caused by poor intelligence, a problem the prime minister has often complained about. The government was clueless about the opposition trick that occupied the government with whether the draft should cover eight or 25 points. The government decided only a couple of days before the scheduled parliament session to agree to the 25 points proposed by the opposition, hoping to win popularity among the people. Less than 24 hours before the session, however, the opposition sprang a surprise by proposing the amendment of the entire Constitution, using the 1978 Constitution as a basis and including some of its 25 points. The government could not adjust in time and was defeated in the first round. Judging from the debate, one major issue the opposition did not touch was the status of senators. It even opened the door to increasing the number of senators in proportion with the size of the lower house. The Senate's power would also increase, making it more than just a rubber stamp. This resulted in the opposition receiving overwhelming support for its draft from the senators. The opposition's draft also removed the ban against politicians or bureaucrats becoming parliamentarians if they are judged to have engaged in corruption or amassed abnormal wealth. The point we wish to emphasize to politicians -- government and opposition alike -- is that the amendment of the Constitution should not be an issue they must try to win at all costs or turn into a political game. They should consider what people throughout the country will gain from the amended Constitution.
