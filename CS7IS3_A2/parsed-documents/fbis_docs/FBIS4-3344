Nine rice-growing provinces reported a combined increase of rice cultivation area of over 66,000 ha this year although the labor force has been reduced gradually due to the relatively low profits from rice-growing. In central China's Hunan Province, the total rice-growing land remained at over 1.66 million ha, and that for early-season rice expanded to more than 730,000 ha, a sturdy 10 percent rise from last year. In Guangdong, a booming coastal province in South China, over 50 grain-producing counties have been set up and a series of preferential policies enacted to encourage farmers to grow more rice. Thanks to the steps taken by the local government and the rise of rice prices, the province has cultivated about 670,000 ha of fine- breed rice, an increase of over 130,000 ha from the same period of last year. The provincial government in Zhejiang, in East China, has assured farmers that early rice will be purchased at a price of 96 yuan per 100 kg this year. In addition, the contracted price will be adjusted according to any new price rate. The early-rice land in the province has reached about 870,000 ha this year, 60,000 ha more than last year. Great efforts have also been made to expand the rice-growing areas in other provinces and regions throughout the country, including Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan and Anhui Provinces. The local governments have decided to offer more loans to back grain production this year and help farmers to overcome any kind of problem likely to hinder the increase of the grain output.
