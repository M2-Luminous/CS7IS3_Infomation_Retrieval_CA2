FR940224-0-00051 FR940224-0-00006 Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengths considering both pipelined operations (if supported), and non-pipelined operations, using the fastest executing instruction for each operand length based on: 1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Exclude extraordinarily short execution times generated for operations on a predetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0 or 1). If no register-to-register operations are implemented, continue with (2). 2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-register operations; if these also do not exist, then continue with (3). 3. Memory-to-memory. In each case above, use the shortest execution time certified by the manufacturer. Step 2: TP for each supported operand length WL: Adjust the effective rate R (or R t ) by the word length adjustment L as follows: TP=R * L, where L=(1/3+WL/96). Note: The word length WL used in these calculations is the operand length in bits. (If an operation uses operands of different lengths, select the largest word length.) The combination of a mantissa ALU and an exponent ALU of a floating point processor or unit is considered to be one ``computing element'' (``CE'') with a Word Length (WL) equal to the number of bits in the data representation (typically 32 or 64) for purposes of the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') calculation. This adjustment is not applied to specialized logic processors that do not use XOR instructions. In this case TP=R. Select the maximum resulting value of TP for: Each XP-only ``CE'' (R xp ); Each FP-only ``CE'' (R fp ); Each combined FP and XP ``CE'' (R); Each simple logic processor not implementing any of the specified arithmetic operations; and Each special logic processor not using any of the specified arithmetic or logic operations. Step 3: ``CTP'' for aggregations of ``CEs'', including CPUs: For a CPU with a single ``CE'', ``CTP''=TP (for CEs performing both fixed and floating point operations, TP=max (TP fp , TP xp )). ``CTP'' for aggregations of multiple ``CEs'' operating simultaneously is calculated as follows: Note 1: For aggregrations that do not allow all of the ``CEs'' to run simultaneously, the possible combination of ``CEs'' that provides the largest ``CTP'' should be used. The TP of each contributing ``CE'' is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the ``CTP'' of the combination is derived. N.B.: To determine the possible combinations of simultaneously operating ``CEs'', generate an instruction sequence that initiates operations in multiple ``CEs'', beginning with the slowest ``CE'' (the one needing the largest number of cycles to complete its operation) and ending with the fastest ``CE''. At each cycle of the sequence, the combination of ``CEs'' that are in operation during that cycle is a possible combination. The instruction sequence must take into account all hardware and/or architectural constraints on overlapping operations. Note 2: A single integrated circuit chip or board assembly may contain multiple ``CEs''. Note 3: Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.
