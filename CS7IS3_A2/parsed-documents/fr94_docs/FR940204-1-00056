FR940204-1-00056 FR940204-1-00010 40 CFR Part 52 [MO&hyph;16&hyph;1&hyph;6022; FRL&hyph;4833&hyph;8] Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Commitment to Adopt a Rule for Reasonably Available Control Technology for Oxides of Nitrogen for Missouri AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to conditionally approve revisions to the State implementation plan (SIP) for ozone submitted by the state of Missouri. This portion of the implementation plan was submitted by the state to satisfy Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements for adoption of rules for application of reasonably available control technology (RACT) for oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) in the St. Louis metropolitan area. In this document, EPA is proposing action, not on the rules themselves, but on a commitment by the state to submit the NO X RACT rules at a later date. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by March 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Josh Tapp at the Region VII address. Copies of the state's submittal and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following location: Environmental Protection Agency, Region VII, Air Branch, 726 Minnesota Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101; and Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Air Pollution Control Program, Jefferson State Office Building, 205 Jefferson Street, Jefferson City, Missouri 65101. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Josh Tapp at (913) 551&hyph;7606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of oxides of NO X emissions through RACT are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. Section 182(f) requirements are described by EPA in a notice, ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' published November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55620). The November 25, 1992, notice should be referred to for further information on the NO X requirements. Section 182(f) of the CAA requires states within moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas (the St. Louis metropolitan area is a moderate area) or the ozone transport region to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO X (``major'' as defined in sections 302 and 182(c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC). For more information on what constitutes a major source, see section 2 of the NO X Supplement to the General Preamble (57 FR 55622). Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by a control techniques guideline (CTG) document) by November 15, 1992. There were no NO X CTGs issued before enactment and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO X sources since enactment. States, in their RACT rules, are expected to require final installation of the actual NO X controls by May 31, 1995, from those sources for which installation by that date is practicable. (See 57 FR at 55623.) Under section 110(k)(4), the Administrator may approve a plan revision based on a commitment from the state to adopt specific enforceable measures by a specified date, but not later than one year after the date of EPA approval of the plan revision that incorporated that commitment. Refer to the NO X Supplement to the General Preamble (57 FR 55622&hyph;55623) for details of this conditional approval with respect to the NO X requirements. The memorandums of July 22, 1992, and September 16, 1992, from Deputy Assistant Administrator Michael Shapiro concerning the SIP submittals due November 15, 1992, also outline general requirements for conditional approval actions.
