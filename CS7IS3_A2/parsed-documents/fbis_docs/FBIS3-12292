An ALF spokesman said the outrage only demonstrates the spiteful nature of the aggression against our people and our nation under the cover of the new world order. Some who are worn out by the struggle and dazzled by the deceptive sparkle of power rushed to make peace with the enemy and recognized its presence on our usurged territory, the spokesman added. This ghastly crime and other Zionist atrocities have in common the objective of controlling Arab territories and eliminating their owners by expulsions or killings. Only its scale sets this latest crime apart from previous outrages, the spokesman noted. We in the ALF denounce the West's collusion with the Zionists and their condoning of crimes against our people. We denounce the flagging resolve of the godfathers of a settlement with this usurper Zionist entity, and reiterate our outright rejection of all forms of settlements with this racial and usurper enemy. We urge all Palestinian and Arab negotiators to withdraw from the talks and rejoin the struggle in all its forms, most of all armed struggle, as the only option to liberating our land and safeguarding the dignity and life of the Arab individual. The spokesman called on the Arab nation and its nationalist forces to speak up against Arab regimes associated with imperialism and who compromise Arab rights and gamble with the future of the Arabs. The spokesman said in conclusion: The Arab masses and the Palestinians in particular must sit in the trench of the Mother of Battles -- the trench of justice and dignity that leads to a bright and prosperous future.
