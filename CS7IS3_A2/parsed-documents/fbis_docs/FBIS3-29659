We exchanged views on ironing out opinions to prepare for the third round of talks between the United States and North Korea and also on South-North dialogue." The following is a summary of the interview: [Reporter] Will the nuclear inspection have to be completed before the third round of talks between North Korea and the United States is held? [Han Sung-chu] Yes. [Reporter] Did the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] side make compromises to some degree? [Han] No. North Korea accepted all necessary measures in guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards. The special [tukbyol] inspection issue will be dealt with at the third round of talks. [Reporter] Even though North Korea accepted the nuclear inspection, has the situation not turned back to that of last March? [Han] The situation has not changed greatly since last March. However, at that time the situation then was worsening while currently the situation is improving to some degree. I believe that the past situation will not be repeated. [Reporter] What is your view on the issue of deploying Patriot missiles and the issue of suspending the Team Spirit exercise? [Han] The issue of suspending the Team Spirit exercise will be ironed out when North Korea receives the inspection and the South-North dialogue is resumed. The United States and the ROK agreed that the issue of deploying the Patriot missiles will not be discussed until the IAEA holds its Board of Governors meeting. The military needs for the two countries will be examined. [Reporter] Is there not a dispute between the ROK and the United States regarding this matter? [Han] It is a fact that the United States positively examined the request by the commander of the U.S. Forces in the ROK for the Patriot missiles. Since North Korea accepted the nuclear inspection, it is not known whether Commander Gary Luck will make the same request or take measures that will be in harmony with our side's military assessment. The deployment itself has not been decided upon yet. [Reporter] When do you think that South-North dialogue will be carried out? [Han] There is a great possibility that North Korea will respond to the dialogue. There is a possibility that the dialogue will be held in the near future. [Reporter] Which do you think was effective in the process of North Korea's accepting the nuclear inspection, dialogue or pressure? [Han] We were not going to wait forever to hold a dialogue. The position of the United States and the ROK from the beginning was to depend on another method if it became impossible to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. North Korea did not change its mind on accepting nuclear inspection but it was a measure it had been planning to take in advance. [Reporter] Are rumors that Kim Chong-il was in an accident a false report? [Han] There were such rumors but it has not been confirmed. I believe that such rumors were spread because he did not attend his birthday celebrations. [Reporter] Please tell us about your dialogue with Secretary Kantor. [Han] I clearly told him that the rumors that those who bought foreign-made cars would be subjected to a tax investigation are not true. In connection with the issue of protecting intellectual property, there is great possibility that Korea is excluded from the priority watch country list on intellectual property violations. The plan to expand NAFTA is being examined by various countries, including the United States. The establishment of relations with NAFTA is being analyzed from various angles, such as that of an associate membership, rather than selecting one alternative. It seems that its framework will be revealed sometime in the middle of this year.
