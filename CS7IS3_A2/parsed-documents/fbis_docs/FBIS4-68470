I already knew this to be the case: National-Radical deputies have approached the Prosecutor's Office, demanding that he be charged with treason against the state. Specifically for signing a treaty on a unified monetary system with Russia, one paragraph of which -- concerning the status of the national bank -- contradicts the relevant article of the Constitution. It seems that his life since he was elected chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic nearly four years ago has been composed entirely of dramatic events. His attempts to salvage the economy -- the decline in production, inflation, the decline in living standards, the constant attacks from the right wing and the national reformers, and the criticism from the left.... "You adapt to living as if under fire in a trench," he confessed to journalists. But whereas these years which have washed like a destructive wave over all the former republics of the Union, have seen several heads of government in Belarus' neighbors, starting with Russia, come and go, Kebich has survived. Because he has occupied a key post for all this time, he has naturally had more of a chance than many others to make sense of the processes that have brought society to the brink of disaster. From the vantage point of his accumulated experience, how does he currently view the ways and means for getting Belarusia out of the crisis and providing its people with a decent life? This was the question, a question of interest to all of us, that I put to Kebich first of all. There Is Only One Way [Kebich] Basically, the only way I can see is close union with Russia, the establishment of an effective model for the economy and a just society. This is the main thing. [Stepanenko] You would put union with Russia first? [Kebich] Yes. Without it Belarusia has no future. Blood kinship, shared roots, and age-old unity with the Russian people are not the only issue here. We are united economically. Almost all our energy resources, raw materials, and the bulk of our components come from Russia, and two-thirds of our products are sent to Russia. The destruction of the Union and the disruption of economic ties is a tragedy whose disastrous consequences are being felt in all the republics; it is a tragedy that has become an economic Chernobyl for Belarusia. Our only salvation lies in integration. The unification of monetary systems, for which, as you know, I had to fight all the way, is just the first step in the direction of full economic union with Russia. If you like, this is the only realistic way not only of surviving, but also of retaining our sovereignty. [Kebich ends] Just the day before, during a meeting with industrialists and entrepreneurs who nominated him as a candidate for the presidency, Kebich issued a sharp rebuke to those who have kicked up a fuss about the "crimes" of a government which, by signing a treaty on the monetary system, has supposedly deprived the republic of its sovereignty. And he voiced his profound conviction that Belarusia actually lost its sovereignty following the breakup of the Union, when it became "independent," because disorder and poverty are a road to servitude and total dependence on others. Opponents of economic union with Russia, he noted in a subsequent talk with journalists, are prisoners of medieval illusions. [Stepanenko] But why unite with Russia alone? After all, there was a time when you advocated economic union within the framework of the Commonwealth. [Kebich] I have not given up on this idea. But you will recall how the politicians conducted themselves: They all destroyed even what was enshrined in the agreement on the CIS -- a single economic area, a single ruble, and joint Armed Forces. With every summit meeting I became more and more convinced that national ambitions and selfishness were being put first. Everyone was in it only for what they could get out of it. I realized that we needed to come up with another, more realistic option. Without destroying the Commonwealth, within its framework, those who are more prepared to integrate, for example, and whose economy basically compels them to do so as a result of objective ties, should draw closer together. And I put forward the idea of an economic union of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarusia.... [Kebich ends] This was Kebich's idee fixe. He plugged it whenever he could: He secured the approval of the Supreme Soviet and discussed the concept on several occasions with Chernomyrdin, Kuchma, and Tereshchenko. The planned union of four, and subsequently, owing to the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine, three, was open to other CIS member states, and was to have been the basis for a subsequent economic union of all Commonwealth countries. But it proved impossible to set it up. Whereupon Kebich concentrated his efforts in just one direction -- union with Russia. [Kebich] Of course, we will go further -- we will completely restore the single economic area and single economic organism. I am sure this will accelerate the unification process on a Commonwealth-wide scale. Here in Belarusia, this system will enable us to keep alive the largest enterprises and whole sectors such as those involved in radioelectronics, machine-building, and oil refining. Russia too will benefit: It will not have to establish industries paralleling the ones operating here, nor will it have to shut down enterprises working in collaboration with Belarusia. The second condition for getting ourselves out of the crisis, as I have already mentioned, is the establishment of an effective model for the economy. And here, I think, we need to rid ourselves of one or two illusions. You Cannot Be Wiser Than Life [Kebich] First and foremost we need to openly acknowledge that the economic model proposed by the radical reformers is bankrupt. Let me be more specific: A policy geared to indiscriminate destruction of the past and all the forms and principles of the previous economic system is not only wrongheaded, it is actually ruinous. This is borne out by everything, by the way the production situation is developing and by experience -- our own experience, I mean not just Belarusia's, but the experience of all former Union republics and world experience as a whole. Let me begin with an extremely obvious fact. This model has not achieved success anywhere on the territory of the former USSR. On the contrary, the more the model has been applied, the more the economy has fallen apart. We, for example, immediately refused to adopt the ideas put forward by the radical marketeers -- wholesale liberalization and total privatization. And we thereby prevented the kind of collapse we are seeing among our neighbors. [Stepanenko] But your opponents claim that until recently Belarusia was being helped along by cheap Russian oil. [Kebich] Excuse me, this is just political speculation and deception. For Russia and its enterprises, oil and gas were even cheaper, but production there has declined at a far quicker rate than in Belarusia. [Stepanenko] Specialists say the fact that the republic survived and did not go under with just 4 percent of its own raw materials and components is nothing short of an economic miracle. [Kebich] To a certain extent it really was a miracle. It is important to understand why. We kept to the safety margin that we had in the previous economic system. Let me remind you that back in 1989 the national income grew by almost 8 percent and was probably the highest in the world. Despite all the distortions and deformations which for dozens of years were imposed on this economic system, its healthy foundation, and particularly its planning system, demonstrated its advantages. In order to extricate ourselves from the crisis, we intend to bolster rather than weaken this foundation. How did Franklin Roosevelt extricate the U.S. economy from the crisis caused by the elemental forces of the free market? By planned programs, and control and regulation of prices and interest rates. Even today in West Europe, EEC countries' agricultural production prices are planned and handed down from Brussels. And what about the Southeast Asian market and the Japanese economic miracle? Once again, it was achieved with the help of extremely vigorous and soundly based scientific planned regulation. Quite frankly, I was amazed by a fact I learned not so long ago. Almost 30 years ago in Canada our workers witnessed an operation where, in the space of just four hours, information was collated on the quantity, range, and quality of footwear all over the country, as well as the demand for these products -- and this information was then used to make forecasts and adjust plans. [Stepanenko] So apparently in Canada they threw all their intellectual resources and all the structures of state and science into combating the elemental forces of the market? And in our country these things have become disconnected? [Kebich] Precisely. And now, in order to extricate ourselves from the crisis, we need to make the connection again. It is time for us to say good-bye to the euphoria over private property, which is alleged to be the only way of creating real owners and ensuring the best results. World experience has dispelled this illusion long ago. In many developed countries almost half the enterprises are owned by the state and operate no less efficiently than private ones. And what about agriculture? Nowadays it should be clear to anyone that the best results are achieved on state-owned land in Holland and the state-run cooperatives of Israel. China has fed 1.5 billion people without private ownership. And the production indicators of people leasing land (in West Europe this accounts for almost 50 percent) -- and I stress leasing, not owning -- are no worse than the indicators of those who own it. What about our Belarusian experience? Despite all our shortcomings and making do with far less equipment than Western farmers, the republic's kolkhozes and sovkhozes have produced 150 percent more milk per head of population than all the farms in the United States. And we have caught up with them in terms of the amount of meat produced per head of population, you know. Mistakes Must Be Corrected [Stepanenko] Nevertheless, Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, Belarusia has also given ground. Laws have been adopted opening the way for private ownership and a privatization program.... [Kebich] You know, if all forces -- our own "democratic reformers," the Russians, and the world community -- are pressuring us, one single country taken separately, and moreover a country without raw materials and energy resources, it is practically impossible to resist all alone. The government, of course, is to blame, but primarily because it was the government during this difficult period. It is even said that I am against the market. No, I am not against it. The market exists in all modern countries. There was even a market in the USSR. I am opposed to the kind of market which has been foisted on us by the radical democrats. I am convinced that privatization should not be imposed by force. At the meeting I had with industrialists, for example, they expressed their opposition to the privatization of a number of major enterprises. I said: Let the labor collectives decide. A program is a program, and life is life. But we have not permitted private land ownership in agricultural commodity production. Only on personal plots and gardens, but these are basically privately owned anyway. We have taken account not only of the greater efficiency of collective forms of ownership, but also the unificatory commune principles inherent in the soul of the people and the Slav mentality. [Stepanenko] This ties in directly with the theme of a just society, the need for which you spoke at the beginning of our talk. [Kebich] Yes, I am convinced that unless we pursue a policy of building a just society, we will never climb out of the pit. It sometimes seems to me that we are standing on the edge of a moral abyss and spiritual catastrophe. Today immorality has become the rule, trickery and deception are commonplace, and cynicism is a virtue; an amazing change has taken place in people of all social groups. Ugly economic relations primarily engender legal and moral thuggery. We need to struggle against this. We must not place a nuclear bomb under the economy which will blow society to smithereens. We must not divide society even more into rich and poor -- it has already been divided enough. We need to correct our mistakes, honestly acknowledging that they were made chiefly in important matters rather than trifles. [Stepanenko] So then, Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, do we need to make adjustments or completely change course? [Kebich] What, is it better to persist in wandering off on the wrong track? Right now a reappraisal of what has been done is already under way. People in Russia are beginning to overcome the consequences of the narrowly monetarist approach of the shock-therapy reforms which destroyed the economy. I am sure that the bitter experience of the recent perestroyka and reformist eras will help us to find the right way to extricate ourselves from the crisis. And I hope we will come out of it alongside Russia rather than separately.
