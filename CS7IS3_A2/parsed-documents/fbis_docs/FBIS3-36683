Vladimir Zhirinovskiy confirmed to us today that he has indeed been invited to visit the Czech Republic by the Republican Party of the Czech Republic. According to Zhirinovskiy, so far they have received only a fax of the Republicans' invitation, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is waiting for the original of the invitation to arrive. Answering a question about what he thinks about negative reactions to the possibility that he would visit the Czech Republic, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said: [Zhirinovskiy] If Vaclav Havel feels unhappy about my visit, then I am also unhappy about the fact that playwrights can become presidents of some countries. This is not right. I am not going to write stage plays, I am not going to write the Cherry Orchard if I am not Chekhov. Why, then, is a playwright a president? Your country is dying. I can assure you that in 10 years there will be no Moravia, no Sudeten. In 10 years the entire Czech nation will curse Havel as the Russian people are cursing Gorbachev. All, including me, used to applaude him -- after Chernenko we saw Gorbachev as a good option. Nowadays we curse that villain. The same situation will exist in your country. Vaclav Havel will die and in 10 years young Czechs will curse him. They will be forced to speak German, they will be forced to forget their mother tongue, they will be forced to attend Holy Mass in German churches and to clean the boots of German officers. This will be the Czechs' fate in a few years. We do not want this. We intend to call a congress of Slavonic nations on 2 and 3 April. We are 300 million, we will live in our East European community and will not serve Western Europe. [Reporter] Answering a question about his views on the possibility of an air strike against the troops shelling Sarajevo, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said: [Zhirinovskiy] We oppose violence. To bomb Serbian towns is the same as bombing Russian towns. If this terrible thing takes place we will lodge our protest with the countries whose pilots get involved in the bombing. The same thing will consequently happen to their towns -- bombs will fall on towns of the countries which attack Bosnia.
