Abizanda report: "Defense Ministry Rejects U.S. Offer for Purchase of 40 F-16 Aircraft"] [Text] Madrid -- The Defense Ministry has responded in the negative to the U.S. offer for the purchase of at least 40 F-16 fighter bombers at a unit price of 1 billion pesetas. The Defense Ministry believes that the purchase of those aircraft, despite their good price, would entail further expenditure since this is a new weapons system, especially with respect to providing maintenance for these fighter-bombers. As ABC has already reported, the U.S. authorities offered the Defense Ministry a batch of their model "A" and "B" F-16's -- the oldest -- from their surpluses. These aircraft, built in the late seventies, have been decommissioned or are on service with the National Guard, as a result of the reduction of aircraft in the U.S. Air Force and because they are surpassed in their features by the "C" and "D" series F-16's. According to sources consulted by this newspaper, the United States also offered A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft. Although the two types of aircraft -- both the F-16's, with certain modernizations carried out in Spain, and the A-10's -- would have met one of the Air Force's chief needs, for tactical missions and support for land units, the Defense Ministry rejected the option to buy for economic reasons and because of the purchase of 18 Mirage F-1's from France and Qatar. Among other tasks, the F-16's would have filled the gap left by the F-5A's, whose tasks are currently being fulfilled by C-101 training aircraft equipped with bomb targeting and launching systems. The department headed by Julian Garcia Vargas felt that the purchase of these aircraft would have necessitated a major effort to establish a maintenance network for a new weapons system. This would be in clear contradiction to the line pursued by the Air Force in the last three years, in decommissioning various types of aircraft with a view to making the air fleet more homogeneous so as to make maintenance more flexible and cheaper. The purchase of the F-16's would also have made it necessary to train pilots and maintenance personnel. For these reasons, although the Defense Ministry regards the good price for the planes as a major consideration, the operation would have been much more costly taking a wider view. In addition, there are also political factors weighing against the operation from the Defense Ministry viewpoint. Sources consulted by this newspaper indicated that the partners participating in the EF-200, the former EFA [European Fighter Aircraft], would not take it very well for Spain to purchase U.S. hardware now, when the project in question is entering a decisive phase. In this respect, the case of Italy is fairly similar to Spain's, since its F-104 Starfighters have now outlived their service life and must be decommissioned, creating a major gap in its Air Force, as happened with the Spanish Air Force's F-5's. The Defense Ministry and the Air Force have now decided on the purchase of 18 Mirage F-1's from France and Qatar, in the "C" and "ED" versions. It is hoped that these planes will complete the fleet of these machines, which has been much reduced because of a number of accidents, reducing the fleet to 50 planes from the original 60. The planes from Qatar, according to Air Force sources, consist of 12 single-seaters and one two-seater, and are destined, in all probability, for the 11th Wing at Manises (Valencia), which has hitherto also been equipped with Mirage F-1's, but in the model in service in Spain, the F-1CE; these will go back to their original unit, the 14th Wing at Los Llanos.
