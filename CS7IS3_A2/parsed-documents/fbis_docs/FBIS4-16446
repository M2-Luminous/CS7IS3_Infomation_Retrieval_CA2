Russia's National Wealth Is Leaving for the West by Train"] [Text] The "democrats'" apocalyptic regime has scored a great number of specific achievements -- from the total collapse of industry to the mass closure of maternity homes and kindergartens as being not wanted. But one of the "victories" most worthy of this power is probably the unprecedented flowering of crime in its particularly wild manifestations. Precisely 2,799,714 registered crimes -- this is the record figure for 1993. There is also at first glance a more modest but essentially terrible figure. Last year 9,477 crimes associated with the misappropriation of raw materials and strategic materials, which are being exported on a vast scale to the West, which applauds the anti-Russian reforms, were brought to light. This is not just robbery. Having stripped the shirt off the back of the present generation of Soviet people, the pro-Western regime has organized the total robbing of our children, grandchildren, and all subsequent descendants by sending the country's natural riches abroad. The process of misappropriating strategic materials has reached such a terrifying scale that indistinct, albeit somewhat timid, grumbling has begun even in Yerin's department. Some facts and figures were divulged at a recent meeting of journalists with leaders of administrations of the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Last year the illegal export of 17,800 tonnes of metals, 97,900 tonnes of petroleum products, and 157,400 cubic meters of timber worth a total of more than 18 billion rubles was prevented. This is just the tip of the iceberg. It is difficult even to imagine what quantity of strategic materials nonetheless went to the West. Militia Major General Vyacheslav Saltaganov, chief of the Russian Federation MVD Main Administration for Economic Crimes, cited the following data. All sorts of output and strategic materials worth 10.6 billion francs arrived in France alone from CIS countries during seven months of last year. And yet this is not the country with the biggest penchant for Russian riches. There are far more greedy countries. Whose hands are plundering our country? In Saltaganov's opinion, commercial structures, primarily joint ventures, are the chief active force here. They issue orders for thefts of strategic raw materials and then resell them to nearby and distant foreign countries. "During the two years since the breakup of the USSR," Mikhail Vanin, chief of the Administration for Combatting Smuggling and Violations of Customs Regulations, said, "this problem has passed a critical point. Stable groups of smugglers, who control the process of the extraction and production of strategic materials and export them, have been formed all over the country. They have set up ramified structures in enterprises and export groups, and there are 'windows' on the borders.... "In the USSR there was a state monopoly on foreign trade," he blurted out in a temper, "and so the confusion that exists now did not exist then!" But why do the MVD and the State Customs Committee keep quiet about this and not strive for a normal state approach to protecting our national riches from plundering? Vladimir Vorozhtsov, chief of the Russian Federation MVD Public Relations Center, made things clear: "If we were to raise this question, we would at once be called antimarketeers and opponents of reforms!" Well, well! It turns out that MVD officials are perfectly well aware of who is pilfering our riches, why, and for whom. They are also aware that, within the framework of the present regime, not only is it impossible to secure a state monopoly of foreign trade, but it is also dangerous to personal well-being to speak aloud about this. It only remains to add that the "democratic" power is programmed to work for the West and in the interests of the West. While this regime lords it in Russia, the strategic plundering of Russia will only increase.
