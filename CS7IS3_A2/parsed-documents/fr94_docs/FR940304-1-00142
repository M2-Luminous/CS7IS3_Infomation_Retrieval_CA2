FR940304-1-00142 FR940304-1-00014 Rather than presenting the results for all classes of direct heating equipment in today's notice, the Department selected a class of direct heating equipment as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is presenting the results only for that class. The results for the other classes can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the representative class. The representative class for direct heating equipment is gravity wall heaters greater than 27 kBtu/hr but less than 46 kBtu/hr, which is one of the more prevalent classes of direct heating equipment. For this representative class, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by derating the burner by 20 percent, level 2 adds electronic ignition, level 3 adds a burner box damper, level 4 adds the use of an induced draft fan and electronic ignition to the baseline unit, and level 5 assumes condensation of the flue gases. Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the other classes of direct heating equipment and are found tabulated in section 1.4 of the Technical Support Document. 2. Payback Period Table 4&hyph;6 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative class of the product. For this representative class, standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year. Payback for all classes of direct heating equipment may be found in Tables 4.17 to 4.32 of the Technical Support Document. Table 4&hyph;6._ Payback Periods of Design Options for Room Heaters Over 46 kBtu/hr [In years] 1Standard level 1Payback period 1 2.3 2 6.7 3 7.5 4 15.0 5 17.6 3. Significance of Energy Savings To estimate the base case energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new direct heating equipment under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings would result for all classes of the product: Level 1_0.04 Quad Level 2_0.21 Quad Level 3_0.38 Quad Level 4_0.23 Quad Level 5_0.23 Quad The above energy savings are smaller than anticipated because the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model predicts fuel switching from gas to electricity at trial standard levels 4 and above as shown in Table 3.3 of the Technical Support Document. However, the Department finds that the increased standards at levels 1 through 4 considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy. 4. Economic Justification A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for the representative class is $8.60; to meet levels 2&hyph;5, the manufacturers' cost increases are $19.10, $51.80, $157.60, and $227.70, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 1.16.
