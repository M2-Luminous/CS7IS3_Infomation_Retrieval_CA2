The modified Murkowski Amendment adopted by the joint conference of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the U.S. on April 19, asserts that the Taiwan Relations Act takes primacy over the Sino-U.S. August 17 Joint Communique. The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said that the Murkowski Amendment, which asserts that sections 2 and 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act take primacy over statements of U.S. policy, including communiques, regulations, directives and policies based thereon, is designed, in essence, to negate the Sino-U.S. August 17 Joint Communique, undermine Sino-U.S. relations and erect obstacles to the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the Chinese people. It is absolutely unacceptable and the Chinese Government and people are firmly against it, Wu said. "We demand that the U.S. Government take this case seriously, abide by the guiding principles of the Sino-U.S. relations as set forth in their three joint communiques, live up to its promises and take effective measures immediately to keep the Sino-U.S. relations from serious harm," Wu said.
