Reports said the salary increases would cost Zimbabwean taxpayers about 217 million U.S. dollars. Low paid workers were given salary increments of 23 percent to match Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate and others were given between 10 to 23 percent. In addition, all government employees were given transport and housing allowances. A government spokesman said those working in government had been most affected by the high cost of living because their salaries and conditions of service had not matched inflation. The report said in comparison salary increases for private sector workers had been on average around 15 percent.
