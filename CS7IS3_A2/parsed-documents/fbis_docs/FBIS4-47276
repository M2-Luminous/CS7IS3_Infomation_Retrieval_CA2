Shevchenko; UDC678.621.315.772.93] [Abstract] Low melting point oligomers are used in photo-thermoplastic recording as a recording medium. An electric charge placed on a film of such material remains intact in darkness and diminishes under illumination. The remaining charge in unlit portions of the film is capable of deforming the film when heated to a temperature above the flow point, thereby forming an image. In the present work linear and radial (star-like) carbazole-containing oligomers, used as recording means for photo-thermoplastics, were synthesized. The coefficients of molecular packing of the synthesized oligomers were determined, and it was demonstrated that on transition from the linear to the radial (three and four rays) form, the coefficient of molecular packing decreases and the fraction of free space increases. This confirms the branched structure of the radial form. References 5 (Russian).
