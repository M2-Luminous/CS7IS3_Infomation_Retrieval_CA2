The threat reportedly emanates from the right-wing's militant factions which oppose AVF leaders' initiatives to participate in the elections and to continue negotiations for a "volkstaat" [homeland]. A report in a morning newspaper, THE CITIZEN, said AVF transitional president Ferdi Hartzenberg was shocked by news of the plot, and that hitherto slack security for Gen Viljoen would be improved. The AVF's transitional representative assembly on Saturday took a majority decision to reject an option to participate in the elections, secured by Gen Viljoen when he registered a Freedom Front party for such purposes. AVF Gen Tienie Groenewald said on Monday the debate on possible participation would continue as long as it was possible to keep alive Gen Viljoen's provisional registration of the party. Pointing to the considerable "no" vote in the elections, observers said the right wing could count on enough electoral support to secure a number of parliamentary seats. Serving Conservative Party MPs and liberal AVF elements may argue that those seats should be filled by AVF members -- even as a "tactical breakaway" grouping from the AVF -- rather than to let them fall to the National Party or Democratic Party. In Mmabatho on Monday, President Lucas Mangope's cabinet will decide whether to participate in the April elections. Speaking on Radio 702 on Monday, the Freedom Alliance Chairman and Bophuthatswana Minister of State Rowan Cronje declined to be drawn on the outcome of the cabinet meeting, or on what effect labour unrest in Bophuthatswana had had on the homeland government's thinking.
