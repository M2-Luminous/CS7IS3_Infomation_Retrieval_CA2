Mendiandua (PRENSA LATINA): "The Cuban Armed Forces: In Search of Capabilities for Self-Financing"] [Text] Havana -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba [FAR], considering they have already secured their main mission of guaranteeing the defense of the country's sovereignty and territory, have been working on utilizing more efficient methods to manage the economy, and the FAR has introduced multiple initiatives to create capabilities of self-financing. This is the prevailing atmosphere among the high command and mid-ranking officers who have been charged with the complex task of making affordable military activities on the island. General Leopoldo Cintras Frias, commander of the Western Army, told this reporter during a tour of regional installations the FAR leadership is demanding its officers possess four basic skills during the current economic difficulties. They must be good fighters, politicians, administrators, and farmers. The tour included visits to a chemical regiment, an artillery regiment, the San Antonio de los Banos Air Force Base, the country's most important air base, tunnels for the defense and protection of the people, and a rearguard combined forces installation, among other places. By opening certain installations that for more than three decades had been closed to civilians, the military wanted to convey several messages. One is that in case of an armed conflict, the fighters' lives and technology will be protected, made possible by the construction of high-protection tunnels spreading for kilometers in areas that are difficult to reach. There are arms and ammunition in those tunnels as well as the necessary infrastructure for production and logistical needs to facilitate indefinite periods of fighting, something we noticed in the fields of operations, as the military calls those areas. Civilians will also be safe in those tunnels, which are areas well protected against air, heavy artillery, and other forms of attacks of mass destruction. Consulted sources have reported the Cuban military has creatively resolved the challenge of training troops for combat. This training remains at a good level despite the break up of the European socialist bloc (from 1989 to 1991), a situation which produced an abrupt cut in the supply line for weapons, fuel, and spare parts, which had existed for the past three decades. From the beginning of this process, the FAR, using different types of initiatives, was able to save fuel and materiel expended in training and was able to strictly maintain its technology. There is a strategy in Cuba that guides the Armed Forces in conjunction with the situation and economic possibilities during a period of severe currency-exchange shortages. At the San Antonio de los Banos Base, for example, electronic equipment located in cabins similar to airplane cabins is used by pilots being trained to simulate, on the ground, the most complex combat situations. According to specialists, a MiG training flight costs no less than $3,000 for fuel. The electronic equipment represents a considerable saving. Another relevant aspect is the new profile assumed by the soldiers who are now engaged in agricultural works and business operations they had never touched. Each FAR unit has agricultural areas, raises livestock, and keeps poultry so that the troops have dependable supplies in peace or wartime. The efforts are producing results. The FAR covered 50 percent of its expenditures in 1993 with funds generated from their own units. The Armed Forces also work hard on the artificial breeding of fishes and industrial and artisan production, which is directed at providing shoes, clothes, and utensil supplies that were previously imported. The FAR plans to be self-sufficient in tubers, grains, fruits, vegetables, and spices in 1995 and be partially self-sufficient in fat and beef production, an objective that is both tactical and economic in nature. A special push is being given to aquaculture as a quick and economically viable way of supplying the troops with protein and securing the raw materials necessary for animal food. Military production requires sustained growth. Material encouragement is used to secure it but, rather, without disregarding moral encouragement, which traditionally has yielded good results in the Armed Forces of Cuba.
