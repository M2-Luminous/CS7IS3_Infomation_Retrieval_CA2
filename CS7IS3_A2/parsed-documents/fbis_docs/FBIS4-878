We review the reasons for this postponement with our correspondent from Hoggar. [Correspondent] We reviewed the contents of the latest talks held last night with (Abderrahmane Guella), general coordinator of the Azaouad movement. [Begin (Guella) recording] Thanks to the efforts of the mediator, we reached an agreement on holding another meeting in Algeria in the next few days. By then the [Malian] government side will have discussed the fronts' points of view and made a final decision regarding them, because the government delegation has asked for consultations with its government, and God willing, the minutes of the meeting could be signed. [end recording] [Correspondent] Talks were marked by intransigence in some positions, despite the Algerian mediator's efforts. The last phase lasted until late last night and was marked by differences in principle regarding the implementation of the agreement on integration as a main point in the final solution to the crisis. The Malian Government delegation raised several problems which its government was facing and which would not allow the total acceptance of the demands of the Azaouads regarding the number of those to be integrated in various economic, political, and military sectors. The delegation justified this by the reforms currently under way in Mali within the framework of its program with the International Monetary Fund. [passage omitted]
