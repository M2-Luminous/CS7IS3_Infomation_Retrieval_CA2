He made it clear that "in case of emergency, there are always courageous and talented people who can take on the responsibility" of heading the Finance Ministry. The head of state endorsed his minister on 24 February, a day on which financial markets were in turmoil and share prices on the stock exchange plunged as a result of insistent rumors of Cavallo's resignation and other technical reasons. Menem's comment was like an analgesic on the tense atmosphere at the stock exchange and prevented shares from plummeting further. Menem played down the importance of the decline in stock prices, stating: "This is not the first time the market has been bearish." The president, speaking on Radio America, noted: "There is invariably speculation on ways to reap greater profits. A bearish market enables those who want to buy stocks to get them cheaper." He once again remarked that the continuity of the present economic model is not tied to those in charge of implementing the economic policy. The head of state said he always keeps a name "in pectore," ready to replace each of his cabinet members if need be. Cavallo's case is no different from any other, even though he is considered to be the "almighty" person within the government. Rumors of Cavallo's resignation affected stock exchange trading on 23 February, when blue chips dropped by more than 5 percent. The economy minister has had to withstand several attacks over the last few days. San Isidro Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich, for example, accused him of "interfering" in the case of the Opalsen firm -- linked to businessman Francisco Macri -- which allegedly failed to pay duties on the importation of 15,000 cars. When Cavallo questioned several aspects of the proceedings, Judge Marquevich charged the executive branch with "meddling" in the judiciary. The spectacular operations conducted by the DGI [General Directorate of Taxation] especially among the "rich and famous" caused friction between Cavallo and his influential Public Revenues Secretary Carlos Tacchi, who is held in high respect in business circles for his struggle against tax evasion. Cavallo questioned the methodology used by DGI agents -- the director of which is Ricardo Cossio -- stating that Luis Maria Pena, the head of the fiscal auditing office, had committed "excesses" during the investigations. Cavallo subsequently supported DGI agents, but demanded that they be more restrained and observe confidentiality in their operations. Now that the alleged fraudulent importation by Sevel has been brought in the open, the protection of the Argentine car industry has also come under fire. Some economists have voiced their opposition to an indefinite continuation of this protectionist policy and found that Cavallo is willing to defend it to the bitter end. He crashed headlong into Dardo Gasparre and Miguel Angel Broda on two occasions, labelling them and other economists as "market fundamentalists." Cavallo attacked Broda by bringing to light an old incident of disloyalty within the government. He recalled that in 1991, the then Finance Secretary Saul Bouer told Broda that the government was going to pay overdue securities. The latter interpreted this as an increase in the money supply, and therefore, a form of devaluation. Bouer demanded a public apology, with which the minister complied by issuing a press communique that cleared the good reputation of the incumbent mayor. These conflicts obliged President Menem to put Cavallo in his place during a cabinet meeting. He reportedly told the minister: "In politics, peppery people lose out." All these events led people to surmise that Cavallo was going to resign, which in turn had an adverse effect on financial markets.
