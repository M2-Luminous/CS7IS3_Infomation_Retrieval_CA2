SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 2E4148 to EPA on behalf of the Agricultural Experiment Station of California. Pesticide petition 2E4148 requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of sodium chlorate on potatoes when used as a defoliant in accordance with good agricultural practices. The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include: 1. A 90-day subchronic feeding study in rats given gavage doses of 0, 10, 100, or 1,000 milligrams (mg)/kilogram(kg)/day with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 100 mg/kg. Rats given doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day showed decreased hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and red blood cell counts. 2. A subchronic study in monkeys given drinking water containing 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/liter of sodium chlorate with no adverse clinical or hematological findings reported. 3. Mutagenicity studies including gene mutation tests in Salmonella species (Ames test) and Chinese hamster lung cells, structural chromosome aberrations test in mice (a micronucleus assay for chromosome damage), and other genotoxic effects (unscheduled DNA synthesis in HeLa cells) were all negative for mutagenic effects. A DNA repair test was positive for primary DNA damage in repair-deficient bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli. 4. A developmental toxicity study in rats given gavage doses 0, 10, 100, and 1,000 mg/kg with no maternal or developmental toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The toxicology data provided are sufficient to demonstrate that there are no foreseeable human health hazards likely to arise from dietary exposure resulting from the proposed use of sodium chlorate on potatoes. The nature of the residues in plants is understood; sodium chlorate will be reduced to sodium chloride in the presence of organic material. The residues in plants will, therefore, be composed of sodium chlorate and sodium chloride. Magnitude of residue studies report no detectable residues of sodium chlorate on potatoes from the proposed use pattern. There is also no reasonable expectation of secondary residues in meat, milk, poultry, or eggs from the proposed use. No enforcement actions based on the level of residues in food are expected. Therefore, the requirement for an analytical method for enforcement purposes is not applicable to the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes that a tolerance is not needed to protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [PP 2E4148/P589]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
