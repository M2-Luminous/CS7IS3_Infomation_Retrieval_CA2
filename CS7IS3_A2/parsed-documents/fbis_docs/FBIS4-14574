Kostikov called the initiative "unexpected," although he admitted Nazarbayev could not have made his idea public at a meeting with Moscow State University students without having discussed it with the Russian president beforehand. Kostikov expressed his opinion that "Nazarbayev's idea has a geopolitical logic, but that logic is already contained in the CIS formula, so it is hardly necessary to replace one good idea with another, but there would be some sense in their mutual evolution." The presidential press secretary said that Yeltsin has taken a time-out to examine the arguments pro and contra Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative.
