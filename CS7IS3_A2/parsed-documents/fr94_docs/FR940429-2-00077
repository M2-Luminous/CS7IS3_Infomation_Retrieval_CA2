FR940429-2-00077 FR940429-2-00062 II. Jurisdiction to Consider Alleged Discrimination Against Individuals Who Did Not File a Complaint OFCCP, while arguing that it may seek individual relief even if no complaint has been filed, see OFCCP's Exceptions at 6&hyph;15, contends in the alternative that it may seek relief, during a complaint investigation, on behalf of individuals who did not file a complaint. Id. at 15&hyph;20. While both Section 503(b) of the Act and the implementing regulation, 41 CFR 60&hyph;741.26, provide that an individual may file a complaint alleging handicap discrimination, neither the Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards nor the courts has addressed whether a complaint must be filed for each individual for whom OFCCP seeks relief. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง2000e-5 (1988), which requires that a charge by filed before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can take enforcement action, it has been held that the purpose of the charge is to trigger the investigatory and conciliatory procedures of the EEOC. EEOC v. General Electric Co., 532 F.2d 359, 364 (4th Cir. 1976) (charge provides EEOC with jurisdictional springboard to investigate and investigation may disclose other illegal practices which provide basis for reasonable cause determination). In this setting it is nonsensical to require each of the plaintiffs to file individual administrative charges with EEOC, even though no class action has been filed. Allen v. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 788, 554 F.2d 876, 882&hyph;83 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 891 (1977). Similarly, under the National Labor Relations Act, the purpose of a charge is to set a Board inquiry in motion, and acts not specifically mentioned in the charge may be investigated and subject to enforcement if they are sufficiently related to the specific acts alleged. See N.L.R.B. v. Central Power & Light Co., 425 F.2d 1318, 1320 (5th Cir. 1970). Cf. United States Dept. of Labor v. Honeywell, Inc., 77&hyph;OFCCP&hyph;3, Sec'y Dec. and Order June 2, 1993, slip op. at 16 (complaint may include discrimination like or reasonably related to original charges).
