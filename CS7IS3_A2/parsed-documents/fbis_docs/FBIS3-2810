He stressed: The further reform is carried out, the more extensively the pattern of interest sharing is adjusted, and the greater the market role is, the more vigorously we should advocate ideals, discipline, unity, and attention to national interests, the more we should promote the spirit of helping each other like passengers in the same boat, taking the interest of the whole into account, and the more we should adhere to the path of working together for common prosperity. He urged Shanghai's working class and the broad mass of cadres and people to continue carrying forward their fine tradition, play an exemplary role in this regard, and make still greater contributions to reform, development, and stability in Shanghai and the whole nation. At this afternoon's group discussion, the deputies earnestly examined and discussed Premier Li Peng's "Report on the Government Work" and freely aired their views. As Zhang Zhongli and eight other deputies spoke, Jiang Zemin listened attentively and took notes. He; Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee secretary; Mayor Huang Ju; and Ye Gongqi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress; chipped in from time to time. They talked cheerfully and humorously and the meeting hall was permeated with a warm atmosphere. When he spoke, Jiang Zemin first pointed out: Taken together, the current international situation is good for China's development and the situation at home is excellent. The better the situation, the harder we should work to seize the opportunity and take advantage of it to develop our country. We must keep sober-minded and be fully aware of challenges faced by China in the international community, as well as problems that have arisen at home amid continuous progress. We should think of danger in times of peace and work even harder and more diligently. Jiang Zemin said: The basic policy for and overall task of the party's and state's work for 1994 have been adopted. Everything we do must be subject to and serve the overall task of "seizing development opportunities, deepening reforms, opening up wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability." The Central Committee has decided to make this the focus of work to achieve a sustained, rapid, and healthy growth [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. This overall task gives full expression to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas of development. We must fully understand it and implement it comprehensively in our work. The key to successfully fulfilling this overall task of the party and state is to correctly handling relations between reform, development and stability. We must, on one hand, work hard to deepen reform, open up wider, and promote economic development; on the other hand, we must pay close attention to maintaining a stable social and political environment, promote reform and development amid stability, and ensure long-term social stability through reform and development. Reform, development and stability are like three closely interrelated strategic pieces on a chess board. When all three pieces are moved with skill and coordination, the national situation as a whole will be enlivened. A wrong move by one piece will put the two other in a tight spot, causing a setback to the overall situation. Correctly handle relations among the three represents an essential leadership art in our modernization drive. Speaking on promoting agriculture and rural work, Jiang Zemin said: Years of experience has told us that to develop agriculture, there must be no wavering of the following in terms of guiding ideology and basic policy: 1) agriculture as the foundation of the national economy; 2) maintaining a steady increase in the output of major farm products such as grain, cotton, and cooking oil; 3) incremental increase in agricultural input; 4) alleviating farmers' financial burdens while increasing their incomes; 5) vigorously developing village and township enterprises, encouraging rural industries to subsidize agriculture, and creating jobs locally for the surplus rural work force; 6) the policy of stabilizing the responsibility system with the household contract linking output to payment as the main form, perfecting the system of unified management combined with independent management, developing a network of collectivized services, and continuously enhancing the economic strength of rural collectives; and 7) improving the work efficiency of village-level organizations led by village party branches. He also pointed out: Even a large industrial city like Shanghai should uphold, without wavering, the overall guiding ideology that takes agriculture as the foundation of the national economy. In addition to being self-sufficient in grain, the districts and counties in the outskirts must also do a good job in implementing the "shopping basket" project and ensuring an adequate supply of vegetables and other nonstable foodstuffs in the city. Speaking of continuing the efforts to invigorate state-owned large and medium enterprises, Jiang Zemin stressed: After decades of work, China has developed an independent state-owned industrial system that is comprehensive in scope. This is a unique advantage of the Chinese economy. Thanks to this advantage, China has been able to steer clear of many of the problems that are unavoidable in the course of the development of a developing country. Large and medium state-owned enterprises have made vital contributions to China's economic growth. They serve as the backbone of China's economy and will continue to play a leading role in expanding a socialist market economy. Therefore, no matter what difficulties we may face, we should make every effort to improve the performance of state-owned large and medium enterprises. Their economic strength can only be increased, never to be weakened, because they are the lifeblood of China's socialist economy and because they are where China's working class is concentrated. It is true that a considerable number of large and medium state-owned enterprises are beset with many difficulties and urgent problems, and it is a major task of the party, the government, and society as a whole to help them overcome their difficulties and to quickly regain their vitality. The fundamental solution is to deepen reform and unswervingly separate the functions of the government from those of the enterprise, to accelerate a change of their operational mechanism, and to build a modern enterprise system. It is imperative to push such enterprises onto the market place where they should compete with one another and seek new ways to overcome difficulties. Government at all levels must also guide them and provide them with the needed support. He pointed out: State enterprises, of different types and under different conditions, can have diversified operational approaches and varied ways to invigorate themselves; they can become very creative on their own. However, this point should be made abundantly clear: They must, all in all, preserve and increase the value of state assets. This fundamental requirement must be adhered to unswervingly. He expressed the hope that Shanghai will accumulate more valuable experience in improving the performance of large and medium state enterprises to usher in a new situation. Speaking of strengthening socialist spiritual civilization, Jiang Zemin said: The grand goal of rejuvenating China and accomplishing modernization has two aspects: a highly developed material civilization and a highly developed spiritual civilization. Socialism with Chinese characteristics calls for the development of both civilizations. By repeatedly stressing the need to persist in the principle of "giving equal emphasis on two fronts and doing well in both," Comrade Deng Xiaoping has reminded us again and again that while promoting material civilization, we must not overlook spiritual civilization. It would not be a comprehensive, correct implementation of the party's basic policy if a locality, by paying more attention to the former to the neglect of the latter over a long period, has successfully promoted the economy but has seen a decline in social conduct. The growth of social productive forces should be reflected both in the accumulation of wealth and the upgrading of the quality of workers. It will be a dangerous deviation for a country, a nation, and individuals to emphasize only the material side to the neglect of the spiritual side. The suggestion that I made at last year's NPC session that we need to promote the 64-character pioneering spirit [emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, actively explore new ways, dare to innovate, work hard, press forward in the face of difficulties, learn from foreign countries, constantly improve ourselves, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, work together as one, keep the national interest in mind, be diligent and frugal, be upright and honest, work vigorously to make the country prosperous, and serve selflessly] has received widespread support. We all hope that this kind of pioneering spirit will become the order of the day throughout the whole nation and the whole society. It is hoped that we will, as a result of the efforts in promoting spiritual civilization, bring forth in large numbers builders of socialism with Chinese characteristics who are well educated, self- disciplined, and who have lofty ideals and moral integrity. Jiang Zemin affirmed the achievements that Shanghai has made in its work and spoke of his hopes for the city. He said: In the past year, people in Shanghai have done good work under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and government; its economic growth has been rapid, and the situation is heartening. It is hoped that the broad ranks of cadres and people in Shanghai will continue to exert themselves, guard against arrogance and impatience, and create still better performance in reform and opening up. He reiterated that development of Pudong is a major policy decision of the central authorities, that the development and opening of Pudong must be carried out unswervingly, and that the central authorities' policy toward Pudong will remain unchanged. He expressed the hope that Pudong will become a real "dragon head" that will bring about economic development in the Chang Jiang Valley and that Shanghai will serve as a conduit for China's march to the world and become a veritable international economic, financial, and trade center. He also said that Shanghai's development can never be separated from the support of other parts of the country and that the latter's development also needs Shanghai's support. Shanghai's working class and people should carry forward the fine tradition of subordinating regional interests to the national interest and make continuous and fresh contributions to reform, opening up, and China's modernization drive and to the development of other parts of the country, especially the central and western regions. Vice President Rong Yiren, another NPC deputy elected from Shanghai, also spoke at the meeting. He said: China has undergone tremendous changes in the political, economic, and social sectors over the decades. The system of people's democracy is being perfected daily and the economy is growing steadily. Under this new situation, we should work with one heart and one mind and carry forward the spirit of hard work, plain living, and seeking truth from facts in order to turn China into strong, prosperous country.
