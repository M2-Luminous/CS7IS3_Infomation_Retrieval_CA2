After hearing the work briefing by responsible comrades, he noted that Shanxi must stabilize the agriculture through all possible means and promote the development of village and town enterprises as well as coal production. On 28 May, Tian Jiyun and his party came to Dazhai Village in Xiyang County. He ascended the Hutou Shan with great interest and carefully inspected the Dazhai-type fields which decorated the slopes with gullies and ridges. This is the fourth time he ascended the Hutou Shan and he asked Guo Fenglian, secretary of the Dazhai Village party branch, about the production situation in recent years. On his third visit to Dazhai in March 1992, few changes were apparent in Dazhai despite over 10 years of reform and opening up. He was discouraged to find out that Dazhai still basically relied on agriculture and the per capita income was only 600 yuan. He encouraged the Dazhai people to "emancipate their minds, renew their concepts, widen their roads, and strive for a comfortable life with concerted efforts" at that time. Two years passed, and he saw a great change in the spirit and appearance of the Dazhai people when he came here again -- Dazhai Village has taken a new step in reform and opening up and promoted its economic development to a new level; it has not only further developed agriculture, but has also built a shirt factory, a woolen sweater factory, a cement factory, and started a transportation service. Last year, the village's total income exceeded 10 million yuan for the first time; of this, non-agricultural income accounted for 93.6 percent, and per capita income reached 1,350 yuan. Tian Jiyun smiled with delight. He said: Within merely two years, the Dazhai people have paid attention to industrial and sideline production, reaped bumper grain harvests, and flourished in second and tertiary industries after ensuring grain production. This is a correct path. To construct a new Dazhai, it is necessary to adhere to the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and shift one's thinking and concepts from a planned economy to a market economy, as well as from a product economy to a commodity economy. Developing agriculture by merely concentrating on the production of one single kind of grain can only feed the people; in such a case, people will not eat well, much less become prosperous. He hoped that Dazhai, the red flag that has once been fluttering on the agricultural front of China, would make some achievements in the spring tide of the market economy and that a number of new Dazhais that integrate agriculture, industry, and trade for the overall development of agriculture, forestry, husbandry, sideline production, and fishing and that are constructed on the basis of a commodity economy would emerge in Xiyang County, Jinzhong Prefecture, and Shanxi Province. He once again encouraged the Dazhai people to "construct a socialist new Dazhai and restore their past heroic style with new ideas and concepts and on new roads and a basis. [quotation mark as received] During his visit in Shanxi, Tian Jiyun inspected the terminal of the Taiyuan Airport, which was still under construction, and the construction site for the elevated waiting-room of Taiyuan Train Station. He praised the landlocked Shanxi's method of strengthening infrastructure construction to promote opening up. After hearing the work briefings by the provincial party committee, provincial people's congress, and provincial government, Tian Jiyun noted: The idea of three foundations (agriculture as the foundation of the economy, infrastructure, and basic industries) and four emphases (coal mining, power supply, water diversion, and road maintenance) proposed by Shanxi tallies with the actual situation in Shanxi and is very correct. He hoped that Shanxi would stabilize agriculture through all possible means and develop village and town enterprises as well as coal production. When Tian Jiyun was informed that this year was Shanxi's most difficult time in coal production and other provinces had defaulted on 8 billion yuan for Shanxi's coal and freight, he said: Stabilizing coal production is as important as stabilizing agriculture for Shanxi. Only by revitalizing coal production can Shanxi revitalize the economy. Therefore, the difficulties and problems of the coal industry must be resolved through all possible means to boost coal production. Speaking on the work of the people's congresses, Tian Jiyun said: Improving legislation and ruling the country by laws are not only necessary for the practice of a socialist market economy, but also a must for ensuring the state's long-term peace and stability. Therefore, people's congresses at all levels must conscientiously do a good job in legislation and supervision over law enforcement.
