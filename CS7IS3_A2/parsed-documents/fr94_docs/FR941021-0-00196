As an alternative, a mobile earth station shall not operate during radio astronomy observations within the 1613.8&hyph;1615.8 MHz band within 100 km of the radio astronomy sites listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and within 30 km of the sites listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, there being no restriction on a mobile earth station operating within the 1615.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band. (iv) For airborne mobile earth stations operating in the 1610.0&hyph;1626.5 MHz band, the separation distance shall be the larger of the distances specified in paragraph (a)(1) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this section, as applicable, or the distance, d, as given by the formula: ␣d (km) = 4.1 square root of (h) where h is the altitude of the aircraft in meters above ground level. (v) Smaller geographic protection zones may be used in lieu of the areas specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section if agreed to by the Mobile-Satellite Service licensee and the Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Unit (ESMU), National Science Foundation, Washington, D.C. upon a showing by the Mobile-Satellite Service licensee that the operation of a mobile earth station will not cause harmful interference to a radio astronomy observatory during periods of observation. (vi) The ESMU shall notify Mobile-Satellite Service space station licensees authorized to operate mobile earth terminals in the 1610.0&hyph;1626.5 MHz band of periods of radio astronomy observations. The mobile-satellite systems shall be capable of terminating operations within the frequency bands and protection zones specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, as applicable, after the first position fix of the mobile earth terminal either prior to transmission or, based upon its location within the protection zone at the time of initial transmission of the mobile earth terminal. Once the mobile-satellite system determines that a mobile earth terminal is located within an RAS protection zone, the mobile-satellite system shall immediately initiate procedures to relocate the mobile earth terminal operations to a non-RAS frequency. (vii) A beacon-actuated protection zone may be used in lieu of fixed protection zones in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band if a coordination agreement is reached between a mobile-satellite system licensee and the ESMU on the specifics of beacon operations.
