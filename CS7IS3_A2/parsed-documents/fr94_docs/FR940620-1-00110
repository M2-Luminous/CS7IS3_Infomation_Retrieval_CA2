FR940620-1-00110 FR940620-1-00012 As originally published, the ADA Standards consisted of nine main sections and a separate appendix. Sections 1 through 3 contain general provisions and definitions. Section 4 contains scoping provisions and technical specifications applicable to all covered buildings and facilities. Sections 5 through 9 are special application sections and contain additional requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business and mercantile facilities, libraries, and transient lodging. Section 10, which established requirements for transportation facilities, was added on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2674). The appendix to the ADA Standards contains additional information to aid in understanding the technical specifications. The Department is now proposing to supplement the original ADA Standards by adding specific requirements applicable to public entities. These requirements are set out in sections 11 through 14 of the Access Board's interim guidelines, which are special application sections for facilities covered by title II. Section 11 would apply to Judicial, Legislative, and Regulatory Facilities; section 12 to Detention and Correctional Facilities; section 13 to Accessible Residential Housing subject to title II; and section 14 to Public Rights-of-Way. The Department's proposed rule would also amend certain general requirements of the ADA Standards to clarify application to facilities covered by title II. (It would, for example, clarify that the elevator exemption applies to places of public accommodation and commercial facilities, but not to facilities covered by title II.) Section 35.151 of the current regulation applies to design, construction, and alteration of facilities if the construction was commenced after the effective date of the regulation, January 26, 1992. Facilities under design for new construction on that date were governed by that section if the date that bids were invited fell after the effective date. Alterations were deemed to have commenced after January 26, 1992, if the physical alteration of the property began after that date. Paragraph (c) of ยง35.151, which provides that public entities could use either UFAS or ADAAG as the accessibility standard, would be replaced by ยง35.155, which adopts the ADA Standards ( i.e., the Access Board's ADAAG as revised in the interim rule) as the applicable standard, as of the effective date of the amendment. Consistent with federal practice under section 504, the new standard to be adopted by this proposed amendment would not be applied retroactively. Facilities that were designed, constructed, or altered in conformance with the requirements of ยง35.151 prior to the effective date of this proposed amendment would not be required to be retrofitted to conform to the new standard. Thus, newly constructed or altered facilities would continue to be covered by either UFAS or ADAAG if the construction or alteration commenced between January 26, 1992, and the effective date of the proposed amendments. Proposed ยง35.155 could create a potential conflict between the revised regulation and the existing agency regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for federally assisted programs. These section 504 regulations require that newly constructed or altered facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities and provide that facilities designed, constructed, or altered in conformance with UFAS shall be deemed to comply with that requirement. Public entities that receive federal financial assistance, therefore, would be required by this regulation to follow the ADA Standards, while, under section 504, they could also be required to follow UFAS. This overlap between the requirements of title II of the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act was one of the reasons that the current regulation allows public entities the option of using either UFAS or ADAAG. Pursuant to its authority under Executive Order 12,250 for coordination of implementation and enforcement of section 504, therefore, the Department has advised the federal agencies that have regulations implementing section 504 for their federally assisted programs that facilities designed, constructed, or altered by a public entity in conformance with the proposed ADAAG should be deemed to comply with the requirements for new construction and alterations of any regulation implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act that applies to that public entity. Private entities that receive federal financial assistance would continue to be governed by the standards in any applicable regulation implementing section 504. It is expected that, when ADA Standards proposed in this rule are finalized, the agencies with enforcement responsibilities under section 504 will amend their regulations to adopt the ADA Standards as the standard for new construction and alterations. In the interim, the agencies that enforce section 504 should not require public entities to conform to both UFAS and ADAAG. Enforcement Procedures Subpart F of the current regulation establishes administrative procedures for enforcement of title II of the ADA. Section 203 of the ADA adopts the ``remedies, procedures, and rights'' provided in section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794a, as the enforcement procedures for title II. Section 505, in turn, incorporates by reference the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to 2000d&hyph;4a). Section 204 of the ADA, which requires the Department to issue regulations to implement subtitle A of title II, requires that the regulations be consistent with the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs and activities at 28 CFR Part 41. The House Committee on Education and Labor explained that it expected the Attorney General to use the section 504 enforcement procedures as the model for title II enforcement. H.R. Rep.
