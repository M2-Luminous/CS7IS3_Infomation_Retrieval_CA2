The plan was thus fulfilled by 104.9 per cent. However, technical faults and failures resulted in 113.43 MWe undergenerated. 885.6 MWe were lost as a result of reducing capacities' output. Over the month period, 15 incidents were registered, none of which, as experts maintain, involved radiation emissions in excess of acceptable rates. The Zaporozhye NPP was the main culprit of reduced generation (a 673.6 MWe loss) with its 3d and 4th power generating units undergoing maintenance. The Khmelnitsky NPP's 1st power generating unit was undergoing repair, too, same as the Rivne nuke's 1st unit (since February). The Chernobyl NPP's 3d power generating unit was stopped on 2 April for repair, which is scheduled to last until 16 April.
