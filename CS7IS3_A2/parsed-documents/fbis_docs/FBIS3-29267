FBIS3-29267 "dreas032_d_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-032 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Feb 1994 South Korea Daily Writes on U.S.-Japan `Trade Friction' SK1602141994 SK1602141994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 16 February publishes on page 5 a 1,500-word article by reporter Yun Sun-hwan, entitled "U.S.-Japan Trade Friction and Its Affect on ROK--Yen Value Is Soaring...`A Green Signal' for ROK Export." Explaining that the skyrocketing of the value of the yen in foreign exchange markets in Tokyo and in New York is an "aftereffect" of the U.S.-Japan "trade war," the article says that the trade conflict between the two nations increases "tension" and thus people pay attention to what "aftereffects" will be brought to our country's exports to the United States and to our "overall economy." Predicting that the United States will maintain the current high-yen-value foreign exchange policy until Japan guarantees its policy to reduce its "black figures" in trade with the United States, the article says that the "high value of the yen" will likely give "benefits" to our enterprises in the export of their products to the United States. The article points out that with a high yen value, the sale of Japanese automobiles in U.S. markets has been "reduced" and taking advantage of this, the ROK automobiles are "encroaching upon" Japan's markets to "a considerable extent." When the United States actually takes "concrete trade retaliation" against Japan, exports of our "major export items" including automobiles, semiconductors and computers, to the United States are expected to "expand." The article stresses that U.S.-Japan trade conflict may also result in "great burdens" that our country can hardly endure because the United States regards the ROK as "a second Japan," and points to "differences" claimed by the United States and our country in calculating black figures in trade last year between the two countries. The article adds that our enterprises pay the "keenest attention" to whether the U.S. Trade Law Super 301, which makes "indiscriminate trade retaliation" possible, will be "revived" or not, noting that if this is revived, not only Japan but also our country will suffer "great damages." The article notes that if our country is designated as an "unfair trade state," the United States will "drastically increase" tariffs on automobiles and other items manufactured by our country and, thus, will take "retaliatory action" as freely as it wants. The article notes that major domestic business groups and relevant organizations began to analyze the "effects" resulting from U.S. "sanctions" against Japan and from the "skyrocketing yen value" to our "export front," believing that the U.S. trade retaliation against Japan is "imminent."
