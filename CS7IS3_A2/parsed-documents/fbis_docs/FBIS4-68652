Political scientists from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus laid out their vision of reintegration as a global problem for the countries of the former USSR. Mikhail Gorbachev himself led the seminar. Aleksandr Tsipko, Igor Klyamkin, Mikhail Malyutin, Dmitriy Olshanskiy, and others took part in the discussion. The concept "reintegration," as the next political craze, needs interpretation. What is this--a new mythologem that is being inculcated in the mass conscience by the very same groups that were inculcating the idea of sovereignization three to five years ago?. Their aim, moreover, remains what it was before--holding or seizing power. Or is this a real possibility of revival? And, if revival, then of what kind of a state or what kind of a community? And are the costs bearable? Or, perhaps, integration is one and the other, simply at different levels? The seminar was quicker to raise questions than to answer them. Why did the republics--the inheritors of the Soviet Union--not move ahead very far in the sphere of economic reforms? But then "attribution" eclipses all other aspects of their state construction. The initial cause of such a state of affairs, analysts believe, is that independence to many of the republican leaders was by no means happy or desirable news about liberation, but rather a notice that is delivered to an addressee regardless of his own wishes. And they were compelled to "simulate" state construction. That is, sovereignization is first and foremost a product and the next stage of disintegration of the Union. And not the opposite, as we got accustomed to thinking. Mikhail Malyutin expressed this figuratively: "A knock on the door. Who is there? It is I, independence. Summary: We are not to blame, it came by itself." Thus, it (independence) found them (the republics) unprepared. In a certain sense, some of them were ready "morally," but no one was prepared "physically." Three years have not added much orderliness and reasons for their existence. Judging by the accounts of Ukrainian and Belarusian political scientists, life in the sovereign states is "apocalypse today." Thus, the population of Ukraine is convinced that its politico-economic situation is determined first and foremost by the mafia, and only after this by the president and Council of Ministers. But one-third of the population of Belarus thinks that their state is not independent, and another third leans toward such an opinion. And Russia is no exception in the parade of "broken off sovereign pieces," but simply the largest body with its own specific character. If the new states have been suffering up until now "with a childhood illness of statehood," then Russia, in the opinion of political scientists, has once again gotten sick with "imperialist tendencies" as a specific Russian form of capitulation to the difficulties of state construction. However, does this mean that the results of the three-year experiment was only a realization of the impossibility of forming "sovereign" national self-identifications--be it Russian, Ukrainian, or Belarusian? All agreed on one thing: Reintegration is not only necessary, but it is also inevitable. But whether it should be started immediately, while institutions have still been retained that facilitate joining, or in two or three years, when all of the centripetal tendencies reach their very logical end--this served as a subject for discussion. The scheme for integration was considered. Some of the seminar participants expressed points of view that were not trivial, that succeeding unions in the post-Soviet space will be concluded not on principles that are traditional (within the spirit and framework of the USSR), and even not according to principles that are exotic (Pan-Slavic, Romantic, Pan-Turkic). But, for example, on the international principles of a "technological chain." As Dmitriy Olshanskiy noted, if the Dniester Region has sales markets and other economic interests in the "Siberian Agreement," this can be enough of a reason for the conclusion of an economic union. However, statehood under conditions of such geopolitical promiscuity will inevitably begin to melt and will lead to the appearance of a number of "vague" state formations. However, this is only one of the possibilities of the self-development of the post-Soviet space. There is no end to configurations of separate elements that mutually attract and mutually repel each other. The necessary element of reintegration is its components. All of the speakers noted that the left-wingers and the big power supporters in the former Slavic republics of the USSR are calling the loudest for a necessary speedy reunification--each on the strength of his own ideology. However, the real executor, as always, will be the "party in power." A very skeptical interpretation is possible: There was a time when the newly-fledged bankers created their own first capital on the breakup of the USSR, and now those are longing for power who intend to make capital on reintegration. It may be that these are one and the same people. A pessimistic interpretation is possible: The new rulers aptly wrote off their shortcomings to the difficulties of economic reforms, and now a wonderful opportunity has appeared to justify their mistakes, because of the burdens of reintegration. The list of interpretations is open. The myth about the reunification of the peoples is taking on eschatological features.
