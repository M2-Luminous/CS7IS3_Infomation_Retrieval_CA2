All the same, reasonable forces on both sides have come to prevail. Sharp confrontation has been replaced by a mutual striving to reach compromise. Already this approach has succeeded in achieving the first positive results. Therefore, the statement of Yu. Meshkov made before numerous journalists, foreign journalists among them, to the effect that he will do business with the Majlis only in the event of "its legalization and registration as a sociopolitical organization" has evoked entirely understandable alarm, and not only among the Crimean Tatars. Here is how Majlis leaders Mustafa Jemilev and Refat Chubarov have responded to these statements. Mustafa Jemilev--We have already declared in an adopted resolution that the Majlis does not recognize the presidential authority of a person whose policies are directed towards denial of the fundamental rights of the Crimean Tatar people with respect to self-determination. Judging from his program declarations and statements before journalists, Yu. Meshkov, just now elected president, does not intend to observe our sovereign rights. Crimean Tatars therefore do not acknowledge him as the president. This in no way means, however, that we will oppose all his directives and measures. On the contrary. If the actions of the president are directed towards restoration of the rights of a deported people, we will only welcome this and support it. The Majlis will convene 19 February. Over this period of time, new events will obviously take place which will more precisely define Yu. Meshkov's position. We will then adopt a special declaration on the matter of the presidency and on the president personally. Refat Chubarov--Yu. Meshkov knows full well that the Kurultay [Congress] and Majlis elected by it have never claimed any kind of special status in the Crimea. The Kurultay is the highest spokesman of the will and interests of the Crimean Tatar people, and the Majlis is its highest representational organ. We have never had, and do not now have any aspirations of considering ourselves a parallel structure of authority, as Yu. Meshkov has stated. During his tenure as Supreme Council deputy he had the opportunity to examine all of this. The fact that he is making such statements all the same is astonishing to us.
