FBIS4-43105 "drweu113_q_94013" FBIS-WEU-94-113 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Turkey PKK Vows Retaliation PKK Vows Retaliation NC1206104894 Istanbul OZGUR ULKE in Turkish 7 Jun 94 p 8 NC1206104894 Istanbul OZGUR ULKE Turkish BFN [Text] Cologne -- ERNK's [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan] European Mission issued a statement in which it indicated that despite the PKK's [Workers Party of Kurdistan] capabilities it has so far not resorted to assassinations but from now on it will not be a mere spectator to developments, and said: "The businessmen, parliamentarians, policemen, officers, mayors, circles helping the state and their kin will definitely be targets from now on." ERNK's European Mission issued a statement in connection with the murders of Kurdish businessmen Savas Buldan and his friends, and Muhsin Melik, a leading HADEP [People's Democracy Party] official. Indicating that the state is murdering the Kurdish patriots because it is helpless in the face of the Kurdish national liberation struggle, the statement said: "Following Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's statement that `I have a list of those helping the PKK,' the counter-guerrilla group, which runs the state, stepped up its sinister operations, which can be described as the massacre of civilians. As indicated by the incident involving Serif Avsar in the past, the president [Suleyman Demirel] is directly involved in these murders." Stressing that the press is making enormous efforts to distort the causes of these murders, the statement said: "For the sake of the credits they obtain [from the state], the Turkish press and television, primarily HURRIYET and MILLIYET, have assumed the ignoble duty of covering up the murders of civilians by knowingly lying." Indicating that in the murder of Muhsin Melik and Savas Buldan and of others before them, one should discern the policy of genocide being pursued by the Turkish Government against the Kurdish nation, the statement said: "After this developments, the Kurdish people and its vanguards have acquired the right to retaliate in kind." Indicating that despite its capabilities the PKK has not resorted to assassinations so far, the statement said: "Despite its capabilities, the PKK has tried to act with sensitivity and responsibility on this issue. However, at this stage it can no longer remain a mere spectator to this state terrorism against our people. Therefore, it is resolved to demand an accounting for the murdered Kurdish patriots. Similarly, our people should use their right of self-defense. If the state is massacring us in Kurdistan, then we must retaliate in kind in the cities. Businessmen, parliamentarians and their kin, policemen and officers and their kin, circles helping the state and their kin will henceforth definitely become targets. Similarly, mayors and their kin, and those who are hostile to the national liberation struggle will also become targets."
