In a speech to a gathering of 1,000 leading Japanese businessmen, Zhu warned that China's economic development would lag much behind and the nation would miss a chance to modernize itself if the reform efforts failed. China made "brilliant achievements" in its economic reform and modernization program during 1993, which saw a growth of 13 percent in its gross national product (GNP) after a continuously speedy rise for more than 10 years, he said. The GNP in 1993 trippled that in 1978 when China began to pursue its policy of opening up, Zhu said in his speech entitled "China's Reform and Development in 1994." During the last 15 years, China has achieved great progress in carrying out reform and developing the economy. "We have successfully avoided radical ups and downs and maintained social and political stability while great changes have taken place in the country's economic system and social structure," Zhu said. He dispelled concerns that China's economy would overheat and the current development speed would not last long. While admitting some overheating symptoms caused by derailed stock deals, real estate speculation and an overabundance of investment projects during the first half of last year, Zhu stressed that the Chinese Government had taken effective macro-economic control measures since last June to maintain a sustained, speedy and healthy development of the national economy. "The trend of a possible economic overheating has been now brought under control, the monetary supply order and the circulation order have been improved, and some exciting achievements have been achieved," he said. He dismissed overseas reports that China's credit policy had failed and explained that the government's decision to tighten credit made last year was designed to orient investment to the needs of key state construction projects. "In short, we took macro-economic control measures in accordance with the reality of the Chinese economy. This is in keeping with the laws of market economy as well as the actual situation in China," he said. One of the successes in macro management, he said, was a rise in the country's foreign currency reserves last year despite the registration of a 10-billion U.S. dollar trade deficit. Zhu told the gathering that this year was a crucial stage for China in transforming the economic system while keeping the current development momentum. To this end, the Chinese Government launched complex reforms at the beginning of this year on finance, taxation, monetary supply, exchange rates and state enterprises and has been implementing them smoothly since then. Zhu, however, pointed to some problems that could undermine the reform efforts if not solved. He cited last November's steep rise in grain prices, and panic buying of electronic appliances triggered by misunderstanding of the reform bills and fears of a possible rekindling of the high inflation that prevailed in 1988 and 1989. "The price turbulence signaled clearly that we still need to keep vigilance on the economic situation, for reform embraces risks," he said. Dismissing arguments that it is immature to proceed with all-round reforms at this moment, Zhu said, "I believe it is the very right time to completely push forward the drive." The vice-premier explained that this was because the government's reform policy was deeply rooted within the hearts of the Chinese people. Secondly, he said, the government had accumulated experiences on reform over the past 15 years and had already mapped out a blueprint and an action program on reform for the next few years in line with a consensus arrived at among Chinese leaders. Thirdly, the rapid economic development and the resulting improvements in the living standard had enabled the Chinese people to bear, both economically and psychologically, possible pain brought about by reform, he said. "If we fail to overcome difficulties in the economic restructuring in the next few years and well solve all kinds of problems that will crop up on way of development, we might delay the proceeding of the modernization of our nation and miss a historical opportunity of enlivening the nation and making the state powerful," he said. He said he was confident that China would manage to tide over the hardship in the years to come. He predicted that China would establish a socialist market economy by the end of 1996. The Chinese reform, which he called "a great, new century-oriented reform project," would promote the economic prosperity and social stability not only in China, but also in East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region, he said. The prospect for China's economic growth would remain bright because the Chinese Government would never weaken its determination to build up the nation and improve the living standard of the people, Zhu said in conclusion.
