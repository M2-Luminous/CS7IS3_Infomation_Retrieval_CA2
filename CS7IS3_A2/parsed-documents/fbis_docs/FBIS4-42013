In terms of significance, it occupies third place in the structure of the United Nations after the General Assembly and the Security Council. Ukraine is a member of the UN Economic and Social Council and participates in all its sessions. "This time, our delegation must raise, first and foremost, the questions of social and economic development of the Ukrainian state, the course of reforms, and the assistance to these processes on the part of the United Nations," said First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mykola Makarevych. "Besides, we must also draw the attention of the world community to two problems that are important and painful for us -- the presently effective UN sanctions against the former Yugoslavia and the size of Ukraine's monetary contribution to the United Nations. We will again insist that it is primarily the civilian population that suffers from the sanctions. That is why we attach great importance to either canceling the sanctions or minimizing them. Regarding contributions, very complicated work is envisioned. We are not only indebted to the United Nations, but also to other international organizations. Even though the percentage is, in fact, exceedingly high for Ukraine, the money must be paid. In this direction, we will continue to elaborate a mechanism enabling us to correctly calculate the size of our contributions and submit the relevant information to the United Nations."
