FR940106-0-00087 FR940106-0-00021 [T]he facility is required to provide notice of filing of an attestation to various labor representatives or to post a notice in a conspicuous location. The Committee believes that notice of filing is an important element of the new procedure, particularly in view of the fact that this is one of two mechanisms available for U.S. nurses to monitor the admission of foreign nurses and its possible effect on their employment situation. [H.R. Rep. No. 101&hyph;288, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1989).] The Department believes that the notice requirements are consistent with the intent of Congress that all aspects of the process should be open to public review. Additionally, this approach is necessary to facilitate the complaint and investigative process that is called for in the INA. 7. Waiver Provisions The Department received numerous comments critical of the interim final rule's provisions concerning waivers of certain attestation elements. Such waivers may be requested by facilities which are not themselves employers of H&hyph;1A nurses, but which use H&hyph;1A nurses employed by contractors. Three labor organizations opposed the interim final rule's waiver provisions. One of these organizations expressed opposition to allowing any waivers, while another commented that the provisions go beyond the statute and allow for circumvention of legislative intent. One Member of Congress commented that waivers for temporary emergency situations should be very narrow and for a short period of time. One attorney commented that the waiver provisions should be expanded so that facilities only using H&hyph;1A nurses employed by contractors would not be required to file an attestation. Such a broad waiver would go beyond the scope of the statute. The Secretary only has the discretion to waive attestations for worksites using nonimmigrant nurses employed by contractors ``to avoid duplicate attestations in cases of temporary circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good cause.'' Section 212(m)(2)(A) of the INA as amended by section 162(f)(2)(B)(iii) of IMMACT. The Department has carefully considered the comments concerning the waiver provisions set forth in the interim final rule. With the above one exception, none of the commenters made any specific recommendations for revisions to these provisions which would address the concerns raised. No need or basis for revisions are indicated by the Department's operational experience, the Department has received very few requests for waivers during the 2 years the program has been in operation. Therefore, for the above reasons, no changes have been made to this section in the final rule. 8. Nursing Contractors An attorney organization commented that contractors should not be required to comply with each attestation element. The commenter suggested that, at most, they should be required to attest that their employees will be paid at a rate equal to the rate for nurses similarly employed by the facility where they are placed. The Department does not have the authority to make such a change. Amendments to the INA by IMMACT require that both the contractor and the worksite facility (other than private households) file attestations. These amendments grant the Secretary discretion to determine the requirements of the attestation filed by the worksite facility, but they do not grant the Department the authority to waive any attestation elements for contractors. To the contrary, IMMACT amended the INA to make clear that, where nursing contractors are involved, both the contractor and the worksite facility (other than private households) must file attestations.
