"The unfriendly and uncooperative move by the British side will certainly effect normal trade," Wu said referring to Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's proposals for democratic reform in the British territory prior to its reversion to China in 1997. Two-way trade between China and Britain actually surged 86 percent last year to 3.59 billion dollars and Wu said China would be unhappy to see the deterioration of a trading partnership with such potential. However, she put the blame for the ongoing dispute squarely at Britain's door, saying: "It is not the responsibility of the Chinese side."
