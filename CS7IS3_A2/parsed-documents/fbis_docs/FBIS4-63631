Andrey Kokoshin, first deputy defense minister, told SEGODNYA that according to the Defense Ministry's military-technical policy approved by the president and the Russian Federation Security Council, a special program has been worked out for this purpose. It is aimed first of all "at developing smart weapons and means of protection from them and also at achieving a high level of efficiency of a relatively small, but formidable army," Andrey Kokoshin said. To this end, a working group at the Defense Ministry's Military-Technical Policy Council has been set up. However, according to the working group experts, "its implementation is under threat because of the drastic deterioration of the situation with defense spending."
