He has written the last letter to Ghulam Nabi Fai, the president of the Kashmiri American Council who supports terrorists in Kashmir. This letter is addressed to Gary Condit in response to a letter written by 15 U.S. lawmakers. In this letter he had agreed with the concern expressed by these legislators about Punjab and had supported a resolution of the Punjab problem in which the human rights of the Sikhs are protected. When the letter from Clinton to Ghulam Nabi Fai was shared, the U.S. administration had tried to clarify that there has been no change in the U.S. stand and it was not necessary to dwell too much on the letter written to Ghulam Nabi Fai. It was said that this letter was just a formality and not a specifically written letter. However, the recent letter about Punjab does not leave any room for reassurance about Bill Clinton's designs. Thus, the Indian Government had no alternative but to take these negative signs coming from the United States of America seriously. It is imperative that it mobilize its ambassador in the United States to object to the U.S. stand and state that such actions will adversely effect U.S.-India relations. However, doing this will not be enough. This is not the first time that Bill Clinton and his government have shown such an aggressive attitude toward India. We have already seen U.S. actions such as laws relating to intellectual property and the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. This U.S. policy is pushing India toward the wall using the so-called human rights issue which the United States is using in the context of Kashmir and Punjab. The fear that a democratic president, once elected, would increase pressure on India was expressed in the circles that sympathize with India before the presidential elections in the United States. This fear was based on the fact that democratic presidents are very active on human rights and the NPT, and the anti-India lobbies have been very active over these two issues for some time. At the same time, it is believed that the United States will impose its economic policies very aggressively in order to fight the economic recession at home. In this context, it will exert a lot of pressure over the laws relating to intellectual property. Keeping in mind these old fears, the anti-India attitude of the U.S. President and his administration was not taken seriously. However, the attitude of Bill Clinton and his administration cannot be ignored as the expected attitude of a Democrat President. Another reason is that the United States is now ignoring all the Pakistani activities to encourage terrorists in India. Second, Bill Clinton's attitude about Kashmir and Punjab is also directly encouraging the terrorists in Kashmir and Punjab. Obviously, Bill Clinton cannot be unaware of the results of his actions. We have to conclude that the United States is deliberately increasing pressure on India and trying to weaken it. In this situation, India cannot be satisfied just be registering its objection at diplomatic level. It must see and understand how it can counter this anti-Indian attitude of the United States. *
