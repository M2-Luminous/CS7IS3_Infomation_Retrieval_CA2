The letter says, however, that the memorandum on civil peace between the main political forces should be amended. It should include a mechanism for ensuring all the signatories abide by it. The adoption of a law banning fascism and extremism by the Federal Assembly might provide such a guarantee. The Democratic Russia movement also insists that representatives of political forces which violate Russian laws, provoke mass disturbances, instigate national enmity and advocate war and violence, should not be allowed to sign this memorandum.
