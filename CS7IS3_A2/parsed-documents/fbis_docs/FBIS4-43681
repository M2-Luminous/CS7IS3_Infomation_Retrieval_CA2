Corresponding proposals by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] would water down the current division of tasks, FDP Secretary General Hoyer told journalists in Bonn today. It is necessary to fill the 30,000 vacant positions among the police and not opt for "superficial solutions that might turn out to be dangerous." After a meeting of the FDP Presidium, Hoyer stressed that the Liberals are against a "spare-time police," as suggested by Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (CDU). The current division of the monopoly of power must be maintained, according to which internal threats must be fought by the police and external threats by the Bundeswehr. "Internal security is too important. Thus, the citizens must not be put off with makeshift solutions," Hoyer pointed out.
