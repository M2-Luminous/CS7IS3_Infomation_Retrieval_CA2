But apparently both the sellers and the buyers doubt the positive impact of this plan; and the question is why? The initial impression was that at least the buyers would have welcomed this plan, which would at least clear up matters. But this is not what happened. The sellers also have their specific reasons for considering this plan impractical and temporary. In order to explain these stances, we should consider the psychology of Iranian society. This society has learned that there is no stability in decision-makings and that such acts are more of a propaganda nature rather than facts. Therefore, both the buyers and the sellers consider this plan to be temporary; and if the government makes them observe the tagging of goods, both sides will continue to be careless. Moreover, the pricing policy and tagging is facing a more serious problem. Prices cannot be kept low artificially. An economy based on a free market follows specific laws. Profit is the main factor in the market and something which cannot tolerate any laws or limitations. And each time the government exerts pressures from the outside, goods are very easily moved underground and under-the-table deals are made. And this situation, which is known as black marketeering, will thrive in Iran. It is surprising how this policy has been tested so many times and proven to be insufficient, yet it is not given up. Iran's business economy is not in a situation where it can be controlled. Part of the well-off society in Iran wants to show off. The purchasing power of these so-called nouveaux-riches is so high that the black market business cannot fail to thrive. It is not a secret to anyone that there is a shortage of goods in many fields. Therefore, the more goods that are taken underground, the higher their prices and the demand for them will be. In such a situation how can one hope that the pricing plan and the tagging of goods will be successful? The fact that the existing high prices of goods and services have roots that go deeper than mere profiteering should not be ignored. The production of many goods is not as high as demand, and imports are facing many fluctuations because of the great problems with foreign exchange. It is because of this that fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates immediately affect prices. If we consider that the tagging of goods as the government intends will work, each salesman will have to sit down and watch how the dollar rate is fluctuating. Is this really possible?! It is quite doubtful. As long as the necessary balance between production and consumption or between the shortage of goods and imports is absent, no pricing policy will help to stabilize prices. We have experienced this several times in the past. This time too, we are experimenting with this unsuccessful experience. The very fact that both the buyers and the sellers have not taken this plan seriously automatically shows that there is lack of confidence in it. And since this is the case, it is surprising that a pricing policy which both sides looked on with mistrust has been adopted. We think that this policy does not conform with the true economic conditions in the country and is nothing more than a temporary measure. But if it turn out the opposite, then we should say that something is very wrong in society, and this will be an exception that cannot be explained by any economic criterion. At any rate, these comments should not be interpreted as a saying that pricing is completely useless. The issue is one of economic realities, in which pricing is one of the various outcomes of production and is completely different from political decision- making.
