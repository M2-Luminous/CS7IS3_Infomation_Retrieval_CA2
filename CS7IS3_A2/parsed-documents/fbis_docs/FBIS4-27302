This is stressed by Dr. Kim Chol in an article contributed to NODONG SINMUN today. The article says the great leader in the work comprehensively expounded theoretical and practical questions in successfully switching cooperative ownership over to all-people ownership. The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying: "Cooperative ownership should be switched over to all-people ownership with success by consolidating and developing the agricultural cooperative economy." The great leader said the switchover must be carried out gradually, depending on the maturity of all the conditions and possibilities. The fundamental prerequisite for the switchover is to raise the level of ideological consciousness of the cooperative farmers and consolidate the material and technical foundations of the cooperative economy. What is important here is to educate the cooperative farmers ideologically and train them into revolutionaries and assimilate them to the working class. We can say the important conditions for the switchover are matured only when the level of ideological consciousness of the farmers is raised and they give full play to high patriotic enthusiasm and devotion in socialist rural construction, deeply conscious that the interests of society and collective include their private interests and the prosperity and development of the socialist motherland and the socialist countryside are essential for their worthy life and happiness. We can say the solid material and technical foundations for the switchover are laid only when the distinctions between industrial and agricultural labour are gradually eliminated and the efficiency of agricultural labour is decisively enhanced through the industrialisation and modernisation of agriculture and the improvement of the farming methods and the cultivation system. By indicating in the work the fundamental prerequisite for the switchover, the great leader provided a guideline for successfully solving this matter without the slightest deviation and turns and twists. The work says the switchover of cooperative ownership to all-people ownership must be done with the county as a unit. The county is the base linking the towns with the countryside in all spheres of politics, the economy and culture and serves as the basic unit for the direct guidance and management of the rural economy. Since a well-organised agricultural guidance and management system has been established with the county as a unit in our country, the most reasonable form and method is to convert cooperative farms in the county into state farms under all-people ownership and let the county undertake their unified guidance and management.
