Relevant observers believe that this is further proof that investors throughout the world are optimistic about the China market, and about the strongly emerging Chinese economy. Jin Renqing [6855 0086 1987], Vice Minister of Finance, who came to New York from Beijing especially to attend the issuance, said that this "is the largest quantity of bonds issued by the Chinese Government in international capital markets to date. They were sold separately and simultaneously in Asian, European, and U.S. capital markets, with trading carried out over a 24 hour period." In his introduction, Jin Renqing stated that the U.S. dollars amassed through the issue of these global bonds by the Finance Ministry as China's representative would be used to develop such fundamental facilities as transportation, energy, and telecommunications, etc., to ensure that China's economic development would have more staying power. Meanwhile, through issuing bonds, it was also letting world investors learn more about China, provide international investors with investment opportunities, and associate the Chinese economy more closely with that of the world. Specialists believe that the successful issuance of $1 billion in global bonds proves that international investors have great interest in China's economic development and investing in China, and that they are fully confident of China's future. The principal executive bank for the bond issuance is the well-known U.S. Merrill Lynch Securities Corporation. On the afternoon of the 3d, officials of China's Ministry of Finance and Merrill Lunch's people in charge of this business held a press conference in Merrill Lynch's New York headquarters. At the press conference, Merrill Lynch International's Chairman of the Board Winthrop Smith said that investors showed very strong interest in China's bonds, and he hoped by this cooperation to introduce more investment opportunities to the world, and bring closer the relationship between China's economy and world investment markets. Merrill Lynch Corporation announced that although the final figures were not in from the sole marketing group, 60 percent of the bonds the corporation was in charge of selling had been sold in the United States, 20 percent had been sold in Europe, and the remaining 20 percent in Asia. It has been reported that at the end of 1992, China had a total of $69.3 billion in foreign debts. Therefore, a correspondent asked whether rapid economic development and the arrival of a great deal of capital could possibly create such problems as inflation and an increasing burden of payments. Jin Renqing replied that the capital collected in this bonds issuance would be uses to develop construction of fundamental facilities and resolve "bottlenecks" that are hindering economic development. So, issuing bonds will spur economic development but not cause inflation. According to international regulation, in general, a country's debt payment rate should be 20 percent, but China has kept this strictly within 15 percent, and the practical rate of payment is only 7.3 percent. Therefore, Jin Renqing stressed that it was absolutely no problem with China's debt payment ability. Jin Renqing pointed out that the objectives of this bond issuance were: one, to amass capital for fundamental construction at lowest possible cost by taking advantage of the favorable opportunity presented by lower costs in the current international capital market; two, to publicize to the world by means of the world capital market China's achievements by reform and opening; and three, to set a standard line for Chinese financial organs going into the world's capital markets, especially the U.S. market. On 4 February, Jin Renqing, as the representative Chinese authority, officially signed the sales agreement with Merrill Lynch Corporation for issuing $1 billion in global bonds in the international capital market. The interest rate of the bonds is 6.5 percent yearly, with expiration in ten years. China has been preparing for this successful issue for nearly one year. Last year, the Ministry of Finance invited the well-known U.S. Rating Corporation to rate China's authorized foreign debt credit, and the results showed that China had a very good reputation. Moody's Investor Service of the U.S. raised Chinese authorized foreign credit rating from the Baa1 level to the A3 level, while Feiji //phonetic// Corporation has rated China's authorized foreign debt credit as A-. All these paved the way for Chinese bonds to enter the European, Asian, and global market. In addition, before issuing the bonds, the Ministry of Finance organized delegations to the international financial markets of Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Zurich, Frankfort, London, Chicago and New York to carry out publicity activities and answer questions related to China's economy, politics, and international relations. This also had a definite effect on this successful bond issuance. Before issuing the bonds, the Ministry of Finance had at one time or another issued in the European market Japanese Yen bonds worth 30 billion Japanese Yen, and had issued $300 million in "dragon debts" in the Asian-Pacific region, and all were successful. Relevant persons expressed the view that China would in the future continue to vigorously and cautiously collect capital throughout the world in accordance with the demands of its economic development and construction and the conditions of international capital markets.
