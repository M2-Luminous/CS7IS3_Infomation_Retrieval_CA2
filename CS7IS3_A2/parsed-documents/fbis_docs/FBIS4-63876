"Apparently, this is connected with the fact that the U.S. side is not aware yet about main parameters of our proposals to this effect which will be submitted to the acting U.N. secretary general on Wednesday," Grachev said During Grachev's talks with Perry which continued over an hour the sides discussed problems of bilateral cooperation, Grachev said. "Our cooperation is growing stronger day-by-day and we are reaching a greater degree of mutual understanding," Grachev said. Grachev felt at ease in the U.N. Headquarters. He arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule, wearing an elegant dark-blue suit, while Perry was about six minutes late. However, this did not affect the constructive atmosphere of the talks and was fully compensated by a continuous discussion. Grachev confirmed that Russia makes no conditions concerning its participation in the Partnership for Peace programme. "We have a broader vision of cooperation and interaction with NATO than other countries. We suggest such directions for partnership which are characteristic only of Russia and some other NATO member-states. For instance, this concerns nuclear weapons and nuclear control, non-proliferation, reduction and elimination of nuclear arsenals and the transfer of such weapons along the Russian territory," Grachev said. Parameters for interaction with NATO suggested by Russia today will be used as a basis for a document suggested to be prepared. The document can be drawn either in the form of a protocol of intentions, an agreement or a programme, which does not matter," Grachev said. " The most important thing is that apart from other relations of partnership, suggested to all countries, Russia offers additional proposals which are not characteristic of other states. Russia does not intend to impose anything on anyone and look for its own "warm place" in the system of partnership, Grachev said. Perry described Grachev's speech outlining the new Russian military doctrine as a historic event of great importance. He pointed out that the United States welcomed Russia's readiness to join the Partnership for Peace programme without amy preliminary conditions. He pointed out that during the talks the two sides discussed problems pertaining to holding joint military exercises on the Russian territory. Considerable attention was paid to cooperation in the field of nuclear non-proliferation, and in particular, to North Korea's nuclear problem and bilateral efforts made by the Russian Federation and the United States for the Bosnian settlement. After the fifth consecutive meeting between the Russian and the U.S. ministers the two sides are working in the atmosphere of more close contacts, resolving problems of ensuring security in different regions of the world, the U.S. defense secretary said.
