Following this, it is planning to deploy Patriot missiles to U.S. forces in the ROK and to replace U.S. Cobra helicopters with ultramodern Apache helicopters. The United States also plans to send an aircraft carrier in case of an emergency. Thus, the sense of crisis on the Korean peninsula has recently been remarkably heightened in Washington. As the United States and North Korea reached a basic agreement at the end of last year on the solution of the nuclear problem, the people believed that the crisis situation regarding the North Korean nuclear issue was moving toward pacification. The toughening of U.S. military measures have caused the people to worry that the North Korean nuclear issue will not be solved peacefully and U.S. military pressure will make the North Korean attitude even tougher, thus leading the situation to a catastrophe [paguk]. As we anticipated, North Korea on 28 January denounced the projected deployment of Patriot missiles in the ROK as an "intolerable grave military challenge," and demanded immediate cancellation of the plan. There are many varied reasons for intensified U.S. military measures, including the plan to deploy Patriot missiles. One is that the measures are intended to cope with an "unpredictable reaction" by the North Korean side in the event the UN Security Council imposes economic and military sanctions if nuclear inspection negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency are ruptured. Another is that the measures are aimed at pushing for nuclear inspection negotiations by pressing North Korea. At this point, the people express worry about our government's attitude. When North Korea announced a statement of denunciation on 28 January, the government expressed concern to the U.S. Government about the atmosphere prevailing in Washington that tensions are heightened on the Korean peninsula. The government authorities said that "the deployment of Patriot missiles is still in the review stage after the commander of U.S. Forces in the ROK made the request to President Clinton late last year in order to supplement conventional fire power. The plan to introduce Apache helicopters was decided on a few years ago and will now be implemented." Thus, they explained that the measures were not taken to counter movement of the North Korean Army. The U.S. defense authorities also stated that the current measures have nothing to do with specific deployment of North Korean troops. Then, we cannot but have a few questions. Why are the deployment of Patriot missiles, Apache helicopters, and an aircraft carrier being raised intensively at this very moment if it is true the North Korean Army is not making any abnormal moves? It was learned that Patriot missiles will be deployed to U.S. military bases in Pusan, Taegu, and Kunsan in consideration of the functions and firing range of North Korean missiles Nodong No. 1 and 2. Thus, it is noted that the Patriot missiles are not for the defense of the capital. The United States insists that as long as North Korea does not fire Nodong No.1 and No.2 missiles at South Korea, the Patriot missiles deployed to the U.S. Army will be for defense purposes. What is an issue is that a U.S. Defense Department spokesman openly stated that "it is the intent of the U.S. Government to willingly sell Patriot missiles to the ROK." People pointed out that the Patriot missiles are not adequate for Korea in view of its mountainous terrain and that strong suspicions have been presented concerning its accuracy. We will have to bear great burdens if the United States turns over Patriot missiles and ultramodern helicopters to the ROK in the future. Generally speaking, the strengthening of U.S. military measures against North Korea is not agreeable. In addition, our government's attitude of appearing to be controlled by the United States is deplorable. The government should take a firm, independent approach as the issue of peace on the Korean peninsula is ultimately related to the destiny of our nation.
