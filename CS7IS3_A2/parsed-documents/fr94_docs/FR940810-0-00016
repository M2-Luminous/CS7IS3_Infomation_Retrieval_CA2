FR940810-0-00016 FR940810-0-00007 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;75] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Eastport, ME AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Eastport, ME. This action is a result of a review of standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP's) for Eastport Municipal Airport, which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators who will be executing the SIAP's. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles M. Taylor, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, ANE&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7532; fax (617) 238&hyph;7560. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 11, 1994, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Eastport, ME (59 FR 11563). The proposal was prompted by a review of proposed standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP's) for Eastport Municipal Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal of the FAA. No comments on the proposal were received. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace establishment listed in this document will be published in the Order. The Rule This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes the Class E airspace at Eastport, ME. This action is a result of a review of proposed standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP's) for Eastport Municipal Airport, which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep these regulations operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated economic cost will be so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
