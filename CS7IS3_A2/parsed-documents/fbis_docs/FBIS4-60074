Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Sharon said the struggle was being spearheaded by the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza rather than by the Likud, which has failed miserably. Sharon said the Likud should get a new leadership, capable of waging a democratic and legal struggle in the face of danger. Reacting to Sharon's remarks, MK Me'ir Shitrit said that most Likud voters apparently want peace, and that is why so few of them take part in anti-peace demonstrations. He called on Sharon to appear before the Likud Central Committee and try to muster 75 percent required for the election of a new leadership. Shitrit said he will not lend a hand to the ouster of Binyamin Netanyahu, who would be called upon to quit the leadership only if he fails in the elections. MK Shitrit proposed to Netanyahu to consolidate a leadership of five or six people, including Ari'el Sharon, to make the Likud leadership's work more effective.
