Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 16 (CNA) -- Taiwan's crude steel production lagged behind South Korea's in 1993, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Saturday [16 April]. However, Taiwan's steel consumption topped that of South Korea, CEPD officials noted. The officials said South Korea was the world's sixth largest crude steel producer in 1993, with an output of more than 33 million tons. Taiwan ranked 15th with 12 million tons, they said. Both countries completed the establishment of state-run steel mills in the mid-1970s, they pointed out. In terms of per capita crude steel consumption, Taiwan consumed an average of 916 kilograms in 1993, compared to South Korea's 643 kilograms, they said. Moreover, they pointed out, South Korea exported 50 percent of its crude steel output, while the ratio in Taiwan was below 10 percent. They attributed Taiwan's strong demand for crude steel to the ongoing six-year national development plan.
