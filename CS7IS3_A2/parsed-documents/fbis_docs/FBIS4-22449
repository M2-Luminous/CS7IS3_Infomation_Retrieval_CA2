For notwithstanding Moscow's and Washington's assertions to the contrary, their relations have recently begun to cool somewhat. The talks in the Far East were intended above all to give the sides an opportunity to explain their positions. Andrey Kozyrev has compared the relationship between Russia and the United States to a marriage: "The honeymoon is over." And this is indeed the case. But problems that they didn't think about before, not even believing they existed, remain and have made themselves known. The first one is Russia's special opinion on air strikes in Bosnia. The events that followed--Vitaliy Churkin's successful talks, Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin's appeal, the dispatch of Russian troops to Sarajevo, in short, all the factors that proved the Russian policy's effectiveness and consequently Russia's diplomatic success--were hardly something the Americans liked very much. Then came the series of mutual disclosures of Russian and Western intelligence agents and ex-President Richard Nixon's conduct in Moscow, conduct that offended Yeltsin. In this way, minor frictions accumulated into an array of problems that simply had to be discussed. Nevertheless, it is a good thing that the sides have a marriage contract--the Moscow Declaration, which the Russian and U.S. presidents signed at the conclusion of Bill Clinton's visit to Russia. The Russian and American foreign ministers used that declaration as the basis for their discussion of the entire agenda of Russian-American and international problems. That documents sets forth the principle that relations between Russia and the United States are to be given the character of a mature and equal partnership. And in Vladivostok Andrey Kozyrev emphasized the equality of the sides, with no junior or senior partners, leaders and led, superpowers and regional countries. Of course, as major countries that in fact play a most crucial role in the world arena, the U.S. and the Russian Federation do have disagreements that the sides are trying to solve in different ways. Nevertheless, as Warren Christopher said, "we are bound by partnership." One condition of that partnership is constant consultations between the sides, and an agreement that such consultations will be held was reached in Vladivostok. As an example of that equal partnership, Andrey Kozyrev cited an agreement reached in Vladivostok that Russian experts will take part in efforts to draw up a program on the problem of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies and on cooperation in the field of technologies, dubbing it a "new COCOM." In the first stage, Russian specialists will begin producing a draft in conjunction with the Americans, a draft that will not be based on anyone's unilateral proposal. Christopher, elaborating on that idea, stressed that "for the most part we are working together," although "depending on the issue, partnership can manifest itself in various forms." True, Christopher gave a somewhat strange answer to a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent's question at a press conference at the conclusion of the Vladivostok meeting, saying that the spy problem had not been discussed at all at the meeting. It is strange because, for one thing, before leaving for Vladivostok Kozyrev said that "spy passions" will be a focus of the talks, along with other glitches, among which he included the scandal-ridden Nixon visit. Second, both foreign ministers said that Russian-American relations "had been subjected to serious tests." One of those tests--at any rate, one visible to the naked eye--is the series of disclosures that began with the Aldrich Ames affair. The cooling in relations between Moscow and Washington that both are dismissing at the official level was manifested primarily in the reciprocal disclosures of intelligence agents. Christopher and Kozyrev say that resolving this situation lies outside their competence. One can agree with this when the issue is one of agents' working failures. But when the scandal is blow up to all but international proportions, statements by the foreign ministers could play a positive role. For the resolution of military conflicts cannot be left to the sole competence of defense ministers. More serious issues that Kozyrev and Christopher discussed had to do with international problems, not bilateral matters. Kozyrev briefed his colleague on his recent trip to Tunis and Tel-Aviv, telling him that both sides--the PLO and Israel--had shown a readiness to continue talks. As for Bosnia, deputy foreign ministers Vitaly Churkin and Chuck Redman will continue to discuss that problem. Christopher reported that he had asked Kozyrev to use his influence with the Serbs to persuade them to join the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia as a possible way to reach a peaceful resolution. The Russian minister said he was fully satisfied with the position taken by our American partners on transforming the G-7 into the G-8. Russia's joining the Seven could take place at the next G-7 summit meeting in Naples in July of this year. In addition, Kozyrev told Christopher about Russia's special role in the ex-Soviet republics, and he said that the secretary of state had understood that idea correctly. They also discussed the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic countries, human rights, the Partnership for Peace program, and a number of other problems. As had been expected, the meeting did not produce any sensational news. But it had to be held. One gets the feeling that the sides got up from the negotiating table breathing a sigh of relief: No dispute arose, although that could have easily happened, and the sides gave each other vitally needed, frank explanations of their positions. In general, until the next time disagreements arise--and this will happen at some point, for not all of the current disagreements were resolved--one can apparently take the view that the Russian-U.S. partnership is withstanding its test of strength for now.
