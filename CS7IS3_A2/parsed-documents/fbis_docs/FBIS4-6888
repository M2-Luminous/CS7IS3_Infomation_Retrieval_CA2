Security Council, as unjustifiable and unreasonable. The news analyst says: Their demand ignoring the DPRK's unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the Non-proliferation Treaty shows they are trying to deny the unique status of the DPRK and use the safeguards agreement as an experient for the sinister political purpose of stifling it. We cannot fully comply with the safeguards agreement, even if we try before the United States and the IAEA prove in practice that they are not going to stifle the DPRK. So long as the United States refuses to stop the anti-DPRK campaign and its nuclear threat and the IAEA Secretariat fails to renounce its partiality, we cannot allow inspection activities tantamount to routine and ad hoc inspections. It is self-evident that if we allow such inspection activities while the IAEA is escalating its partiality, dishonest officials of the IAEA Secretariat will join-more zealously in the U.S. policy of stifling the DPRK, groundlessly charging us with the possession of something which we do not have, and reversing black and white. When the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our unique status, the nuclear issue will be settled smoothly. How long our unique status lasts depends on the behavior of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. Pressure cannot be a solution to the problem. It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue and negotiation. It is entirely up to the United States and the IAEA Secretariat how the situation will develop.
