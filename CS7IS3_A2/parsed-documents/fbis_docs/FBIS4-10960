[Menem] What was the goal? We must start by asking ourselves what was our goal concerning the 10 April elections: The constitutional reform. This goal is underway. An overwhelming victory, virtually in the entire Republic, has been achieved, even though an attempt was made to downgrade this victory by emphasizing a defeat in the federal capital. Look at Buenos Aires Province: Even though the percentage who voted for Justicialism dropped a bit, it is the first time in history that Justicialism has won 121 of the 127 districts. In Santa Fe Province, for example, it is the first time Justicialism won all 19 districts. The same happened in La Rioja Province and other provinces.... Granted, the number of votes dropped. This may have been caused by this sort of dispersion in which two other parties, the Grand Front [FG] and MODIN [Movement for Dignity and Independence], appeared with a certain strength. Nevertheless, Justicialism obviously achieved excellent results. We achieved victory. Add up the UCR [Radical Civic Union], FG, and MODIN Constituent Assembly members, and you will see they do not reach the number of Justicialism Constituent Assembly members, namely 138. [CLARIN] Mr. President, this fourth consecutive electoral victory for you and Justicialism represents an unprecedented record. Nevertheless, you will agree that the federal capital represents a sort of political showcase in our country and events in the federal capital have strong repercussions. [Menem] The capital is represented by 27 out of 305 Constituent Assembly members. [CLARIN] What is your explanation for the defeat of Peronism in the capital? [Menem] Voters in the capital are wayward and demanding. I don't know why, but this waywardness has occurred since the federal capital was founded. Socialism, headed by Alfredo Palacios, won here once. I could attribute the electoral result in the federal capital to a very good performance by the FG leaders, but also to the waywardness of the federal capital voters. [passage omitted] [CLARIN] Do you agree with the polls that say that the main reason for voting for the FG was that the people believed there had to be an opposition? [Menem] There are many factors. This may be one. The floods, caused by the heavy rain in the capital, was another reason. This soured the people's mood. The people tend to blame the incumbent president rather than what has been going on for many years.... The scandals, prompted by reports on corruption within the PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan], may, also have had an impact; no doubt. There are many factors. [CLARIN] This may be an explanation for the growth of the FG, but why did the votes for Peronism drop? [Menem] Maybe Justicialist Party [PJ] members or those who sympathize with Justicialism decided to cast blank votes or support the FG. [CLARIN] Could this happen again next year during the presidential elections? [Menem] They are a different type of election. It is one thing to vote for presidential, gubernatorial, or mayoral candidates, and quite another thing to vote in this type of election in which it was known beforehand that the candidates' prestige was not involved. [passage omitted] [CLARIN] At the national level the PJ does not have a majority in the Constituent Assembly and there is speculation that someone may attempt to open up the "package" that you and [UCR President Raul] Alfonsin agreed upon. [Menem] We have a strategy to confront this maneuver. This is part of politics. And in this field I am no newcomer.... [CLARIN] At the national level, even after a clear victory, the PJ has lost 900,000 votes since October.... [Menem] For the reasons I have just mentioned. [CLARIN] There will be a presidential election within a year. [Menem] We will recover these votes and achieve a better result than the one we achieved in October. A presidential election is different. In a presidential election, we are all mobilized. This time I went to just two places. I went to Cordoba Province, where I knew that we were not going to fare well, and I went to Santiago del Estero Province where there was a chance of overcoming a given situation. Just 100 days after the December disturbances, we carried out a number of rallies, approached the community, and won by 12 percent. No one expected this to happen -- except those who always have faith and hope. [passage omitted] [CLARIN] Do you believe the 10 April election results spell the beginning of the end of a bipartisan system? [Menem] Following these elections, the bipartisan system has become a four-party system. There are four strongly emerging parties. Of the two traditional parties, Justicialism is holding on while the UCR is visibly shrinking. Nevertheless, I believe the UCR will regain its strength and its votes. [passage omitted] [CLARIN] The latest foreign trade figures indicate that exports are growing at a much slower pace than imports.... [Menem] Every country that is overcoming serious crises and entering a process of significant transformations will have unbalanced trade figures. Argentina cannot be an exception. What are the goods that cause this imbalance? Imported capital goods. How can we compete at an international level with totally obsolete equipment in our factories? We must not forget that as we progress in technology, incorporating science into production, we will overcome a large number of stumbling blocks in our efforts to compete internationally. We are implementing an export-oriented policy, and a series of incentives are under study. We will be somewhat careful concerning imports because virtually all the components required by factories and producers have already entered our country. [CLARIN] Please define "be careful concerning imports." [Menem] I do not want to pass absolute judgment, but a number of measures, to favor our country's production, may be taken. These measures will foster our export-oriented policy. Nevertheless, this issue must be handled very carefully because we may also be subjected to trade reprisals, involving increased tariffs, by the countries receiving our exports and the problem will be more complicated for us. An agreement must be reached on this issue. [CLARIN] [Economy Minister Domingo] Cavallo has recently said it will be necessary to reduce the consumption growth rate.... [Menem] This depends on the people. When [former President Juan Domingo] Peron was president, he said what Minister Cavallo is saying now: Save because this situation will not last a lifetime. Be careful. It is necessary to be far-sighted.... [CLARIN] Is Cavallo announcing that the party is over? [Menem] No, no... Cavallo is not saying this. He is simply telling the people that they have to control their spending. Even if we have a very small amount, we Argentines like to spend this very small amount. This is why we have ruined over the past four or five decades one of the most progressive countries on Earth. [CLARIN] How do you view the pharmaceutical patents law issue? [Menem] We are making an effort to at least have a Senate commission approve it and leave it ready for discussion by the Senate plenary. The commission's approval represents an important step. [CLARIN] If even this small legislative step is not achieved, will Argentina be placed by the United States on a list of countries whose entry into NAFTA is not recommended? [Menem] I don't know because our imports from this country represent a huge benefit for it. More than 50,000 jobs in the United States depend on Argentine imports. [CLARIN] It has been said that if no progress is made on this law, the United States could implement some reprisals, like placing us on this list.... [Menem] These are mere sanction announcements. Nevertheless, we must not forget that the patents law issue goes back to the Bush administration. We discussed this issue with Carla Hills who was the U.S. trade secretary during the Bush administration. We shall see.... [CLARIN] The GATT agreement establishes a more benign patents legislation system. Does the bill presented in Congress follow the GATT or the U.S. standards? [Menem] It conforms to the U.S. proposal. This is very important because like this we have the possibility of joining NAFTA and immediately gaining access to a market of more than 600 million consumers. [passage omitted]
