Gubernatorial elections, including the Seoul mayoral election, will be held in the first half of next year, as promised, the chief executive told reporters while exchanging New Year's greetings with them. An opposition mayor of Seoul would pose no problem to him in carrying out his job as chief executive because the constitution guarantees his rights and duties as president, he said. In the United States, there appears no problem between President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration and the Republican mayor of New York, Kim added. In Japan, there was no problem in the Liberal Democratic Party administration while Minobe, who was elected on the Socialist Party's support, ruled Tokyo for 12 years. He said premature election enthusiasm is not desirable in view of the nation's pressing task to boost the economy. "The elections are still one and half years away, but the press has already begun carrying speculative reports on anticipated candidates to arouse public interest in the elections," he noted. Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Liberal Party Secretary-General Mun Chong-su said his party was not studying a plan to revise administrative districts for next year's local elections. "My party will by no means push ahead with such a plan," he added.
