Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic refused to say whether the delegation would return. Earlier at a press conference Karadzic accused the Muslims of continually sabotaging the conference. "This is a great humiliation for the international community which bears the responsibility for these actions. Before the negotiations we were asked not to set any conditions, and we stuck to that. On the other hand, we are witnessing constant blackmail by the Muslims. There will be no peace without a cease-fire," Karadzic said and left the Palais des Nations with his delegation.
