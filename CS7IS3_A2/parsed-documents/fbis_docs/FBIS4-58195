Addressing a symposium organized by the International and Islamic Studies and Information Center, moderated by Bilal al-Tall, head of the center, in the presence of the secretaries general of the parties, al-Hasan added: We are on the threshold of a new and serious stage, especially since it was agreed in Bucharest that meetings would begin on 3 May and that an agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli sides would be signed on 5 May regardless of the outstanding problems. The signing will be accompanied by the entry into Gaza and Jericho of a 6,000-strong Palestinian police force and 500 civilians who will work in various departments. Al-Hasan described the entry of the Palestinian police force as a fireworks display. He called for concentrated efforts during the next phase to confront and find an alternative to the Israeli strategy, especially since Israel is currently undergoing political, security, and economic difficulties.
