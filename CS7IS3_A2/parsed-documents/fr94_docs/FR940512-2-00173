FR940512-2-00173 FR940512-2-00078 Program purpose, goals, and objectives: The Administration on Children Youth and Families will award approximately 150 new service grants to establish or strengthen existing or proposed runaway and homeless youth Basic Centers. These programs must be locally controlled efforts that provide temporary shelter, counseling and other services to juveniles who have left home without permission of their parents or guardians or to other homeless juveniles. Applications are solicited under this priority area to carry out direct service projects designed to carry out the program purpose, goals and objectives set forth in the legislation and as specified in Part I, section C.1 of this announcement. These goals and objectives are: 1. To alleviate the problems of runaway and homeless youth, 2. To reunite youth with their families and to encourage the resolution of intrafamily problems through counseling and other services, 3. To strengthen family relationships and to encourage stable relationships for youth, and 4. To help youth decide upon constructive courses of action. Background: The Runaway Youth and Homeless Youth Act was enacted in response to widespread concern regarding the alarming number of youth who were leaving home without parental permission, crossing State lines, and who, while away from home, were exposed to exploitation and other dangers of street life. Each Basic Center funded under the authorizing legislation is required to provide outreach to runaway and homeless youth; temporary shelter for up to fifteen days; food; clothing; individual, group, and family counseling; and related services. Many Basic Centers provide their services in residential settings with a capacity for no more than 20 youth. Some centers also provide some or all of their shelter services through host homes (usually private homes under contract to the centers), with counseling and referrals being provided from a central location. Currently, approximately 60,000 youth annually receive shelter for an average of 12 nights and other ongoing services through ACYF-funded Basic Centers. The primary presenting problems of these youth include conflict with parents or other adults, including physical and sexual abuse (63 percent); other family crises such as divorce, death, or sudden loss of income (9 percent); and personal problems such as drug use, or problems with peers, school attendance and truancy, bad grades, inability to get along with teachers, and learning disabilities (28 percent). Low self-esteem is a major problem among this population. Half (49 percent) have a poor self image; somewhat less than half (43 percent) are depressed; and 12 percent are possibly suicidal. After receiving ongoing services from shelter programs, 50 percent of the youth return to their families. One-third (33 percent) are provided alternative, but safe, long-term living arrangements. Five percent return to the streets, and 12 percent leave the centers with no known destination.
