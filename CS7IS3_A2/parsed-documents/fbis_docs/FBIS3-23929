From the very first days of a month-long election marathon, the pulse of public life quickened perceptibly--which, strangely enough, has not found an adequate reflection in the local mass media. Television in Kazakhstan is not flooded with ads proclaiming, "Better with us than with Snickers." Newspapers are not filling their pages with candidates' endless political platforms. It appears that the Central Electoral Commission has learned from the sad experience of the Russian campaign. Paid political advertising is banned. All candidates are in equal starting conditions: Each is entitled to 10 minutes of free television time and 100 lines in the republic press to present his program. But this is not the only reason of the relatively low political activism of the press. Paradoxical as it may sound, it is quite often busy with things other than big politics. Most daily newspapers in the republic come out three times a week lately. And some are suspending publication altogether. There is no paper, no money for printing and delivery--a difficult economic situation. The republic leadership untiringly emphasizes that in Kazakhstan, where more than 500 periodicals are registered, there has not been a single incident of a "coerced" closing of a newspaper. Only "natural mortality" as a result of economic difficulties. What is interesting, however, is that it is primarily the state and quasi-state mass media that had been suffering most from economic difficulties. The very large newspaper KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA--a former Central Committee organ--finished last year "owing" the readers about 30 issues, although one would think that it should feel itself in a privileged position, having as a cofounder--along with the labor collective--the Cabinet of Ministers. The mighty cofounder, however, reminds of its existence mostly only after another "unpleasant" article, when the newspaper is duly reminded that it is a state organ and must defend state interests! One of the latest such reminders was an official letter to the editor in chief from the republic's Ministry of Publishing and Mass Media. Among other things, it contains a list of subjects which, in the ministry's opinion, "may constitute" state secrets. The list is long and not very comprehensible. Some items in it simply contradict current legislation. For instance, "it is not recommended" to reveal data on the state gold reserves. At the same time, the law on the monetary system prescribes the National Bank to issue at least once a month information on the gold and foreign currency supply that supports the tenga. Actually, this is not even a full list. No one in the editorial offices has seen the full one. The newspaper's senior management reminiscences almost wistfully about the times of Glavlit [the Main Administration for Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press], when each editor had in his safe a list of items that constituted state secrets. Now the ministry suggests: "Call for guidance before publishing...." More often, however, the ministry itself takes the initiative in calling and advising. They may recommend that some or other rubric be started, to "cover a topic." There was an incident when the newspaper was "advised" to put a certain headline in the next issue.... According so some data--so far unofficial--a draft for creating some sort of state-owned "press holding company" is in the works in the bowels of the administrative structures. The state will own the controlling share of stock and will thus get a real lever of managing newspapers' policy as well as the ability to appoint and remove editors in chief. Actually, even today the logogriph "independent newspaper" on the front page does not guarantee complete independence from the state. Just recently, Dauir, the largest publishing house in the republic, where many "independent" newspapers are printed, refused to print about 30 of them with the lowest circulation. The pretext for refusal was that several presses needed preventive maintenance. By strange coincidence, "preventive maintenance" coincided with the beginning of the election campaign. The list of "low-circulation" newspapers included the popular KARAVAN newspaper, with a circulation of 200,000. This happened after KARAVAN and the businessmen's newspaper ABC published a very biting open letter from the president of Krands--the largest state corporation--to the mayor of the capital. On the day this issue came out, the city fire inspectorate sealed the printing house facilities. Later, electricity was cut off there several times.... Someone wants very much literally to implement the famous journalistic postulate: A newspaper's life is one day.
