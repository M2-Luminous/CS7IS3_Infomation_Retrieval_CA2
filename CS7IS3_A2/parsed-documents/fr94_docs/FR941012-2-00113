FR941012-2-00113 FR941012-2-00076 Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate Account under the Contracts. Applicants state that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Other Contracts funded by the Account or any Other Account, in the future, are consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants state that, without the requested relief, Applicants would have to request and obtain exemptive relief in connection with Other Contracts under certain circumstances. Any such additional request for exemption would present no issues under the 1940 Act that have not already been addressed in this application. Applicants submit that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest, because it would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for First ING Life to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. The delay and expense involved in having to repeatedly seek exemptive relief would impair First ING Life's ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If First ING Life were required to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby. Indeed, they might be disadvantaged as a result of First ING Life's increased overhead expenses. Thus, Applicants believe that the requested exemption id appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. 3. Applicants have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by First ING Life under the Contracts and reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that these determinations are based on their analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practices, and by taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels and benefits provided, the existence of expense charge guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. First ING Life undertakes to maintain at its home office, and make available to the Commission and its staff upon request, a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology used in making the foregoing determinations. 4. The surrender charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. In that event, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the surrender charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, First ING Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate Account and Owners. First ING Life also represents that it will maintain at its home office, and make available on request to the Commission and its staff, a memorandum setting out the basis for such conclusion. 5. First ING Life also represents that the Separate Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes, in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Applicants' Conclusion Applicants submit that, for all of the reasons stated herein,the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act meet the standards set out in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
