The new generation of applied satellites currently under research and development includes large-capacity longevity communication and broadcasting satellites, meteorology satellites, navigation position satellites, disaster-minimized satellites, and multipurpose earth resource satellites. Of these, the Dongfanghong [East Is Red] No. 3 communication satellite and Fengyun [Wind and Cloud] No. 2 meteorology satellite will soon be put into use, and will be the important indicators of China's applied satellites catching up with the advanced level in the world. With 24 transmitters and an eight-year designed longevity, the Dongfanghong No. 3 satellite is capable of meeting China's satellite communication requirements till the year 2000 or even a longer period of time beyond. The Fengyun No. 2, the first earth-synchronous remote-sensing meteorology satellite developed by China, will play an active role in developing meteorological science and technology in China and the world. Meanwhile, China is improving and perfecting the Changzheng [Long March] series of carrier rockets, and has successfully developed a batch of more advanced and larger-capacity carrier rockets to satisfy domestic and international demands for launching different applied satellites. The Changzheng No. 3B cluster rocket's loading capacity on the earth-synchronous orbit can reach 4.8 tonnes, while its low-orbit loading capacity is about 12 tonnes. The Changzheng No. 1D rocket's loading capacity on the near-earth orbit has been greatly enhanced. The Changzheng No. 3A rocket, which was successfully launched recently, has increased Chinese rockets' loading capacity on the earth-synchronous orbit to 2.5 tonnes, and has upgraded a number of China's new technologies to the world's advanced level. To provide advanced technical means for telecommunications, broadcasting, education, meteorology, resource prospecting, ocean exploitation, cartography, navigation position, traffic control, maritime accident rescue, environment monitoring, and other national economic departments, China has also established selected nationwide ground satellite application systems, such as satellite travelling communication system, rapid satellite position system, special satellite data information system, satellite financial and taxation system, and satellite wage issuance system.
