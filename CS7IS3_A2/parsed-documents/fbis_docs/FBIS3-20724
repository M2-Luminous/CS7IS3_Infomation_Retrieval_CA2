Dimitrovska: "Crete Is With Serbia"] [Text] Tugboats carrying the sign "You Are Not Alone -- Crete Is With You" have delivered 450 metric tons of humanitarian aid from Iraklion. Father Dimitrije Teodorus sent a message that the citizens of Crete will also send volunteers to help the Serbs if necessary. As he delivered 20 tugboats containing more than 450 tons of humanitarian aid collected by the citizens of Crete for all the Serbian countries, Father Dimitrije Teodorus, representative of the archbishop of Crete, also delivered a message for all Serbs: "The brotherly Greek people will also help the Serbian people militarily it that becomes necessary." "The citizens of Crete are with you, and in addition to the humanitarian aid, which will not be lacking, they are also ready to send manpower to help the Serbs in their just struggle, if the Serbs make such a request. Cretan citizens in that event would certainly be eager to join you and fight together; they are special people in Greece; they are ready to shed their blood for the Serbian motherland and Eastern Orthodoxy if you ask them to do so." Stressing that he speaks for all Cretans, Father Dimitrije Teodorus, representative of the Greek Orthodox Church, pointed out that in addition to other firm bonds uniting the two friendly nations, Serbs and Greeks are also bound by the "unbreakable link of their common religion, which becomes ever firmer to withstand enemy forces when they become persistent, as they are now, in their desire to rupture Eastern Orthodoxy." "I assure you," Teodorus said, "that the Greek nation shares these difficult times with you, they understand your conditions under these inhuman sanctions, and they see through the politics of the world's power brokers, who blame only the Serbs for the war in the region. You are not alone. Crete is with you." Janis Papadakis, president of the Cretan delegation, otherwise dean of the University of Crete, reminded journalists that this is not the first time Crete had sent humanitarian aid to help the Serbs. Papadakis noted that "Only five days after the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] were introduced, we brought two tugboats of aid to Belgrade, and another four in August of last year; this is the third time we are meeting with the same people here in Belgrade. We will continue to supply humanitarian aid to the Serbs. Thus we will prove to everyone that we have understood from the first moment of the sanctions why the international community accuses only the Serbs of being responsible for all the problems in the former Yugoslavia, and we will show the international community that we do not agree with this biased position. In addition to the aid, consisting of clothing, footwear, food, oranges (50 tons), and pharmaceutical products, the Crete representatives offered to FRY to receive the refugee children for three months, to be hosts to expatriates until the end of the war, and to adopt orphans from the Serbian lands upon mutual agreement. The journalists were informed that lraklion, which shipped the aid, plans to become a sister city of Novi Sad.
