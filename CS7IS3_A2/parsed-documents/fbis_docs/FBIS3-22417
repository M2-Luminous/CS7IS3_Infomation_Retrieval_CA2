These seemingly high figures are not that impressive, because ecologists are responsible for drafting legislative instruments and administrative ordinances and for monitoring and evaluating environmental conditions in various parts of the country. The conclusions everyone has drawn from the results for 1993 are not optimistic. Ecological conditions are still growing worse. In addition to the decline of technological discipline at many enterprises, there is the low rate of retooling, the reduced allocations for environmental construction and renovation projects, and the use of substandard types of fuel. Ecological conditions are still at the critical point in 44 cities in the country (Moscow, Novokuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Bratsk, and others). In just the first half of 1993, 207 cases of pollution levels 10 or more times in excess of allowable limits were recorded here. There has been no decrease in the total number of accidents or in the ecologically harmful emissions of industrial and agricultural facilities and public utilities. The operations of more than 120 enterprises, shops, units, and facilities were halted (temporarily) for violations of water conservation laws. Specialists are still particularly concerned about the radiological conditions throughout the country, and especially in the areas surrounding facilities of the nuclear complex. Mobile sources of pollution are creating additional problems: The total quantity of harmful vehicle emissions has increased dramatically, and this is certainly connected with the increase in the number of vehicle owners who will not stop driving even in winter. Some species of animals and fish have been reduced to the critical point as a result of the deterioration of their habitats and the higher number of poachers. One of the problems inhibiting effective Minprirody operations, according to Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, is the flawed legal base. Many necessary laws simply do not exist, and those which have been passed are frequently contradictory. The failure to draw clear distinctions between the functions of central and regional agencies has led to the proverbial situation in which "too many cooks are spoiling the soup." As Danilov-Danilyan said at the final collegial meeting of Minprirody, departmental specialists drafted 44 presidential edicts last year and coordinated 42 draft legal instruments received from other organizations. Subdivisions of the state Board of Environmental Impact Appraisals reviewed 64,000 pre-planning and planning documents of various types and standardizing documents. These impressive figures include the fundamentals of Russian Federation water, land, and forest legislation, draft laws "On Lake Baykal," "On Ecological Security," and "On Oil and Gas," and the "Fundamentals of RF Legislation on Flora." Their future, however, now depends on the new parliament, which is unlikely to consider these bills until it has "scrutinized" some political matters and has scored additional privileges for its members. Finances are another of the ecologists' concerns. According to Danilov-Danilyan, ecological policy should be coordinated with economic reforms. The amount allocated to finance all of the operations of Minprirody organizations in 1993 was 22.6 billion rubles, which was equivalent to 83.2 percent of the amount agreed upon with the Ministry of Finance and just over half of the estimated cost of these operations. The 30 programs of environmental recovery and several dozen programs of regional, oblast, territorial, and municipal socioeconomic development are based on the scientific and technical program called "Russia's Ecological Security." The implementation of this plan, however, might be disrupted because the financing has been cut to just about one-third of the original amount. Only 2.6 billion of the 6.87 billion rubles was allocated in 1993. The required amounts are minimal on the national scale and are within the limits of the error built into the state budget. "Ecological allocations are not this low in any other country in the world. That is why the unsatisfactory state of our environment is not surprising. Under these conditions, there is no hope of improvement," the minister has repeatedly pointed out. In spite of this, six natural preserves (with a total area of 8 million hectares) were established last year, and the plans were drawn up for seven more, which should be established this year. Ecologists have calculated that around 40 percent of Russia's territory (7-8 million square kilometers) is unaffected by economic activity, except for the planes flying overhead. This "ecological gold mine" must be protected from industrial inroads. As a result of the work on the plans for the sound network of state natural preserves and national parks, these territories (along with the 77 existing preserves, with an area of 27 million hectares) will cover 53.6 million hectares, or 3.12 percent of the area of the Russian Federation, by 2005. Six new maritime inspection boards were also created for the protection of the resources of the Russian Federation's territorial waters, continental shelf, and maritime economic zone, which are under unequivocal federal jurisdiction. Because of the inadequate equipment of these inspection boards, however, the state of Russia's maritime resources and their ecologically acceptable use are being monitored on an area of only 900,000 square kilometers, or only 13 percent of the total. It is possible that the Minprirody treasury will be supplemented slightly by unpaid fines and pending claims amounting to 7 million rubles and just over 500 million rubles respectively. Figures of this size are unlikely to intimidate large enterprises. It is often simpler and more convenient for them to pay the fines than to change their technology, install sewage treatment equipment, etc. Money and the profit motive are the deciding factors in a market economy. This is why Minprirody plans to continue developing environmental and conservation tax benefits, instituting preferential customs duties for operations connected with environmental activity, and developing market mechanisms promoting the prudent use of resources on different levels (the federation, the region, and the enterprise). It will also finish setting standards to regulate environmental impact studies in privatization projects and in the collection of environmental damages caused by industrial accidents. Standard fees will be set for radioactive pollution. Experiments will be conducted with regional ecological insurance and with improved economic mechanisms in territories under special protection. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan is determined to take action. It is possible that he now has a partner in Aleksandr Zaveryukha, the government curator of the ecological establishment, who already attended a Minprirody collegial meeting. In any case, he is certain to take a special interest in the group of "land" problems.
