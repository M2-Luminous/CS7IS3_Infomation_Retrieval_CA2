According to official reports, the Central American ambassadors have taken the last legal step to allow the transfer of ODECA assets, rights, and holdings to SICA. ODECA was created on 12 December 1962, according to a presidential agreement called the "San Salvador Charter." SICA was established, according to the 13 December 1991 "Tegucigalpa Protocol," to coordinate regional integration actions and institutions determined by heads of state in the region. A SICA communique explains that according to a resolution issued at the 13th Central American summit, held in Panama on 11 December 1992, the institution had to begin operations, based in San Salvador, on 1 February 1993, and later settle its legal position, which it is doing today. "SICA asserts itself as a far-reaching, modern, humanist organization which has already yielded results by guaranteeing the coordination of the integration process in the fields of the economic, social, cultural, and political development of the isthmus," the communique states.
