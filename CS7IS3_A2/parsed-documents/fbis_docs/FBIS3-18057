It was an act that "merits the firmest condemnation," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that went on to extend condolences to the families of the victims. Italy "expects Israel to adopt all the necessary measures to prevent any further bloodshed," the foreign office said. "Greater vigilance and sense of responsibility must prevail on all sides in order to ward off the recreation of a vicious circle of violence," the statement continued, adding that "the madness of extremist fringe groups" could not be allowed to jeopardize the peace process. "This tragic episode is part of a series of acts of repeated violence, nearly always against innocent civilians, used by extremists of all denominations aiming to block the peace process," the statement continued, adding that the peace talks, "despite all the objective difficulties, are marking important steps forward."
