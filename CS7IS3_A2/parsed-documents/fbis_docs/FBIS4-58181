It helped the two sides overcome most of the obstacles that hindered the agreement, he said. In a statement appearing today in MAYU, which speaks for the National Democratic Party, Mubarak said that despite obstacles the Golan Heights will soon return to Syria. He noted that Syria and Israel are eager for peace and that Egypt is helping the two sides surmount the difficulties so that an agreement can be reached. On the situation in Yemen, Mubarak addressed a new appeal to the parties to the conflict in fraternal Yemen to demonstrate self-restraint and prevent bloodshed for the sake of the Yemeni people's future. On the results of his recent visits to China and some Arab countries, Mubarak stressed that the trip to China was extremely fruitful and produced positive results. He noted the need for continued cooperation between Egypt and China. President Mubarak emphasized the need for boosting Egyptian-Chinese relations in all fields because China, with its formidable capabilities, will play a more influential role in international politics. He explained that China agreed to reschedule Egypt's debts. He said the move, a privilege not given to any other country, reflects an appreciation of Egypt's status and role on the international scene. Mubarak said that he had rejected an idea to delay his visit to China. I insisted on going to Beijing on the scheduled date, although I postponed my visit to Japan because of that country's government crisis, he said. On his visits to a number of Arab countries before and after his trip to China, Mubarak said: I am always eager for coordination and an exchange of views with Arab leaders on all issues of concern to the region and on international issues of mutual concern. He added: I am eager to meet with Arab leaders whenever I have a chance. During my recent tour, I met with Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman. I have the closet ties with the Sultan and the Omani people. Regarding the United Arab Emirates, its positions toward us are honorable. Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan is a dear friend, and when we meet we discuss all issues frankly and in a brotherly spirit and we always arrive at identical viewpoints. On relations with Bahrain, President Mubarak said the Bahraini people are really kind and proud of their relations with Egypt. My meetings with Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah are always characterized by cordiality and understanding, he said. President Mubarak added: I was willing to conclude my trip with a visit to fraternal Saudi Arabia to meet with my brother the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd-Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, Crown Prince 'Abdallah, and the leaders of the kingdom. I proceeded from eagerness to coordinate and exchange views with them on all issues of concern to the region and the world. Saudi Arabia is a big, influential Gulf state and agreements between us reflect positively on our fraternal peoples. On the implementation of the economic reform program in Egypt, Mubarak told MAYU that the world economy is now unstable, causing higher prices. Egypt is affected by this, but we are concerned that people with low income not be hurt, he said. He added: In the reform plan we are fully committed to certain principles. We do not approve any new loans except when there is an urgent need and we are making strenuous efforts to write off half of our foreign debts. Concluding his statement, President Mubarak renewed his call for investors to establish their projects in Egypt on lands where the state has provided facilities. Projects costing about 10 million pounds do not need permission from any quarter, he said. President Mubarak explained that a good economy supports the climate of freedom and democracy. We are interested in reforming Egypt's economy and establishing it on firm and strong bases so that freedom and democracy will flourish, he said.
