They have only achieved successes in the military area. From the standpoint of the military achievements during the three years of war, we would have to include among the key strategic changes in the area of the former Yugoslavia the formation of the Serbian parastates west of the Drina River. That process took place in parallel with the military strengthening of Serbia and Montenegro, which absorbed almost the entire military potential of the former federal state. During the year-long convergent withdrawal of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] from the west and the south, Serbia turned into a regional military power; it became the domicile for the withdrawing units, and for almost the entire equipment, elements of defense industry, and reserves of the former federal state. With the international community's embargo on importing weapons into the states that were the victims of Serbian aggression, the other states were prevent from successfully opposing it. To illustrate the transformation of the federation of Serbia and Montenegro into a regional power, we should mention that at the beginning of this year, the following military resources were on its territory--which encompasses only 102,350 square kilometers and is 2.5 times smaller than the former Yugoslavia: --135,000-150,000 troops (the number varies because of occasional mobilization and other exercises, for which military conscripts are drafted); --1,100 combat tanks (300 M-84's and 800 T-54/55's); --1,170 combat armored personnel carriers; --1,900 self-propelled and towed cannons for infantry support (105-mm and larger calibers); --187 multiple rocket launchers; --3,000 large-caliber mortars (120 mm); --3,400 medium-caliber mortars (82 mm); --4,100 recoilless cannons; --282 self-propelled antiarmor missile launchers; --1,330 antiarmor cannon (70- to 100-mm calibers); --480 combat aircraft; --136 armed helicopters; --a fleet (five torpedo submarines, four assault submarines, four frigates, 12 missile boats, and 12 torpedo boats). It is obvious from the number of weapons that during the three years of war the so-called Yugoslavia's army has not reduced its weaponry, but instead has increased it even further. We could seek the causes only partly in purchases (25 MiG-29's, SCUD missiles, new long-range antiaircraft missiles), because the main supplier has been its own defense industry. In contrast to the rest of industry, which is operating at 20 to 25 percent of capacity in Serbia, the defense industry plants are said to be operating at three times higher a capacity, with the plants that the Serbs evacuated from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia already equipped for production last year. They are producing on a particularly large scale 120-mm mortars, new types of shells (with proximity detonators and a rocket motor), large-caliber sniper rifles (12.7 mm), and so forth. If, in addition to the number of soldiers, we also take into account the paramilitary units (the party militias, which are well-armed with light infantry weapons and well-trained, because some of their members are constantly operating in territories west of the Drina), then we can ascertain that the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] has about 205,000-220,000 people under arms (this figure does not include the 70,000 policemen, who are also trained for combat missions). If we express the density of military strength in terms of the quotient of the number of troops and weapons and the state's area (in square kilometers), we obtain the following value: two soldiers, 0.22 tanks and armored vehicles, 0.0829 cannons, rocket launchers, and mortars, and 0.006 aircraft and helicopters per square kilometer. For a state that has a per capital national income 10 times lower than ours, those quotients are sometimes higher than the European bloc averages, namely approximately four times higher for the density of troops, almost twice as high for tanks and armored vehicles, almost four times for aircraft and helicopters, and almost 13 times for artillery. The above-mentioned indices--in spite of the obsolescence of the aircraft equipment--clearly show what kind of military power the so-called Yugoslavia has become, although its leadership insistently reiterates that it is not at war, while concealing the fact that without its logistical support the western Serbian armies would never have conquered what they did. Last year it spent approximately 25 to 33 percent of the total GNP to finance the war and the Serbs west of the Drina. Paramilitary troops and many experts from the western Serbian armies have likewise been trained in Serbia. The process of militarization is also apparent in the territories west of the Drina; in that zone, the republic of Srpska [RS] and the republic of Serbian Krajina have a total of about 150,000 people under arms [one-third of them are RSK soldiers). If we also take into account the weapons that the Serbian soldiers have (about 500 tanks and armored personnel carriers, about 600-800 cannons, long-range missiles, and about 50 aircraft and helicopters), then their military superiority (over the Croatian and Muslim units, which otherwise total about 190,000 fighters with about 100 tanks and 300 cannons, and whose main forces are entangled in mutual Croatian-Muslim conflicts) explains how the numerically inferior western Serbian arms have succeeded to date in conquering 25 percent of the territory of Croatia and 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They have thus created the basis for increasing Serbian territory by 50 percent in the event of a merger with the so-called FRY. Since the beginning of the war the Croatian army has made great qualitative and quantitative progress (it has 150,000 people under arms and about 600 tanks and armored vehicles, and approximately 800 cannons); in spite of this, if it started the long-announced decisive, but always postponed offensive (for the final liberation of its territories)--if all the Serbian armies merged--it could not achieve the superiority needed for a successful attack. The Croatian general staff is also aware of this, and therefore decided on tactical operations with limited goals ("Miljevac plateau," "Maslenica," and "Divoselo"). The New Serbian Doctrine as a Source of Threats The former JNA's failures in the wars in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina led to the former JNA general staff's purge of old personnel, and simultaneous formulation of a new doctrine that takes into account experiences from the Gulf War (in 1991) and other local wars. They focused their main efforts on forming an ethnically pure army. The use of paramilitary forces is an "invention" that allowed the general staff to use others to carry out the dirty job of "cleansing territories" (which essentially involves terrorist operations against civilians with the intention of intimidating the non-Serbian population into abandoning the territory); they defined long-range weapons as urgently needed new weapons. Specifically, they needed a "strategic response" in the event that the so-called FRY became the target of missile attacks like those experienced by Iraq (1991) and Libya (1986). In connection with this, they devoted particular attention to the procurement and development of long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. In this regard we should mention that in addition to the threats from the Radical Seselj, back in 1992 then chief of the General Staff Zivota Panic also announced the development of a missile with a range of 1,000 kilometers; he thereby made it clear that the range of the newly acquired SCUD ballistic missiles (450 kilometers) did not meet the new doctrine's requirements. From the standpoint of the balance of power, as a particular threat factor for all of the Balkans and beyond, we should mention the new Serbian offensive doctrine; it specifically proves that the threats announced during the past year by the civilian and military leaders of the western Serbs (for example, about the bombardment of refineries, urban centers, nuclear power plants, etc.) were not the brandishing of an empty weapon, since this year they were actually fulfilled. Even though Gospic in September 1993 involved a tactical attack by the Croatian army, in which the Croatian units did not occupy more than 150 square kilometers of the RSK's territory, the Serbs responded with a merciless bombardment of numerous Croatian towns (the vicinity of Zagreb, Samobor, which lies along the Slovene border, Sibenik, Zadar, and Karlovac), and industrial facilities (the Sisak refinery, and the Kutina artificial fertilizer factory), and they also fired--for the time being only in warning--surface-to-surface missiles (specifically, in the immediate vicinity of Zagreb). The doctrine of Serbian deep strikes against urban centers, accompanied by assaults by Serbian special units deep behind enemy lines, indicates that if there is a renewed escalation of conflicts, the Serbian armies will not limit themselves only to a tactical defense, but will instead respond with the already announced strikes against the entire depth of the territory within the range of their weapons. Consequently, towns still remain the main targets (they are treating Vukovar, Osijek, Dubrovnik, and Karlovac as paradigms for the future). In this regard, they are seriously counting on support by "volunteers" from the so-called Yugoslavia, which will only be a camouflage for the use of regular units from the so-called FRY. [passage omitted] Taking into account the fact that the chief of the so-called FRY's General Staff visited Iraq last year precisely because of Iraq's experiences, and that there are many indirect indications that the army of the so-called FRY has succeeded--in spite of the embargo--in obtaining long-range weapons, last year's threats by Serbian generals about attacks against all targets within range of their weapons should be taken seriously, and appropriate defensive countermeasures should be sought in time, or else we would be risking what the surprised victims of the Iraqi and Libyan attacks experienced. In connection with this, we should recall that this year's list of 30 civilian targets that RSK General Novakovic announced "urbi et orbi" to the Croatian public also included Pulj; in view of the distribution of Serbian positions, this means that in Slovenia, the Serbian weapons could reach targets up to the Radovljica-Sezana line. Furthermore, we should recall that in neighboring Croatia, just as previously in Italy (in 1986) and Israel (1991), before last September's events occurred, they were assessed from a professional standpoint as not very likely or unlikely, but they nevertheless happened.
