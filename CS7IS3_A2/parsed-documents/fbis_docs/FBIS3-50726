Robaina's goals include examining and strengthening bilateral relations with each of those countries. Robaina highlights the importance Cuba attributes to its ties of friendship with the African nations, which systematically express their support for the Revolution. [Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1255 GMT on 6 January 94 adds that Robaina's delegation comprises Alberto Rodriguez Arufe, foreign relations official of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba; Laureano Cardoso, department chief of the Ministry of Foreign Relations; adviser Domingo Garcia; and other personalities. One delegate pointed out that the tour, precisely at the beginning of the year, stresses the importance Havana gives to its traditional ties of friendship with African nations. He also commented that African nations systematically express their support of Cuba in numerous international forums and that the economic importance of these countries -- Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, with approximately 3 million square km and a population of over 34 million -- cannot be dismissed. In addition, there are political ties, particularly with Angola and Namibia, in whose independence Cuba played a significant role. Robaina will return to Havana on 23 January.]
