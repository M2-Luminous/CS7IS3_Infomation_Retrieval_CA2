I do not see any major problems here. In a month's time we will [word indistinct] complete the bulk of the work, I think. On the other hand, I said that this is an open concept -- that is how we see it -- and for the Serbs who are not [word indistinct] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This federal arrangement offers equal opportunities for all. I also said that we (did not expect) the UK Government to insist on a solution that would accept the results of ethnic cleansing as this would be a precedent, a kind of virus that would remain and would later give a chance to someone else in another country to cause such a tragedy. I said that their [word indistinct] influence on the Serbs is completely dormant, and that we expect them to take a stricter line with the Serbs. The Serbs seem to think that they have (support) from London. These were our talks. At the same time we said that we were cooperating with the contact group. However, we cannot give away something that does not belong to us, something that belongs to the people. We politicians have only a limited mandate when it comes to private property. We particularly spoke about cities, as most of the cities that have been occupied [words indistinct] were inhabited by Bosniaks as the majority nation. This is [word indistinct] entire infrastructure, cinemas, post offices, sewage system, roads, streetlights, all that belongs to the people who live there. Everyone knows what is whose. We want a solution to be reached in that context. [Cumurovic] I consider the implementation of the Washington Agreement an important step in halting the war here, Douglas Hogg, UK Foreign Office minister, said. [passage indistinct]
