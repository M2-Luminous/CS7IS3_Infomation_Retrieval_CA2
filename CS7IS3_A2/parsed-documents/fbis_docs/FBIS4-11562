FBIS4-11562 "drlat083_b_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Haiti Chamber President Switches to Sansaricq Camp Chamber President Switches to Sansaricq Camp FL2804220394 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1600 GMT 28 Apr 94 FL2804220394 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Excerpt] Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and Senator Sansaricq, the president of the unofficial Senate office, met on 27 April to coordinate viewpoints on a means of resolving the crisis, particularly of filling the power vacuum. For Sen. Sansaricq, this constitutes official recognition of the office over which he presides in the Senate. Edner Jean filed a report: [Begin recording] [Jean] This meeting occurred fewer than 24 hours after President Monde's shattering statements, which began his turn to the right. This spectacular reversal is about to take place because of extended consultations with the office Sen. Bernard Sansaricq leads. A significant fact: The talk took place in the office of President Monde, the same place where, 15 days earlier, he had assured Firmin Jean-Louis, the president of the National Assembly, of his firm support, which he stated on this occasion in the presence of journalists. With this gesture, Frantz Robert Monde wished to prompt the Senate president to examine the parliamentary plan submitted to him as a resolution by the deputies. The latest statements and initiatives by Firmin Jean-Louis had made Monde think he had other political motives. The president of the Chamber of Deputies therefore decided to switch to the other camp, with a wink at Sen. Bernard Sansaricq. [Sansaricq, in Creole] President Monde has decided to work with the Senate over which I am presiding. He finally recognizes that this Senate is functional and has been constitutionally elected. It is neither an acclaimed office nor an enigma, as with what happened on 10 August in the presence of the international community when they applauded and acclaimed a president without going through constitutional norms, without the president being elected according to the Senate's internal rules. That was a mystery. The page is now turned and must be turned completely. I have been awaiting this moment. It has arrived and I think we must now work quickly to endow the country with an executive because we must really begin considering the country's suffering and pain. [Jean] Bernard Sansaricq paid tribute to President Monde for his flexibility and determination in seeking a solution to the crisis, even though, he said, we have not always approved of his approach. Despite some differences in their positions, the two men have many points in common: Frantz Robert Monde and Bernard Sansaricq are both legislators from the southern region who have always been critical of President Aristide's seven months in office. In the face of what they call interference by the international community, they have always been uncompromising in their opposition and nationalism. Very often in the past, both the senator and the deputy have made the same speech using more or less the same words. [Sansaricq] The international community has its work and we have our work. The best answer we can give the international community is that we will install a serious and honest government with capable men. That is the answer they need. Once they have that answer and realize that we are determined to do something serious for the country, that the prime minister and the ministers who will be chosen will be competent, honest, and capable of running this nation, they will know it is the best answer. Dealing with them right now: Whether we greet Bouki [Haitian folk character] or not, he will eat us up anyway. I would therefore rather die standing up than crouched on my knees. [Jean] According to Turneb Delpe, there is nothing new in President Monde's position. The senator from the constitutionalist bloc explains that the president of the Chamber of Deputies has always expressed his preference for Article 149 of the Constitution. Sen. Delpe would have been surprised if he had said the opposite. [passage omitted] [end recording]
