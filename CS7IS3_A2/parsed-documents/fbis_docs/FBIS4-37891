Let me draw your attention to our correspondent's report: The rival groups in Afghanistan engaged in fighting in Kabul and its environs today, bringing one another's positions under rocket and heavy weaponry fire. In the course of the fighting the forces allied to Borhanoddin Rabbani, the Afghan president, subjected the positions of Hekmatyar's forces and the bases of the forces of General Dostam to severe shelling. The forces opposed to Rabbani, for their part, subjected parts of the northwest of the capital of Afghanistan to rocket attacks. According to a spokesman affiliated to the Afghan president, seven people were killed and more than 30 injured as a result of the opposition's rocket attacks and shelling. Government sources also reported air attacks by forces affiliated to the Afghan president on the positions held by General Dostam's forces on the Bala Hesar hill and its environs, and they claimed that they had captured some fortifications in that area; the opposition has rejected this claim.
