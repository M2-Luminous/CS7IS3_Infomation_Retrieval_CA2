Xiamen has, since reform and opening to the outside world began 14 years ago, approved 2,400 foreign-funded items with a total value of US$7 billion. Some 1,000 of the items were invested by Taiwan businessmen involving US$2 billion while the industrial output value of three-type foreign-funded enterprises made up 61.2 percent of the total in the municipality. With the scale of foreign capital introduced into Xiamen growing rapidly, matters related to laws and regulations emerging from economic activities, especially the investment process, are tending to increase. The current laws and regulations can no longer meet the needs of the adminstration of foreign investment. Laws and regulations on bankruptcy, settlement, notes, banking and mortgages have not yet come into effect, resulting in an adverse impact on the administration of enterprises and imposing direct obstacles to foreign investment. Mr Huang pointed out that with economic exchange and trade between Xiamen and Taiwan growing continuously, Taiwan businessmen hope for the availability of a corresponding legal environment to meet their business development. With regard to laws and regulations involving Taiwan, much time is needed to make legislation possible in the national legislature. The setting-up of Taiwan-funded enterprises, settlement of disputes and administration of these enterprises have long been had no specific laws and regulations to govern them, causing many difficulties to Taiwan- funded enterprises. Mr Huang believes that the authorization of legislation given to Xiamen by the current NPC session will enable the municipality to work out proper corresponding laws and regulations of its own to meet the needs based on observation of the Constitution and other relevant laws and regulations. Backwardness in legislation seen in Xiamen can be improved gradually and the municipality can move forward in promoting the use of foreign and Taiwan capital.
