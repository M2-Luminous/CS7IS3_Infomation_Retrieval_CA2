Hochenbichler, who is seriously ill [with cancer of the throat], still denies that he spied for a GDR embassy secretary. However, Interior Ministry investigators speak of a "dense network of evidence." Investigations are now extending to Libya. Hochenbichler reportedly had close contacts with a Libyan intelligence service agent. For many years al-Qadhdhafi's capital of Tripoli was considered the point of departure for sensational attacks. This ranged from OPEC terrorist "Carlos" to the bombing over Lockerbie. The Cologne Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has a Stasi document in its possession. The document, which is labeled "top secret" and has the file number 000898, lists Stasi measures to support Arab terrorists. A brief excerpt: - creation of logistical bases in the GDR capital with the inclusion of GDR citizens; - promotion of travel by liaison people of the Carlos group to the FRG and other West European countries; - efforts to acquire weapons, explosives, money, and information; - inspiration for acts of violence of armed struggle, including individual actions, attacks, etc. against the imperialist policy of the United States, the Zionists, and the clique around al-Sadat. Contact addresses were the embassies in Yemen, in Baghdad, and in Tripoli. Man in Vienna Became Very Interesting To put it clearly: All terrorist attacks organized via Tripoli were supported logistically by the Stasi. This makes a Vienna State Police official interesting for the GDR foreign espionage service HVA (Foreign Intelligence Collection Main Administration), because the most important counterespionage activities of western security authorities went across Hochenbichler's desk. The investigations also get a new dimension as a result of the allegedly close contacts between Hochenbichler and former GDR Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beil and Rudolfine Steindling, a Viennese businesswoman and the trustee of the Communist Party of Austria. The Berlin public prosecutor's office thinks that both played a central role in the "Koko" empire (Commercial Coordination) of GDR foreign currency acquisitor Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski. Multidigit billion sums were allegedly transferred illegally to other countries via Koko. An arrest warrant has been issued for Steindling in Germany. The hunted woman enjoys Hochenbichler's sympathy. After all, he was able to welcome "Red Fini" at his private party on his 50th birthday in the Vienna Police Directorate. "Poor Fini," the official pitied her, must now "invest millions in lawyers." Steindling's lawyer, Dr. Harry Neubauer, cannot say what links Hochenbichler with the businesswoman. However, he rules out that Hochenbichler's name turns up in the comprehensive Koko trial files. Beil, who is considered to be one of the architects of the Koko empire, is reportedly an old, intimate friend of Hochenbichler's. The state police official liked to boast of this friendship. At the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations, State Protection Department, Koko Chief Schalck-Golodkowski stated for the record that Beil had been an "unofficial employee" of the HVA "for decades." "In particular in Austria" he was working "unofficially."
