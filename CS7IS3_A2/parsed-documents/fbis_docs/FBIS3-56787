"Ukraine has been and will be a great missile and space power regardless of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from our territory," he told a meeting with the heads of the mass media in Kiev. "We have everything necessary to build missiles and fly into space," he added. Speaking on his attitude to the presidential elections in Crimea, Radetskyy pointed out that as defense minister he regarded this event "normally." "But as a citizen of Ukraine, I am confident that there must be only one president in the republic," he said. The minister also said an inspection of the Black Sea Fleet will be carried out in the near future. He said it was "costly" for both Russia and Ukraine to maintain the Black Sea Fleet. Summing up the results of the first two years since the creation of the Ukrainian army, Radetskyy said that during this time Ukraine concluded bilateral agreements on military cooperation with 19 states. During Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to Kiev scheduled for January 20-21, such an agreement is expected to be signed with Kazakhstan, too. According to Radetskyy, by now the Ukrainian army has been reduced by over 200,000 troops compared to last year. By the end of 1995, the republican armed forces will have 450,000 personnel.
