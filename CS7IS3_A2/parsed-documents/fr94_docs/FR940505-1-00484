An employer with 400 or more employees arriving at a single location during the peak travel period may survey a random sample of those employees if approved by the Administrator. All employees selected for the random sample must be accounted for either by the survey data, or a documented leave of absence. Any employee designated for the random sample that does not respond to the survey must be counted as arriving in a single occupancy vehicle. Employers desiring to conduct a random sample survey shall submit the following information to the Administrator: a sampling process and statistical methodology that will produce reliable and valid results consistent with a 95 percent confidence level; and, documentation that the person or persons conducting the survey have the qualifications to ensure the survey will be conducted in a statistically valid manner. The Administrator shall grant or deny approval for the random sample survey within 30 days of receipt of the methodology. (iv) An employer shall achieve an APO survey response rate of at least 75 percent of all employees assigned to report to the work location during the peak travel period. An employer that fails to achieve at least a 75 percent response rate on any APO survey shall repeat the survey until the required response rate is achieved. If the response rate is less than 90% but 75% or greater, all non-respondents shall be treated as single occupant vehicle commuters. If the response rate is 90% or greater, non-respondents shall be treated as having the same commute behavior as that of the average of the respondents. (v) An employer may use its own staff to conduct the APO survey or arrange with a market research or transportation consultant, local government, TMA, or other entity outside the employer to conduct the survey.
