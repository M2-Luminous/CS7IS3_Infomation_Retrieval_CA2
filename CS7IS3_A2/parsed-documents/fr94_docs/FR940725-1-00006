FR940725-1-00006 FR940725-1-00002 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION 12 CFR Part 325 RIN 3064&hyph;AB42 Risk-Based Capital Standards; Bilateral Netting Requirements AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC or Corporation). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The FDIC is proposing to amend its risk-based capital standards to recognize the risk reducing benefits of netting arrangements. Under the proposal, state nonmember banks would be permitted to net, for risk-based capital purposes, interest and exchange rate contracts (rate contracts) subject to legally enforceable bilateral netting contracts that meet certain criteria. The FDIC is proposing these amendments on the basis of proposed revisions to the Basle Accord which would permit the recognition of such netting arrangements. The effect of the proposed amendments would be to allow state nonmember banks to net positive and negative mark-to-market values of rate contracts in determining the current exposure portion of the credit equivalent amount of such contracts to be included in risk-weighted assets. DATES: Comments must be received by the FDIC on or before August 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to Robert E. Feldman, Acting Executive Secretary, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429.
