The explosion left six injured and damaged several buildings. The area is not dangerous right now, because the authorities have the situation under control. Our journalist Ana Fernanda Valderrama has the report. [Begin recording] [Valderrama] Thank you, Yolanda. At this time the debris left by the explosion of a bottled gas cylinder near El Brasero Dorado Restaurant, a few meters from the Attorney General's Office, is being removed. A new tragedy has occurred in Bogota due to lack of foresight. The authorities, fortunately, have the situation under control. Debris is being removed now, but earlier there was real panic, a veritable paralysis of downtown Bogota this morning. These are the first video clips that we have shortly after the tragedy occurred in downtown Bogota. Members of the Firemen's Corp, Civil Defense, and hospitals, as well as ambulances, arrived to evacuate the persons who were in the buildings and to try to control the situation in downtown Bogota, which was immersed in hectic activity as it is everyday. The authorities have confirmed that the explosion occurred when a gas truck was supplying gas to El Brasero Dorado Restaurant, at a time when -- this is being investigated -- a commercial establishment should not have been receiving gas. Authorities have confirmed that both the driver of the vehicle that was supplying the gas as well as the vehicle are being held, pending an investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office. We have the government subsecretary of the district, who will give us an official report at this time from downtown Bogota. Go ahead, Dr. Beltran. [Beltran] At 1011 this morning when the Gas Sur Company was supplying gas to this establishment a bottled gas cylinder exploded, causing what you see here. The authorities of the Prosecutor General's Office have initiated the pertinent investigations. A last-minute report indicates that 26 persons were injured. All have been treated at various hospitals. We learned that nine are in the San Juan de Dios Hospital, seven in the San Pedro Clavel Hospital, two in the San Ignacio Hospital, and eight in the Samaritano Hospital. Fortunately nobody was killed, and the persons who were injured are not in serious condition. There is one, however, who is being given special treatment. [Valderrama] Dr. Beltran, we want to clear up something that is important. Can gas be supplied at 1000 in the downtown part of the capital? [Beltran] No. In fact there is a regulation issued by the city mayor that restricts the loading and unloading of bottled gas in downtown Santa Fe de Bogota. Necessarily, it is prohibited to engage in this type of activity from 1000 to 1100 in the downtown part of the city. [Valderrama] Thus, another irregularity is turned over to the Prosecutor General's Office, which is investigating why this gas truck was supplying gas in downtown Santa Fe de Bogota at 1000 this morning. This has been a report from Jimenez and 4th Avenue, where there was an explosion today in the downtown part of the capital. [end recording]
