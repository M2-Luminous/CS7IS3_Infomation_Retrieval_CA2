In the discussion of the question as to whether or not Russia should sell arms, one is astounded by the simplicity with which many of our citizens approach this complex, delicate problem. Having digested a certain amount of superficial information, and not burdening themselves with a meticulous, comprehensive analysis, in all seriousness they offer proposals which not only possess content that often recalls the line of reasoning followed by Manilov in Gogol's Dead Souls, but which may also lead to serious negative consequences. In the estimation of the Ministry of Defense, the USA's share of the world arms market is currently around 60 percent. However, citing available official international data, Doctor of Historical Sciences A. G. Arbatov, a prominent specialist in security matters, asserts that of the total volume of world arms exports, which was $18 billion in 1992, the USA's share was approximately $8 billion, or only 46 percent. How correct are these estimates, and which is closer to the truth? Of course, the differences in the indicators are the product of different procedures for calculating them, and there is nothing prejudicial in this. Something else is important--correct manipulation of data obtained by means of some specific methodological approach, and a clear understanding of their limits. Having no information on the procedure by which the volumes of arms exports by different countries were estimated by specialists of the Ministry of Defense, we need to offer some clarifications regarding estimates of the world arms trade volume and the USA's share of it. The principal data were obtained from an analytical survey of armament and disarmament problems covering 1993, prepared by specialists of the Stockholm International World Problems Research Institute (SIPRI). There can be no doubt as to the high professionalism and objectivity of this well-known organization's scientists. And as with anyone concerned with maintaining one's scientific image, SIPRI specialists accompany the cost indicators of world arms trade volumes cited by them by the corresponding methodological explanations. It follows from these explanations that the data reflected in the SIPRI survey embrace only five basic forms of conventional arms: Warplanes and helicopters; armored equipment and artillery systems of 100 mm and higher caliber; radar stations and other electronic systems (tracking, control, guidance etc.); guided missiles; ships of the principal classes (with displacement greater than 100 tonnes). That is, export and import of forms of armament such as ammunition, infantry weapons, artillery armament of up to 100 mm caliber, military launches etc. are disregarded. Considering the complexity and the practical impossibility of clearly tracking deliveries of this assortment of military property, SIPRI specialists make special reference to their well-known table, which contains data on the world trade volume. In the meantime when he cites SIPRI data but fails to mention this reference, Mr. A. G. Arbatov unwittingly reduces the real volume of arms trade in the world, and the roll played in it by the USA. An estimate of the difference may be obtained by comparing the SIPRI estimate with indicators contained in a special annual report written by the research service of the U.S. Congress on deliveries of conventional arms to Third World countries. Thus according to the last report, which accounted for all deliveries of American arms through state and private channels, in 1988-1992 the USA exported weapons and military equipment to developing countries amounting to $36.2 billion in current prices. Considering that according to SIPRI data Third World countries represented only 36 percent of American exports of the main forms of conventional arms in the indicated period, and making the assumption that this proportion also applies to deliveries of other types of military property abroad, we find that total exports of weapons and military equipment by the USA in 1988-1992 were approximately $100 billion. In the meantime, we see an indicator of only $55 billion in the SIPRI survey; however, it corresponds only to that part of armament which the USA supplies to other countries. Thus, one of the indicators exceeds the other by 82 percent. With regard for this, and ignoring the nonessential error due to differences in prices observed in the Congressional report and in the SIPRI survey, and adopting an average coefficient of excess for the entire five-year period, we find that American arms exports in 1992 exceeded $15 billion. Why cite all of these complex calculations, which are tiresome to the reader and which aren't commonly found in newspapers as a genre? To once again demonstrate to our people that we continue to approach arms trade, which is such a complex problem, in a very superficial way, without accounting for the evolving realities. As a result, while we were waging a campaign of directive and, in many ways, unilateral conversion, and debating whether Russia should sell arms or not, the leading foreign military exporters, chiefly in the USA, began building up the efforts to increase their exports, including by penetrating into markets abandoned by us. As a result, a significant imbalance revealed itself in world arms trade, which was pointed out in particular by Russian President B. N. Yeltsin in his report to a joint meeting of the Council of the Federation and the State Duma in February 1994. Thus, while according to calculations the volume of American arms exports exceeded $15 billion in 1992, this indicator was only $2.3 billion for Russia (taken from the cited report to the U.S. Congress, and corresponding to our arms exports to Third World countries, because for practical purposes there were no deliveries to other countries in 1992). Indicators contained in the United Nations conventional arms register also attest to presence of such a large imbalance in the volumes of American and Russian exports of weapons and military equipment (a factor of more than seven times, and not the four times arrived at when using SIPRI data). Corresponding with this, in 1992 the USA exported 1,241 tanks (82 percent of world exports), 706 IFVs and APCs (63 percent), 166 large-caliber artillery systems (17 percent), 165 warplanes (69 percent) and 6 helicopter gunships (75 percent). Of these types of arms, Russia exported only 7 tanks, (0.5 percent), 198 IFVs and APCs (18 percent) and 26 warplanes (11 percent). The Soviet military-industrial complex was distinguished by a high potential in relation to creating and exporting defensive products, permitting it to successfully compete in the world arms markets. However, the USSR's disintegration significantly weakened this potential. First, in the heat of the infighting that engulfed us, and desiring to reach the finish line first, we began pursuing an uncoordinated arms export policy, and developing ill-conceived competition, which is ultimately leading to serious political and economic losses for all parties. In particular, when the same types of equipment are aggressively offered in the same markets, their prices decrease. Second, disturbance of the unified military-economic space seriously undermined our possibilities for designing state-of-the-art, competitive arms. Because of nondelivery of certain units and parts by some neighboring sovereign state it is impossible to manufacture and export entire weapon systems. Even Russia suffers this fate in some cases, despite the fact that it possesses the most powerful military-industrial base in the CIS. A meeting with the director of a certain defense enterprise comes to mind in this connection. When asked about seeking new export orders, he replied that he wasn't especially troubled by this (there was a demand for his products), and that the main problem was filling the orders already placed, which was jeopardized by violations of cooperative deliveries. This negative factor elicits serious apprehensions among our potential customers regarding the ability of CIS exporters to ensure dependable post-sales maintenance of the delivered weapon systems, which is extremely important to successful activity in the world arms market. As a result of these and a number of other causes, some countries that have been traditional importers of Soviet armament are starting to actively seek alternative sources of deliveries. For example India, which was the biggest purchaser of Soviet armament (the latter represented 80 percent of India's military imports in 1987-1991), has been developing military and economic cooperation with Western countries in recent years, thus attempting to insure itself against possible failures of military deliveries from CIS states. Concurrently, capitalizing on the problems in our military-industrial complex, arms exporters in Eastern Europe are also rushing into the Indian market. For example, during a recent visit to Delhi by a high-placed Hungarian military delegation, it was announced that Hungary was prepared to supply India with spare parts and equipment for MiG airplanes as well as for T-55 and T-72 tanks. Unfortunately, many of us who are concerned about proliferation of arms in the world believe the main threat in this sphere to be coming from the Russian military-industrial complex, which is striving to sell its state-of-the-art, competitive defensive products in the foreign market. But this is a deeply mistaken position, inasmuch as the solution to this problem must be approached under the conditions of strict parity, with all of the principal exporters and importers involved. Otherwise, tensions in certain regions of the world would not be reduced, inasmuch as other countries would deliver weapons there. In the meantime, not only will we fail to earn additional hard currency necessary to reform the Russian economy, but under the conditions of limiting defense orders to our own armed forces, ultimately we will transform from an arms exporter into an arms importer.
