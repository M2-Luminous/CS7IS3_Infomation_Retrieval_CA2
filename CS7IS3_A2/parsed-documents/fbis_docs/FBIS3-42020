Rol was born in Kiev, where he completed high school and received training at an aviation club. He studied at the Chernihiv Aviation School and later graduated from the Military Aviation Academy. He was a fighter pilot, a bomber pilot, and also did staff work. For three years, he was adviser to the commander of the Vietnamese Air Force. Even though Rol's military service was almost entirely outside Ukraine, he speaks very good idiomatic Ukrainian and this points to his family's healthy roots. for the state. [passage omitted] Bazelyuk: Did you take part in elaborating the Ukrainian Military Doctrine? What is your opinion about it? Rol: It is centered on defense. The doctrine adopted by the Supreme Council in October 1993 has become a state document, which soldiers must adhere to rather than assess. Bazelyuk: However, it is written in the doctrine that ``Ukraine must become, in the future, a nonnuclear state if other nuclear powers undertake similar actions.'' After it became a state document, some people in the upper echelons of power rushed to transfer nuclear weapons immediately to Russia. What is your position with regard to our state's nuclear status? Rol: Starting from 1991, I made many statements for the press and spoke from various rostrums. I said that Ukraine must have atomic weapons as a means of deterrence. Our state must possess nuclear weapons as long as at least one country, which may become our adversary and lead to a military confrontation, keeps its nuclear weapons. This is my opinion. No matter how big our army is, there is nothing like nuclear potential as a means for defending Ukraine. The position of our political leadership has led to several negative processes. Back on 24 August 1991, Ukraine, for some reason, proclaimed to the whole world that it was going to become a nonnuclear state. Another example. Why, people are asking, does Ukraine need the Black Sea Fleet, if it declared that it only needs the fleet for local needs? This gave rise to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet with all its consequences. It is a pity that we gave away our tactical weapons so quickly; they might defend Ukraine much better than the largest army. It is impossible to guarantee national security without modern weapons. Ukraine must proceed from the fact that it is impossible to ensure the defense of our state if we only rely upon guarantees offered by other states. In questions of Ukraine's defense capability and national security we may only rely upon our own forces. Why does the West help Russia in every way? Simply because it has a powerful nuclear potential and is, in this respect, a strong power. Bazelyuk: What are Ukraine's real possibilities for maintaining its nuclear status? Rol: First and foremost, it is up to our president. We might conduct a nationwide referendum on Ukraine's nuclear or nonnuclear status. You know, I am very annoyed when some state tells us didactically: ``You must give up your nuclear weapons.'' Who would dare make such claims upon China, Great Britain, or France? Bazelyuk: How do you assess that the personnel of the 43d Rocket Army has not, to this day, taken the oath of allegiance to Ukraine? Rol: I will investigate this situation as chairman of the SOU. Bazelyuk: You have been nominated as a candidate as Ukraine's people's deputy. Do you agree to stand for this post and why? Rol: I agree, because I have a clear picture of my work in the Ukrainian Parliament. Bazelyuk: Thank you for the interview, from which I have become convinced that, despite the enormous pressure exerted upon Ukraine both from the West and from the East, Ukraine will be able to create a reliable defensive shield with all those types of weapons necessary for this.
