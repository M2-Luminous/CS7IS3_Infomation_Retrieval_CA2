FBIS3-31487 "dreeu034__a94008" FBIS-EEU-94-034-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 February 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Colonel Denies Sale of Classified Information AU1802083794 Sofia BTA in English 1620 GMT 17 Feb 94 AU1802083794 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["General Staff Did Not Sell Classified Information" -- BTA headline] [Text] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- No information classified as state secret has leaked about the work on the Euroref International Geodetoc Project, Colonel Nikolay Ivanov, head of the Topographic Service with the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, said at a news briefing today. The Military Topographic Service has carried out its activities in compliance with the operative list of state secrets, he stressed. Besides Bulgaria, all Western and East European countries except for Russia took part in the project, Col. Ivanov said. Bulgaria's participation was organized by the Institute of Applied Geodesy in Frankfurt which is financed by the European Union. In 1992-1993 joint teams comprising representatives of the institute, Bulgarian military topographers, scientific workers and students determined the co-ordinates of 15 geodetic points in the territory of Bulgaria. A database is being build, which will make it possible for the geodetic and topographic services to harmonize the national geodetic network with the European and the world system of geographic co-ordinates, Col. Ivanov explained. This, according to him, will help solve some problems of the international air and sea navigation. The Bulgarian system of co-ordinates is top secret and the Frankfurt-based institute has no methodology that would enable it to get classified data on the co-ordinates of geodetic points in Bulgaria, Col. Ivanov said. He denied the allegations that appeared in DEMOKRATSIYA that classified information about Bulgaria's topography had leaked to the West and Turkey. Today's issue of DEMOKRATSIYA leads with an article describing the inclusion of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army in the Euroref Project as "an unprecedented blunder" and "treason." Not mentioning names, the paper cites the opinion of top military officials who said that the Bulgarian supreme commander-in-chief, President Zhelyu Zhelev, must hold the General Staff chief and the Army's civil leadership responsible for having sold state secrets. There were no Turkish military experts in the teams working in Bulgaria on the Euroref Project, Col. Ivanov said. There were no Bulgarian military experts in the teams implementing the project in Turkey either, he went on to say. The head of the General Staff Topographic Service denied the allegations that the Bulgarian military working in the geodetic teams had been paid handsomely. DEMOKRATSIYA's source is inaccurate and ill-meaning, Col. Ivanov said describing the article as an attempt to discredit the Bulgarian Army's Topographic Service and its General Staff.
