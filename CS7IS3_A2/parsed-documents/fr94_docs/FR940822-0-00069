FR940822-0-00069 FR940822-0-00021 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Rhode, Jr., Secretary, Panama Canal Commission, 1825 I Street NW, Suite 1050, Washington, DC 20006&hyph;5402, (Telephone: (202) 634&hyph;6441) (Facsimile: (202) 634&hyph;6439). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 1604 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 3794, and in the regulations at 35 CFR part 70, on April 18, 1994, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 18332) recommending a complete revision to the Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal contained in 35 CFR part 135. The change is designed to simplify the Commission's measurement procedures and bring measurement rules at the Canal in line with the worldwide standard of tonnage measurement as contained in the 1969 International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships. At that time, a written analysis showing the basis and justification for the proposed revision was made available to interested parties. The revised 35 CFR part 135 provides for: a. Establishment of measurement rules for the Panama Canal Commission which are based on Annex 1 of the Convention; b. Transitional relief measures for certain vessels, provided they do not have a structural change which results in an alteration of 10 percent or more in their total volume; c. Continued use of foreign tonnage authorities, and for acceptance of reasonably accurate volumes provided by them; d. Correction of tonnage values as necessary to satisfy the Commission's desire for accuracy; and e. Calculation of volumes for vessels without an International Tonnage Certificate 1969 (ITC 69) through an alternative tonnage estimating formula. In addition to the changes to 35 CFR part 135, certain administrative changes to 35 CFR part 133 (Tolls for Use of Canal) are required. These changes will reconcile the language of part 133 with the revised part 135 by allowing for the use of the ITC 69 to obtain the required total volume information. Written comments were solicited and received from interested parties, and a public hearing was held May 25, 1994 in Washington, DC. The views presented by the interested parties were considered by the Board of Directors of the Panama Canal Commission at its quarterly meeting of July 1994. On July 13, the Board agreed to recommend to the President the revisions to the existing measurement system and the implementation of the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS). The proposed rule and recommendation to the President was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 36398) on July 18, 1994. A complete record of the proceedings since the initiation of the proposal, including the views of the interested parties, was included in the Canal Commission's final recommendation forwarded to the President.

Measurements may be made by the admeasurers of the Canal or certain other officials worldwide as designated by the Panama Canal Commission. Each transiting vessel should have aboard and available to Canal authorities a full set of plans and a copy of the measurements which were made at the time of issue of its International Tonnage Certificate (1969), as well as the tonnage certificate itself. A copy of the International Tonnage Certificate (1969) shall be provided to Canal authorities. The Commission reserves the right to check and correct the total volume that is to be used in the calculation of the PC/UMS Net Tonnage.
