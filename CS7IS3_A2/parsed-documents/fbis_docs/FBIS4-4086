In a meeting with Kuniji Miyazaki, chairman of the Daiichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, Li said that China was now shifting to a market economy, so it needed to have a variety of means to raise money. He said that through mutual exchanges, overseas business people would certainly enhance their confidence in investing in China. "I am optimistic that Japanese banks will open branches in Beijing," he told Miyazaki and his party. Kuniji Miyazaki, who visited Beijing two years ago, said that during his current visit he wishes to discuss cooperation with his Chinese colleagues in banking reform. He said that his bank plans to hold financial symposiums in Shanghai and in Dalian, Liaoning Province. "I am sure that China will score even greater achievements in its economic construction," he said. The Daiichi Kangyo Bank, the largest commercial bank in Japan, had raised a total of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars for China by the end of 1993. It currently has a branch in Shanghai and offices in Beijing, Dalian, Xiamen and Guangzhou.
