Khashig says about 20,000 Russians, Armenians, and Jews have returned to Abkhazia from Russia over the three months since the end of the war. The issue of the return to Abkhazia of Greeks sent to Greece during the war is almost settled, and special Athens-Sukhumi flights are soon to be organized by a Greek firm for this purpose. The government commission for refugees has begun preparations to return Georgian refugees to Abkhazia's Galskiy Rayon. The commission held a random session yesterday in the town of Gali and met with the inhabitants of the rayon, he said. The crime situation in the area is bad, which hinders the return of refugees, the commission pointed out. A decision was made to tighten the curfew, the video reporter said. Refugees are returning without waiting for the issue to be finalized officially. Over 500 have already returned, not by the bridge over the Inguri River, but by the ford, which is dangerous. This means they avoid the checkpoint on the Georgian side that, strangely, is not letting them through. The refugees themselves told us that it is specifically the inhabitants of Gali Rayon who are being hindered from returning to their homes, the reporter said.
