FR940516-0-00025 FR940516-0-00012 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;7] Revocation of Class E airspace; Thomaston, GA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action revokes the Class E airspace that extends upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Thomaston, GA. The Reginald Grant Non Directional Beacon (NDB) was decommissioned on February 11, 1994. The standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) based on the NDB will be cancelled. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface will no longer be needed to contain Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at Thomaston, GA. The operating status of the airport will change from IFR operations to VFR operations concurrent with decommissioning of the NDB. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, May 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert L. Shipp, Jr., Airspace Section, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, ASO&hyph;532, Federal Aviation Administration, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta, GA 30320; Telephone (404) 305&hyph;5591. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation revokes the 700 foot Class E airspace area at Thomaston, GA. The Thomaston City Government advised the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of its decision to decommission the Reginald Grant NDB effective February 11, 1994. The FAA will cancel the Standard Instrument Approach based on the Reginald Grant NDB. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface will no longer be needed to contain IFR operations at Thomaston, GA. In addition, the operating status of the Reginald Grant Airport is changed from IFR operations to VFR operations concurrent with the decommissioning of the Reginald Grant NDB. Since this action merely involves the revocation of Class E airspace area, as a result of the removal of a navigation aid by the Thomaston City Government, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Additionally, since there will no longer be a SIAP at Thomaston, Georgia, Reginald Grant Airport, the Class E airspace area must be removed to avoid confusion on the part of the pilots flying in the vicinity of the Reginald Grant Airport and to promote safe and efficient handling of air traffic in the area. Therefore, I find that good cause exists, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for making this amendment effective in less than thirty days. Designations for Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1, effective September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be removed subsequently from the Order. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
