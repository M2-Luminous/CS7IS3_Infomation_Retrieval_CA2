Since 1989, in five years CAPM established a national diseases monitor network including 145 monitoring stations in 30 provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government and autonomous regions. The purpose of monitoring stations is to study people's health situation in China. The stations' major findings are: China's overall birthrate, mortality rate and infant deathrate are basically unchanged or somewhat decreased. However, rate of decrease is different from region to region. For example, overall birthrate and infant mortality rate in the rural areas are twice those of the cities. In poor rural areas, epidemic disease incidences of digestive system account for 50 percent of the category A and category B infectious diseases. Death rate of adult tuberculosis in poor rural areas ranks highest in the world. The four major causes of death in China are cardiocerebrovescular diseases, malignant tumors, respiratory diseases and accidents. Bronchial tumor, which increases at the annual rate of 4.5 percent in the nation and 10 percent in rural areas, is the major killing tumor of Chinese people. Accidents, especially traffic accidents, are increasing at a rate of 10 percent each year in China.
