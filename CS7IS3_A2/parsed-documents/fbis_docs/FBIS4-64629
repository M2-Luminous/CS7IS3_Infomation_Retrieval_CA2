Hello Manuel de Ramon, good evening. [Ramon] Former Minister Vicente Albero has explained that he resigned because he had mortgage bonds deposited in the office of the former receiver of the Madrid stock market, Manuel De La Concha. He gave Manuel De La Concha orders saying that these bonds were not to be speculated with. He had obtained these mortgage bonds when he resigned as managing director of the Marie Claire hosiery company in 1982. He was managing director until 1982, and then he got a job as general director in the socialist administration. He was paid in mortgage bonds which he deposited in Manuel De La Concha's office. Vicente Albero has repeated that he did not speculate while he was working as a politician and as a civil servant. He only worked at his job and he is not mixed up in any shady deals. This is all we can say just now.
