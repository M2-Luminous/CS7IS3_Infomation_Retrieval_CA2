The Association of Foreign Banks reports that the Finance Ministry has completed a regulation based on an agreement between the governments and banking supervisory boards of the United States and Germany. This will give U.S. banks much the same rights as banks from European Union [EU] countries. The Association thinks that this regulation might guide other non-EU countries as well. The Association of Foreign Banks, which has advocated extending the EU model to other non-European banks for some time, points out that U.S. banks will continue to be subject to approval and control by the Federal Banking Supervisory Board. The banks will, however, no longer be required to support risk assets by capital. In the field of big loans, European regulations must be observed, which limit the risk for the individual debtor to 25 percent of the bank's capital resources. What remains in force is the (costly) annual audit and a minimum capital of ECU5 million per subsidiary, which, according to the association, is, however, insignificant in terms of banking supervision.
