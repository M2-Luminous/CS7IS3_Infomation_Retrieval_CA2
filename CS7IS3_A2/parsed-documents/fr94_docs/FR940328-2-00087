March 21, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on March 14, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change consists of extending the pilot for amendments to Rule 116.30 for an additional year until March 21, 1995. 1 The amendments permit a specialist, upon request, to grant a stop in a minimum variation market for any order of 2,000 shares or less, up to a total of 5,000 shares for all stopped orders. 1 The NYSE received approval to amend Rule 116.30, on a pilot basis, in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28999 (March 21, 1991), 56 FR 12964 (March 28, 1991) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;48) (``1991 Approval Order''). The Commission subsequently extended the NYSE's pilot program in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 30482 (March 16, 1992), 57 FR 10198 (March 24, 1992) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;92&hyph;02) (``1992 Approval Order''); and 32031 (March 22, 1993), 58 FR 16563 (March 29, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;18) (``1993 Approval Order''). Commission approval of these amendments to Rule 116.30 expires on March 21, 1994. The Exchange seeks accelerated approval of the proposed rule change in order to allow the pilot program to continue without interruption. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The practice of ``stopping'' stock by specialists on the Exchange refers to a guarantee by the specialist that an order the specialist receives will be executed at no worse a price than the contra side price in the market when the specialist receives the order, with the understanding that the order may in fact receive a better price. Formerly, Exchange Rule 116.30 permitted a specialist to stop stock only when the quotation spread was at least twice the minimum variation (i.e., for most stocks, at least a 1/4 point), with the specialist then being required to narrow the quotation spread by making a bid or offer, as appropriate, on behalf of the order that is being stopped.
