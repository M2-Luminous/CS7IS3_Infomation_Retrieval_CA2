The assistance is part of the 200 million dollars Japan pledged last October to provide over two years to finance reconstruction of the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza strip, the official said. Of the total, the government disbursed 3.5 million dollars to a World Bank fund dubbed the "Holst Fund," which aims at financing administrative expenses, he said. The fund is named after the late Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Holst, who played an instrumental role in brokering the agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) last September for limited Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. The fund has so far collected 25 million dollars, but it is expected to fall short by 20 million to 25 million dollars in June because of the lack of administrative systems such as tax collection, the official said. On a yearlong basis, the shortage is expected to amount to some 120 million to 130 million dollars, he said. Tokyo also disbursed 10 million dollars through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to provide houses for 800 families of Palestinian police and 250,000 dollars to purchase computers for the police, he said. Another 1.5 million dollars was extended to the Palestinian Economic Committee for Development and Reconstruction (PECDR), he added.
