Vietnam's state bank governor welcomed the idea during Wichit's visit to the country last week. Wichit Suphinit, central bank governor, said Vietnam banks are specialized in industries and lack financial expertise to cope with international investors flooding into the country. Its specialist banks are involved with foreign trade, industrial development, construction and agriculture. The Thai central bank must first help Vietnam convert its banks into commercial facilities through the four-year training programmes it is offering the country's financial sector, said Wichit. Upcoming commercial banks will then be able to institute local and foreign loans to help bolster the country's economy, he added. Under the programmes, Thailand will receive Vietnamese banking officials for training in finance and stock market development. Vietnamese banks will be assisted in drafting banking regulations for loans, cheque clearing, promissory note issuance, bond issuance, loan repayments and share certificate transactions, said Wichit. The programmes will also address bankruptcy law, he added. Wichit does not foresee Vietnamese banks as a threat to Thailand's finance sector once they acquire commercial exposure. "Thai banks still have to accomplish many things for further development. For example, our form filings have to be upgraded to meet the European standards." Although Vietnam's banks will not pose competition for Thai banks, they will encourage our institutions to develop further, stressed Dr Som Chatusiphithak president of Thai Bankers Association. Vietnam, a promising investment area due to its abundant resources and low wage labour, recently launched several schemes to develop its financial sector. Aside from bank development, the country is planning a stock exchange for next year. Vietnam alone may not be able to set up an exchange due to high investment required for the entity. Formation of the bourse, however, would help large companies raise cheap funds, said Wichit. Prior to the bourse's establishment, Vietnam should upgrade its private and public organizations to meet listing qualifications. The country is currently drafting stock exchange regulations. A developed banking industry will support exchange procedures through loans to companies. As a result, companies will improve performance and qualify for listing. The central banker earlier said Vietnamese firms will be given listings on the Stock Exchange of Thailand if they meet requirements of the Thai bourse and the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, Wichit does not expect the Vietnamese exchange will encourage fund shifts from Thailand to Vietnam. Vietnam has applied for a seat in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Wichit dismissed the possibility that Asean's economic growth will drop once the country is admitted. Once Vietnam is an Asean member, Thailand will have an edge over other Asean members due to the cultural and geographical proximity.
