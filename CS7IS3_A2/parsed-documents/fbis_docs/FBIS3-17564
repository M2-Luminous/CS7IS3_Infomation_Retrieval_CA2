Of course, the main questions concerned the situation in Abkhazia. [Ivlev] Today, Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze, who is in Moscow, said in regard to the events in Kondor Gorge that they are the result of the Abkhazian side shooting at civilians with Grad installations. Intercepted radio communications talk of a large concentration of Abkhazian military formations near Sukhumi. Supporters of the late ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia are ready to join them. Aleksandr Chikvaidze spoke tersely about the aims of these military preparations by Abkhazia: [Chikvaidze] They are getting ready to start an attack on Mingrelia. [Ivlev] However, at the news conference questions were asked not only by representatives of the mass media. Among those present, journalists were surprised to see Former Georgian Defense Minister Tengiz Kitovani. In an exclusive interview for NTV he gave his forecast. If no peaceful solution to the conflict is found, then just like the Soviet Union was able to somehow be victorious over Germany during the Second World War, so Georgia will in a fatal struggle conquer the Abkhazians, he said. [Kitovani] But at present more important goals will be observed. In my opinion if a sensible, intelligent military chief is found, then other things will probably happen in Georgia. [Ivlev] In reply to the question of whether a major war could break out, Tengiz Kitovani answered: [Kitovani] This depends on the weather, both political and also how quickly the snow melts.
