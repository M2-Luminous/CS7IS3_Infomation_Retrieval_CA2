It is not official yet, but it is no secret that the [Belgian] F-16's cannot take part in the [possible NATO] operations because they are not fitted with the necessary equipment. However, the Netherlands' F- 16's are operational should air raids be decided. Christophe Deborsu has investigated this issue. [Begin recording] [Deborsu] Our F-16's were not involved in the Gulf war and they also will not be used in Bosnia. The F-16 is an excellent aircraft, but the Belgian Air Force has not had the [financial] means in 15 years to outfit it with proper components. Freddy van de Weghe, spokesman for Air Force foreign operations, explains why: [Van de Weghe] Our F-16's are not yet fitted with certain devices -- although they will be next year through the 1995 investment project -- in particular, with an electronic countermeasure system, which therefore makes them more vulnerable to certain types of antiaircraft weapons than other planes which are fitted with that system and which could be used in air raids. [Deborsu] Next year, our F-16's will finally be fitted with a so-called passive electronic countermeasure system. This device makes it possible for the pilot to know if an enemy radar has locked onto him. Thus, the pilot knows in advance if he is a target and, therefore, has some time to try to escape the enemy missiles. On the other hand, the Belgian Air Force cannot afford to purchase an "active" countermeasure system, i.e., a system that not only detects enemy radar but also jams it. The Netherlanders have electronic systems -- active and passive -- on their own F- 16's. Another problem is that the Belgian Air Force jets are not equipped with laser components. In order to target Serbian artillery positions with precision, without causing harm to the surroundings, the laser guidance system is by far the best solution. As a consequence, NATO will use, if necesary, aircraft better equipped than ours. But the lack of those electronic systems should not be criticized overly. Indeed, according to Beauvechain Air Force base, our pilots often beat foreign pilots who fly better-equipped planes during training sessions. The reason for this is easy to understand: The Belgian pilots have learned to make the best use of the limited equipment they have while foreign pilots are at a loss as soon as one of their gadgets breaks down.
