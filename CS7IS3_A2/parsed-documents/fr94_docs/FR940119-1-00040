FR940119-1-00040 FR940119-1-00011 5.4.8␣Hardware failure of both? XXXX 5.4.9␣Undetermined XXXX Question 6: Answer the following on leak detection system performance: 6.1␣What was the circumstance(s) under which data was collected for this segment and time period? 6.1.1␣System development (Y/N) XXXX 6.1.2␣Leak detection system pre-operational demonstrations on a segment of operational pipeline (define segment length) (Y/N) XXXX 6.1.3␣Existing system modification/testing (Y/N) XXXX 6.1.4␣Actual system operation (Y/N) XXXX 6.1.5␣Other (specify) XXXX 6.2␣For each leak detected by the system during the time period, include the following data: 6.2.1␣The specific detection threshold volume (include any error bandwidth that is incorporated in that amount)(bbls.) XXXX 6.2.2␣Pipeline length between leak detection measuring devices in the pipeline segment on which leak occurred (miles) XXXX 6.2.3␣Commodity transported at the time of the alarm XXXX 6.2.4␣Flow rate at the time of the alarm (bbls/hr) XXXX 6.2.5␣Estimated (or actual) leak volume (bbls.) XXXX 6.2.6␣Estimated (or actual if known) size of hole or rupture (in.) XXXX 6.2.7␣Estimated 7 (or actual) date and time leak occurred (MM/DD/YR & hours & minutes in military time) XXXX 7 Data provided from simulations should include the simulated leak start and end times, however, actual leak start times are not expected from operational data since there is a lag between the actual leak start and when it is detected. 6.2.8␣Date and Time leak detected (MM/DD/YR & hours & minutes in military time) XXXX 6.2.9␣Date and Time leak located (MM/DD/YR & hours & minutes in military time) XXXX 6.2.10␣Location of leak as indicated by leak detection system (mile post or survey station no.) XXXX 6.2.10.1␣Was a leak detection/SCADA system alarm issued (Y/N)? XXXX 6.2.10.2␣If ``yes'', the date and time alarm issued (MM/DD/YR & hours & minutes in military time) XXXX 6.2.10.3␣If ``yes'', the date and time alarm cleared (MM/DD/YR & hours & minutes in military time) XXXX 6.2.10.4␣Dispatcher response (check all that apply): 6.2.10.4.1␣Pipeline shutdown XXXX 6.2.10.4.2␣Leak detection system shutdown only XXXX 6.2.10.4.3␣Contacted pipeline personnel to check for operational or system explanations for alarm (other than a leak) XXXX 6.2.10.4.4␣Dispatched personnel to approximate leak location XXXX 6.2.10.4.5␣Other (specify) XXXX 6.2.11␣Actual location of leak as determined by field observation (mile post or survey station no.) XXXX Placement of EFRDs at water crossings, locations affected by commodity release, and rural areas where the public is in proximity The request for information notice, documented in the Department's March 1991 EFRD study, asked ``Where should RCVs and ACVs be placed and why?'' The response provided a number of specific locations, e.g., locations where possible ground movement might occur, and densely populated locations, such as near a school or hospital, near an office building or factory, or near a shopping center. River crossings were also specified by some commenters. Although conventional wisdom would seem to suggest installing RCVs at these locations, the RSPA presently has no data which supports requiring the installation of EFRDs at these locations. The number of these locations is unknown, but one of the following questions will solicit data on the number of such areas which might be affected by a pipeline release.
