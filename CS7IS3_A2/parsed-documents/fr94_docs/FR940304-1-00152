FR940304-1-00152 FR940304-1-00014 Efficiency levels analyzed for microwave ovens. The Department considers microwave ovens to comprise one class. For microwave ovens, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by incorporating a more efficient power supply, level 2 assumes a more efficient fan, in level 3 the wave guide is modified, level 4 assumes an improved magnetron, and level 5 adds reflective surfaces. 2. Payback Period for Conventional Ovens Table 4&hyph;10 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative classes of conventional ovens. For both representative classes, standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year.

Table 4&hyph;11 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative classes of conventional cooking tops. For the gas representative class, standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year.

Table 4&hyph;12 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for microwave ovens. Levels 1 through 3 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year.
