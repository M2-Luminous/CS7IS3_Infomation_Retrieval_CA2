In that agreement, we must take reality into account, which means we must reach a lasting solution for all problems connected to our economic, political, cultural, and other links. We must not concentrate only on those matters that are now seen as problems, and thus exclude far more essential questions. That is why we followed an example that seems the most acceptable in this situation; the agreement between Poland and Germany, solving all the questions between these two countries that have had great disputes throughout history. All of a sudden, different relations were created between these two countries, which is a good example of how Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Greece should solve the outstanding questions. Regarding the name, the Republic of Macedonia is the most suitable solution and is not only in our interests, but also in the interests of Greece. Here are the reasons for that: If our neighbor cools its emotions and starts thinking more realistically, it will see that all the other solutions proposed so far were deemed unsuitable by the negotiators, and therefore they were not accepted. The name "Northern Macedonia" was launched. Later, they said it was not adequate because it implied other situations leading to a desire for unification. "Vardar Macedonia" was the hit name for some time. Nevertheless, they dropped it because the Vardar River flows through Salonika. The name "Slav Macedonia" was very attractive to the Greek side. However, we were categorically against it because we have to take into account all the citizens of this country. The citizens must feel the country is their own. That is one aspect we have not discussed very much -- stability and a better future for this republic. After a number of proposals, I think our arguments are now being taken into consideration, and they are of a very simple nature. After it became clear in Edinburgh that there can be no solution without the word Macedonia, and yet a suffix is needed, the best suffix to our name is Republic, because Republic Macedonia is a legal and state entity and, as such, has its constitution and borders defined precisely by the constitution, which makes a clear distinction between the geographic name Macedonia and Republic Macedonia as a state. Any other solution will imply certain suspicions. The question of the flag and some other questions are matters that we are ready to debate. It is impossible to look for an outcome of this situation without open dialogue, which must normally be based on the force of argument. There will be no outcome if one side or the other imposes selective solutions. That is why we see the solution in a broader discussion that will provide prosperity to our relations. After all the events that have taken place in the north, it is now the moment to look at these matters with open eyes, with a defined vision in looking for a solution to the problems, without entrenching ourselves in our Balkan positions, which could make the lives of this and future generations uncertain.
