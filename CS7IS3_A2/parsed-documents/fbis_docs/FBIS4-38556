The Latvian foreign ministry press center reported today that a note received Monday from the Russian foreign ministry expresses the hope that in the near future Latvia will ratify agreements regulating the withdrawal of the Russian army from Latvia, as well as the social guarantees for Russian military pensioners and their family members. The assigning of most favored trading status means that each country will refrain from imposing unequal conditions on its trading partner with respect to import and export customs duties, as well as regulations affecting the imposition of duty on goods, transit, and other regulations connected with foreign trading relations. The mutual exchange of goods by the two states will be increased, effective since 15 March this year, when the Russian government set a range of higher import tariffs on goods, as export to Russia has become unprofitable for Latvia. At present Russia is still Latvia's biggest trading partner. Goods manufactured in Latvia and exported to Russia account for about thirty percent of the total volume of Latvia's exports. Latvia is the first Baltic country to actually attain most-favored-trading status with Russia.
