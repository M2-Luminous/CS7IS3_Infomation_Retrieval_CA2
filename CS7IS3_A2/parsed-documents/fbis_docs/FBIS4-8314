"Similar actions could have expanded and internationalized the armed conflict, they could have led to a confrontation between the great powers in an extremely risky way, they could have turned the international community from a part of the mechanism regulating the conflict into a part of the problem itself; there still is such a danger," the statement says. According to Mr. Slatinski, "there is also the danger of the great powers learning to cleanse themselves from their sins, inaction, contradictions and impotence by air strikes". In the view of the National Security Committee chairman, there is yet another reason for serious concern about the developments in the Balkans: the fate of the Bulgarian minority on the territory of Eastern Serbia, which once belonged to Bulgaria but "were detached from it by great powers in an utterly unjust and cynical way under the Treaty of Neuilly in 1919". "Bulgaria has taken the heaviest losses as a result of the strict application of sanctions against ex-Yugoslavia," Mr. Slatinski said at today's news conference. "The international community should clearly state that after the settlement of the conflict, Bulgaria will be given the right to participate in rebuilding the countries in ex-Yugoslavia under preferential terms," he pointed out. "Given the colossal losses suffered by non-embargoed countries, no doubt the lack of compensations will discredit sanctions as the most important instrument of the United Nations," Mr. Slatinski says in his statement circulated today. "To right a wrong by doing another wrong undermines the efforts of the world community and makes them pointless," Mr. Slatinski's statement reads. "While Europe continues to distance itself from the Balkans, a process of nuclear buildup is going on in the region; NATO has not stopped guarding itself against threats and risks... Today our neighbours are on friendly terms with us, but what about tomorrow?", is Mr. Slatinski's question. "We need mechanisms of control, confidence building, protection and easing tensions," it is said in his statement. In Mr. Slatinski's opinion, Bulgaria stands a chance of becoming a factor in the region. "Bulgaria's primary national interest is its non-involvement in the military conflict in the region," the chairman of the Parliamentary National Security Committee said. "But who can guarantee that Bulgaria will assume the role of a passive observer if the developments in the Balkans take a turn for the worse and its national security and national interests are directly threatened?" Mr. Slatinski says in his statement.
