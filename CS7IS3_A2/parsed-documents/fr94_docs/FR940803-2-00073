FR940803-2-00073 FR940803-2-00059 Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (McDonald's Corporation, Common Stock, No Par Value, With Attached Rights) File No. 1&hyph;5231 July 26, 1994. McDonald's Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Pacific Stock Exchange Inc. (``PSE''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Company, its Board of Directors of the Company (the ``Board''), pursuant to lawfully delegated authority, unanimously approved resolutions on May 27, 1994, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the PSE. The decision of the Board was based upon the belief that the listing of the Common Stock on the PSE was no longer beneficial to the Company due to minimal volume of trading of Company shares on the Exchange. Further, an adequate market exists for trading of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). Any interested person may, on or before August 16, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan D. Katz, Secretary.
