The parliament's presidium will put forward candidacies for participation in the delegation by the next regular meeting which will take place in a week (on 17 June). This decision was adopted after most of Crimean deputies had withheld their approval of the final document signed by the Crimean parliament working group and the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet deputy commission signed on 3 June and stating that Crimea was a part of Ukraine. The working group on the coordination of Ukrainian and the Crimean legislation was established last week in Simferopol in order to put forward proposals on coordination of the Ukrainian and Crimean constitutions by 15 June. Crimean Chief Negotiator Sergey Nikulin stated that some pro-Russian deputies though it was necessary to sign a document with more decisive formulas mentioning Crimea as an independent republic. However, Nikulin said that the Ukrainian and the Crimean delegations had tried to prevent forceful methods of settlement of the discord in the legislation. The present conflict between Kiev and Simferopol emerged after the Crimean parliament had restored the Crimean Constitution in its version of 6 May 1992, providing for a treaty basis for relations with Ukraine and for dual citizenship for Crimeans.
