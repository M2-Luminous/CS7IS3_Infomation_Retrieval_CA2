He was reacting to the words of Peter Sokol at yesterday's SNS briefing (a report on which we comment elsewhere--editor's note) that important documents, "the publication of which would not necessarily cast a good light on the president's moral qualities or his credibility," disappeared at the time Cernak left the party. Cernak went on to say that, when the new SNS chairman took office, he asked him to take over all of the documents according to a list in the safe. When leaving the party, he handed over to SNS First Deputy Chairwoman Eva Slavkovska documents that he himself had taken over and other important documents that should be filed by the SNS. According to Cernak, the specific document mentioned at the SNS briefing was the minutes of a meeting between SNS representatives and the then presidential candidate Michal Kovac, which cannot bind the president in any way and cannot be misused. After the signing of the coalition agreement with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, the proposal was made that this document be sent to the president. "I physically destroyed those minutes because their contents had become irrelevant. I would never use them in the way described by Peter Sokol, nor could they be used in such a way," Cernak added.
