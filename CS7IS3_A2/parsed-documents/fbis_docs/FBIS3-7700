Regarding short-term economic forecasts, views were divided among the executives, with 50 of them saying they feel the economy is either "recovering gradually," "firming down," or "close to hitting the bottom," and the other 50 saying they feel the economy "remains at the bottom." However, while the previous survey (conducted in November 1993) showed that one-third of the executives felt the economy was "worsening," this time there were none. As to when the economy would move toward recovery, 56 executives said they feel this will happen between October to December this year, indicating they hold high hopes the economy would begin recovering by the end of the year. Increased consumer spending and housing investments were cited as major reasons the executives feel the slumping economy is bottoming out. On the other hand, the yen's further appreciation against other currencies and more layoffs were concerns cited by many executives. Notable was the fact that the number of executives who stressed "political instability" as a source of concern jumped from five in the previous survey to 33 in the latest survey. Since economic prospects still remain uncertain, most executives said they feel the government should take further action, recommending that income tax cuts be continued after fiscal year 1994 and further deregulation be promoted. ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted its survey from 14 to 25 March by holding personal interviews with top executives, as a rule. Regarding the current state of the economy, two of the executives said the economy is "beginning to expand." Thirty-one said it is "firming down," while 17 said it is "close to hitting the bottom." In the previous survey, none said the economy was "firming down" or "close to hitting the bottom." If we look at the manufacturing industry and the services sector separately, the results of the survey show that 19 executives from the services sector said they feel the economy is "firming down." In contrast, 30 executives from the manufacturing industry said they feel the economy "remains at the bottom." These results were in line with the fact that many executives from the services sector cited increased consumer spending as a positive economic factor, while many from the manufacturing industry cited little growth in investment in plant and equipment as a negative factor. It can thus be said that the manufacturing industry, which by itself has experienced the effects of diminished investment in plant and equipment, has given a less-than-optimistic view about current economic conditions. In the previous survey, predictions as to when the economy would start recovering were evenly divided among those executives who predicted recovery between July and September 1994, those between October and December 1994, and those who predicted recovery after 1995. This time, however, 56 of the executives predicted economic recovery between October and December this year. There were 27 executives who predicted the economy would not recover until next year, but they were mostly from retail merchandising, transportation, steel, and chemical firms. Executives predicted real economic growth would remain low for fiscal year 1994. Fifty-seven of them said the economy will grow in real terms by 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent, and 24 said it will grow by less than 0.5 percent, while none predicted growth over 2 percent. This indicates there is a wide gap between the executives' predictions and the government's prediction of 2.4 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Regarding areas where they want the government to step up its efforts, the executives said they hope for continued income and residence tax cuts and increased spending on public works projects. Notable, however, were some executives saying that "effects of increased spending on public works projects, which has been the mainstay of the government's traditional pump-priming measures, have become diluted." Asked about steps government should now take, 82 of the executives said they want tax cuts to be continued in fiscal year 1995. Forty-eight of them cited "vigorous promotion of deregulation," indicating they hold high expectations for renewed vitality in the private sector through the implementation of structural economic reforms.
