Smajl Terzic reports: [Begin Terzic recording] They [the Serbs] are fleeing from Novi Seher via Dubrave toward Teslic, and they are also withdrawing part of their forces via (Globarica) toward Mt. Ozren. This is the first time that this has happened since the outbreak of the war as their warlords well appreciate the power of the united forces of the 3d Corps, units of the 7th South Operative Group, and the two HVO brigades, the 110th Glorious Usora Brigade and the 111th Zepce Brigade. These territories, which were occupied for nine months, were indeed occupied only temporarily. This great victory by the forces of the B-H Army and the HVO is the result of highly coordinated activities. It is in fact the result of Article 6 of the Washington Agreement concerning joint military activities of the B-H Army and the HVO on the ground. Therefore, this is the beginning of the end of the aggression, and it is taking place in the 7th South Operative Group's theater of operations. By the way, the enemy has not been silent today. This morning he fired mortars at the villages of Jelak and Sije, in the theater of operations of the 207th Glorious Pousora Fierce Brigade, and [word indistinct]. [end recording]
