Those evils and dangers have harmed and are harming not only Iraq, but also the intervening sides themselves and the neighboring country of Turkey, on whose territory the foreign intervention forces are stationed. The U.S. Administration has tried to mislead many people by saying that its intervention in Iraq's internal affairs and the presence of the coalition forces in Turkey are aimed at enforcing a security zone in northern Iraq and maintaining the security and stability of the region. So, what are the results of this aggressive U.S. intervention? One main result of this intervention is that it has undermined Iraq's sovereignty, although the U.S. Administration and the coalition forces say that they support Iraq's unity and territorial integrity and oppose any action that is prejudicial to its sovereignty. Another result of this aggressive intervention is what we see happening in northern Iraq today; acts of murder, destruction, plunder, and sabotage of all that the 17-30 July Revolution and the autonomy institutions have built for the well-being of our Kurdish people in the Autonomous Region. Incidents are reported every day in which government officials and foreign news correspondents become victims due to the lack of security and the physical liquidations taking place between numerous foreign elements and agent parties in northern Iraq. Some U.S. quarters have tried to blame Iraq for the incidents taking place in that region, where conditions are unnatural and unsafe due to the continuous foreign intervention and where gangs of agents, vagabonds, and robbers have taken over control under foreign protection. Let us ask: How can any country in the world guarantee security in a region which is not under the direct control of its security organs? Whoever follows events will discover that foreign intervention is not in anyone's interest. This intervention, which directly affects Iraq, since it is taking place on its territory and undermining its national sovereignty, is also detrimental to the interests of the coalition states themselves, especially the neighboring country of Turkey, which Iraq has never tried to harm, and with which Iraq has sought good-neighborly relations and strong economic ties. What has the United States gained from its continuous intervention in northern Iraq and the continued presence of its forces in Turkey? The United States and some of its Western allies have gained nothing but disappointment and failure. As for Iraq, it overcame its ordeal a long time ago when it confronted the coalition aggression and when its struggler people resisted in the Mother of Battles and reconstructed what was destroyed by aggression. Washington and its Western allies reaped failure and losses and its hostile program witnessed repeated defeats. Perhaps, the shooting down of the two U.S. helicopters by two U.S. fighter bombers is best proof of this disappointment and the failure of the policy of intervention in Iraq's affairs. All the claims about safeguarding security and human rights which President Bill Clinton's advisers bragged about have all fallen at once. Of all Iraqi territory, the region witnessing the intervention of the aggressor states is the only one lacking security. As for the question of human rights, it is a ridiculous issue of U.S. foreign policy, because the Clinton administration, which talks about human rights, did not hesitate to kill 15 Americans and others of different nationalities, including Kurds, thinking the helicopters were Iraqi. The U.S. Administration needs to make a general revision of its entire policy in the region, especially toward Iraq. Iraqi national unity has all the historical bases and means of continuity and viability in the present and the future. Washington itself admits this fact. Therefore, the recent incident must sound the alarm concerning the continuation of intervention. The recent U.S. decision to suspend flights over northern Iraq does not offer a solution. The correct solution which responds to the interests of Iraq, Turkey, and other states in the region is withdrawing the coalition forces from the region and building correct relations which will meet everyone's legitimate interests. Therefore, what is correct is for the United States to stop intervening in Iraq's affairs, pull its forces out from the region and adopt new relations with Iraq based on accommodation and achieving common interests, and abandoning the policy of saber rattling and threats of intervention, because developments and facts have proven the futility of this policy.
