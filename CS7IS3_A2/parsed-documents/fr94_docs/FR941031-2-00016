FR941031-2-00016 FR941031-2-00013 [A&hyph;570&hyph;838] Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Honey From the People's Republic of China agency: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. effective date: October 31, 1994. for further information contact: David J. Goldberger or Louis Apple, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4136 or (202) 482&hyph;1769, respectively. Initiation of Investigation The Petition On October 3, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form by members of the American Beekeeping Federation and the American Honey Producers Association. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioners allege that honey from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a United States industry. Petitioners have stated that they have standing to file the petition because they are interested parties, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of a significant portion of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to this petition, it should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are natural honey, artificial honey containing more than 50 percent natural honey by weight, and preparations of natural honey containing more than 50 percent natural honey by weight. The subject products include all grades and colors of honey whether in liquid, creamed, comb, cut comb, or chunk form, and whether packaged for retail or in bulk form. The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under subheadings 0409.00.00, 1702.90.50, 2106.90.60, 2106.90.61, 2106.90.65, and 2106.90.69 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. United States Price and Foreign Market Value United States Price Petitioners based United States price (USP) on contract prices from a U.S. importer of the subject merchandise from the PRC. In calculating USP, petitioners deducted amounts for the following: U.S. duties, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. harbor maintenance fee, U.S. merchandise processing fee, and the Honey Board fee (a U.S. Department of Agriculture assessment on honey or honey used in honey products in the United States). Foreign Market Value A. Non-Market Economy Determination Petitioners contend that the PRC is a non-market economy (NME) country within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act. The Department has determined in previous investigations that the PRC is an NME, and the presumption of NME status continues for purposes of initiation of this investigation. See e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Paper Clips from the PRC , 59 FR 51168 (October 7, 1994) (Paper Clips). In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, foreign market value in NME cases is based on NME producers' factors of production, valued in a market economy country. Consistent with Department practice ( see Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Glycine from the PRC , 59 FR 38435, July 28, 1994), absent evidence that the PRC government determines which of its beekeepers/processors shall produce for export to the United States, we intend, for purposes of this investigation, to base FMV only on those beekeepers/processors that produced honey sold to the United States during the period of investigation (POI). In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME determination and provide relevant information and argument related to the issues of the PRC's NME status and granting of separates rates to individual exporters. B. FMV Calculations Petitioners calculated FMV on the basis of the valuation of factors of production derived from information developed by a market researcher in India about production processes in India, which petitioners claim are similar to the PRC. Petitioners valued these factors, where possible, based on publicly available published information from India ( see foreign market research report submitted by petitioners on October 14, 1994, at Exhibit 1). Petitioners argue that India is a country at a comparable level of economic development to the PRC and India is a significant producer of comparable merchandise, thus meeting the requirements of section 773(c)(4) of the Act. For purposes of this initiation, we have accepted India as an appropriate surrogate country selection. Where Indian values were not available, petitioners valued the factors of production using the U.S. industry's costs, where petitioners determined that this provided a reasonable basis upon which to value such factors. Petitioners provided FMV calculations based on data associated with two species of bee known to produce honey in the PRC, i.e. , the low-yield A. cerana (eastern) honeybee and the high-yield A. mellifera (western) honeybee. Petitioners have provided public information which indicates that each species accounts for approximately one-half of the commercial honey-producing colonies in the PRC ( see October 14, 1994, submission of petitioners, at p. 8). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.52(a)(2), petitioners' FMV for the two species consisted of the sum of beekeeping costs, processing costs, profit, and packing, and the factors were valued as follows: •For variable and fixed costs associated with beekeeping operations, as well as processing costs, petitioners used Indian factors of production based on their foreign market research. •For labor costs associated with beekeeping operations, petitioners relied on Indian factors based on their foreign market research. Petitioner valued labor costs on the basis of publicly available Indian agricultural wage rates. •Petitioners added amounts for transportation and land-lease costs associated with high-yield western honeybee beekeeping operations, and valued these based on a U.S. producer's cost-per-pound. •For profit, petitioners used the profit margins for beekeeping operations contained in their foreign market research, and the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of production for processing operations. •Petitioners added an amount for packing in steel drums based on a U.S. producer's cost per drum. Based on our analysis of the petition and petitioners' subsequent amendments, we have made certain adjustments to petitioners' FMV calculations as follows:
