A strike by transport workers of the Luchegorsk opencast coal mine, which is the main supplier of fuel for the Primorskaya state regional electric power station, the giant of far eastern power engineering, has been going on for ten days now. The shortfall in deliveries of coal over the ten days exceeds 500,000 tonnes. The main reason for the protest action was that the transport workers' wages are regularly overdue and they have not been paid since April. Besides this, the strikers are demanding the abolition of tariff cuts, as well as the resignation of the director of the main enterprise of "Primorskugol". In their turn, the administration of the transport directorate, believing the action to be illegal, have instituted court proceedings against the strikers. In response, according to a report from Mikhail Byankin, chairman of the strike committee, their families will picket the court sitting.
