FR940921-0-00134 FR940921-0-00016 88. Section 86.1227&hyph;96 of subpart M is amended by revising the section heading and paragraphs (b) introductory text and (b)(2) to read as follows: §86.1227&hyph;96 Test procedures; overview. * * * * * (b) The evaporative emission test (gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, and methanol-fueled vehicles) is designed to determine hydrocarbon and/or methanol evaporative emissions as a consequence of diurnal temperature fluctuation urban driving and hot soaks during engine-off periods. It is associated with a series of events representative of heavy-duty vehicle operation, which result in hydrocarbon and/or methanol vapor losses. The test procedure is designed to measure: * * * * * (2) Running losses resulting from a simulated trip on a chassis dynamometer, measured by the enclosure or point-source technique (see §86.1234; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles); and * * * * * 89. Section 86.1230&hyph;96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b), to read as follows: §86.1230&hyph;96 Test sequence; general requirements. (a)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. The test sequence shown in figure M96&hyph;1 of this section shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the standards set forth. The full three-diurnal sequence depicted in figure M96&hyph;1 tests vehicles for all sources of evaporative emissions. The supplemental two-diurnal test sequence is designed to verify that vehicles sufficiently purge their evaporative canisters during the dynamometer run. Sections 86.1232&hyph;96, 86.1233&hyph;96 and 86.1238&hyph;96 describe the separate specifications of the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence. (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. The test sequence shown in figure M96&hyph;1 of this section shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the standards set forth, with the exception that the fuel drain and fill and precondition canister steps are not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. In addition, the supplemental two-diurnal test and the running loss test are not required. (b) The vehicle test for fuel spitback during fuel dispensing is conducted as a stand-alone test (see §86.1246). This test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. * * * * * 90. Section 86.1232&hyph;96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (b) and (f), to read as follows: §86.1232&hyph;96 Vehicle preconditioning. * * * * * (b)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. Drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in §86.1213, to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in §86.082&hyph;2. The fuel cap(s) shall be installed within one minute after refueling. (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. Vehicle fuel tanks are to be filled with fuel that meets the specifications in §86.113. Fuel tanks shall be filled to a minimum of 75% of service pressure for natural gas-fueled vehicles or a minimum of 75% of available fill volume for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior draining of the fuel tanks is not called for if the fuel in the tanks already meets the specifications in §86.113. * * * * * (f)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. Within five minutes of completion of the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the dynamometer and parked. For gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles, drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in §86.1213, to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in §86.082&hyph;2. The vehicle shall be refueled within one hour of completion of the preconditioning drive. The fuel cap(s) shall be installed within one minute after refueling. (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. Within five minutes of completion of the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the dynamometer and parked. Vehicle fuel tanks shall be refilled with fuel that meets the specifications in §86.113. Fuel tanks shall be filled to a minimum of 75% of service pressure for natural gas-fueled vehicles or a minimum of 75% of available fill volume for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior draining of the fuel tanks is not called for if the fuel in the tanks already meets the specifications in §86.113. * * * * *
