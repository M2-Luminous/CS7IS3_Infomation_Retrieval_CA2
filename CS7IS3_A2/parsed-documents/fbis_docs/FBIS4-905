Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya centered his address on the major issues that are facing our country following the crisis and have paralyzed the country since October last year. Matthias Ndahirigije has gone into this address, here is his report: [Ndahirigije] Peace seems to prevail on the whole country, but insecurity and suspicion are not mainly uprooted yet because mutual hatred still haunts the population and lack of confidence hasn't been swept away at all. In such state of affairs, the population think that evils are intellectuals because it is the latter who always create disorders in the country while fighting for powers. For the Burundi ad-interim head of state, current chairman of the National Assembly, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the population has suffered too much and wants peace now. Time has come to come together, work together, and overcome all partisan tendencies which can't lead nowhere else than to catastrophe. It's true that some provinces have now a state of security somehow calm but in some other areas of the country, such as the capital Bujumbura, especially the mayorship of Bujumbura, the situation is rather deteriorating. Ethnic cleansings have led to the creation of ethnic settlements and barbarous acts can no more allow free traffic and free circulation of people. For the ad- interim president of the Republic, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the state can't allow such ethnic settlements because the country should serve every citizen. For him, it is too deplorable to see quarters like Kinama, Kamenge, and others to become Hutulands, and quarters such as Nyakabiga, Ngagara, and others become Tutsilands. For Mr. Ntibantunganya, everyone should bear in mind that all Burundians are all citizens, and therefore should share all opportunities offered by the state. It's true that since 21 October, the country lives a strong crisis but if everyone could feel involved in the settlement of it, a lot could be settled down. That's why he called upon administration forces, order forces, lawmen, and churchmen to feel involved and do whatever necessary to restore peace and mutual confidence. Therefore, some activities seem to take priority over others. First of all, the state should organize the relocation of displaced persons and start the reconstruction of all damaged equipment or buildings, start quickly the disarming of the civil population because this is a prerequisite for the restoration of peace in the country. Another priority task would focus mainly on the youth (?training) which is becoming more or less impossible in the capital Bujumbura. The OAU and UN observers are also appealed to backing this mission of restoring peace in the country. Earlier he had congratulated all order forces for having done whatever possible to keep security.
