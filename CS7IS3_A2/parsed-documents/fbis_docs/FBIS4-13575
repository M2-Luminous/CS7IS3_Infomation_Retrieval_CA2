The time is propitious. The security forces have made important gains in the recent past and the militant groups have been pushed onto the defensive. Beginning the process of reconciliation assumes greater importance if the Government wants to go ahead with its plans for an early election in the Valley. Though neither their firepower nor their ability to strike has diminished greatly, the militants have now begun to talk in terms of not just Kashmiri Muslims but the entire community. This is a definite signal and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief, Mr. Bashir Ahmad Bhat's observations about inducting non-Muslims into the Kashmiri struggle are a case in point. The Hurriyat leaders are in Delhi on a prolonged mission to test the mainstream waters. The contours of the reconciliation will of course have to be traced with care. It need not be the much talked about "package" of economic goodies that is better left to a popular Government which emerges out of the polls. But if the gains made in the Valley have to be consolidated, the psychological moment has to seized. The fatigue induced by the bloodshed in the Valley is showing. The anger of the people with the Indian political and security establishment is, no doubt unabated. But Pakistan's misadventure at the UN Human Rights Conference at Geneva may have opened the eyes of Kashmiris to the real nature of Pakistan's interest in prolonging their agony. At the same time, there are indications that the strain of living under the gun for five long years has begun to tell. To that extent, the policy of firmness may have paid off, but to pursue it to the exclusion of a political and psychological initiative will be counter-productive. What is urgently needed is a willingness on part of the Government to think of an amnesty for those incarcerated militants against whom there are no specific charges. Excesses by security forces have to be accounted for. Interaction between the administration and the people has to be tempered with greater sensitivity. Such generosity will send a positive signal and create an atmosphere of goodwill which, in the fullness of time can translate itself into conditions conducive for a democratic exercise of people's will. Dr. Karan Singh has also called for setting up a separate ministry for Kashmiri affairs, apparently in reference to the multiplicity and divergence of approaches in the Union Home Ministry. Going by past experience, ministries such as the Mr. S.B Chavan's Home Ministry, do not solve problems. They are the problem.
