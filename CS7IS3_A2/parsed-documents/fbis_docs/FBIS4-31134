They are still taking advantage of the night to bring in new manpower reinforcements and to [word indistinct] the arsenal of weapons in order to pound our defense lines, as well as to [word indistinct] set off into new infantry assaults that are successfully repelled by the heroes of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although they failed to cause the slightest disorder or disorganization among our fighters, (?yesterday's) missiles, which have not been used on this section of the battlefield before, show that the chetniks are using their last trump cards to [word indistinct] the security zone around Doboj. During the night, in the zone covered by the 109th Doboj Brigade and the 111th (?Gracanica) Brigade, apart from activity with various weapons of diverse calibers, the chetniks brought to the regions of (?Svjetlica), Radic, and [word indistinct] dozens of trucks with new chetnik forces and equipment. This certainly represents the latest replacement of forces that were crushed by our fighters during the chetnik eight-day infantry assaults on our defense lines. In the shelling of civilian districts of Klokotica, Brijecica, Lukavica, and Lukavica Rijeka, eight people were seriously or lightly wounded yesterday, while the material damage is huge. As I report, the chetniks are intensively shelling our defense lines, which is only a preparation for (?mindless) new infantry assaults. The great fighters of the 109th Doboj Brigade and the 111th Gracanica Brigade are firmly maintaining our defense lines and are determined not to permit chetniks [words indistinct].
