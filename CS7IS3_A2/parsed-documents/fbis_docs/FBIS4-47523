During this, consideration of dynamic processes caused by a change of the imposed connections greatly improved the quality of algorithms of control and, especially, decreased loadings on control mechanisms. Mathematical modelling of the movement of a machine with biomechanical mesurements of parameters of human walking were presented and discussed. Conclusions of other authors concerning this question were discussed. References 47: 37 Russian 10 Western.
