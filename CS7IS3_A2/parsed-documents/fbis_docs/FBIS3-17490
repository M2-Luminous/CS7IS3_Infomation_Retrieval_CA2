Sceptics' forecasts were not proved false as an average of 40 per cent of registered Stavropol voters turned out for the secret balloting in the territory's 25 districts. According to the preliminary results, the overwhelming majority of voters preferred those who had already had experience in running the territory's complicated economy and in implementing Russian reforms. The electoral mandate was won by almost all of the municipal and regional administration heads and law enforcement officials who nominated themselves as candidates to the territorial duma. Neither the pro-reform Russia's Choice bloc nor the other social movements and political parties were able to gather enough votes to put one of their followers in the local duma, with the exception of a very few cases. Bryansk -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Artyushin: The preliminary results of the elections to the Bryansk regional duma are in. ITAR-TASS was told by the regional administration's working group that the elections were valid in six of the nine three-seat constituencies, resulting in the election of 18 of the 27 duma deputies. Despite that fact that the 27 spots were contested by 151 candidates, low voter turnout in the other three constituencies disqualified those elections. Of the 18 new deputies in the regional duma, five are high officials in the regional administration, being the deputy head, the heads of the regional departments of internal affairs, agriculture, and labor and unemployment, as well as the chairman of the department of the regional consumer's union. Five local administration heads and their deputies also got seats in the duma, along with three collective farm chairmen, two industrialists, a teacher, a doctor, and an agronomist. Cheboksary -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentina Ivanova: The voter turnout in Chuvashia's second round of local elections, held on Sunday, was around 40 per cent, ITAR-TASS was informed by the Central Electoral Commission. The names of 28 of the 47 deputies in the State Council were determined, while the remaining 19 seats are still vacant. Samara -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Belyakov: Of the 25 deputy mandates in the Samara gubernatorial duma, only 14 were filled as a result of Sunday's local elections. The other 11 districts were plagued by very low voter turnout, and the elections were declared invalid. Overall, of the region's 2.5 [as published] registered voters, a little more than 30 per cent showed up at the polls.
