The proposal follows the failure of EU employer and trade union organisations to reach a voluntary accord on how to improve ways by which employees are informed and consulted about a multinational's activities. The European Commission said its proposed framework would be mandatory for companies which cannot negotiate a voluntary accord with their employees within two years, or which refuse pointblank within six months to start negotiations. It would apply to companies with at least 1,000 employees, including at least 100 each in at least two member states -- if at least 100 employees in at least two countries ask for it in writing. EU Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn said the proposal, which must still be approved by member states, aimed at maximum flexibility. He said: "It is designed to trigger off a process of negotiation between the social partners at company level which are best suited to their own particular circumstances. ``It is only in the event of failure to agree that minimum requirements concerning the nature and content of information and consultation will apply,'' Flynn added. But the EU employers' confederation attacked the proposal, saying that the Commission wanted to impose a "uniform, rigid and bureaucratic" structure on all EU companies. The directive, which stems from the social chapter of the EU's Maastricht union treaty, would apply to all companies, whether based within the EU or outside, whose European operations meet the Commission's size criteria. The only exception is Britain, which negotiated an exemption from the social chapter when the treaty was negotiated. But the proposal would apply to affiliates of British-based companies in other EU countries.
