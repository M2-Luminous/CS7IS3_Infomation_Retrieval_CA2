FR941007-1-00184 FR941007-1-00011 Section 682.604(e)(4)_The Secretary proposes to allow a school no more than 45 days after the school's receipt of a late disbursement of loan proceeds to deliver those loan proceeds to the borrower. Section 682.604(f)(1)_The Secretary proposes to change the requirement for counseling first-time borrowers. A school will not be required to administer initial counseling to a student who has already borrowed under the FFEL or Direct Loan Program. Section 682.605 Determining the Date of a Student's Withdrawal Section 682.605_The Secretary proposes to revise this section to clarify that a school must determine the date of a student's withdrawal by following the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22(i). The Secretary proposes to delete the provisions regarding leaves of absence. The Secretary's regulations now provide in ยง668.22 that a student on a leave of absence is considered to have withdrawn for purposes of the refund calculation. Therefore, the Secretary believes that, for consistency, such a student should be considered withdrawn for all purposes. Section 682.606 Refund Policy Section 682.606_The Secretary proposes to delete this section from the FFEL regulations. A school is required to follow the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22 regarding refund policies for all of the Federal Title IV Student Financial Assistance Programs. Section 682.607 Payment of a Refund to a Lender Section 682.607(c)_The Secretary proposes to revise the timely payment requirement to require a school to pay a refund to the lender within 30 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn under 34 CFR 668.22(i). This change is proposed in order to conform to existing General Provisions Regulations. Executive Order 12866 1. Assessment of Costs and Benefits. These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercises of their governmental functions. To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program. 2. Clarity of the regulations. Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol ``ยง'' and a numbered heading; for example, ยง682.200 Definitions. ) (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue, S.W. (Room 5100, FB&hyph;10), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. While the statute requires that the Secretary regulate certain actions that must be taken by various program participants, these requirements would not have a significant impact because they would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal additional requirements to protect the Federal fiscal interest, as well as the interests of the borrowers under the programs. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Sections 682.205, 682.602, 682.604, and 682.605 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department will submit a copy of these proposed regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))
