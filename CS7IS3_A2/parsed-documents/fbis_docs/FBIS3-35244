Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi denied in press comments Monday [21 February] that he knew that Israelis had attended a conference he sponsored on trying to settle the conflict through psychological analysis. But the AL-'ARABI newspaper, mouthpiece of the Nasirist pan-Arab party, quoted conference chairman Jamal Madi Abu-al-'Azayim as saying Tantawi had met all the participants, including the Israelis, at his office. Tantawi is the most prominent religious figure in Egypt, along with the al-Azhar Muslim Academy chairman, Shaykh Jad-al-Haq 'Ali Jad-al-Haq. The Israeli delegation to the conference numbered 15 members and was headed by former ambassador to Egypt Shim'on Shamir, according to opposition sources. Columnist Fahmi Huwaydi told AFP "the Islamic world will suffer a shock when it finds out that the Mufti of Egypt met an Israeli delegation" in a Moslem site. He also said government censorship last week had prevented him from publishing an editorial to denounce the meeting. Although Egypt signed in 1979 a peace treaty with Israel, relations are almost restricted to official contacts. President Anwar al-Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Moslem militants for having signed the treaty. Egypt is the only Arab country which has signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state.
