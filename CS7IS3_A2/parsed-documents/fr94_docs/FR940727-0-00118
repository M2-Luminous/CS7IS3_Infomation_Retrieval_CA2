The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State for review. §95.13 Debarment and suspension. Recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension'' codified by DOL at 29 CFR part 98.

If an applicant or recipient: (a) Has a history of poor performance, (b) Is not financially stable, (c) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this part, (d) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or (e) Is not otherwise responsible, DOL may impose additional requirements as needed, provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing as to: The nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional requirements are being imposed, the nature of the corrective action needed, the time allowed for completing the corrective actions, and the method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed.

The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities.
