Therefore, North Korea has been in conflict with the IAEA. Taking samples from the hot cell is an important means for the nuclear inspection to check North Korea's plutonium processing. Also, this is an important clue in determining the differences between the amount of plutonium extracted as declared by North Korea and the amount of plutonium North Korea has really processed. A relevant government official said that "the ongoing conflict between North Korea and the IAEA regarding the nuclear inspection is due to North Korea's refusal to allow the extraction of the samples from the hot cell," and that "the IAEA and the United States are very dissatisfied with its refusal." He said that "despite its agreement with the IAEA in the course of nuclear negotiations regarding the sample extraction from the hot cell, necessary for guaranteeing nuclear safety, North Korea had refused an actual inspection." Concerning this, a relevant Foreign Ministry official said that "whether the North Korean refusal to allow the inspectors to obtain samples from hot cells has threatened the objective of the inspection is a matter that the IAEA should decide on" and that "we need to watch the other processes of the inspection because there are some other means to check the plutonium extraction without the extraction of samples from the hot cell."
