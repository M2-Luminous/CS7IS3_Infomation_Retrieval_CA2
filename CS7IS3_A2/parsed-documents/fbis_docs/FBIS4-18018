Thus the population is 20 percent poorer, since the day before the same dollar could be bought for 800 manats. The same has happened with the exchange rate of the Russian ruble -- on the black market it is expressed in terms of the dollar rate and has reached 1 manat to 2 rubles. The manat is clearly dropping away. Correspondingly, prices of basic necessities also shot up, getting beyond the reach of the majority of the population. The opposition press believes that what is happening on the currency market is the consequence of serious economic upheavals. In particular, the opinion is being expressed that the financial magnates who manipulate black market transactions are ready to blow the situation in the republic apart from within. It is not yet clear according to what scenario events will develop. The population has been agitated by the explosion of prices on the market -- a minimum salary today will only buy 1.5 kg of beef.
