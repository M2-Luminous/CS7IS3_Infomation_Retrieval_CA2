The civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic was not on the agenda at the NATO summit, but was "comprehensively and thoroughly treated on Monday evening during a dinner, and on Tuesday morning," said Woerner. NATO is reiterating its support for UN mediation and for a solution at the negotiating table, said Woerner, who continued by saying that NATO is prepared to carry out air strikes in order to support the UNPROFOR troops in Bosnia and Sarajevo, and to protect the Muslim enclaves. There are two kinds of air strikes, said Woerner: those aimed at protecting UNPROFOR troops, and air strikes like those NATO approved in August 1993. He emphasized that air strikes will only take place if there is a consensus among the countries belonging to the North Atlantic [Cooperation] Council, and provided that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is in agreement. When asked whether the NATO countries have reached agreement on this, the secretary general answered that "the situation on the ground needs to be assessed, and the safety of the UN ground troops must be borne in mind." NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner called the Brussels summit "a historic turning point." The reform of NATO has taken a great step forward. "We are now on track for the 21st century," said Woerner. Fresh assignments have been outlined clearly, and this was done in a "highly constructive atmosphere among all 16 NATO countries." A renewed, more mature relationship is growing up between North America and Europe, claimed Woerner, who said that "everyone was impressed by the strong leadership of the U.S. President." The principle of expanding NATO was approved, and the countries of East Europe were invited to work with NATO within the framework of Partnership for Peace agreements. Finally, a more flexible structure will be created for crisis management and peace assignments, and NATO will develop its strategy vis-a-vis the proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. Admittedly, there is still some discord in NATO about carrying out air strikes in Bosnia, since some countries have NATO troops there while others do not. However, the readiness to carry out such strikes is greater now than it was in August, since the ground troops increasingly are being exposed to danger, said U.S. President Bill Clinton at the end of the meeting. The allies are unanimous in their support for a text on Bosnia in the final declaration of the NATO summit, Clinton said. In it, the NATO countries reaffirm their readiness to carry out air strikes under the authority of the UN Security Council in order to prevent Sarajevo and other threatened areas from ending up in a stranglehold. In addition, the allies are assigning the UN military on the ground the task of drawing up plans for relieving the UN contingent that is blocked inside Srebrenica, and for reopening Tuzla Airport for humanitarian aid. In this context, the UN commanders can ask NATO to carry out air strikes, said the U.S. President. He also said the NATO countries had agreed that tougher rhetoric can only be used if it is translated into action. According to Clinton, air strikes now depend first on how the Bosnian Serbs behave, and second on what the UN commanders in Bosnia request. The President was "pleased" that the Partnership for Peace initiative proposed by the United States was approved "at this historic meeting, my first NATO meeting." "General Powell will immediately contact the military" in those East European countries interested in the Partnership with a view to preparing future forms of cooperation, such as military exercises. Clinton also said he was pleased with the stronger role which the Western European Union -- the defense component of the European Union -- will play in the alliance from now on. However, in his view NATO remains the most important defense alliance, and he therefore thanked Secretary General Manfred Woerner for his strong leadership.
