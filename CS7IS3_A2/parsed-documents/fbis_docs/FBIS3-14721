Obviously, Moroccans and Europeans do not have the same approach to their joint future. The vice president of the European Commission, Mr. Manuel Marin's visit to Rabat in mid-December illustrated the differences arising from the renegotiation of the Euro-Moroccan cooperation agreement. "We expected the Moroccans to have reservations on a number of points, but we never expected such a shock," people at the Commission pointed out. Actually, Mr. Marin came up against a polite but firm "niet" from his Moroccan counterpart, Mr. Abdellatif Filali, minister of foreign affairs. The latter said that the concessions made by the Europeans to his country, especially as far as agriculture is concerned, were markedly "inadequate." In fact, the Twelve agreed only to a few improvements of the conditions covering Moroccan agricultural exports, providing a 3-percent annual increase for the first five years of application of the agreement, but only for products enjoying special access conditions, such as fruit and vegetables which, as a result, will have to be "communitized" [considered on a community scale]. At present, with 51 percent of imports, France remains Morocco's largest European customer. But the Moroccans keep recalling that "for the past 10 years, current agreements essentially benefited Europe" and that "the trade deficit keeps getting worse." From 1987 to 1992, it rose from 350 to 650 million ECUs [European currency units]. Moroccan exports to the former EEC account for only 0.12 percent of all Community imports. Sales of citrus fruit and tomatoes have not increased since the seventies. According to Mr. Allal Sijelmassi, in charge of bilateral relations at the Foreign Trade Ministry, "exchange terms are quite out of balance: Morocco no longer expects assistance but real partnership and the creation of a free-trade zone." But that question was not even discussed. The proposed agreement is a mere association agreement, like the one between the twelve European countries and East European countries. Morocco rejects it; what it wants is to be totally docked to Europe. This in spite of the reluctance displayed by Moroccan economic circles, who are worried at seeing their markets wide open to European industrial and agrifood products. They fear the disappearance of entire sectors of their industry and the massive arrival of European staple agricultural products (milk, meat, grains) at very competitive (because often subsidized) prices. Internal Resistance To explain this relative failure, people in Brussels stress the role played by the government opposition, led by the (nationalist) Istiqlal and the (socialist) USFP [Socialist Union of Popular Forces], in denouncing this negotiation mandate "that brings grist to the mill of Morocco's most conservative pillars, including some in the government in particular at the Ministry of Interior, although the king and his closest advisors are ardent supporters of the agreement." The European negotiators, however, acknowledge that their proposals "lacked scope" because they were dictated by the recession that is affecting Europe. "As member States have no money left and have problems with their agriculture, the negotiation could not have come at a worst time," Mrs. Le Dantec, one of the Commission's people in charge of the negotiation mandate, deplored. The thorny problem of immigration also had something to do with the Europeans' reluctance, as part of their public opinion is increasingly xenophobic. These delays exasperate the Moroccans who feel that they are doing their best to no avail. "We pay an exorbitant social cost for the structural adjustment program dictated by the IMF, the State and agricultural producers are making a constant effort, but in recent years the quantities exported per hectare have kept decreasing. These ridiculous proposals are no match for the challenges of the 21st century," an economist at the Hassan-II Institute protested. Faced with Europe's increasing tendency to "de-Mediterranize" its trade flows (they now account for only 5 percent of all European trade) and with the endemic weakness of inter-Maghreb trade (6 percent of the global trade volume), Morocco is losing patience. And it is distressed at getting so little in return for opening its market to investors from the North ($800 million projected for 1994, compared with $60 million in 1986). European experts, for their part, point out that "this mandate represents an important qualitative jump, because it provides a forum for political dialogue at the highest level prior to any subsequent progress, which also answers the Moroccan's initial request." The access door to Europe is barely half-open. The two parties still have two years to find an area of agreement before the renegotiation of the agreements linking the two Mediterranean shores is completed. The crucial year will be 1996, with the deadline for the implementation of the PAC (common agricultural policy) and the new U.S. farm bill.
