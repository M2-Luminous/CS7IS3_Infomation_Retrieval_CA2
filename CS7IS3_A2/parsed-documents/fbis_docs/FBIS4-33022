Peres, who arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota for an official two-day visit to Colombia, met with President Cesar Gaviria for 40 minutes. Peres congratulated Gaviria for being elected OAS secretary general, a position that the outgoing Colombian president will fill in September in replacement of Brazilian Joao Baena Soares. The former Labor Party leader, whose first Latin American tour also includes Mexico and Chile, said his visit to Colombia is the result of the fortunate rapprochement that began in December with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio's visit to Israel.
