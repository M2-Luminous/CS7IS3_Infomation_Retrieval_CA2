FR940606-2-00078 FR940606-2-00056 [Release No. 34&hyph;34133; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Relating to Amendments to its Listing Fees May 31, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 72s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on May 3, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Amex is proposing to reduce the maximum fee applicable to original listings of stock issues. The fee is proposed to be amended as follows: 1 1 With respect to the following schedule, italicizing indicates new material and brackets indicate material to be deleted. ยง140. Original Listing Fees Stock Issues Less than 1 million shares $5,000 1+ ^ 2 million shares 10,000 2+ ^ 3 million shares 15,000 3+ ^ 4 million shares 17,500 4+ ^ 5 million shares 20,000 5+ ^ 6 million shares 22,500 6+ ^ 7 million shares 25,000 7+ ^ 8 million shares 27,500 8+ ^ 9 million shares 30,000 9+ ^ 10 million shares 32,500 10+ ^ 15 million shares 37,500 15+ million shares 45,000 [15+ ^ 25 million shares 47,500 25+ ^ 50 million shares 72,500 50+ ^ 75 million shares 97,500 75+ ^ 100 million shares 122,500 All Shares over 100 million ^1/10 cents per share (no maximum)] In addition to the above per-share fee, there is a one-time charge of $5,000 for companies that do not have a stock or warrant issue listed on the Exchange. (The one-time charge of $5,000 does not apply to any company which previously paid the one-time charge in connection with the listing of a debt issue.) [There is no maximum fee applicable to original listings of stock and warrant issues, except] I [i]n the case of non-U.S. companies listed on foreign stock exchanges[.] , [For such issues,] the fee, including the one-time charge, will be 50% of the rates set forth above, with a maximum fee of [$30,000] $25,000. Where the original listing of more than one class of stock is included in the same application, the fee is based on the aggregate number of shares of all such classes. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the fee increase and discussed any comments it received on the fee increase. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change (1) Purpose When an issuer applies for listing on the Exchange, an original listing fee is levied on the company based on the total number of shares to be listed. Currently, the fee ranges from $5,000 for new listings of less than one million shares to more than $122,500 for listings of greater than 100 million shares. In addition, each issuer which does not already have securities listed on the Exchange is assessed a one-time charge of $5,000. Listing fees for non-U.S. issuers listed on foreign stock exchanges are currently 50% of the rates for U.S. companies, including the one-time charge, with maximum of $30,000. Based upon discussions with prospect companies, the Exchange believes that each year several large companies elect not to list on the Amex because the expense of the Exchange's listing fee can become significant at the upper end of the scale. The Exchange is therefore proposing to amend section 140 of its Company Guide to provide that the maximum fee applicable to the original listing of stock issues is $50,000, inclusive of the one-time charge of $5,000. To be consistent, the Exchange is proposed to reduce the maximum listing fee for non-U.S. issuers already listed on a foreign exchange from $30,000 to $25,000. The Exchange notes that Nasdaq/NMS original listing fees are roughly comparable to the Exchange's current fees, although their fees are already capped at $50,000 (also inclusive of a $5,000 one-time fee for new listings). 2 2 See NASD Manual, part IV, paragraph 1814(A)(1). (2) Statutory Basis The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will remove or lessen an existing burden on competition in that it proposes to reduce an existing difference between the Exchange's original listing fees and those charged by Nasdaq.
