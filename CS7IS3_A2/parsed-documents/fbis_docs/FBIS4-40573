"We have agreed with our German colleagues to develop close contacts between committees of the State Duma and the German Bundestag which deal with economic issues. I believe that Bundestag's experience in this field will be of great interest for us, especially in matters concerning the economic boost on Germany's eastern lands," Rybkin said. He pointed out that during his talks with German leaders on Thursday the sides touched upon problems faced by Germans residing in Russia and Russians in Germany. "We must do our best so that hundreds of thousands of these people could feel at home both in Russia and in Germany," Rybkin said. Touching upon problems existing in Russo-German relations, Rybkin singled out the problem of mutual return of cultural values, removed from Russia and Germany as a result of the Second World War, as the most difficult one. Asked about the interaction between the Russian president and the State Duma and the extent to which the lower house of the Russian parliament supports the course of reforms pursued by Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said that "from the very first days of our existence we have been acting together with the president and shall continue to do so in future to find a way out of the quagmire of the crisis".
