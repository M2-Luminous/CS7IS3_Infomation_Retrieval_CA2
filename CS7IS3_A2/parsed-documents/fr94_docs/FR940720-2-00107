FR940720-2-00107 FR940720-2-00068 Date of amendment request: June 9, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications include: (1) modification of the high head charging pumps seal cooling subsystem, (2) restructuring of the Chemical and Volume Control System and Safety Injection System Specifications, (3) relocation of certain specification requirements within existing specifications, (4) specification of a minimum boric acid solution temperature in lieu of heat tracing channel operability, and (5) minor wording changes which are administrative in nature for consistency in terminology, capitalization of defined terms and clarification. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Specifically, operation of Surry Power Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The modifications to the charging pumps and elimination of the charging pump component cooling subsystem do not increase the probability of occurrence of any accident or malfunction previously evaluated in the safety analysis report. The charging pump modifications utilize a passively designed process flow cooling arrangement to reduce exposure, improve reliability, and improve operability. The charging pump modifications will not decrease the pumps ability or the associated subsystems ability to perform their design function. The restructuring of the Chemical and Volume Control System and Safety Injection System specifications on a subsystem basis continues to ensure that the reactor can be made subcritical from any operating condition and provide sufficient shutdown margin to preclude inadvertent criticality when in the shutdown condition. The Safety Injection System subsystems continue to maintain sufficient boration capability to mitigate reactivity transients within the design limits associated with postulated accident conditions. The Safety Injection System subsystems ensure that sufficient emergency core cooling capability will be available in the event of a LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] assuming the loss of one subsystem through any single failure consideration. Either subsystem operating in conjunction with the accumulators remains capable of supplying sufficient core cooling to limit the peak cladding temperatures within acceptable limits in accordance with the loss-of-coolant accident analyses. The Chemical and Volume Control System remains capable of achieving Cold Shutdown of both units during any operating conditions in accordance with the safety analysis with a minimum specified solution temperature of 112 degrees F. Heat tracing is not required for operability of the Safety Injection System nor does it affect the ability of the Safety Injection System to mitigate the consequences of any postulated accident identified in the safety analysis. The changes ensure that the refueling water storage tank remains capable of providing a sufficient supply of borated water for injection by the emergency core cooling system in the event of a LOCA. The limits specified for refueling water storage tank volume and boron concentration continue to ensure that sufficient solution is available within containment for recirculation cooling flow to the core, and that the reactor will remain subcritical in Cold Shutdown consistent with the LOCA analyses. The specified allowed outage time of 72 hours for an inoperable Chemical and Volume Control System subsystem or Safety Injection System subsystem is reasonable for the repair of affected components and is consistent with NRC Memorandum, ``Recommended Interim Revisions to LCO's for ECCS Components,'' dated December 1, 1975, and NUREG&hyph;1431, Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Pressurized Water Reactors. A reliability analysis (reference NRC memo above) has shown that the impact of having one subsystem inoperable is sufficiently small to justify continued operation for 72 hours. Engineering evaluation of the proposed changes determined that they are bounded by existing safety analyses. Furthermore, the proposed changes do not increase the allowed outage times to achieve Cold Shutdown presently specified in the Technical Specifications. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The passively designed once-through process flow cooling arrangement for the charging pumps' seals are recommended by the pump manufacturer with the pump seal manufacturer's concurrence and result in no decrease in the pumps ability to perform their safety function. Our Engineering evaluation has determined that the affected systems ability to mitigate the consequences of any accident as described in the safety analyses is not reduced. The restructuring and relocation of specifications has not reduced any limiting condition for operation or surveillance specification requirements. Changes in allowed outage times are consistent with NUREG&hyph;0452, NUREG&hyph;1431, or Generic Letter 93&hyph;05 and our accident analyses. Consequently, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The modifications to the charging pumps result in improved reliability and improved operability of the CVCS [chemical and volume control system] and SI [safety injection] subsystems. Our Engineering evaluation of the manufacturer's proposed modification and the pump seal manufacturer's concurrence with the modification, have determined this modification to be acceptable with no reduction in the pump's safety-related function. The charging pump modification does not reduce the margin of safety in any part of Technical Specifications or the accident analyses. The restructuring of the Chemical and Volume Control System specifications continue to ensure that the reactor can be made subcritical from any operating condition and provide sufficient shutdown margin to preclude inadvertent criticality when in the shutdown condition. The Chemical Volume and Control System remains capable of achieving Cold Shutdown of both units during any operating conditions in accordance with the safety analysis with a minimum specified solution temperature of 112 degrees F. The revised allowed outage times for the Safety Injection System subsystems do not impact the margin of safety *␣*␣* in the Technical Specifications bases or the accident analyses. The Safety Injection System subsystems continue to maintain sufficient boration capability to mitigate reactivity transients within the design limits associated with postulated accident conditions described within the safety analysis report. The Safety Injection System subsystems ensure that sufficient emergency core cooling capability will be available in the event of a LOCA assuming the loss of one subsystem through any single failure consideration. Either subsystem operating in conjunction with the accumulators remains capable of supplying sufficient core cooling to limit the peak cladding temperatures within acceptable limits in accordance with the loss-of-coolant accident analyses. The changes ensure that the refueling water storage tank remains capable of providing a sufficient supply of borated water for injection by the emergency core cooling system in the event of a LOCA. The limits specified for refueling water storage tank volume and boron concentration continue to ensure that sufficient solution is available within containment for recirculation cooling flow to the core, and that the reactor will remain subcritical in Cold Shutdown consistent with the LOCA analyses. Consequently, the proposed change to Technical Specifications does not involve a significant reduction [in] the margin of safety within the accident analyses. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50&hyph;305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: May 17, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.c by separating the Internal Containment Spray (ICS) and Spray Additive Systems into two distinct specifications. The proposed amendment would also remove the requirement that for a spray train to be operable, a spray pump suction flow path from the additive tank is needed. In addition, the allowable out of service time for the Spray Additive System would be increased from 48 hours to 72 hours. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below:
