Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk will not present the document to the Sejm until this fall. As Minister Kolodziejczyk told reporters, the document contains several options for the development of the Polish Armed Forces, but their implementation depends on the availability of funds. According to the minister, there is a "positive approach among Sejm deputies" on the issue of increasing defense expenditures. The minister told GAZETA WYBORCZA, however, that Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko's approach is "not positive." Kolodziejczyk says that, provided armament expenditures reach the level of 3 percent of the GDP over three years, the Polish Army will reach a level similar to NATO armies by the year 2015. Of course, we want the size of the Army cut down, and we want to have 12-month military service introduced, but an army like that must have modern equipment and be well trained, so as not to decrease the state's defense potential, the minister said. The Defense Ministry also wants to reform civil defense structures and transfer them to the supervision of the Internal Affairs Ministry.
