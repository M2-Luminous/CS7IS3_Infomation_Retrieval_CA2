FR940328-2-00020 FR940328-2-00009 COMMITTEE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TEXTILE AGREEMENTS Amendment of Export Visa and Quota Requirements for Certain Textile Products Produced or Manufactured in Various Countries and Re-Imported Under Certain HTS Numbers March 22, 1994. AGENCY: Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA). ACTION: Issuing a directive to the Commissioner of Customs amending visa and quota requirements for goods re-imported under HTS number 9801.00.2000 or 9801.00.2500. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lori E. Goldberg, International Trade Specialist, Office of Textiles and Apparel, U.S. Department of Commerce, (202) 482&hyph;3400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Authority: Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854). Effective on March 25, 1994 textile and apparel products which are produced or manufactured in various countries and entered into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption under existing visa and quota requirements are no longer subject to visa or quota requirements upon re-entry into the United States under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number 9801.00.2000 or 9801.00.2500. These tariff provisions provide for duty free entry to products which have been previously imported into the United States. Upon the initial importation the textile or apparel products would have been subject to all applicable quota and visa requirements. Since these HTS numbers mandate that the same articles be re-imported, CITA has decided to exempt them from being subject to the same quota and visa requirements a second time. Ronald I. Levin, Acting Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements March 22, 1994. Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, all import control directives issued to you by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. This directive also amends, but does not cancel, all visa requirements for all countries for which visa arrangements are in place with the United States. Effective on March 25, 1994 textile and apparel products which are produced or manufactured in various countries and entered into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption upon re-entry into the United States under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number 9801.00.2000 or 9801.00.2500 are no longer subject to visa or quota requirements. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). Sincerely, Ronald I. Levin, Acting Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7186 Filed 3&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;F
