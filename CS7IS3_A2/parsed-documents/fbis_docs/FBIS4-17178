As we were told by the Belarusian State Company for Gas Transportation and Delivery Beltranshaz, over the first three and a half months of this year, we amassed 165 billion rubles [R] in debt, while our total [word indistinct] now stands at R331 billion. We will likely be able to service our debts with gas suppliers only after unification with the Russian monetary system. For a while, our republic receives energy resources in full volume, though, in line with the agreement, we should clear our debts by 1 June because, beginning 1 July, gas will be delivered to us only according to advance payments.
