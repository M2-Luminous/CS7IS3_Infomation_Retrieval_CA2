The CII mission will visit several places in China during the period from June 20 to June 24, Bhargava said. "The main objective of the mission is to look at the possibilities of developing trade, business and investment cooperation between the two countries," the CII president said. He expressed the hope that the CII will send another team to China later in the year and to meet the industrialists in the interior provinces of China. Bhargava said that he was very happy at the considerable improvement of bilateral trade between India and China last year. "With economic and trade liberalization in India and China opening its market to the world and also to each other, CII will play an effective and catalytic role enabling members of Indian and Chinese industry to take the advantages of the open-door policy of the two governments," he said. The CII president noted that Chinese overseas trade is of the order of nearly 200 billion U.S. dollars per year while the India- China trade stood at less than 700 million U.S. dollars last year. "Both have a developing economy and therefore the potential for mutual beneficial business can well understood by any businessmen," he said.
