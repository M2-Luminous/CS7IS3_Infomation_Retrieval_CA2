FR940119-0-00015 FR940119-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary 24 CFR Parts 44, 45, 85, 92, 207, 213, 221, 232, 236, 242, 277, 280, 570, 572, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 880, 881, 883, 884, 885, 886, 889, and 890 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1581; FR&hyph;2594&hyph;F&hyph;03] RIN 2501&hyph;AB19 Implementation of OMB Circular A&hyph;133 ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions'' AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: OMB Circular A&hyph;133 provides policy guidance to Federal agencies for establishing uniform requirements for audits of awards provided to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations. This rule makes final the interim rule that HUD promulgated in July 1992 to incorporate the provisions of the circular. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven O. App, Deputy Chief Financial Officer for Finance, room 10166, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;0650. TDD: (202) 708&hyph;9300. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OMB Circular A&hyph;133 establishes audit requirements and defines Federal responsibilities for implementing and monitoring such requirements for institutions of higher education and other nonprofit institutions receiving Federal awards. It supersedes Attachment F, subparagraph 2h, of Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and other Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit Organizations.'' The provisions of Circular A&hyph;133 apply to: a. Federal departments and agencies responsible for administering programs that involve grants, cost-type contracts and other agreements with institutions of higher education and other nonprofit recipients. b. Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions whether they are recipients receiving awards directly from Federal agencies, or are subrecipients receiving awards indirectly through other recipients. On July 27, 1992, the Department published an interim rule at 57 FR 33252 to adopt the provisions of the circular. The rule adopted the provisions of Circular A&hyph;133 by adding to Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, a new PART 45_NON-FEDERAL AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND OTHER NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. Part 45 incorporates the requirements set forth in Circular A&hyph;133. The rule also made numerous technical changes throughout the parts of Title 24 in order to make the cross-referencing and conforming changes necessary for implementation of Circular A&hyph;133. Included in these technical changes were a number of changes needed as a result of the definition of ``Federal financial assistance,'' as set forth in the circular. That definition now covers loans, loan guarantees, and insurance. Therefore, programs that make, guarantee, or insure loans to nonprofit mortgagors have been brought within the coverage of Circular A&hyph;133, as it is implemented at part 45. However, for HUD programs whose regulations are set forth in 24 CFR parts 207, 213, 221, 232, 236, 242, 277, 880, 881, 883, 884, 885, 886, 889, and 890, a nonprofit institution is the nonprofit corporation which owns the individual property receiving the HUD assistance. Each project under the parts 200 series and many projects under the parts 800 series are required to complete project-specific audits because they are deemed to be separate entities. The audits currently conducted under applicable HUD audit guides for these programs will serve as the organization-wide audits required by OMB Circular A&hyph;133 and this part. In performing the compliance review required by paragraph 13.c. of OMB Circular A&hyph;133, auditors should consider the compliance requirements set forth in the OMB Compliance Supplement. In accordance with the regulatory agreement incident to the insured mortgage, where HUD provides federal funding, the audit reports pertaining to nonprofit organizations subject to these regulations are to be submitted within 60 days after the end of the fiscal year audited. Each of the parts listed in the first sentence of this paragraph is amended to cross-reference to part 45. The details of coverage of entities receiving assistance under these parts is contained in section 45.1(c). 1 1 Parts 889 and 890 are programs regarding supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities, respectively. The regulations for these programs were developed after the publication of the interim rule. Nonetheless, the projects under these programs are required to complete project-specific audits because they are deemed to be separate entities.
