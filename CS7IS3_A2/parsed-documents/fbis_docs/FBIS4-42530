Eight to 10 billion of the Swedish gross contribution of some 18 billion [Swedish] kronor [SKr] will be returned to the farmers. Swedish subsidies to agriculture amount this year to 3 billion in direct payments. Then there is the limit protection, estimated to be worth over SKr12 billion. Sweden's state treasury will be the big looser in a possible EU membership. Even if we have succeeded in getting a so-called phasing-in subsidy in our membership agreement, the Swedish net contribution to EU's treasury is estimated at SKr6 billion during the first year. Agriculture will, however, be a sure winner in an EU membership. The largest subsidy item from the EU will be the so-called acreage subsidy, which is paid out for maximally 1.8 billion hectares. Total acreage subsidies, including fallow field grants, will be close to SKr4 billion. Animal subsidies will amount to nearly SKr500 million. The other main form of grants is export subsidies and the possibility of selling surplus production at EU stockpile prices that are considerably above world market prices. Here, the effects on Swedish agriculture are difficult to estimate, considering the small scale of exports today. Other great subsidy items are regional subsidies and grants to environmental programs, which both require national cofinancing. EU subsidies to environmental programs amount to SKr1.5 billion annually and require 50-percent cofinancing. Regional EU subsidies amount to SKr1 billion for northern Sweden and about SKr500 million for southern Sweden and require 75-percent cofinancing. The example of Denmark shows us that agriculture is the main beneficiary of an EU membership. Here, the farmers received SKr20 billion in export and other subsidies from the EU last year. Denmark has, due to its relatively large agricultural economy, also had a net surplus of about SKr2 billion per year during its more than 20 years of membership in the EU. Norwegian Farmers Are Negative The Norwegian farmers do not want to join the EU. They represent today the most highly subsidized sector. The Norwegian farmer is kept sitting on his tractor with a good income of SKr11 billion per year. But the farmers remain negative in spite of continued assurances about good conditions. "We oppose membership for two reasons. We do not agree with the EU's basic philosophy to let market forces prevail and to accept expansion at any price," said Per Ole Ranberg at the Norwegian Framers' Union, one of the two agricultural organizations. "Farming plays a completely different role in Norway than in Europe, where it only produces food. We must supply the country with food in times of emergency, we look after the environment, we safeguard quality and maintain an open cultural landscape. This makes our products very expensive and Norwegian farmers will be hit hard by EU prices. We also think that the government calculates the effect of the regional subsidies many times over. The total agricultural subsidy will in fact be 2 billion less." According to the government, Norway's agreement with the EU gives the farmers more or less the same economic conditions as before. EU's contribution amounts in various forms to SKr4.11 billion and that of the Norwegian state to SKr5.74 billion, which makes a total of SKr9.85 billion. The state will, in addition, subsidize all farming to the north of the 62d parallel and to farmers south of the parallel, who farm in mountainous regions. According to this year's agricultural agreement between the farmers and the state, national grants will continually be reduced down to SKr11 billion, which means that a readjustment to the world of the EU can hardly be dramatic. According to EU rules the total permanent subsidies to agriculture may not exceed the present level. During some years, transitional rules will give the Norwegian farmer good possibilities to adapt himself to the European reality. But he does not want to. Paavo Has Not Been Forgotten "Farmer Paavo, on his frosty homestead, high up on the sandy heaths of Saarijarvi, tilled his land with steady hands, waiting for the Good Lord to bless his crop." Thus wrote the poet Runeberg. But that was a long time ago. For the Finnish farmer of today the Good Lord has been replaced by the state, i.e., the taxpayers and a subsidy system, which has been developed during the last 20 years to protect farming on frosty homesteads. The subsidy system has to a large extent been developed by Heikki Haavisto, present foreign minister and long-time chairman of the farmers organization MTK [Central Union of Agricultural Producers], "Finland's LRF" [Federation of Swedish Farmers in Finland]. Heikki Haavisto was the man in charge of Finland's EU negotiations in Brussels. The Finnish agricultural subsidy system is today an almost impenetrable maze of paragraphs, which encumbers several budget items. It includes direct grants and subsidies in the form of tax and pension regulations, generation-change subsidies. The Ministry of Finance in Helsinki estimates that farmer Paavo costs today some SKr40 billion per year. Finland's strained national budget is approximately SKr260 billion. While the rest of the population has been hit by the government's austerity program during the deep economic plunge, nobody has dared to touch agriculture. Not so even now, on the threshold of the EU. On Thursday [26 May], the government is expected to decide on an additional subsidy package to the farmers, a so-called national grant to keep the country's 150,000 farmers indemnified when life in the EU becomes reality and some other subsidies disappear. The subsidy amounts to SKr6.1 billion. The expected decision has aroused anger among the employees, who think that farmer Paavo has had enough. Their argument is strengthened by indications that the Finnish national debt, today 370 billion and 55 percent of the GNP, will double before the turn of the century to become 100 percent of GNP. There is one consolation however. The EU will probably not approve of permanent national subsidies to farmers.
