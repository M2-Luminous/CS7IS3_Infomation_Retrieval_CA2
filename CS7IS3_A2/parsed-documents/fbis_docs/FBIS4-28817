Other points in a draft of the revised insurance law are a ban on insurance companies acting as brokers and a requirement that brokers give the best advice possible when signing up customers for insurance products, the sources said. Insurance brokers sell insurance products on behalf of insurance companies. The brokerage system is widespread in the United States but in Japan insurance companies sell their own products directly. In bilateral talks on a new trade framework, the US is demanding that insurance brokers be allowed in Japan as the Insurance Council, an advisory panel to the finance minister, proposed two years ago. Under the revised law, insurance brokers will be licensed through an exam to be conducted by an association of such brokers to be set up under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry. The law will authorize the ministry to inspect brokers and to cancel the license of any broker found guilty of wrongdoing. Insurance industry officials say introduction of brokers could lead to a major shakeout in the insurance industry, causing insurance firms to compete against each other on the strength of their products rather than on the ability of their sales staffs. The Insurance Council is slated to hold a hearing Tuesday to obtain the view of foreign insurance companies on how to revise the insurance law. The Finance Ministry is now working on revising the law and the revision is expected to take place in fiscal 1996 at the earliest.
