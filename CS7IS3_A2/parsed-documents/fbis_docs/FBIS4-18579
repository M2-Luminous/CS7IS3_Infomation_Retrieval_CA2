The above statement by the Greek Foreign Ministry was issued in response to a question by the Political Spring party, which used this pretext to call on the government to "pay particular attention to the continuous efforts to change the population of North Epirus, instead of insisting on ineffective friendship overtures to the Albanian regime." The Greek Foreign Ministry statement stresses that the government "will continue handling the issues related to the Greek minority with particular responsibility, distancing itself from nationalist glorification--which as the experience of the recent past has proven, has not served the Greek interests--and with the sole purpose of protecting human rights and minority rights and one's right to remain in one's birthplace."
