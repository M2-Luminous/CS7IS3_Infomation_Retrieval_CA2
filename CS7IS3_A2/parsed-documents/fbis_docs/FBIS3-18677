That is a demand from the Center Democrats [CD] to the next government. The CD has already made inroads into the discussion on the basis for cooperation in a future [coalition] government. A demand from the CD remains that a new government be in favor of Danish membership in the WEU. The WEU is a West European cooperative defense organization that, following the last NATO summit meeting in December last year, became the European component of NATO cooperation. "We are stating clearly that a receptivity must be part of the basis for a new government," said Peter Duetoft, the CD's policy spokesman. "In the government terms of office to come, each government must take a position on Danish membership in the WEU. If they say no, then Denmark will become a second-class member of both the EU [European Union] and NATO, and in any event we do not want that. Our foreign policy footnotes (provisos, editor's note) in the 1980's quite simply won't amount to anything compared with the footnotes we'll have to adopt if we're out of the WEU," Duetoft said. He had no wish to state in which government the CD's wishes could be fulfilled or whether it would be easier to convince a nonsocialist government on the issue of WEU membership. Duetoft does not support the Liberal Party's proposal -- in connection with elections to the European Parliament -- to hold a national membership on WEU membership this summer. "That's much too early, because WEU membership requires popular enthusiasm. The Liberal Party's proposal will only lead to another no vote. I would rather wait until 1995-96 but precisely because it would be insane to put together a government that is closed to the idea of membership," Duetoft said.
