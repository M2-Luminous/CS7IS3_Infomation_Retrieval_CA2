Summing up the meeting, he said: "We did not win in Moscow, but neither did we lose. The talks were very nervous and tense." "We were trying," he said, "to find options of positive solutions in fulfilling the tasks set by the president of Ukraine. We made concessions, but not those which would make Ukraine lose its wealth and independence." Zvyahilskyy believes that a generally positive solution was found to the problem of separate deployment of the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's navy. Sevastopol will be the main Russian naval base in the Black Sea, while Ukraine's navy will be based in Balaklava and Donuzlav.
