"There is no opposition, just ordinary criminals protected by Russia which seeks to get its way in the Chechen Republic," he said in an interview with Interfax. Asked by an Interfax correspondent about the possible aims of the Russian leadership in Chechnya, Dudayev said it was trying to discredit the Chechen leadership, to deteriorate the situation. He said Russia was also involved in terrorism, sabotage and provocations which Dudayev believed, according to plans of Russian politicians, might lead to chaos and collapse in Chechnya. Dudayev said Russia was carrying out a policy of aggression against Chechnya. "When did Russia put an end to the Russian-Caucasian war? I think, it never stopped. The present situation is just a continuation of it but in a more sophisticated manner," Dudayev said. In Chechnya, aggression, occupation, genocide and violence have been going on for 300 years already, he concluded.
