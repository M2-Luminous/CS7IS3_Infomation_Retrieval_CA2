Ziaur, speaking at a luncheon hosted by Japanese economic organizations, presented Bangladesh as "an attractive country for foreign investors" and urged Japanese investors and traders to visit the country themselves and "make your own judgment." Meanwhile, she called on the Japanese Government to offer better market access opportunities for Bangladesh goods and services, noting that the bilateral trade balance is weighted "heavily in favor of Japan." Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo on Monday for a five-day official visit, said Bangladesh products are very competitive in terms of price and quality, while they enjoy special and preferential market access facilities in major world markets. She cited such examples as jute, ready-made garments, leather goods, rice and tea. Two-way trade between the two countries in 1993 totaled about 400 million dollars. Japanese investments in Bangladesh by the first half of 1992 had numbered 40, totaling about 130 million yen. But this represented only 0.2 percent of all Japanese investment in Asia. Recognizing that some potential investors still harbor doubts about her country, Ziaur sought to dispel them by portraying what she called "the true image of present day Bangladesh." "Lack of proper information and a clear understanding about a country can naturally cause a degree of reservation in the minds of those who are looking for new business opportunities," she said. Ziaur noted Bangladesh's location in a South Asian market of more than one billion customers, growing confidence in the economy shown by major international financial institutions, the substantial growth of export industries in the country in recent years, the establishment of export processing zones and an emerging stock market. She also cited the stability and convertibility of the local currency, full repatriation of profit and various investment incentives. "Bangladesh is poised for a new phase in industrial development," she proclaimed. "Our industrial policies are built around the central role of the private sector, our economy is now fully market-friendly (and) our trade is fully liberalized."
