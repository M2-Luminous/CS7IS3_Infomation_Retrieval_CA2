According to Police Chief Paulo Souto, director of the Baixada General Police Department, the past six months have seen a significant increase in the number of drug traffickers in the area's municipalities, resulting in battles between "native" outlaws and those migrating from Rio de Janeiro. In the police chief's opinion, that explains the scare caused by last weekend's violence, during which 27 homicides were reported in Baixada Fluminense--the highest figure in three years. Souto said he had already identified Rio de Janeiro gangs dominating the traffic in places such as the Lixao shantytown in Duque de Caxias--which is constantly being invaded by traffickers from Vigario Geral--and Vila Norma on the border between Sao Jose de Meriti and Nilopolis. Flight--According to the police chief, the outlaws are trying to leave Rio de Janeiro in search of more control or, in some cases, to escape repression in the capital's shantytowns. "The homicide rate had been falling thanks to our efforts to prioritize repression of the extermination groups. What is happening now is a new causative factor," Souto said. Decline--January provided one indication of the rising number of murders in the region: 197 compared to 176 in December. The data for February are not yet complete, but there were probably 176 murders that month, whereas March is showing another increase. Over the past five years, police have been recording a decline in the number of murders: 2,683 in 1989, 2,572 in 1990, 2,256 in 1991, 2,090 in 1992, and 2,040 in 1993. The municipality of Queimados, which has the smallest population in Baixada Fluminense, had five murders between Friday night and Sunday night, making it proportionately the most violent municipality that weekend.
