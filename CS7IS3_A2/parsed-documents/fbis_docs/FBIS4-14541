V. Selga died on his way to the hospital, without regaining consciousness. Assistant General Prosecutor Rita Aksenoka added that, according to police information, the murder took place at a garage where V. Selga kept his car. He was attacked by a lone assailant who fired twice. "There was one eyewitness to the attack, but it must be taken into account that it was already dark, and this may make it difficult to get a precise description of the murderer," said R. Aksenoka. V. Selga was chairman of the board of the Latvian Reconstruction and Development Bank [LRAB], and the owner of its control packet, as well as the owner of several Latvian companies and joint-ventures. About a year and a half ago, a criminal case was lodged against him for large-scale fraud. On 25 September 1992, V. Selga was arrested and charged with cheating in a deal with the confectionery firm "Uzvara," in a deal worth 50 million rubles. [passage omitted] A few hours before his death, Selga had called the investigating magistrate. "At around 1800 on Tuesday, Voldemars Selga called me and asked when I was going to finish the investigation. He told me it has been settled with my administration, although nothing of the kind has taken place," Maigurs Strikis, the investigating officer of the Ministry of Interior Affairs Investigating Department, who is in charge of the case, told us yesterday. As for the question of what is going to happen to the case, the investigator replied that apparently it will be closed due to the death of the accused. [passage omitted]
