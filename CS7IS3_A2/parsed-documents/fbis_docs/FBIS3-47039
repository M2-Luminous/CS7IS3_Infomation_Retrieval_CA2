The first is "south" which implies the South-North issue. The second word is "speed." The realization of an information-oriented society will further progress, and in 10 to 15 years from now all means of communications are expected to have about doubled their present speeds. The third word is, though its use is a little farfetched, "ethnicity" which, when transliterated, starts with "es" (S) (esnisity). There will be growing interest in the racial or community issue and in the so-called "nation state" question--to put it simply, the question of the nation. First, as to the South-North issue, I think that this issue can also be subdivided into three "E's." They are "economy," "energy," and "environment." Harmonizing these three "E's" seems to be synonymous with resolving the issue of the "south," that is, developing countries, is it not? On the global environment problem as well, the following questions are raised: Which regions will succeed in development? Will they be advanced countries or developing countries? Another question is: Who will use fossil fuel? These are the questions which the South-North issue involves. I may receive your scolding by saying this, but I think that it is proper to use atomic power, to which safety is important, as long as its users are advanced countries. As to the second "S" or speed, this aspect can also be divided into two "N's." They are "network" and "neighbors." These days we frequently hear people talk about downsizing and in this connection, as the use of networks expands, the need for, say, libraries will dwindle. It also becomes possible to obtain copies directly from the U.S. Harvard University library. Referring to neighbors, it is frequently said that borders may disappear in the economy-related sector for example. There were no economic interchanges on the Sea of Japan in the era of the East-West cold war, but exchanges will be carried out vigorously through the Sea of Japan in the future. Harmony Between Nation and Individuals As to the third category "ethnicity," it can further be divided into three "H's." The first is "human rights" or individual rights. Perhaps, the world will change in such a way that each individual will become its center. The second is "history." The nation states were formed in modern times, and it was after the start of the 20th century that the nation states bent their minds on economic issues and began to mention the importance of full employment. A nation takes care of its people by providing conveniences; however, it is not the nation that furnishes them with affluence. Instead, each individual of the nation must pursue affluence on his or her own. The most typical example of this pursuit is a racial movement. Herein lies the reason for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks in Czechoslovakia. Racial problems are rare in Japan, and on this score I think that they are rather linked to the doctrine of well-being, thereby becoming arguments for the decentralization of administrative power. Concerning the third point, "harmony," I think that how to harmonize relations among the state, the community, and each individual will assume importance from now. Such are the fundamental tides of the world, and I believe that amid them we are now at a period of adjustment. I say that the year 1990 marked the end of World War III. That was the year when the cold war ended. The settlement of issues ensuing from the termination of this war will require very large energies, but when I consider the global distribution of economic influences in the future, I believe that the future will still be the tripolar era formed by Japan, the United States, and the EC nations. Perhaps, regional relations among countries surrounding these tripolar forces will increasingly be deepened. World War III has ended, and so there will probably no need for the present veto-bound Security Council which we began to have when World War II ended. It will be necessary to fully review the UN organization itself. So Good That They Would Like To Live in... The foregoing is an outline of the world direction, but under these circumstance what will become of Japan? I would like to view this question also from three points. First, we should build a beautiful national land. I think that Japan's future will largely depend on whether we can build a national land which is so good that even foreigners would like to come and live in Japan. When I visit Europe and see such scenes as red roofs, white walls, and potted flowers hanging in each house, I feel like living there--though not for life--at least two or three years. The estimation of a region or a national land will be decided by whether visitors from around the world feel like residing there, will it not? Second, what about becoming a "middle power" in the sense of restraining ourselves? Of late, our country is frequently called an economic superpower, but Japan does not need to become a "superpower" at all. I believe that it will be good enough for Japan to be a middle power. I think that the recent change of regime has provided a chance to animate discussions about the state. From a long-term viewpoint, the form of state we choose will be a great issue. However, Japan will ruin itself if it loses its status as a technology-based nation. And future thriving businesses in Japan will be interface industries which connect different sectors, will they not? Materials are connected by distribution, and funds by banking. What connects techniques is research. Last, I think that the decentralization of administrative power is necessary for building a beautiful national land as well. I propose that local areas be given more authority in the utilization of land. What about repealing the Agricultural Promotion Act and the Town Planning and Zoning Act and enforcing a space maintenance law like one in Germany? This law provides for a formula under which the assembly of each local public body designs programs for the utilization of land while the head of each local public body enforces them. This formula, when followed, makes it possible to create a town of red-roofed houses if its members all say they like the red roof. Moreover, we will have an aging society from now. It is each locality that sustains such a society in a real sense. This has thus far been the job of the nation and the family in terms of social security. However, support by the family has now reached its limit. A helping hand is needed in every resperct, but such a thing is the job of each locality rather than of the nation. In this sense as well, the decentralization of administrative power has become important.
