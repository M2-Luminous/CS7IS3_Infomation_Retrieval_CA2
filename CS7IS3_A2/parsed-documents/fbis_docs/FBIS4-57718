According to Vivas, president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV, the organization in charge of privatizations), American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Aces of Colombia, and a local finance company refused to participate in the purchase. In the opinion of these four companies, the base price of $450 million established for Aeropostal does not reflect the value of its assets. Vivas explained that although the consortiums expressed interest, they noted that its overvalue [sobredimensionamiento], its excessive number of retirees, the currency devaluation, and social instability are factors that must be assessed before making the purchase. Vivas's statements at a news conference following the opening of the envelopes containing the consortiums' bids, suggest that they apparently requested, among other things, a reduction in the more than 3,000 employees of Aeropostal, the country's third largest airline. They also asked the government to guarantee currency stability, a negotiation of the number of retirees, and the "excessive social benefits" granted to Aeropostal employees. The FIV minister-president said that the proposals of the consortiums interested in purchasing Aeropostal will be analyzed next Monday. He added that the Caldera administration will not budge in its effort to privatize state companies. Caldera, who assumed the presidency in February, plans, within his economic stabilization program, to privatize six hotels this year and a similar number in 1995, as well as tourist services, Aeropostal, and electricity companies. According to FIV estimates, the sale of at least 13 companies, which should yield $1.8 billion to the state, will start this year. The center of the privatization process is the electricity sector which involves the transfer to private hands of the main electricity plant and three distribution networks that represent 88 percent of the revenues that the Executive Branch is expecting to receive. The remaining funds will come from the sale of the "La Rinconada" Racetrack, a milk factory (Indulac), Aeropostal (the third largest airline based on operations), ports, and six hotels rated as five, four, and three stars. According to FIV figures, 36.3 percent of the revenues will be used to pay for the costs of the privatization process. The other 63.7 percent will help ease the serious fiscal deficit of over $4.5 billion, which represents more than 6 percent of the $63 billion GNP. The sale of the stock of the national telephone company privatized in 1992 that is still in state hands (49 percent) is scheduled to take place next year and this will produce revenues of about $7 billion. The privatization process started in Venezuela in 1989 as part of a plan to liberalize the economy and it yielded revenues of $2.6 billion as of 1993. Eighty percent of those revenues were used to cover the fiscal deficit.
