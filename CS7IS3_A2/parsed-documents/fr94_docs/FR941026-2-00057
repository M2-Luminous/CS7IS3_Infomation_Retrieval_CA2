FR941026-2-00057 FR941026-2-00036 B. Proposed Projects To Be Funded With FY 1994 and 1995 Funds The purpose of this announcement is to invite single year (up to seventeen months in duration) or up to thirty-six month proposals from eligible applicants to undertake any or all of the Phases. Applicants may apply for projects of up to 36 months duration. A multi-year project, requiring more than 12 months to develop and complete, affords applicants the opportunity to develop more complex and in-depth projects. Funding after the first 12 month budget period of an approved multi-year project is non-competitive and subject to availability of funds. (see Part E for further information) Phase I: The purpose of Phase I is to conduct the research and planning needed to identify environmental impacts to Indian lands caused by Department of Defense activities on or near Indian lands and to plan for remedial investigations to determine and carry out a preliminary assessment of these problems. These activities may include, but not be limited to, the following: •conduct site inspections to identify problems and causes related to DOD activities; •identify and develop approaches to handle raw data that will assist in performing comprehensive environmental assessments of problems and causes related to DOD activities; •identify approaches and develop methodologies which will be used to develop the activities to be undertaken in Phases II and III; •identify other Federal agency programs, if any, that must be involved in mitigation activities and their requirements; •identify potential technical assistance and expertise required to address the activities to be undertaken in Phases II and III; and •identify other Federal environmental restoration programs that could be accessed to cooperatively coordinate and mobilize resources in addressing short and long-term activities developed under Phase III. Phase I should result in adequately detailed documentation of the problems and sources of help in solving them to provide a useful basis for examining alternative mitigation approaches in Phase II. Phase II: The purpose of Phase II activities is to examine alternative approaches for mitigation of the impacts identified in Phase I and to lead toward the mitigation design to be developed in Phase III. Phase II activities may include, but need not be limited to the following: •conduct remedial investigation and/or feasibility studies as necessary; •plan for the design of a comprehensive mitigation strategy to address problems identified during Phase I which address areas such as land use restoration, clean-up processes, contracting and liability concerns; regulatory responsibilities; and resources necessary to implement clean up actions; •design strategies that coordinate with or are complementary to existing DOD cleanup programs such as the Defense Environmental Restoration Program which promotes and coordinates efforts for the evaluation and cleanup of contamination at DOD installations; •review possible interim remedial strategies that address immediate potential hazards to the public health and environment in order to provide alternative measures i.e., providing alternate water supplies, removing concentrated sources of contaminants, or constructing structures to prevent the spread of contamination; •identify specific types of technical assistance and management expertise required to assist in developing specific protocols for environmental assessments, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, interim remedial actions and strategic planning for existing and future mitigation activities; •review other types of assessments that need to be considered, reviewed and incorporated into the conduct and/or design process such as: _estimates of clean-up cost; _estimate of impacts of short-term approach; _estimate of impacts of long-term approach; _cultural impacts; _economic impacts; _human health-risk impacts; and •document approaches and procedures which have been developed in order to negotiate with appropriate Federal agencies for necessary cleanup action and to keep the public informed. In establishing the basis for a design process, particularly when there are multiple problems, the applicants may want to consider a prioritization process as follows: •emergency situations that require immediate clean-up; •time-critical sites, i.e. sites where the situation will deteriorate if action is not taken soon; •projects with minimum funding requirements; •projects with intermediate-level funding requirements; •projects with maximum funding requirements. Achieving compliance with Federal environmental protection legislation is the driving force behind all Federal clean-up activities. The following is a list of major Federal environmental legislation that should be recognized in a regulatory review as all Federal, state and local regulatory requirements which could have major impacts in the design of mitigation strategies: •Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act of 1992; •Clean Air Act (CAA); •Clean Water Act (CWA); •Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); •Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA); •Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA); •Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); •Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA);
