His wife, (Huang Chun-mien); his two children, (Li Hsin-yao) and (Li Hsin-kao); and his 68-year-old foster mother (Li Yu-ying) were also on board. The family of five were led by the aviation police off the plane for further investigations. The airplane has departed CKS Airport at 1444 [0644 GMT]. Except for Lin Wenqiang, his family and other passengers on board were expatriated in the airplane. It is understood that hijacker Lin Wenqiang, 25, is a Fukien [Fujian] native.

To carry out the hijacking, he carried a fruit knife and placed tissue paper in a teacup to pass it off as an explosive device. According to the hijacker's confessions, he hijacked the airplane to Taiwan in a rage over the Communist Chinese local government's obstruction of his application to set up a company.
