Since only one carrier may be authorized for this service, we are requesting applications from all U.S. certificated carriers that are interested in performing services between New York and Turin. 1 1 Trans World Airlines has a pending exemption application in Docket 49535 for authority to conduct scheduled combination service between New York and Turin. TWA may amend or supplement its application under the procedural timeframes established in this notice. We request that exemption applications to provide this service be filed no later than May 31, 1994; that answers be filed no later than June 7, 1994; and that replies be filed no later than June 13, 1994. Except for the filing dates, exemption applications should conform to subpart D of part 302 of the Department's regulations. Applications should be filed with the Department's Docket section, room 4107, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Further procedures for acting on the applications filed, if necessary, will be established in a future Department order. We will serve a copy of this notice on all U.S. certificated carriers licensed to conduct airline services with large jet aircraft. Dated: May 19, 1994. Paul L.
