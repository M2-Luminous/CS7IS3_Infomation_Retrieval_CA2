[National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini professes to be optimistic. He does not believe the rumors concerning gathering storms, and he seems to rule out further elections, a possibility which -- rumor has it -- some Forza Italia members may have been contemplating. In any case, in order to avoid further jolts, Fini is making haste to wear the hat of the patient mediator between an aggressive Nothern League Secretary Bossi and a haywire Prime Minister Berlusconi. Thus he is facing up to those constantly reproaching him for being nostalgic about rough woolen cloth and high boots [reference to fascist uniform]. [Caprettini] The committee war in the Senate, quarrels, mutual accusations.... Deputy Fini, is the majority already beginning to fall apart? [Fini] Not at all! The election campaign is still not over.... The situation will go back to normal after 12 June. As regards the committee chairmanships which the majority failed to obtain in the Senate, I do not believe they will be an obstacle to the government's action. [Caprettini] However, there is already some talk of going back to the polls. [Fini] No, I do not believe elections will be necessary. [Caprettini] Not even if Bossi continues his offensive against Forza Italia? [Fini] I repeat: For his election campaign, Bossi has chosen to clash with Berlusconi because he fears that his own identity may be watered down or swamped. This is why he is raising his voice. I do not justify his stand, but...let us say that I understand his political logic. After the vote, however, I think the problems will be solved. In fact, Bossi himself has said that this majority is not to be tampered with for at least another two years. [Caprettini] However, can a negative result in the European elections not lead the League to exacerbate the differences? [Fini] If Bossi were to lose a lot of ground...then something may indeed happen. On the other hand, I am asking myself: Where could he then go? [Fini] Well, to the Left, I guess. His beckoning to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], his vaunted support for Arlacchi's candidacy for the chairmanship of the Anti-Mafia Commission.... [Fini] Mmmm, no.... (Here Fini made a grimace, he did not believe that Bossi would start moving in a different direction -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) I do not believe that he is seriously thinking of changing his position. [Caprettini] Deputy Fini, what do you think of the fact that the other day, speaking to his deputies, Berlusconi praised you to the heavens? Do you wish to return his compliments? [Fini] I must say that the prime minister was always very straightforward with me, and therefore I reciprocate his trust in me. Which does not mean, of course, that I have always agreed with him. [Caprettini] Have you already had some differences of opinion? [Fini] Over the intelligence services, for example. I would have already started from scratch. [Caprettini] What about Forza Italia's idea of opening a dialogue with the PPI [Italian Popular Party] in the future, if [PPI leader] Buttiglione wins the day? [Fini] I agree that the majority must become broader, and that it can show some interest in Buttiglione. We must, however, establish a premise, namely, that it should be them who approach the majority positions, rather than pretending that we are shifting toward them. [Caprettini] Today you were interviewed by THE WASHINGTON POST, NEWSWEEK, and THE NEW YORK TIMES -- the entire U.S. press is asking you whether you are a fascist, right? [Fini] My God! I have done nothing but answer this very question. [Caprettini] What did you say about Mussolini? [Fini] Exactly what I had already told LA STAMPA, and which was in fact somewhat distorted, namely, that he was one of the greatest Italian politicians in this century. I confirm this. [Caprettini] What did you think of [Rome Mayor] Rutelli's speech at the Capitol before the U.S. President -- in which he stressed that there would never again be a dictatorship in Italy? [Fini] He said the same things that I had already said in my speech on trust, in the Chamber of Deputies. [Caprettini] Finally, a word about Clinton. What is your opinion of him? [Fini] He is a pragmatist, like all Americans.
