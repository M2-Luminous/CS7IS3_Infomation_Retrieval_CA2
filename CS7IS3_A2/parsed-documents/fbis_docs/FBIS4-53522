Because of the aging of the population, the amount of assets in corporate pension funds has grown steadily, exceeding 50 trillion yen. This sizable amount is attracting attention from those who are involved in this market. 2. There are only two sources of funds for corporate pension plans: contributions and earnings from investment. Because of the aging of population, pension funds will have to rely more on investment earnings in the future. 3. To increase investment revenues in the long run, it becomes necessary to achieve optimal allocation of assets, according to the degree of acceptable risk for each pension fund. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a system of risk management for each pension fund and to eliminate or ease regulations on investment imposed on both investment companies and pension funds. Reaching the "Mature" Stage by 2010 Because of Increased Payments of Pension Benefits There has been a rapid expansion in the total amount of assets in corporate pension funds, which supplement income for salaried employees after their retirement. As of the end of the fiscal year 1992, the amount stood at more than 47 trillion yen (32 trillion yen of which was in welfare annuity funds, and 15 trillion yen in funds approved for special tax treatments), showing a robust increase of more than 10 percent per year. It was the third largest, following 317 trillion yen in the United States and 52 trillion yen in England. According to Nomura Research Institute, the amount is expected to exceed 100 trillion yen by the year 2000. Especially noteworthy is the growth of welfare annuity funds. As of the end of February 1994 there were 1,804 funds with 12 million participants, representing about a one-third of salaried employees at private companies. These funds provide good security -- they distribute portion of the nation's welfare annuities and are required to pay out more than 30 percent of the amount of this distribution. In comparison to other pension plans, they are also attractive -- they receive preferential tax treatments; contributions to the funds up to a certain level are not subject to taxation. These are probably the reasons that the corporations have enthusiastically adopted these funds. Assets in the pension funds are invested in stocks and bonds in the financial market through trust banks and life insurance companies to generate revenues. Therefore, people involved in the market have a strong interest in pension funds assets that will continue to grow in the future. Eighty-seven percent of the pension funds assets that are managed by trust banks are invested in stocks and bonds; 44 percent in the case of those that are managed by life insurance companies (as of the end of the fiscal year 1992). As trust banks and life insurance companies share this market by two to one, approximately 70 percent plus of the pension assets are invested in stocks and bonds. Beginning in the fiscal year 1990, portion of the assets in the welfare annuity funds can be managed by investment advisory firms. Also, the Federation of Welfare Annuity Funds can manage the assets with some restrictions. Therefore, much larger portion of pension assets will likely be invested in stocks and bonds in the future. An important mission for those involved in pension funds is to invest in the financial market as profitably as possible pension assets that are entrusted to them by corporations and participants and thereby to ensure future payments of pension benefits. But, as explained in detail in the following, the problem is that the current system of investment is not adequate to carry out this mission. There are only two sources of revenues for welfare annuity funds to pay pension benefits: contributions from corporations and participants, and earnings from investing the contributions. In light of the austere condition where corporations are carrying out restructuring of their operations, it seems difficult to raise the amount of contributions. As pension-related costs are estimated to be about 10 percent of total wages, raising them further will not be accepted readily. On the other hand, a 1-percent increase in the rate of return on investment is in general enough to offset more than a 20-percent reduction in the amount of contributions. Therefore, proper investment will generate a significant amount of assets. As corporate pension funds have become widespread, some of them began to reach the "mature stage," where the amount of annual payments of pension benefits equals that of annual contributions. Most of the funds are expected to reach this mature stage by the year 2010, and thus the time is getting short for making enough profits from investment. Problems in the System That Lacks Market Principles In April 1992 a Committee of Professionals was established within the Committee of Assets Management at the Federation of Welfare Annuity Funds. Its objective was to examine problems in assets management, including restrictions on investment, and to find solutions to these problems. Committee members included Shigeki Sakakibara, professor of management at Kobe University, and five other academics who are knowledgeable of pension assets and computations. After a year of study, they compiled and issued a report entitled "On Revising Restrictions on Investment of Pension Assets." The members of the committee and those involved in pension funds at that time expressed their candid opinions: "We were able to recognize how important market principles are in managing pension assets in the securities market, and in what respects the series of current restrictions on investment are in contradiction to these market principles." They also agreed on another point: "To meet the trust of participants and beneficiaries of some 1,800 pension funds, it is important for pension funds managers to understand the market principles and to carry out their job responsibilities prudently and honestly, considering different levels of acceptable risks for different funds." In other words, they reached a conclusion that there is no other way than to establish a prudent-men's rule (fiduciary responsibility) as in the ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) in the United States. This means establishment of a system of risk management by pension funds. In addition to making basic investment policies (regarding acceptable risks and so on), it is necessary to create a comprehensive manual, covering how to select institutions that manage pension funds and how to evaluate investment performances. Reactions from various circles against the report by the Committee of Professionals were not limited to favorable ones such as "What they say sounds reasonable in light of the current condition." Some opinions were critical: "Restrictions on investment are still necessary to ensure the safety of pension assets," and "to eliminate restrictions on investment, pension funds themselves must streamline their operations first." To these opinions, we responded as follows: First, to ensure sound investment and to protect pension benefits of beneficiaries, investment activities through trust banks and life insurance companies have been restricted since the inception of the pension system, using same ratios as current allocation of pension assets (i.e., more than 50 percent of assets are to be reserved to guarantee the principal, and less than 30 percent to be invested in domestic stocks), except for assets denominated in foreign currencies, according to the notice from chief of the Banking Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and per enforcement regulations of the Insurance Business Act. However, as almost 30 years have passed since the inception of this system, it is not clear how much safety these restrictions provide to the pension assets. Also, investment through investment advisory firms that were allowed to enter the pension market in 1990 is subject to fund-by-fund restrictions (i.e., more than 50 percent of assets are to be reserved to guarantee the principal, less than 30 percent to be invested in domestic stocks, and less than 30 percent to be invested in assets denominated in foreign currencies) as well as a duplicate restriction requiring more than 50 percent of assets to be reserved to guarantee the principal. Here, it is unclear why the duplicate restriction is imposed. These restrictions also deviate from the special rulings that came about as a result of the Japan-U.S. talks on monetary policies in 1991, easing restrictions on foreign investment advisory firms by allowing them to reserve more than 30 percent of assets to guarantee the principal. As an example of advantages of the restrictions, we often hear the following opinion: "Owing to restrictions on investment, valuation losses of pension assets were only about 10 percent even when the stock market hit the bottom after the collapse of the bubble economy." We want to respond to this by saying, "This does not provide evidence that restrictions on investment contribute to risk management of each individual fund. In light of the acceptable risks, profits could have been made if pension assets were allocated more to stocks than the regulated ratio (30 percent) dictated. Therefore, they [restrictions on investment] are actually robbing income opportunities from the funds." The biggest drawback of investment restrictions is that they are weakening the sense of responsibility by both funds and investment firms over risk management. For example, let's assume that a fund at a high stage of maturity allocated its assets to stocks up to the upper limit of the regulated ratio when it should have reduced the amount of such investment in stocks. As a result, the fund may incur valuation losses due to declining stock prices, and pension financing that has already become tight due to the advanced stage of maturity may deteriorate further. In August 1993 the Federation of Welfare Annuity Funds asked some of the major financial institutions to which it entrusts management of its pension assets how they thought of restrictions according to types of investment institutions. All of the eight trust banks and eight life insurance companies that were questioned replied, "Regulations are needed at least until pension funds themselves streamline their risk management systems." In contrast, all of the 16 investment advisory firms that entered the market in April 1990 and three foreign-owned trust banks replied differently: "Regulations should be eliminated as soon as possible." The difference in opinions seems to show that regulations are business-related issues of these investment institutions, rather than safety issues for pension assets. Those involved in pension funds strongly hope for earliest possible elimination of investment regulations so that pension funds with established risk management systems can select investment institutions on their own according to their own investment policies. The objective in managing pension assets is to maximize profits under the level of risk acceptable to each individual fund so that pension liabilities will continue to be met in the future. The acceptable level of risk varies, depending on the stage of maturity of each individual fund as well as the employer's ability to contribute to the fund, that is, the profitability of the business. Therefore, it is not something to be regulated. Application of Regulations According to Funds Ability However, it was necessary to reconfirm a consensus for pension funds in dealing with the issue at present. This point was resolved in early December 1993 when the Committee on Assets Management reached a decision: "For the time being, we maintain investment regulations at the funds level, with exception of those funds that have an ability to manage risks and a high level of risk tolerance." Those of us who are involved in pension funds understand that to demand easing of regulations, it is imperative for us to establish a system of risk management (prudent-men's rule) on pension funds. To this end, we are preparing an investment manual in our department and are planning to distribute it to all pension funds at the beginning of the fiscal year 1994.
