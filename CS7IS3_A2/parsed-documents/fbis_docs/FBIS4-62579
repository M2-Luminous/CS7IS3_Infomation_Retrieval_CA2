"We are resolving these issues in practical terms," a senior member of Russia's Foreign Ministry, Viktor Gogitidze, told Interfax. The decision to give aid to the Palestinian police was taken in principle during the recent meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, in Moscow, he noted. "This concerns the granting of light firearms and some other types of equipment. Each of these types is to be endorsed by the Israelis," he explained. When the Israelis and the Palestinians signed their Gaza-Jericho first agreement in Cairo, the coordinating committee for giving aid to the Palestinian police force, Russia is a member of, held a session. "We studied everything done in terms of giving aid to the Palestinian police force, and considered what else they need," he said. According to Gogitidze, despite the difficulties the Palestinian police and security forces are ready to take the greater part of functions connected with maintaining law and order in Gaza and Jericho upon themselves. "This is particularly important because under agreements the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the process of transferring power from the civilian and military administration to the Palestinian structures in Gaza and Jericho should be concluded before the end of May," he said. As Interfax's interviewee noted, "the process of Middle East settlement will depend largely on how the Israeli-Palestinian talks on the West Bank, that is on the autonomy as such, will proceed." "Gaza and Jericho will be the sample under which the further spread of autonomy in the West Bank will be built. The problem of settlements and the issues of jurisdiction, particularly territorial, are the most complicated, he said. These talks should necessarily be resumed, since the agreement on Gaza and Jericho is good, but it is insufficient and too isolated." Talks in the other directions, such as Israeli-Syrian, got stalemated, the diplomat conceded. "On the whole the situation is favorable for breaking the impasse. As far as we can judge, the Israelis realize that Syria is a key country in the Middle East. Movement forward in the entire peace process is unthinkable without progress in the Syrian direction, he said. The Syrians also realize that the situation is changing for the better. Everything hinges on the circumstance that they expect the Israelis to make a clear statement as to their willingness to comply with Resolution No. 242 issued by the U.N. security Council, that is withdraw from the Golan Heights altogether."
