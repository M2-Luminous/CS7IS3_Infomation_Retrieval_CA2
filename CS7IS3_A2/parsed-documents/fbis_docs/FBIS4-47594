Leading Scientists of Kurchatov Institute Talk About Coming Changes''] txt}[Text] OG: Many have attributed the current decline in prestige of science directly to the Chernobyl disaster, while scientists, the creators of new sources of energy, are seen as Greeks bearing gifts of which one must beware at all costs... Ponomarev-Stepnoy: Clearly, this is the wrong approach. The causes of the disaster lay in a sociopolitical system, rather than in science. It must be kept in mind that for decades the nuclear industry was a state within a state, entirely out of contact with the other world: there were cities not shown on any map, the strictest discipline was maintained in classified combines. This is what drove all nuclear danger inward. And this rigid and closed system produces a child and turns it loose on God's world. And no one even stops to think about how to fix things so that this child does not make a devil of a mess. None of the necessary steps were taken to safeguard the existence of nuclear power outside the confines of the state within a state. Chernoplekov: The late Anatoliy Petrovich Aleksandrovich, a pioneer and staunch supporter of nuclear power, started getting uneasy rather early on. He repeatedly reported to the management that the intensive development in this field had its down side as well, and that immediate steps were needed. And incidentally, he did manage to get some steps taken at the time. The Nuclear Power Oversight was his initiative, as was the introduction of military certification of all goods for nuclear electric power plants. OG: Heretofore, the entire structure of Soviet science had been determined by the part it had to play in the socialist society. Now we are converting to a market economy, and yet this structure remains virtually unchanged... Belyayev: Science is not alone in having that trouble. We have all been living in a society with distorted proportions. We had a huge army, huge science--true pearls in the crown of the Soviet Empire! Consider this unique phenomenon: the existence of an enormous number of political, economic and sociological institutes. No one nation has such a thing. And all these institutes were in fact subsidiary institutions of the Central Committee of the CPSU. In many areas, we have proportions that have been broken. Of course, science needs restructuring, that's obvious. OG: With regard to the ``brain drain'' to the West, the problem is perhaps exaggerated at the moment. The more so in the case of your field... Belyayev: In our nuclear centers, the situation is just about hopeless. They are having a tough time getting reoriented. There is virtually no problem of a ``brain drain'' to the West in the nuclear industry. For us it is something else: there is no ``replenishment'' of key personnel. Out of 96 graduates of our department at the Physicotechnical Institute, 40 have gone over to the West. Half of the remaining 56 have gone to commercial banks. And incidentally, you can now find Physicotechnical Institute graduates in the management of just about any commercial bank. Kadomtsev: If you add up the number of papers that have been written by the most eminent scientists, it turns out that half the papers are being written by a number equal to the square root of the total number of scientists, and they are the source of half the work. Extract the square root of the million scientists that we now have in our nation, and you get a thousand people actively creating science. What is the outcome? You can't tell me that there aren't many people leaving. In fact, if you take a thousand eminent scientists, and out of those there are thirty of the front leaders going elsewhere, the scientific potential is cut in half. It is not only the number of talented scientists that is significant. They have an impact, as it were, on the whole coloring. If schools of science fall away, so does the scientific potential. It is for this reason that we have to keep an eye on who is leaving. And unfortunately, the ones leaving are the most talented. About three years ago, it was barely noticeable, and now it is obvious. On the other hand, you can hear Russian being spoken in literally any U.S. university. I have seen many of our graduates there. Their potential, of course, has considerably increased because Russian scientists are nothing at all like their Western colleagues. Our scientists have a different ``set'' from those of the West. There a scientist, like any engineer, is narrowly specialized. On the other hand, here in one continuous tangle a person has to be much more broadly educated and diverse to have a normal existence. When our people reach the West, they have a tremendous advantage over Western specialists simply by virtue of their education and our specific character. the indigenous ``families''... Kadomtsev: There is yet another side to the issue: the role, place and volume of research that our nation can allow itself. Prior to perestroyka, the USSR was second in science only to the United States. Now the empire has crumbled, and the information loss has been enormous. Without the ability to communicate, the potential began to decline very rapidly. Secondly, science lost its prestigious position in the nation, which is part of a general pattern. There had been a huge empire which, like any empire, had been watching out for its crown, for its facade. It is no exaggeration to say that this facade was magnificent. Excellent education, advanced technology, leading-edge science on a par with Western standards. But unfortunately, the rest of the infrastructure of the nation could not be pulled up to this level. Of course, from time to time it was remembered that help was sometimes needed in rural areas. They got us together and sent us out to a collective farm to bring in the harvest. We were puzzled about the reason for sending intellectuals to do such work, why workmen were not sent instead. But the workmen were elsewhere, helping out in the ``boondocks.'' Now it is clear that science as it exists in Russia is unfortunately larger in scale than the Russian potential can support. Even if the present government had the desire to act and support the facade on the same level (it is not in fact so concerned), it could not now be done. Once we had a privileged position. But another component of society had been decapitated, and the potential sucked out. The management that should have existed in a normal nation was underdeveloped. It did not absorb young blood. Today, young people have realized that by working in this field one can achieve a much better standard of living and have chances to improve one's position in society. It is natural that our alumni are now looking at commercial banks rather than at Kurchatov Institute. In fact, even earlier we should have been sharing with management, where there is a need for young people. At one time our former prime minister Valentin Pavlov said: ``All of Soviet science is working for the West.'' And although it is harsh and coarse, the quote is not groundless. Science is international. All results of research, except for what is classified, are published in the scientific press and are the property of the world community. Scientists of different nations form ``invisible colleges'' that are thoroughly familiar with one another's work, and react instantaneously to the corresponding results. But different nations put the product of science to different uses. ``Balanced nations'' like the United States very rapidly transform scientific knowledge and technology into new goods. And thereby they enrich their nation. But we have failed to tune our internal social organism with sufficient finesse. OG: On the other hand, we see that the United States has not just ``jumped'' at building its own orbital station. A joint project with Russia has been agreed to. And for a measly 400 million dollars, we give up everything we have, all our unique technologies. Ponomarev-Stepnoy: Of course, we could elect not to give it up. But then our space technology would die. Here is the dilemma: to give it up, or not to give it up and perish. The Americans take us as partners, and we give them a lot. But so what? We should learn to work like they do. I can cite a specific example. We have sold the United States nuclear power plants for spacecraft. We have invested a certain part of the proceeds in development of new technologies. Among other things, we have financed the development of new coolants for refrigerators. Something that the United States and other nations have been working on to no avail so far. They have passed a law: no freons down and worked out a formula for a coolant that will not harm the ozone layer and can be used in existing refrigerators. However, we have this fluid without freons that no one has need of. We wanted to take out a patent, so the Americans told us: ``As soon as you publish everything, we will make the same fluid, adding, say, one atom of argon. Then it will be our patent. We will simply take your fluid and charge our refrigerators with it. You can take us to court and be in litigation for ten years. Assume that you win the suit. We pay you 500,000 dollars, you will spend millions to get it, and we will get billions.'' So learning to get into the market is not that simple. We must pay our dues with our brains and our technologies. Belyayev: A characteristic feature of our science has been that fundamental research was most open. There was a maximum of international exchange. A lot of it has already been incorporated into world science. But the most material intensive and fund intensive, and perhaps the most important research for our science was classified as a rule. Here it must have been no worse for us than for them, even if more costly. Now the greatest problems have come up in these areas. Chernoplekov: Russia will inevitably produce a certain amount of talent per unit of time per unit of space. In accordance with the conditions that we will bring about, talents will be distributed: political, military, scientific... We know that in Germany after the war at one time science was wiped out. Talented young people were leaving the country. And now when we travel to Germany we see that kids and people returning from the West are working in science there. There is almost no middle link. We should understand this and make efforts to avoid it. Belyayev: And how do we keep our young people for science? I do not agree that it is such a tragedy that young specialists are going over to the West. I don't know what is better: going off and retaining what they have while developing in science, or staying here and not getting into it at all. And why believe that none of them will ever return, and that we will not reap the benefit for our science from what they are now doing? The large contingent of our former citizens who are now living in Israel opens up a broad exit to other fields and nations, and we ought to take advantage of it. Thousands of Chinese are scattered throughout the world, and China is now getting a lot from its compatriots, they are bringing their potential to the homeland.
