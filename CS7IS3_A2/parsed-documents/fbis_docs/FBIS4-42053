They did not even try to flee or bribe the guards. They were simply released to the four winds, since the Armenian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] did not have the 33 million rubles needed to pay for the prisoners to be escorted to their place of permanent residence. IZVESTIYA was told by Gayk Arutyunyan [name as transliterated], the republic's first deputy minister of internal affairs, that there were 1,364 criminals being sought at the start of the year, and, although this figure has fallen somewhat, the problem of finding them and bringing them back is still very acute. Everything depends on the financial resources of the MVD, and these -- according to Colonel Arutyunyan -- are very limited. Meanwhile, the republic's Finance Ministry has turned down the MVD's request to be allocated 3 billion drams, cutting the sum to 836 million. That kind of money will not make it very easy to do the job, the police department believes. Particularly when you consider that an ordinary policeman's salary in Armenia is equivalent to $1.80, and the extra pay for being a general is equivalent to just 10 cents. So the criminals can sleep easy for the time being. What cannot be cured has to be endured.
