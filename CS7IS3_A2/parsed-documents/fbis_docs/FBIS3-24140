A separate study was devoted to the "time budgeting" of television viewers. What Are They Watching? It was revealed that Ostankino had lost somewhat during the year, and the second channel had gained somewhat, but at the same time, the latter lagged behind the former in the order. Incidentally, this is only the most general idea of the ebbs and flows of television viewers on the channels. If it is individualized, we will see the following. At Ostankino, apart from its information programs, almost all the programs suffered noticeable losses. Only half as many viewers are watching "Utro" [Morning] this year as did last year. The ratings for "Zvezdnyy Chas" [Starlight Hour] in 1993 constituted 24 percent, and this year dropped to 15 percent. "Muzoboz" went from 10 percent to 6 percent. "Lotto-million" -- from 17 percent to 8.5 percent. "S Utra Poranshe" -- from 19.5 percent to 10 percent. "Marafon-15" -- from 12.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Against this background of the drop in the ratings of almost all the daily broadcasts, the constancy with which TV viewers devote their attention to the broadcast "Poka Vse Doma" [While Everyone Is Home] is worth a great deal. It consistently holds at the 19-percent mark. Most symptomatic for Ostankino, however, is the fact that showings of feature films have begun to lose their audience, even though, in the quantitative respect, the showing of films and serials this year noticeably intensified. This is a sign of the fact that a certain oversaturation of the air waves with cinematographic spectacles has taken place. In addition, one must not discount the very keen competition from NTV, whose film repertoire is of higher quality and variety than the film programs of other channels. To all appearances, Ostankino is at a point in its development which cannot be called anything but a crisis. Moreover, it is not a question of the problem which two weeks ago turned into blackmail of the telecommunications engineers, nor of the crisis of financial non-payments, but of the crisis of the creative debt of the most prestigious television company today. What Is To Be Cut? "At the same time, we looked for the `holes' in the daily broadcasting, when the television audience is minimal," the director of the service explained to Yuriy Bogomolov, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent. [Bogomolov] What do you consider as "holes?" [Director] Ratings in the area of zero to five percent. In this case it is not a question of the level of interest in certain specific broadcasts, but of the gradation of the potential viewer. It looks like this. From 6 to 7 in the morning, the audience is at zero and a little above. From 7 to 8, the audience potential grows to 10 percent. Then comes a sharp drop. Beginning at 9, pensioners tune in, which gives 13 percent. From 11 to 2 in the afternoon it is a desert -- about 7 percent. From 2 to 3 in the afternoon, there are a few more viewers -- about 9 percent. The audience begins to grow noticeably from 4 p.m. By 6, the potential audience reaches the 35-percent mark. NTV, which begins its broadcasting, not with current affairs commentators, but with entertaining programs, makes good use of this surge of viewers. It catches the wave of viewer interest and holds it for the whole evening. At 8-9 in the evening, the audience is already a whole 80 percent. This level is maintained to 10, and then begins a steady descent. By 11, we have 54 percent. Just before midnight the audience falls to 36 percent. From midnight to one in the morning -- 17 percent. After one in the morning -- 12 percent. [Bogomolov] What conclusions can be drawn from this? [Director] Daily broadcasting can be cut from 20 hours to 15 without any particular damage to the mass audience. It is clear which time slots will have to go. [Bogomolov] Apart from the mass audience, however, television has relatively narrow categories of viewers whose interests the state cannot disregard. [Director] It is not ruled out that private television companies, who can get a broadcasting license on a competitive basis, to broadcast in the airwave space freed, will take over the concern for individual, relatively narrow strata of the television viewers.
