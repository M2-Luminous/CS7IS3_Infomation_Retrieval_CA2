And these think tanks are supposed to help in the moulding of public opinion and Government policies. And yet, when it comes to the actual application of policies, the U.S. Administration has been displaying an amazing lack of coherent thinking and mature understanding of the impact of its policies on the rest of the world. It has hardly covered itself with glory in Somalia nor has Bosnia added a feather on its cap. In this rather messy background, the Deputy Secretary, Mr. Strobe Talbott's Indo-Pak safari last week has been a rather pedestrian exercise without an indication of any fresh thinking on South Asia. Granted that he was far more cautious and sophisticated than his impulsive under-secretary, Mr. Talbott's visit has been no path-breaking achievement. Mr. Talbott came, saw but hardly conquered. In New Delhi, he bravely tried to assure that Washington intends ``to cultivate good relations with India for the sake of that relationship and to do the same with Pakistan.'' In other words, New Delhi should not be concerned with what Washington would be doing with Islamabad. Consequently, it is not India's business to bother about what the U.S. would be giving or denying to Pakistan: That should be treated as a bilateral issue between two countries, just as Pakistan should treat any Indo-U.S. deal as of no consequence for itself. On paper this sounds like good logic, but in reality it is naive indeed. The strategic importance of Pakistan in the Pentagon's future projections in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf zone has hardly gone down even after the end of the Cold War. The potential turbulence that stretches from Xinjiang to Iran calls for a U.S. foothold in this region, and that is what Pakistan can provide. During Mr. Talbott's talks, there was a feeling in New Delhi that the ingenious formula--offering of F-16s in exchange for Islamabad agreeing to cap its nuclear weapons programme--would be a nonstarter as no Government in Pakistan would agree to give up its nuclear weapons programme. However, after his Islamabad talks--which he described as a ``total success''--it is becoming clear that what the Clinton Administration is immediately concerned with is the disposal of the F-16 fleet along with other lethal items for which the one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment is being pressed in the U.S. Congress. The immediate compulsion of the Clinton Administration is to sell the product of the giant aircraft and missile manufacturers in the U.S. Senator Pressler has already exposed this with regard to the F-16 offer to Pakistan. And if Mr. Narasimha Rao is willing, President Clinton will readily offer to sell another consignment of aircraft to India. Let us not forget the rumpus over our cryogenic rocket deal with Russia which was bullied to go back on its contract to make room for the promotion of the American rocket products. And now the pressure is being mounted on New Delhi to abandon its missile programme. ``If you need rockets or missiles, we are ready to sell our stuff, why make yours'' seems to be the latest jingle in the U.S. arms bazaar. The question arises: What about the widely advertised mission to cap Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme? In New Delhi, Mr. Talbott elaborated on the deal with Pakistan as ``an equation'' with ``strict unambiguous conditionality''--of which one half is the release of F-16s and the other half is ``agreement in advance to a veritable cap'' on Pakistan's nuclear programme. Two days later at Islamabad, he threw more light. In carefully worded comments it was stated that the U.S. and Pakistan have agreed to go in for ``further consideration'' of the U.S. proposal. And this joint effort would be for ``developing our approach'' to the equation. And for all that only a ``preliminary accord'' has been reached. And when further consideration was completed and ``an approach'' was developed, then they would come to produce the goal of capping, then reducing and finally eliminating nuclear weapons. A fairly protracted process which may even outlive the Clinton Administration. But the supply of F-16s would be immediate. In New Delhi, Mr. Talbott sought to underplay the issue of F-16s as having only ``a potent symbolism'' in the South Asian region and urged the need ``to look beyond symbolism to reality.'' However, such pseudophilosophical profundities can hardly conceal reality. With protocol politeness Mr. Narasimha Rao had to gently warn Mr. Talbott that the supply of F-16s would be a matter of serious concern for our defence and this would compel the Government to go in for counter-measure jeopardising Indian economy. The nonproliferation drive of the U.S. Administration hardly impresses the Third World. Behind the tenacious drive to disarm Iraq and current threats to North Korea, as also the pressure on India and Pakistan to abandon the nuclear option, there is a clear move to perpetuate the dominance of the nuclear powers over those countries which are denied these weapons--the very basis of the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. Secondly, Washington's calculation that if Pakistan could be cajoled to agree to cap its nuclear weapons programme then it will be possible to persuade India to follow suit, is made invalid by fact that the nuclear threat to India does not come from Pakistan alone but also and more seriously from China, and now from other Central Asian countries particularly Kazakhstan which has a portion of the huge nuclear stockpile of the former Soviet Union. And why should India leave out the danger of nuclear threat from Israel which had once made a sneaking attack on Pakistan's nuclear arsenal at Kahuta? So, if one is really serious about dispelling Indian threat perception, one has to extend much beyond a two-country arrangement between India and Pakistan, or even the latest version of 5+2+2 (i.e., the five permanent members of Security Council including China, plus Japan and Germany along with India and Pakistan) that is heavily weighed against India. Thirdly, the Indian perception is that the nuclear powers are not serious about reversing the nuclear arms race towards nuclear disarmament. Had they been genuinely serious about nuclear disarmament, then why did they not readily respond to Rajiv Gandhi's initiative when he placed before the UN special session in 1988 a detailed and realistic Action Plan--which was updated by Mr. Narasimha Rao in his intervention before the special session of UN Security Council in 1993? There has always been a condescendingly polite appreciation of the Indian initiative without any effort at any serious follow-up discussions by the big bosses of the nuclear corporate club. Here is a foretaste of the new form of world overlordship through nuclear monopoly of a select group of powers with the U.S. at the head, and to ensure economic domination through control of world trade as GATT represents, in which discrimination is sought to be practised even through non-economic means. In this context, the arms sale is first on the priority list for the U.S. The message is clear for all VIP visitors to Washington: Don't bother to make your own weapons, that is only a fetish. Instead, buy it from us.
