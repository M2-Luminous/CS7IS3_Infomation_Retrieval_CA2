This was the first meeting of the PWC's political affairs group since the PWC was founded last July. The two-day meeting was concluded early this evening. Liang Zhenying, a leader of the political affairs group, said to this reporter: At this meeting, we concentrated on further discussions on the election and formation of the first legislative council of the future Hong Kong SAR and related issues. The participating members reached agreement on the principles concerning the formation of the first legislative council. He said: The formation of the first legislative council should reflect the executive-led principle; the principle that the executive and legislative organs should cooperate with each other and balance and check each other, with the emphasis on cooperation; the principle of balanced participation by people from all strata in Hong Kong society; and the principle of developing democracy in an orderly and gradual process. All these are guiding principles. Liang Zhenying said: As to several specific arrangements, the members also reached a consensus. These arrangements include: That the voting age in elections should be lowered to 18 and that, in terms of the functional constituency elections, the existing methods of functional constituency elections that have proved effective, as well as the current practices and principles, shall be retained. Xiao Weiyun, another leader of the political affairs group, added: At the meeting, we also discussed the current situation and, in particular, analyzed the report presented recently by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons of the British Parliament. The members' views can be summarized into the following two points: 1) Many of the things mentioned in the report are inconsistent with the facts; 2) the report reflects some change in the British Hong Kong authorities' attitude and policy toward the Basic Law. Many members took part in the drafting of the Basic Law and are very aware of where the report does not agree with the Basic Law. He revealed that the political affairs group will hold another meeting in Beijing in June to discuss the report of the third meeting of the PWC and the arrangements for work in the second half of this year.
