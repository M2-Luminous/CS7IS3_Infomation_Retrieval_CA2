[passage omitted] Sr. Gen. Than Shwe noted that this 1993 third four-monthly coordination meeting is an important one and it is time to review 1993 and to draw plans for the first four months of 1994. He expressed the need to review the achievements truthfully when presenting reports. Successes and failures should be presented realistically. Continuing, he explained that if success is not yet realized, new correct methods should be implemented to achieve it. If honest presentations are not made there will be many errors in the activities and this will hinder the progress of the country. He then noted that in this present era there are many development works according to the areas and regions. He said there are three classifications -- work activities purely on a self-help basis, work activities jointly on a self-help basis with government support, and government funded activities jointly with regional support. He remarked that in implementing regional development activities one could not rely on the government for everything and they should not be neglected by the central organizations also. He then explained since regional authorities have been delegated with the power to act, they should choose their priorities in implementing development projects. Basically, it must be on a self-help basis. If it is not feasible, then government support should be acquired. He reminded that after taking the responsibilities of the state according to historical changes, work should be carried out with determination and commitment for the benefit of the country and the people. He explained that this opportunity should not be utilized for personal gain, but to work with the intent to benefit the country. He stressed that after a long time activities tend to become routine and responsible personnel need to adopt an active and alert motivation to work for the betterment of the state. Finally, Than Shwe reminded responsible personnel not to be satisfied with the achievements but to work for the better in 1994 based on past successes and failures. [passage omitted]
