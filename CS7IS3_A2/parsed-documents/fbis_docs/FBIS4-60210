During these contacts, the leaders exchanged congratulations on the blessed 'Id al-Adha. Our country's relations with each of these leaders' country were also discussed. The brother president briefed his brother leaders on the current developments in the Yemeni arena in light of traitor ['Ali Salim] al-Bid's action against his Yemeni homeland and the Arab nation of announcing secession, which only represents himself and the small gang of the [Yemeni] Socialist party [YSP] that conspires against the Yemeni homeland, unity, people, and their democratic approach. The president said that all the sons of our people in all the Yemeni governorates reject this crime and adhere to unity and democracy. They will continue to strongly defend and protect them from all plots and plotters, and to sacrifice all that is dear for their sake. He also said the masses of our Arab nation also reject this crime because they view the Yemeni unity as an important step on the road to achieving the pan-Arab objective of establishing comprehensive unity among the sons of the Arab nation. The president expressed appreciation for the stands of the Arab brothers who have always been concerned about Yemeni unity and about supporting the Yemeni people's march under the banner of the Republic of Yemen, whose fourth anniversary is being celebrated by our people. Another telephone contact was held last night between Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, and his brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 1 September Revolution in Libya. They exchanged congratulations on the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the current developments in our country in light of the crime of secession committed by traitor al-Bid. The Libyan leader said he was very upset because of the current serious developments which threaten the march of the Yemeni unity. He also reiterated his support for the Yemeni unity and that of the Libyan people's support for the Yemeni people to safeguard the Yemeni unity, considering it a pan-Arab gain for the Arab nation and an advanced step on the road of achieving the comprehensive unity.
