We would not like it to turn into a mere declaration," said Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Duma Committee for Informational Politics, during debates on legislative activities held in the lower house of the Russian Parliament. Poltoranin cautioned lawmakers against including into the memorandum the notion of "confronting forces". Poltoranin described today's Russia as "a raft swiftly carried away by the stream to a huge waterfall." "We most row together in order to reach a safe spot," he said. He believes that the president and the Government must offer anti-crisis measures which would be adopted by all, parliament included. For its part, the State Duma must adopt a package of legislative acts which would ensure full implementation of these measures, he added. Poltoranin believes that definite guarantees must be given both by the judicial power and public organisations, including trade unions, which "should not shake Russia with strikes," as he put it. Poltoranin urged journalists to undertake commitments to objectively cover the activities of all branches of power and processes which take place in Russia.
