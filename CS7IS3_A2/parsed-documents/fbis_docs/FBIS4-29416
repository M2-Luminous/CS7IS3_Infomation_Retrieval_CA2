The government amended four IPR-related laws last year and enacted a new law protecting the semiconductor industry, Kim told the seventh session of the Korea-U.S. Business Council that opened for a two-day session. The opening ceremony was held at the Inter-Continental Hotel in southern Seoul. "To strengthen IPR protection, our government basically aims at instituting a foundation against infringement by promulgating and revising relevant laws and regulations, by vigorously enforcing such laws nationwide until IPR infringements are completely eradicated, and by establishing greater public awareness of IPR protection," said the justice minister. As a result of Seoul's tightened enforcement, the number of detected IPR violators was 2.2 times higher in 1993 than the previous year, he said. "...We were disappointed to find that notwithstanding the (Korea-U.S. business) council's efforts, the American government has once again placed Korea on the PWL in its recent evaluation of the IPR protection of individual countries," he said. Kim was one of the early speakers at the council session, divided into committees on manufacturing, technology and service and a subcommittee on IPR.
