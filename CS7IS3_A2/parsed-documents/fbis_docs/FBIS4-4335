FBIS4-4335 "dreas062_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 South Korea Opposition Demands Recall of Ambassador to PRC Opposition Demands Recall of Ambassador to PRC SK3103062594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0516 GMT 31 Mar 94 SK3103062594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic Party [DP] demanded Thursday that the Seoul Government immediately recall Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae and reshuffle its entire diplomatic and national security team. The DP made the demand on the ground that the team has created fear and anxiety among the people by pushing an inconsistent foreign and national security policy with regard to the North Korean nuclear dispute. As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, President Kim was at the receiving end of persuasion during his visits to Japan and China, the DP said. Moreover, the Kim administration's North Korea policy has performed another sudden about-face, from a hard-line position to a moderate stance. The opposition party, however, acknowledged that it was proper for Seoul to have reaffirmed its position on resolving the North Korean issue through dialogue. For its part, the DP again made clear it was against imposing any sanctions on North Korea through the UN Security Council. DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek said, "The president has to carry out a clear policy so that the people don't become confused." "It was a very serious matter when the ambassador to China and the senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs fought in Beijing, causing confusion," Yi said. "If all members of the government's foreign and national security policy team are not changed, similar problems will continue to occur." DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won said, "Our country was subjected to international shame in China when the ambassador and the presidential aide publicly squabbled to grab the policy initiative." "The government ought to straighten out its wavering policy on the North Korean nuclear issue," Pak said. "And it has to recall Ambassador Hwang immediately." Hwang, after attending a summit between Presidents Kim and Jiang Zemin of China, briefing reporters, said, among other things, that Seoul would henceforth consult with Beijing closely on the North Korean issue, placing emphasis on China's role in the affair. Hwang said China would actively intervene to end the nuclear standoff and North Korea would allow additional International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. His remarks were refuted by Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs. The Seoul Government has not changed its policy of closely coordinating and cooperating with the United States and Japan, Chong said. Meanwhile, some members of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party also criticized the administration for lacking consistency in its policy on North Korea. Rep. Chong Che-mun, chairman of the Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee, said Ambassador Hwang's comments were uncalled for, especially while the senior presidential secretary was in the Chinese capital. "It is all very well and important to cooperate with China, but we have not reached the stage where we should shift the base of our foreign policy away from the cooperative arrangments among Japan, the United States and South Korea," said Rep. Pak Chong-su.
