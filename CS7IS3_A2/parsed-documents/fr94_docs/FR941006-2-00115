FR941006-2-00115 FR941006-2-00083 With regard to ELNs, as discussed above, except for two aspects the proposal merely provides the CBOE with the ability to list equity-linked debt securities on the same basis as the NYSE and the Amex. Moreover, the Commission notes that the proposals by the NYSE and the Amex to list and trade equity-linked debt securities were published by the Commission for the full comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. With respect to the two aspects of the ELN proposal which expand on the standards previously approved for the NYSE and the Amex, for the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that no significant regulatory issues are raised that were not adequately addressed in the Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders. 49 49 See Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders, supra note 10. Finally, Amendment No. 1 to the proposal also lowers the minimum size for an issue of securities listed pursuant to CBOE Rule 31.5.F from $20 million to $4 million. The Commission notes that this amendment merely conforms the CBOE's rules to those of the NYSE which provide that an issue of a hybrid security must have a minimum market value at issuance of at least $4 million. 50 50 See section 703.19 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 6(b)(5) 51 and 19(b)(2) 52 of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal on an accelerated basis. 51 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 52 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;04 and should be submitted by October 27, 1994. It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 53 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;04), as amended, is approved. 53 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 54 54 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
