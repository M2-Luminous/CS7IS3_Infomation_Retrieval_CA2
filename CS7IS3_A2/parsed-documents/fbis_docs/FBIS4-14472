He described Nazarbayev's idea as interesting "but every idea must be thoroughly prepared. In particular, there is no saying what consequences would follow for the CIS that has just won the status of an observer in the UN. If closer ties between two or more CIS member states frighten the others and the union becomes a purely formal body, this will hardly be a desirable outcome." In his words, Russia wanted a stronger Commonwealth. "Ways have to be found to implement the Kazakh president's proposals that would be conducive to this goal," the diplomat said.
