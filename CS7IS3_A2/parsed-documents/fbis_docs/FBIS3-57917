According to members of the three above-mentioned parties participating directly in the meetings with the Socialists, the results are proving so slight that, on the one hand, they show the weakness and uncertainties of the team headed by Carlos Solchaga. On the other hand, they are creating serious doubts about whether the PSOE wishes to go beyond creating a "smoke screen" with which to maintain the image of a fluid dialogue with the opposition while making changing and confused proposals, depending on the interlocutor and the matter which is specifically being negotiated with each. "We Could Quit Tomorrow" "We could quit tomorrow," a member of the CiU delegation told YA. "Progress is very slow: The PSOE has no real desire for us to cooperate in the legislature, but rather to surmount obstacles on an ad hoc basis in order to avoid a rift that could mean their starting to lose votes in the Congress [of Deputies]," the same source stated. In the opinion of the CiU, the "democratic impetus" has become a cosmetic operation for the PSOE. Leaders of the Catalan coalition are indignant about the Socialists backtracking on the reform of the Senate. "They told us at one of our meetings that they would convince the People's Party, so that there would be no problems in accepting our amendments aimed at the comprehensive use of Catalan in the Senate, and then we find that they are telling the People's Party just the opposite: that they will try to convince us." According to the same sources, "this switch has now occurred in other matters. Since [CiU leader] Pujol and [Basque Nationalist Party Chairman] Arzalluz said `no' to Gonzalez over joining a coalition government, and since the prime minister met with [People's Party Chairman] Aznar and promised him we know not what, the Socialists have turned toward the People's Party." "They seem," they added, "to have had enough with putting through the budgets, but the legislative term is very long, and if they continue to do so much double-dealing, we could break up the game." The suspicions aroused in the CiU by the PSOE agreement with the People's Party on Senate reform are equaled within the People's Party, where it is believed that CiU is taking "its degree of egoism" to unacceptable lengths. Only yesterday, Jose Maria Aznar asserted in Salamanca that Gonzalez failed in accepting the nationalist demands in order to ensure that it would stay in power rather than meeting the country's own needs. According to parliamentary party sources in the upper chamber, the People's Party has made the Senate reform "a matter of honor." "We will not even accept the PSOE's abstaining in the vote on CiU's amendment on the use of the official languages." "The agreement," they continued, "is to approve in full the text on which we have agreed. If they deviate from that, they can consider the `impetus' finished." Curiously enough, these sources agree with CiU in describing as a "smoke screen" the Socialists' real aim in the "democratic impetus" meetings, which, in Aznar's own opinion, "are showing that Gonzalez does not know how to govern in a minority." United Left Pessimistic Only yesterday, the PSOE and the United Left tackled another meeting on the "impetus," which leaders of the coalition led by Anguita said they were setting about with little optimism. The disquiet caused by the suspension of the bilateral meeting scheduled for the first few days in December -- the suspension that was ordered by Felipe Gonzalez after he received a letter from Julio Anguita that was highly critical of his conduct -- persists in the United Left. According to Francisco Frutos, the United Left cherishes no hope that the PSOE will be prepared to make the change the coalition demands in the economic and labor spheres, and so the "democratic impetus" cannot go very far. Other United Left leaders have told YA that "the choice of the government and the PSOE is very clear -- to rely on the conservative nationalist parties; we cannot sit at that table." People's Party, CiU, and United Left sources stated that the mutual suspicion and distrust of the PSOE could end the "impetus" soon.
