According to the League, it is necessary to shift the emphasis of public spending from current expenditure to investment and to reorganize the public sector, cutting state support in order to favor private enterprise. The League believes in the complete freedom of local authorities to levy their own taxes and be responsible for expenditure. Personal and corporate income tax would be reduced. Small and medium-sized businesses would be developed by means of partnerships, aid to southern Italy would cease, and greater flexibility in working hours would be introduced.
