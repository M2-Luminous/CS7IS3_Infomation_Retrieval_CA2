Colonel Nikolay Pivovarchuk, Russia's military attache, was introduced to Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. The ceremony was attended by General Jonas Andriskevicius, Lithuanian defense forces commander in chief, and some other Defense Ministry officials. For three years Colonel Pivovarchuk served as the assistant head of the Soviet military mission in Europe and later headed a department of the Russian Armed Forces staff. Before his present appointment, Pivovarchuk was a military and political adviser to the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. The Russian military attache said his primary task in Lithuania will be "to develop friendship, cooperation and mutual understanding." In his opinion, work in this direction will not be affected by the recent arrest of a Lithuanian businessman whose company builds housing for the Russian military in the Kaliningrad region. Pivovarchuk said he is certain that more Russian military attaches will soon come to work in Lithuania because of its "specific character" -- many Russian citizens and former servicemen. The Russian colonel will reside in Vilnius. He is the 16th foreign military attache accredited in Lithuania.
