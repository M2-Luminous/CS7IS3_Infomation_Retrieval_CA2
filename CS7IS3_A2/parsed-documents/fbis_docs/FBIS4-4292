At the news conference held at the Great Hall of the People before his departure, Li Peng announced that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji would be acting premier of the State Council during his foreign visit. As everyone knows, during the last term of the State Council, each time Li Peng made a foreign visit, he announced that then executive vice premier Yao Yilin was acting premier. Since Zhu Rongji became vice premier in 1991, this was the first time he had become acting premier. Why did the Chinese authorities make such a decision? What was the purpose of such an arrangement? Let us first see how the decision was made. According to sources in Beijing, the appointment of Zhu Rongji as acting premier was one of the personnel arrangements made by the CPC top leadership recently, and these arrangements included: 1. In accordance with the actual needs of the work of the State Council, during Li Peng's foreign visits and his absence from Beijing on other official missions, Zhu Rongji will be acting premier of the State Council. 2. Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua are executive vice premiers of the State Council. 3. The party leading group of the State Council is composed of Li Peng as secretary, Zhu Rongji as deputy secretary, and Qian Qichen (vice premier and foreign minister), Chi Haotian (state councillor and national defense minister), and Luo Gan (state councillor and seretary general) as members of the Standing Committee. 4. Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Qin Jiwei, and Ni Zhifu are executive vice chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC]. People in Beijing political circles held that the above-mentioned personnel arrangements were made according to the work performances of the individuals and the needs of the work. Such arrangements also balanced representatives from the party, the government, and the military. So they were favorable to strengthening unity in the top leading bodies and to quickening the pace of establishing the new market economic structure. Thus, the authorities will more effectively carry out the domestic and foreign policies of maintaining independence and extensively making friends in the world. The arrangements also indicated that the status of Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen had been raised, and that they would shoulder greater responsibilities. The two political rising stars will play more important roles in China's domestic and foreign affairs in the future if things do not go beyond general expectations. Qian Qichen, who is also deputy leader of the CPC Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs, will also have a weightier say on the CPC's policy toward Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. The sources also revealed that the CPC top leadership's decision on appointing Zhu Rongji as acting premier was made in accordance with a proposal by Deng Xiaoping. During the NPC session in March this year, Deng Xiaoping twice mentioned the need to create the post of acting premier. Once, Deng Xiaoping met with Qian Qichen and listened to Qian's report about recent diplomatic work. Afterward, Deng said: "Is Big Peng (Li Peng) in good health? He should take care of his health. He is still young and will have to do a lot of work. The workload in the State Council is heavy. I think that in the future when the premier makes foreign visits, an acting premier should be appointed to take charge of the State Council's routine work. Can the Political Bureau consider this?" On another occasion, on 22 March, Deng Xiaoping met with party and government leaders of some provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. He talked about two issues. One was the need to safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council; and the other was the reiteration of the need to "have two strong hands." He stressed that they must not have only one strong hand, with the other hand remaining weak, and should first toughen the style of the leading body. When talking about the work of the State Council, Deng said: "The workload of the State Council is heavier than before, but they are cooperating quite well. It is right that they continue to cooperate although there is division of work among them. Last year, Big Peng was ill for some time, and Rongji did a lot of work. Qichen also shared the workload. According to the needs of the work, the State Council should create the post of acting premier in the future. The State Council is a governmental institution, and it is different from the party's central Political Bureau and the Central Military Commission." Obviously, Deng Xiaoping's proposal on creating the post of acting premier was aimed at making Zhu Rongji acting premier during Li Peng's foreign visits. The CPC central leading body understood this and immediately made the corresponding decision. This showed that although Deng Xiaoping had long withdrawn from the political stage, he still influenced the decisionmaking operation of the third-generation leading collective of the CPC in the capacity of a CPC member and a people's deputy. This may be regarded as Deng Xiaoping's thoughtful support for the third-generation leading body, but it also showed that the current leading body still lacked the insight and courage to make independent decisions. This was precisely one of the reasons why people could not trust them unreservedly. The sources said that it was true that Zhu Rongji was promoted and appointed to such a crucially important top leading post because he was able and especially had the ability to handle economic affairs, but that he would not have the status he has today without Deng Xiaoping's bold recommendation. In the eyes of leftist-minded leaders, Zhu Rongji, who was labeled a rightist in the past, could never be a politically reliable person. Only Deng Xiaoping had the ability to remove this obstruction. So, how did Deng Xiaoping discover Zhu Rongji? After the 4 June Incident in 1989, Deng Xiaoping continued to seek someone who was able to open up a new path for reform. From Zhu Rongji's work performance as mayor of Shanghai, Deng felt that Zhu should be the right man. In early February 1991, as Deng Xiaoping had the intention of promoting Zhu to be vice premier of the State Council, he went to Shanghai with Li Xiannian and Yang Shangkun, and consulted them on this idea. In Shanghai, when Zhu Rongji reported to Deng Xiaoping on the plan to first develop financial business, trade, and infrastructural facilities in Pudong's development, Deng Xiaoping expressed appreciation again and again, and said: "I have been saying that we should have new ideas for reform, and that means new methods and measures different from those in the previous 10 years should be worked out. So we need to study the new conditions, and explore new ways. The key lies in further emancipating the mind. The planned economy should not be equated with socialism, and the market economy should not be equated with capitalism, because there is planning in capitalism and there is a market in socialism. We cannot be bogged down in a new form of ideological ossification on this issue." Deng Xiaoping not only expressed this idea to Zhu Rongji, but also selected Zhu for the "premier body" later. Obviously, Deng hoped that Zhu would be more open-minded in creating a new situation in reform and opening. After Zhu Rongji was promoted to be vice premier, Deng Xiaoping again named him as a member of his entourage on his inspection tour to Shougang [7445 6921] in May that year. Deng praised Zhu Rongji for being an able person with economic knowledge. Zhu did not let him down, and successfully fulfilled a number of tough tasks, including the settlement of the accumulated debt chains, the arrangements for adjusting the industrial and production structure, the transformation of the operation mechanism of the state-owned enterprises, the pilot schemes for adopting the joint-stock system, and the preparations for and reestablishment of the State Economic Commission. Zhu's work was widely praised and appreciated by people in economic and other circles. Since June 1993 he has further successfully organized macrocontrol and rectified the overheated economy. Deng not only praised Zhu but also instructed him to "turn the banks into true banks" rather than "currency-issuing companies or state treasuries." In November 1993, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted the "Decision on Building the Socialist Market Economic Structure." After that, Zhu Rongji became the top architect of the banking and taxation reforms in the course of building the socialist market economic structure, and was regarded as one who had the best understanding of Deng Xiaoping's line. He became number two man in the State Council next to Li Peng, and naturally held the position of first vice premier. However, Zhu Rongji is also facing various difficulties in the deep-going economic structural reform. For example, debt chains are accumulating again; the situation in which state-owned enterprises continue to incur serious losses has not yet been thoroughly changed; and inflation is becoming more serious. All these will be new tests for him. Time will prove whether he can tide over the difficulties and create a new situation.
