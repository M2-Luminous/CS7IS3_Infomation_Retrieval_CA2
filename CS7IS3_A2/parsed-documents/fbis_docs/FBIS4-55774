Pawlak added he hoped "a slightly different outlook on introducing reforms might be helpful in working out final solutions." "We are supporting decentralisation but at the same time we are not going to put responsibility on local governments in a way which is making it impossible for them to fulfil these tasks," the prime minister stressed, adding that for instance it was local governments which decided whether to take over schools. The prime minister also said the cabinet was supporting the plan to grant more powers to local authorities. Commenting on Kulesza's statement that the assumptions of the socio-economic policy for the years 1994-1997 and draft laws on state administration prove that the cabinet is not interested in Poland's decentralisation, the head of the cabinet office, Minister Marian Strak, said: "I think that this opinion is resulting either from incomplete knowledge of the documents or ill will." Strak stressed the documents proved the cabinet wanted to increase powers of local governments and to consolidate the position of a governor. "The point is to make a governor a host in a province and not one of the parts of the state administration," he added.
