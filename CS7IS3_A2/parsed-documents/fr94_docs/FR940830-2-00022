SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION A. Background Under a Settlement Agreement negotiated between the Department and Iowa, the Department recovered $127,600 from Iowa in full resolution of all claims arising from an audit of Iowa's State Department of Education, covering fiscal year (FY) 1987. The Department's original claim of $338,128 was contained in a final letter of determination issues by the Assistant Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education (Assistant Secretary) on September 29, 1989. The claim arose from findings related to Iowa's allocation of vocational education program payroll expenditures under provisions of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 2301, et seq. (1988) (Perkins I). In the September 29, 1989, letter the Assistant Secretary determined that Iowa had violated the Federal requirements that salaries of employees chargeable to more than one program o other cost objectives be supported by appropriate time distribution records. The Federal requirements are derived from Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A&hyph;87, Attachment B. The settlement negotiations which followed Iowa's appeal of the Assistant Secretary's September 29, 1989, determination in this matter culminated in a tentative Settlement Agreement being reached between the parties in which Iowa agreed to repay $127,600 to the Department. The Settlement Agreement was executed on February 5, 1991. On February 20, 1991, the Department received full payment from Iowa in the amount of $127,600. B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback Section 459(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234h(a), provides that whenever the Secretary has recovered funds following a final audit determination, the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional funds available for the program and may arrange to repay to the State or local agency affected by that determination an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the recovered funds. The Secretary may enter into this grantback arrangement if the Secretary determines that: (1) The practices and procedures of the State or local agency that resulted in the audit determination have been corrected, and the State or local agency is, in all other respects, in compliance with the requirements of the applicable program; (2) The State or local agency has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement which meets the requirements of the program and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that was affected by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and (3) The use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the State or local agency's plan would serve to achieve the purposes of the program under which funds were originally granted. C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement Pursuant to section 459(a)(2) of GEPA, Iowa has applied for a grantback of $95,700_75 percent of the $127,600 repaid to the Department_and has submitted a plan for use of the proposed grantback funds, consistent with the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1990 (Perkins II). Iowa plans to utilize the requested grantback funds, totaling $95,700, to purchase computer equipment, software, and printers to be used to design new systems and improve existing systems of administering Perkins II, including: (1) Reviewing local applications; (2) monitoring and evaluating program effectiveness; (3) providing technical assistance to grant recipients; (4) ensuring compliance with all applicable Federal laws, including required services and activities for individuals who are members of special populations; and (5) supporting the activities of technical committees established under 34 C.F.R. ยง403.12(b)(1). Iowa's plan further indicates that this equipment will supplement and enhance Iowa's ability to achieve the goals and objectives of the current State plan (FYs 1995 and 1996). The equipment purchased with the grantback funds will permit administrative activities under Perkins II funds to use a local area network and all personnel involved in administering the Perkins II programs will have direct access to that network and information regarding Perkins II grant awards, recipients, and applications. The results of the use and availability of this equipment are expected to be (1) Improved quality and compliance monitoring, and the evaluation of program effectiveness by facilitating timely access to needed information and standardizing report formats; (2) improved capacity for staff to provide, in a more timely manner, written responses to requests for technical assistance and to track technical issues; (3) shared information among staff responsible for Perkins II administration through use of an electronic mail system; (4) reduction in time spent preparing reports; and (5) facilitation of the collection of data and statistical analysis leading to better evaluation and targeting of technical assistance to programs and populations with the greatest needs. D. The Secretary's Determination The Secretary has carefully reviewed the plan submitted by Iowa. Based upon that review and a review of other information, the Secretary has determined that the conditions under section 459 of GEPA have been met. This determination is based upon the best information available to the Secretary at the present time. If this information is not accurate or complete, the Secretary is not precluded from taking appropriate administrative action. In finding that the conditions of section 459 of GEPA have been met, the Secretary makes no determination concerning any pending audit recommendations or final audit determinations.
