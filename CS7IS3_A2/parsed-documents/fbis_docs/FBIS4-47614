IT IS BASED ON FOREIGN MEDIA CONTENT AND BEHAVIOR AND IS ISSUED WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT COMPONENTS) FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-064--IRAQ IRAQ: 'Udayy's BABIL Glories In Coalition Charges Against Regime IRAQ: 'Udayy's BABIL Glories In Coalition Charges Against Regime Summary--Evidently seeking to further cultivate his public image as a top Iraqi official and potential successor to his father, Saddam Husayn's son 'Udayy has continued to publish in his newspaper BABIL materials that are taboo for other Iraqi media organs. For example, the 2 February 1994 issue contains copies of alleged fliers dropped on al-Basrah Governorate by "coalition aircraft" that depict 'Udayy and other Iraqi officials as "wanted" by "international justice." The pictures of 'Udayy and other senior Iraqi officials are accompanied by summaries of the individuals' alleged crimes. 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's newspaper BABIL has had a long history of publishing articles, editorials, and interviews that are surprisingly candid and frank in in a country with strict limits on freedom of the press. 'Udayy apparently has used this vehicle not only to portray himself as a champion of press freedom, but also to avenge his enemies and to advance his political career. The fact that BABIL has continued to be published suggests that 'Udayy's enterprising approach to commenting on political and economic developments in Iraq enjoys, on balance, Saddam's support. 'Udayy may have published the fliers in question primarily to enhance his own political status. BABIL's headline on the fliers reads: "The Greatest Honor: Serving the Homeland and the Leader." 'Udayy's name and picture appear alongside those of Vice-President Taha Yasin Ramadan, Defense Minister 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, Interior Minister Watban Ibrahim, Revolution Command Council Member Muhammad Hamzah al-Zubaydi, and Ba'th Party Command Member 'Aziz Salih al- Numan. The text accompanying the reproduced fliers claimed that they were air-dropped by the same aircraft that had dropped "hundreds of tons of bombs on our great people" during the Gulf War. But, it added, those attacks "failed to achieve the enemies' goal of infringing on the sovereignty, security, and renaissance of Iraq under its mujahid leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and preserve him." The hardcopy version of this Foreign Media Note contains pictures of six individuals and a summary of the crimes with which their are charged.
