Though other seven elemental semiconductors, e.g., Si, P, Se, have rather simple bonding nature, i.e., sp[.sup]3[/], p[.sup]3[/], p[.sup]2[/], only boron has such complicated bonds. Aluminum is an element which belongs to the same third group as boron and has the same icosahedral cluster (Al[.sub]12[/]) in metallic quasicrystalline alloys. On the other hand, C[.sub]60[/] molecular solid is also an elemental semiconductor which has almost sp[.sup]2[/] bond and C[.sub]60[/] cluster has an icosahedral symmetry. Bonding nature between C[.sub]60[/] is van der Waals type, though that between clusters in boron-rich semiconductors is covalent. It is interesting to investigate the interrelation between boron-rich semiconductors, aluminum-based quasicrystalline metals and C[.sub]60[/] molecular solids. Boron-rich solids are considered to be candidates for a semiconducting quasicrystal. Quasicrystals have been found in many kinds of, but only metallic alloy systems. Boron-rich solids are considered to be icosahedral approximate crystals which have the same local structures as an icosahedral quasicrystal. Analyzing the crystalline structure of _a_- and _b_- rhombohedral boron as approximates, atomic structures of two unit cells of the icosahedral quasicrystal are constructed. Based on cohesive energy calculated by the molecular orbital method, the _a_-rhombohedral boron type quasicrystal can be realized. Among the (_a_-rhombohedral type structures, the distortion of B[.sub]12[/] is the smallest and rhombohedral axis angle is close to the icosahedral angle for the B-C system. A search for semiconducting quasicrystal has been experimentally done in the B-C system. A new type of approximate phase of icosahedral quasicrystal has been found on the way to crystallization of the B[.sub]95[/]C[.sub]5[/] amorphous phase. The crystalline structure of the _b_-rhombohedral boron is considered to have B[.sub]84[/] soccer-ball clusters at vertices of the rhombohedral unit cell. The B[.sub]84[/] cluster is constructed of B[.sub]60[/] outer soccer-ball shell and B[.sub]24[/] inner double icosahedral. This crystalline structure is essentially the same as the face centered cubic structure of C[.sub]60[/]. Though lattice constants are almost the same (about 1 nm), soccer-balls have larger diameters and are closer to each other for the _b_-boron than for C[.sub]60[/]. This corresponds to that bonds between the C[.sub]60[/] clusters are van der Waals type and those between B[.sub]84[/] clusters are covalent. In spite of this different bonding nature, energy band gaps are similar (about 1.5 Ev) for bothmaterials. Though electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility of alkali metal doped C[.sub]60[/] is metallic and shows superconducting transition, those of the _b_-boron remain to be semiconductive up to several percent metal doping and the conductivity has a variable-range hopping type temperature dependence. For the _b_-boron, the Fermi level is pinned at the localized intrinsic acceptor level and a carrier may form a bipolaron.
