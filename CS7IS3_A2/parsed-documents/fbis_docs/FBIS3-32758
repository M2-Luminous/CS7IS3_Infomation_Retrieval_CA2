He has visited Popayan, Cauca Department, to learn firsthand how the country's economic situation is affecting the lives of poor people. He has said his administration would focus on eradicating poverty. In Santander, he has proposed the creation of more mobile counter- guerrilla battalions, because "they are more effective and cost less." He has also proposed "exerting pressure on the Prosecutor General's Office to continue fighting impunity through the creation of judicial mechanisms." De la Calle has also proposed a reduction in military operation costs. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 31 Jan 94 p 8) PL presidential hopeful Carlos Lemos was the center of a polemic yesterday for using inappropriate language when referring to the manner by which his party is being treated. His remarks sparked many reactions, but Lemos did not express regret about using such language; on the contrary, he said he wanted "to call the attention of other PL members," because he believes "Liberalism is in decline." He said: "I publicly said what everybody is commenting in private. The party is in bad shape, and it is going to lose power if it does not change. It is sad to see a PL congressman lose his seat every week." Otherwise, he added if the party does not react, the country could identify with other candidacies such as Andres Pastrana's [Conservative Party presidential hopeful]. Meanwhile, PL President Julio Cesar Turbay has refrained from commenting on Lemos' remarks, saying he "will take no reprisals." Ernesto Samper, another PL presidential hopeful, said Lemos' position is "unfair," and Ernesto Parejo Gonzalez, a PL dissident and presidential hopeful, said Lemos "has no authority to make those remarks, because he is a member of the party he criticizes." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 1 Feb 94 p 6A) Treasury Overseer Jorge Garcia Hurtado ordered a 30-day freeze yesterday on 94.549 billion pesos of the national budget to prevent several congressmen who are seeking reelection from using funds of the so-called "social investment programs." Garcia said by freezing these funds he is "guaranteeing the honesty of the March and May elections, because the use of these funds to carry out works could influence their outcome."
