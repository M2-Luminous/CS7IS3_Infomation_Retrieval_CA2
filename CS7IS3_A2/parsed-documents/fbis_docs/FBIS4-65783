"A minor problem," was the transport minister's comment. The Water Rights Court's call for new calculations of the water through flow in the Oresund will not lead to much delay for the Oresund project. It is simply a case of a "minor problem" that will shortly be dispatched. That was the optimistic comment from the government yesterday after the Swedish Water Rights Court's surprising call for new calculations of the Oresund project's environmental impact. While Olof Johansson, the Swedish environment minister and an opponent of the bridge, was jubilant and was talking about a new round of consultations in Sweden, Danish Transport Minister Jan Trojborg (Social Democratic Party) hurried at record speed from a meeting of Nordic ministers in Nyborg to an emergency meeting of the cabinet. And later in the day he had to brief the group following the progress of the Oresund project on developments that for the time being at least have in reality deprived the Danish political parties that are in favor of the bridge of any influence over the future of the bridge. Once again Danish supporters of the bridge were able to note that it is now "up to the Swedes," and that "we naturally expect them to keep their side of the bargain." Trojborg even went as far as to call the Water Rights Court's ruling "a step in the right direction." However, when asked, he admitted that he had been hoping for a clearer pronouncement from the court. The transport minister is convinced that the two governments will be able to produce the calculations that have been requested as early as next week: "And it is my hope that the Swedish Government will be able to reach a decision in the space of a relatively short period of time. I am expecting only minimal delays. Today the Swedish Government has confirmed the existing agreement between Denmark and Sweden. There is no reason to dramatize the situation." According to Conservative People's Party leader Hans Engell "there ought to be no suggestion of significant delays." "But in fact we will not know anything until we find out about the decisionmaking process that the Swedes are contemplating. And we will not find this out until next week. But now we must apply pressure for them to keep their side of the bargain." Hans Engell called the decision "surprising, because the experts' material was so well documented and comprehensive." He also dissociated himself unambiguously from Olof Johansson's remarks about a new round of consultation in Sweden. "This would be a very unfriendly act toward Denmark," Engell said. Not unexpectedly, the Socialist People's Party, the Radical Liberals, the Progress Party, and the Christian People's Party exploited the court's pronouncement to underline once again the hostile view they take of the bridge. "Halt all construction activity now. We now have the court's word that the project is far from being as well founded or as environmentally neutral as the parties in favor of the bridge have claimed hitherto," the Socialist People's Party's Steen Gade said. The Christian People's Party's Ole M. Nielsen said that a new investigation into the impact of the bridge will be one of the party's new demands in any negotiations to reach agreement on a possible future government base. He is considering a proposal that all the parties opposed to a bridge should enter into a sort of musketeer agreement -- all for one and one for all -- so that regardless of which party is involved in the negotiations to produce a government platform, it will demand a new investigation of the bridge.
