Keeping the entire party and people thoroughly informed of the essential points of this resolution and transforming the resolution into life now constitute an urgent and essential demand. Great national unity is a highly valuable tradition our people have followed during their history of national construction and defense. The Political Bureau resolution says: "Taking up and developing this tradition right from its founding, our party has always paid attention to strengthening and broadening the universal national unity bloc; developing national strength; and combining national strength with international, traditional, and contemporary strengths. It is because of this that the party won many great victories during the struggle for the independence of the fatherland and the freedom and happiness of the people. It is thanks to the promotion of great national unity during the struggle for national independence, construction, and defense that our party -- since assuming its leadership role over a half century ago -- has led our people to one victory after another. Yet this tradition has not been promoted in certain localities and at certain times. This is why the revolution has had to cope with many difficulties. This is the lesson learned from the reality of the revolution. If we are united, we will be able to overcome any difficulties in any revolution, regardless of how hard they may be. If we are divided, we will go bust. This is a great lesson of experience that is illustrated by the following quotation by Great President Ho Chi Minh: "Unity, unity, great unity; success, success, great success." Part One The Party's Renovation Policy and the Great National Unity as Seen in the Past In the situation where the party is the ruling party, its role in the great national unity bloc is a decisive factor. Since the liberation of the south and the unification of the country, our country has been faced with a profoundly changing domestic and world situation. This has created new opportunities and new challenges in the cause of defending the Vietnamese fatherland. Under such circumstances, our party has enjoyed great advantages. As noted in the resolution of the eight party Central Committee's eight plenum: "Founded and trained by President Ho Chi Minh, the Communist Party of Vietnam led our people to fight as a united body. This made it possible for the August Revolution; the war of resistance for national independence, freedom, and unification; and the struggle for national construction and defense to achieve successes and become successful. "These achievements were the result of the following factors: The party had a correct political line. It had support from the people and a contingent of party cadres and members who, during the fight, associated themselves closely with the people. "The close relationship between the party and the people has become a source of strength and a very valuable tradition of the Vietnamese revolution." Entering the new revolutionary stage, the party has promptly detected and corrected the mistakes in its political leadership. Only a few years after the liberation of the south and the unification of the country, the sixth party Central Committee's 10th plenum, held in October 1979, criticized the system of bureaucratic and subsidy-based centralism. It advocated building a multi- component economy, with South Vietnam having five economic components, to enable production to flourish from the grass roots. Based on the guiding thought of the party Central Committee's sixth plenum resolution, the party Central Committee (fourth and fifth terms) has formulated a series of lines and policies aimed at fulfilling various set tasks. These include Directive No. 100 on the end-product contractual system for laborers in agricultural cooperatives (January, 1981); Directive No. 35 on implementing and developing the family economy; Directive No. 29 on allocation of land and forests to cooperatives and households; Directive No. 65 on developing the sea and coastal economy; Government Decree No. 25-CP on granting autonomy to state-run enterprises; and so forth. Afterward, the sixth and seventh national party congresses set forth new, fundamental, and comprehensive lines and policies to build the market-based multisectoral economy under state management and expand and diversify diplomatic activities. This was followed by party Central Committee Political Bureau Resolution No. 10 on renovating the management mechanism for agriculture, and many other resolutions of the sixth and seventh party Central Committees. All of these are aimed at consistently carrying out the renovation process from the higher down to the lower levels, in order to unleash the labor force and further strengthen the people's right to mastery. In implementing the renovation process, at certain times we have faced acute difficulties within the party as well as among the people. We have also experienced clashes between the conservative and renovation concepts. Because our people's creativity and dynamism -- especially that of the peasants -- has been condensed and formulated into national lines and policies by our party, however, we have overcome numerous difficulties and ordeals. We have also been able to combine the "party concept with the people's feeling," thus creating a vigorous driving force for developing the rural areas and agriculture and resolving the most fundamental issues; namely, the peasants' rights to use the land and the laborers' rights to ownership in production and distribution. This has motivated tens of million of peasants to participate in the implementation of party policies for their own benefit, thus revitalizing the potential of land and labor, promoting our people's diligent characteristics, and producing remarkable economic results. For instance, the grain shortage and the import surplus were two acutely difficult issues that we failed to overcome, despite great efforts over many years. Yet since early 1981, the first year we implemented agricultural renovation, we have achieved an unprecedented pace of development in this regard. The gross grain production output during the 1976-80 period was 13.3 million tonnes, an average increase of 200,000 tonnes annually. During the 1981-88 period, however, gross grain output was 17.5 million tonnes, an increase of 810,000 tonnes. During the 1989-92 period, the output was 22.2 million tonnes, an increase of 1.5 million tonnes, while gross grain production output in 1992 and 1993 was 24.5 million tonnes annually. The export value also increased from $700 million during the 1976-80 period to almost $2 billion at present. The rapid increase in grain production output and export value has created favorable conditions for other economic sectors. Animal husbandry, industrial crops, forestry, and maritime products have developed remarkably, thus stabilizing and improving people's daily lives, especially in rural areas. This has contributed to helping the country overcome very dangerous ordeals while consistently implementing the renovation process. Against the background of the complicated international situation that greatly effected global stability, the United States continued its trade embargo against our country. After the war, our country faced numerous difficulties as a result of its consequences. We also experienced difficulties caused by past mistakes in formulating our lines and policies. As a result, our renovation undertaking calls for efforts to overcome difficulties while correcting our mistakes. We have, nevertheless, made the abovementioned achievements. This is testimony to the fact that our party's renovation line is correct and our revolution is advancing in the right direction of maintaining national independence and ensuring freedom and happiness for our people in accordance with the socialist orientation. Our country, however, is still rife with many difficulties and shortcomings. As far as the socialist reformation and construction process is concerned, our party committed mistakes due to haste, dogmatism, and voluntarism. It did not pay due attention to the laws governing the formulation of action programs, failed to take into account the fact that ours is an agriculturally backward country with a predominantly small-scale production, and belittled efforts to make use of the strengths created by the tradition of great solidarity to formulate correct policies and lines. Prompted by the desire to quickly get rid of all other economic sectors, including the individual economic sector, and retain only the socialist and semisocialist economic sector, it eliminated a substantial number of talents and inviduals with wisdom and skills who can be used to serve the national construction and defense goals. In implementing the party-initiated renovation line, our people have scored initial yet very important results. Nonetheless, the national economy still depends entirely on agriculture. The scale of industrial production remains small, and material and technical bases are not enormous in size. The level of economic efficiency is very low. There still remains enormous budget overspending and substantial foreign debt. Many people are unemployed or underemployed. Corruption, smuggling, and extravagance continue to develop seriously and in a complicated manner. Only slow efforts have been made to renovate the state and cooperative economies. Though the private economy has developed, its growth rate is not high enough. The lives of the people, especially ethnic minority people in high altitude regions and remote areas, are still rife with many difficulties. The pace of renovation and consolidation of the political system is slow. Party members and the people still do not display a truly firm ideological stance. The situation concerning political stability and social security and order is not good. Our nation is still listed as one of the poor countries in the world. The gross domestic product per capita is much lower than that of many countries in the region, and the average annual growth rate is even slower. The danger of lagging further behind compared to many countries in the region has exerted an adverse impact on employment, living conditions, the people's confidence in and support for our regime, and national security and defense capabilities... Meanwhile, many hostile forces are trying by all means to undermine our people's revolutionary undertaking. Over the recent past, our party has made due efforts to resolve social problems. Nonetheless, there are still many shortcomings and difficulties which, in turn, have exerted a not-too-slight impact on the people's idelogical and political singlemindedness. Now that the national economy has effected changes for the better and the new mechanism has created favorable conditions for resolving social problems, let's ensure social justice through the distribution of production means and let's combine this move with efforts to adjust the income distribution system. It is necessary to create conditions for everyone (by means of land allotment, selling of shares, contracting, bank loans...) so they can earn their living, enrich themselves, and bring about prosperity in society. Nonetheless, economic development and the application of a new mechanism alone cannot provide solutions to all problems. We should try to resolve social problems according to the party's policy on human resources development under which the human factor is regarded not only as the target of but also the motive behind the national defense and construction cause. At the same time, we face a series of major social problems that have reached an alarming level both in the short and long terms. They include the deterioration of educational, public health, and cultural services and the growing development of illiteracy, school dropouts, diseases, moral degradation, corruption, and smuggling, thereby causing our efforts to cope with challenges to become more difficult and complicated. Given the new development stage of the revolution, the party's leadership skills, the political background and singlemindedness of all party members, and the moral ethics of cadres and party members constitute the preliminary conditions for rallying the entire people around the party. Thoughout history, our party recorded a very glorious achievement by providing leadership for national liberation and fatherland protection. In recent years, the party has quickly initiated the renovation line and led the reform undertaking, gaining important initial victories. However, in the new situation, it has shown weaknesses in keeping par with the revolution's current requirements. Moreover, the government's management role from the central to local and grassroots levels governments has been far too low for the demand, despite its successes in building a law-governed state of the people, by the people, and for the people; in enforcing the law; in improving foreign affairs work; and in controlling inflation and prices. Mass organizations have been relatively quick in developing their economic, scientific, social, and professional associations to meet the new situation and duties. Traditional organizations have exerted many efforts to broaden democracy and reform their structure and working methoda. They, however, are still more or less in a vicious circle of stagnation, inflexibility, and disparity, especially at the grassroots level where the systems of mass organizations have not really been integrated and taken root in the grassroots and the public.... Since the party became a ruling party in the entire nation, particularly since the country entered its renovation, the socioeconomy has been moving and progressing very quickly; international relations have been changing; the party's contact with current affairs and social realities has not been renovated quickly and accordingly; and the political and moral degradation in some cadres and party members has brought about serious effects to the party's fighting spirit and reputation. The party has not thoroughly understood the people. The people have not really become attached to the party. Lower level cadres do not dare tell the truth to higher cadres. The atmosphere of democracy and fair discussion to discover the truth has been limited. The principle of democratic centralism, which is the party's vitality, has not been maintained. The practice of bureaucracy and authoritarianism has existed together with the devils of indiscipline, sectionalism, and clannishness. In many places, the party's internal fighting has been very weak and the clarification of correctness and incorrectness has been prolonged to an extent that clarification becomes impossible. If the party, state, and mass organizations do not improve their knowledge and if their management is not corrected to make them cleaner and stronger, there will be difficulties in gathering the intellectual essence from the party, the national, and the current world, leading to the weakening of their attraction to the public. This situation arises for different reasons. But the most fundamental reason that needs to be clarified and corrected is that the party has not been absolutely correct in defining its relations with the national political system and with society in the new revolutionary condition, situation, and duties. From a party of the workers' class leading the revolution to seize power and protect the government, our party has become a ruling party in the entire nation. It is leading the undertaking of national construction and protection in a multisectoral economy with a market mechanism with state management; with the government of the people, by the people, and for the people; and with the broadening and diversifying of multilateral international relations. This special characteristic requires the party to combine the strength of the workers' class with national strength, national strength with international strength, and traditional strength with temporary strength. The liberation of the workers' class must be preceded by national liberation. The settlement of sectional interests must be in harmony with national interests. The party's goal and duty must be the goal of all society as well. Therefore, the party must be renovated. The party must lead the revolution. It must be a party of the workers' class and represent the interest of the workers' class and the national interest. It must be the vanguard team of the workers' class and the nation as well (with no sexual discrimination and not standing above the nation). It must place national interest above everything else to unite people of all strata and religions for the implementation of President Ho Chi Minh's spirit of the great national unity and to create a strong force for "the construction of a Vietnam of peace, unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity" (from President Ho Chi Minh's Testament).
