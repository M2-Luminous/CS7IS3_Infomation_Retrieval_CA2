Ajello told MEDIAFAX yesterday that "right now, it is just a matter of prestige for the two sides (the government and the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo)." "This issue has become a matter of principle and that should have been avoided." We approached Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana for an opinion, after apprising him of Ajello's views. Hunguana replied that Ajello's reading of the problem revealed "naivete, to say the least." Hunguana asked: "Why is it that Renamo defies decisions made by the competent organs? What is the real reason?" To the labor minister, the most recent pronouncements by Dhlakama and Ngonhamo are at variance with the logic of the peace process, leading to speculation that Renamo has a hidden agenda that includes the use of force. Does the goverment take a military view of Renamo's insistence on maintaining its military position in Salamanga? "Such an interpretation cannot be excluded", Hunguana replied. [passage omitted] This is Renamo's Jose de Castro's version of the events: Renamo agreed to leave the relevant farming area in Salamanga and move 700 meters away from it "to avoid controversy", but the government wants Renamo to shift its men to at least 10 km from it. Castro told MEDIAFAX that Renamo asked for that area for logistical reasons, adding that it offers good conditions for an assembly area. He confirmed that, at a meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, Renamo had conveyed its belief that the government wanted Renamo out of the farming area because it had been given to Transport and Communications Minister Armando Guebuza. Ajello announced publicly on 8 February that he would launch "an initiative" to settle the problem. We asked him: What initiative? To which he simply replied that it would be an initiative "outside the usual channels" to "get us out of this trap." Ajello believes that there will be no logistical problems for the UN Operations in Mozambique, should it need to move the Renamo forces to one of two assembly areas--one 10 km and the other 30 km from the disputed area. Other than that, Ajello believes the process is going satisfactorily. To the extent that elections may be held in October? "We must have elections in October", he categorically replied, adding: "We have no other choice." Not even a smaller UN budget for, let us say, another six months, until April 1995? "No, elections must be held in October." [passage omitted]
