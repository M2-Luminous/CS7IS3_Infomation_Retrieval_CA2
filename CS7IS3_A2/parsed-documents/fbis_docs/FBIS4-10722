The report, which was prepared at the request of the Eastern Military Command, mentions a 1981 meeting between numbers game chiefs -- represented by Aniz Abrahao Davi, known as Anisio, from Beija-Flor; Ailton Guimaraes Jorge, known as Capitao Guimaraes; and Toninho Turco, one of Rio de Janeiro's major drug traffickers who was killed during a major police operation in February 1988. At the 1981 meeting -- according to the Army report -- it was decided that the numbers game people would finance drug trafficking in Rio de Janeiro, and that Turco, Anisio, and Guimaraes would be responsible for all drug movements into and out of the city. In addition, they also would be responsible for the trafficking of smuggled arms. A former Army captain who engaged in political repression as a member of the DOI-CODI [Department of Domestic Operations-Internal Defense Operations Center], Ailton Guimaraes Jorge had been under investigation by the Armed Forces since 1974, when his name appeared in a military inquest in which he was charged with smuggling and extortion. At the end of the 1970's, he left the Army and joined the numbers game. Says the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] deputy for Rio de Janeiro, Miro Teixeira: "Capitao Guimaraes gave the numbers game chiefs all the know-how in weapons and smuggling that he learned from DOI-CODI. His joining the numbers game was simultaneous with the appearance of the link with drug trafficking." Before that, in 1976, when the progress of the federal lotteries posed a financial threat to the numbers game, the alliance with drug trafficking was already in design. Top Rio de Janeiro numbers game chiefs met and decided that they had to "professionalize" the business. In that year, numbers game chiefs met for the first time with U.S. citizen Joe Conforte, one of the entrepreneurs who controlled gambling in Las Vegas and whose name was linked with drug trafficking. During Carnival 1982, one year after a meeting between Toninho Turco, Anisio, and Guimaraes, Conforte returned to Rio de Janeiro and was welcomed in the theater box of numbers game chief Castor de Andrade. He had Moet et Chandon champagne, Iranian caviar, lobster, and tropical fruit as dessert. This was the final signal that the numbers game would no longer be the "innocent" activity of the 1960's and 1970's. As of that time, Guimaraes and Castor vied for control of operations. Guimaraes was the first game chief to control his business with computers and to expand his activities to other states. He also was designated president of the League of Samba Schools -- an activity that cleans up the image of game chiefs in the eyes of the people. Despite the fact that he was arrested one year ago at Polinter on charges of illegal association and creation of armed gangs, he is considered the natural successor to Castor de Andrade. At a recent meeting in his gasoline station in Bangu, which was also used as an accounting office for the numbers game, Castor de Andrade reportedly said to some of his employees that he suspected Guimaraes. A maneuver to replace him in the game might have been under way. After the collapse of Castor de Andrade's operation, many people in Bangu began to openly disclose the names of the police and attorney general informers.
