FR941102-1-00052 FR941102-1-00015 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 68 [CC Docket No. 94&hyph;102, RM&hyph;8143; FCC 94&hyph;237] Enhanced 911 Emergency Calling AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to amend rules to ensure the compatibility of enhanced 911 services with private branch exchanges (PBXs), other private dispersed telephone systems, and wireless services. This action responds to a petition for rulemaking (RM&hyph;8143) to amend the rules to require compatibility of PBXs with enhanced 911 emergency calling systems, a petition for reconsideration filed in the Commission's proceeding on personal communications services, and issues raised in an Emergency Access Position Paper filed recently with the Commission. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 9, 1995, reply comments must be received on or before February 8, 1995. ADDRESSES: Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commissions, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554, with copy to Suzanne Hutchings, Mail Stop Code 1600B2, FCC, Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Suzanne Hutchings, Attorney, Domestic Services Branch, Domestic Facilities Division, Common Carrier Bureau, (202) 634&hyph;1802; or John Reed, Engineer, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;7313. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This summarizes the NPRM in CC Docket No. 94&hyph;102 and RM&hyph;8143 (FCC 94&hyph;237) adopted September 19, 1994 and released October 19, 1994, which bears the title ``Revision of the Commission's rules to ensure compatibility with enhanced 911 emergency calling systems.'' The NPRM and supporting file are available for inspection and copying during the weekday hours of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the FCC Reference Center, room 239, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC. Copies may be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, ITS, Inc., 2100 M St., NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, phone (202) 857&hyph;3800. The NPRM will be published in the FCC Record. Summary of NPRM 1. Background A petition for rulemaking was filed by Adcomm Engineering Co. (Adcomm), to amend part 68 of the rules to require interoperability between PBXs and enhanced 911 emergency calling systems. See FCC Report No. 1922 (RM&hyph;8143) released December 29, 1992. The Texas Advisory Commission on State Emergency Communications (TX&hyph;ACSEC) under the Office of the Attorney General for the state of Texas filed a petition for reconsideration in the Commission's proceeding on personal communications services (PCS) (GEN Dkt. 90&hyph;314) requesting Commission action to ensure the compatibility of PCS with enhanced 911 emergency calling systems. This NPRM also addresses an Emergency Access Position Paper, filed by the Associated Public Safety Communications Officials-International, Inc. (APCO), the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), the National Association of State Nine One One Administrators (NASNA), and the Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA), which presents the consensus recommendations of these organizations to assist in developing appropriate standards for emergency access from wireless service systems to 9&hyph;1&hyph;1 systems. We seek comment on proposals for insuring the compatibility of PBXs and other dispersed private telephone systems with enhanced 911 emergency services. Second, we propose to adopt rules that would require wireless services to include features that will make enhanced 911 services available to mobile radio callers. 2. Dispersed Private Telephone Systems and Enhanced 911 Systems The NPRM proposes to require that PBX and similar equipment: (a) have the capability of automatically providing a caller's number and location to the public safety answering points (PSAPs) where the calls are received; (b) permit callers to obtain access to a PSAP by dialing 911, i.e., without dialing ``9'' or another access code to obtain an outside dialtone; and (c) have the capability to alert, and provide calling information to, an attendant at the location served by a dispersed private telephone system so that an attendant may assist in responding to an emergency. These requirements would apply to PBX equipment manufactured or imported one year after rules ultimately adopted in this proceeding or installed eighteen months after that date. Under the proposed rules, PBX equipment manufactured or imported during the first year must be labeled with emergency dialing instructions both on the device and on the outside of the packaging in which it is marketed. 3. Wireless Services and Enhanced 911 Systems We propose to require commercial mobile radio services (CMRS) that provide, or are capable of providing, real time voice services to include features that will make enhanced 911 services available to mobile radio callers. These features include Station Number Identification (SNI), Automatic Location Information (ALI), and Selecting Routing (SR).
