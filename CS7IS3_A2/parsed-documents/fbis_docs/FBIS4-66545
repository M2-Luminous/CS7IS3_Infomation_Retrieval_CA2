FBIS4-66545 "jpnea020___94053" JPRS-NEA-94-020 JPRS Near East & South Asia 5 February 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Contempt Notices Issued to Advani, Others Contempt Notices Issued to Advani, Others 94AS0229T Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 5 Feb 94 p 1 94AS0229T Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] New Delhi, February 4--The supreme court today issued contempt notices to the eight top-ranking leaders of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and its like-minded Hindu organisations for their alleged involvement in the demolition of the Babri mosque over a year ago despite the court's order to protect the disputed structure at Ayodhya. Taking cognisance of the petition filed by Mr Mohammad Aslam alias Bhure seeking contempt of court action against the BJP leaders, including Mr L.K. Advani and others, the chief justice, Mr Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, and Mr Justice S. Mohan, granted three weeks to the alleged contemnors to show cause why [they] should not be hauled up for violating its orders passed on November 15, 1991. In a brief order, the court directed that notices be issued to the BJP president, Mr Advani, the former president, Dr Murli Manohar Joshi, the BJP MP [member of Parliament], Ms Uma Bharati, the Bajrang Dal chief and MP, Mr Vinay Katiyar, the Shiv Sena MP, Mr Moreshwar Save, the VHP [Vishwa Hindu Parishad] general secretary, Mr Ashok Singhal, the joint general secretary, Acharya Giriraj Kishore, and the organisation's fire-brand, Sadhvi Rithambra. Already, the then chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Mr Kalyan Singh, his close aides, including the then district magistrate and police chief of Ayodhya, had been summoned before the apex court and were facing contempt of court proceedings. These proceedings related to the violation of the court's order against construction of the concrete platform at the state of the disputed structure and also for their inaction in protecting the mosque later in December. As an aftermath of the demolition, riots engulfed the country, leaving behind several killed and property worth crores destroyed. Mr Aslam's counsel, Mr M.M. Kashyap, had submitted that on a call given by the VHP, the Bajrang Dal, the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] and the BJP in November, kar sewaks had started converging at the disputed structure site for the sole purpose to construct the Ram temple there. He had expressed the apprehension and sought the court's protection for the over four-century-old mosque. However, on December 6, two years ago, these kar sewaks from 20 states, who had been trained earlier in the demolition task at a camp in the outskirts of Ahmadabad, "jumped on the Babri mosque" and demolished it amid provocative speeches made by the pro-temple leaders. The then president of the BJP, Dr Joshi, or Mr Advani did not stop the kar sewaks, the petitioner said. During their "rath yatra," Dr Joshi and Mr Advani had mobilised the kar sewaks to execute the "task plan of demolishing the mosque," Mr Advani had also made inflammatory speeches during the "rath yatra."
