S. Kropotkin, department chief in Russian Federation GKRCh [expansion unknown]; first paragraph is ELEKTROSVYAZ introduction] [Text]Availability of mobile communications to the people of the CIS does not exceed 10 percent of the mean level in Europe and virtually all existing networks are used by state administration agencies. This article describes the classification of types of mobile communications, features of general use systems with honeycomb structure and future satellite systems. The limitation on assigned frequency bands compelled VAKR-92 [World Conference of Radio Administrations] to allocate new frequency bands for development of mobile communications. In the last decades, there has been rapid development of mobile ground-based and satellite communication systems in all parts of the world. They make it possible for any mobile subscribers to communicate with one another, use the general communication network, transmit and receive telephone communications and digital data. Operation of such systems yields profit in the billions. Tens of firms all over the world are engaged in production and assembly of equipment for them. In view of the increasing role of mobile communication systems, many national communication administrations are expanding the frequency bands reserved for their operation. Recently, additional frequency bands were also assigned in Russia, in the range of 450 and 900 MHz, which should help overcome the considerable lag in development of such networks in our country, as compared to development of mobile communications in Europe and America. Considerably fewer radio stations are in operation in Russia and other CIS states than in western countries (one radio station per 100 people, which constitutes only 5-10 percent of the European level); all networks of mobile communications are used by state administration agencies and the ordinary citizen is deprived of the opportunity to become a subscriber to the mobile communications network. For this reason, there is a need for intensive development of networks of mobile communications accessible to all in Russia and other CIS states. The importance of this matter lies in the considerable economic impact of its use, as well as acceleration of furnishing telephone communications to many regions of Russia, where availability of telephones is quite low. Ground-based systems of mobile radio communications are divided into the following types: - general use radiotelephone systems - RSOP; - technological dispatcher networks - TDS; - personal pagers [beepers] - SPV; - emergency communication systems - SAS. The RSOP is intended for communication between any mobile subscribers, as well as their access to the municipal and sometimes intercity network. As a rule the RSOP has one base station (BS) that services 2000-5000 subscribers over an area with a radius of 30-50 km. Communication between them, as well as access to the general use network, is effected through the BS. In recent years, all over the world there has been intense development of RSOP with a honeycomb structure, that makes quite efficient use of the frequency band assigned to them. In such networks, there are several tens of BS in a city or region, each of which operates over a radius of 1-2 km. Altogether, these BS service 100,000-200,000 subscribers. Honeycomb networks require more complicated equipment and software, used to control the flow of information between BS. TDS are intended for control of industrial operations and technological processes in construction, agriculture, railroad services, river fleet, municipal services of cities, systems for control of gas line operation, power lines, etc. SPV began to be used relatively recently, and they serve to transmit signals from one or several BS to mobile subscribers situated in a specific territory. They enable any subscriber to the general telephone network to access SPV subscribers. Their distinction is that there is no two-way communication channel. To respond, the mobile subscriber must use a telephone, telegraph or any other available channel. SPV are often organized by means of multiplexing the FM UHF channels of broadcast transmitters with radio access signals in the pauses between transmissions. The range of SPV is 30-40 km, and it serves 10,000-20,000 subscribers. There are systems for not only individual, but also group paging. SAS are used by state administration agencies, and have been developed the most in the maritime and aviation services, where they are used to transmit distress signals, including automatic ones. In CIS states, 10 frequency bands have been assigned to mobile communication systems: I (1.6-30 MHz); II (33-48.5 MHz); III (57-57.25 MHz); IV (74-74.6 MHz); V (75.4-76 MHz); VI (146-174 MHz); VII (300-308 MHz); VIII (336-344 MHz); IX (451-466 MHz) and X (890-960 MHz). These bands are used not only by mobile communication systems, but also other radio systems. For this reason, assignment of frequencies for a new network presents a serious problem, and it is resolved by communications agencies in each specific instance. These 10 bands are divided mainly according to type of mobile communications: I-VIII are used in TDS networks; I-VI in SPV. As a rule, band I is used to organize long-distance communications in inaccessible regions; band II is one of the most used, since hundreds of thousands of radio stations of various departmental networks (emergency medical aid, militia, etc.); band III is intended for organization of intraplant [intrafarm] and intraregional communications in rural regions; bands IV and V are used essentially to organize communications at construction sites; the networks for railroad technological communications, as well as services of the petroleum and gas industries and electric power complex, operate in bands VI and VII. RSOP uses bands VII and IX, and the latter band was assigned recently to deploy, for example, the honeycomb systems in Moscow and St. Petersburg, which were assembled using NMT-450 equipment purchased abroad. The question of using band X in Russia must be resolved in the near future. It is planned to develop RSOP using the latest equipment of the general European GSM standard, which operates in the frequency ranges of 450 and 900 MHz. On the one hand, this will provide subscribers with a wide range of services and, on the other hand, it will permit quite efficient use of the frequency band assigned to mobile communications, so that networks with a large number of subscribers can be organized. In CIS states alone, we expect a 10-15-fold increase in number of mobile radio stations. The GSM system, use of which has already begun in FRG, France, Italy, Great Britain and other countries, was developed by a team of experts in mobile communications of the European organization SEPT.[.sup]1[/] It is expected that the network of this system will cover 10 million subscribers by 1995 and 15 million by the year 2000. In addition to new services related to digital transmission of signals, GSM provide for privacy of communications. Considering the prospects for development of industry and agriculture in Russia and the fact that it is moving closer to the European market, it should be conceded that it is desirable to have speedy development of this system in Russia. For this reason, we can only welcome the production of equipment for the 900 MHz range planned by several Russian enterprises. The PCN[.sup]2[/] [Personal Communications Network] system will be another promising international system of mobile communications, and several Russian enterprises are undertaking production of equipment for it. Satellite systems of mobile communications (SSS) are an effective means of organizing communications in the maritime, air and ground services. Commercial operation of SSS was started in 1982 by the international organization INMARSAT, which comprises more than 50 countries including Russia. Stations for this system, designed to provide for maritime and aircraft communications, can be installed on trucks that make long-distance runs, railroad cars, aircraft and vessels. At the present time, the system services up to 700 ships cruising in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. Communications are established via a geostationary IS3 [artificial satellite] and stationary ground-based station. The system uses ranges of 6 and 4 GHz (coastal ground-based stations), 1.6 and 1.5 GHz (ship- and aircraft-based stations). The annual income to the INMARSAT organization is about 160 US dollars. INMARSAT provides the following types of services: telephone, telegraph and fax communications, transmission of data, reception of signals from satellite radio navigation systems. Since 1992, personal radio paging is also provided, which permits INMARSAT users to receive brief texts displayed on a monitor by means of a personal device weighing 400 g. National SSS systems are being developed in many countries of the world. In the United States, for example, it is planned to start up a system in 1995 that will service up to 270,000 users with the possibility of accessing the general telephone network. This system will provide for transmission of data and organization of dispatcher communications, in addition to ordinary telephone communications. In Russia, the Marafon -- a specialized national satellite system for land, sea and air mobile communications -- is being developed with consideration of the INMARSAT experience. Marafon will satisfy the acute need of our country for mobile communications in all types of transportation, and it will resolve the problem of providing reliable communications to the most remote and inaccessible regions. It is planned to start up the first line of this system in 1993 for 2000 subscribers, and their number will reach 50,000 by the year 2000. The cost of the system should be returned after 9-11 years of operation. Satellite systems of scanning radio paging with subscriber receivers the size of a credit card have gained wide use in the last few years. The low-cost receivers can operate out of doors, in buildings and vehicles. Since 1986, such a system has been undergoing test operation in Great Britain, and it permits paging truck drivers on the roads of West Europe, the Mideast and Africa. In the United States, a satellite system of scanning radio paging has been put in operation, and it services more than 50 major cities in that country. Many regional ground-based radio paging services in the United States are integrated by means of space communication channels. One of the main factors retarding RSOP development is the limited radio frequency spectrum. Considerable difficulties are involved in assignment of additional parts of the spectrum for RSOP, and for this reason almost half the items (9 out of 21) on the agenda of the World Conference of Radio Administrations on Assignment of Frequency Bands (VAKR-92) had a direct bearing on this problem. In the relevant Table of Band Assignment of the International Radio Communications Regulations, there are are virtually no frequency bands assigned on an exclusive basis to the mobile service (with the exception of maritime and air mobile services directly related to providing for safety of human life). In addition to spectrum overloading, this circumstance limits the possibility of meeting the needs for organization of mobile radio communications. For this reason, it was conceded at the VAKR-92 that it is imperative to broaden the spectrum for mobile services, and discussions arose only on different details of the problem, in particular, matters of compatibility of mobile services with, for example, the stationary service already using these parts of the spectrum. The conference approved the decision to raise the status of the mobile service to a primary rank in the 1700-2450 MHz band. The Russian delegation proposed limitation to a 1710-2110 Mhz band since the 1700-1710 MHz band is used extensively to receive meteorological information from satellites, the 2110-2450 MHz band is needed for the stationary service (radio relay lines), while the 2200-2290 MHz segment is needed for space-earth and space-space communication lines in space research services. In the opinion of Russian specialists, questions of electromagnetic compatibility of the mobile service with these important stationary services have not been sufficiently explored. Since the same apprehensions were voiced by other delegations, VAKR-92 asked MKKR [International Radio Consultative Committee] to investigate the problem of compatibility of these services and develop the technical criteria for joint use of frequencies. The VAKR-92 assigned the frequency bands of 1670-1675 MHz (ground-aircraft) and 1800-1805 MHz (aircraft-ground) to administrations thatwish to use such systems for communications with aircraft. In Canada, the United States and Mexico, 849-851 and 894-896 MHz bands, respectively, are already being used for such purposes. Thus, a dual set of onboard equipment will be needed on aircraft that will fly between zones with different frequency assignments. At the VAKR-92, assignment of spectrum segments for satellite mobile services was the subject of the main discussions. This is attributable to the fact that the typical distinction of the present stage of using space communications equipment is the desire to make broad use of nongeostationary, including low-orbit, satellites. The reason for this is that the feasibility of using a geostationary orbit is close to being saturated in several ranges, and geostationary satellites in circumpolar regions are not very efficient because of the small angles at which radiowaves reach ground stations. Systems with low-orbit satellites also have higher power characteristics of communication lines, which is particularly important when using cheap portable ground-based terminals with nondirectional antennas. Lengthy discussions revolved around several specific parts of the spectrum, which it was proposed to assign to the satellite mobile service, which uses nongeostationary earth satellites: 137-138 MHz, 148-149.9 MHz, 149.9-150.05 MHz, 400.15-401 MHz, and 1610-1626.5 MHz. The 137-138 MHz band was divided into 4 segments, and the satellite mobile service (space-earth) was assigned the 137-137.025 MHz and 137.175-137.825 MHz segments on a primary basis, 137.025-137.175 MHz and 137.825-138 MHz on a secondary basis. Such separation of the band was made because of the fear of several countries, including the Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine, as well as SEPT nations, that this new service could create problems in using existing ground-based mobile services. The 148-149.9 and 400.15-401 MHz frequency bands were assigned to the satellite mobile service on a primary basis. Limits were set for power flow density near the earth's surface in the 137-138, 148-149.9 and 400.15-401 MHz bands to protect existing ground-based services. These bands are permitted for use only by nongeostationary satellite systems, provided steps are taken to protect radioastronomic observations in the 150.05-153 and 406.1-410 MHz frequency bands. At the suggestion of the Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine, a satellite mobile service was included on a secondary basis in the 312-315 MHz (earth-space) and 387-390 MHz (space-earth) bands. This permits development of Gonets [racer], a Russian system of satellite mobile communications, was included in the Table of Frequency Assignment of the Radio Communications Regulations on a secondary basis, and it will now be rid of the complicated coordination procedure that is mandatory for all analogous services in the 235-322 and 335.4-339.9 MHz frequency bands. At the VAKR-92, it was decided to distribute 50 MHz at a time in each direction to the satellite mobile service, scheduled to be done by 1 January 2005, to meet its growing needs. In the meantime, there are several problems to be solved concerning control of reciprocal interference between the satellite mobile service and existing ground-based services. There was particularly sharp discussion of suggestions on assignment of the 1610-1626.5 MHz band to the satellite mobile surface. A suggestion was advanced by the United States that proposed the use of this band for development of a global system of mobile communications. One of the plans of the Motorola firm proposes to develop a system of 77 low-obit satellites at an altitude of 770 km in circumpolar orbits. Each satellite with 37 pencil beams would generate 37 coverage areas [``honeycombs''] each about 670 km in diameter near earth's surface. On a global scale, total carrying capacity of the system will be 377,000 duplex telephone channels (240 channels per honeycomb). In its report to the VAKR-92, the MKKR concluded that the frequency bands for air and maritime radio communications and radio navigation that are related to assuring safety of human life should not be viewed as candidates for satellite mobile services. The conference, however, disregarded this conclusion and, under pressure of the U.S. delegates, adopted the proposed decision. In order to protect the GLONASS system, the Russian delegation was compelled to record a special statement in the concluding minutes of the VAKR-92. On the whole, the decisions of the VAKR-92 pertaining to mobile services are indicative of the increasing interest in new types of communications, mainly for general use. Footnotes 1.
