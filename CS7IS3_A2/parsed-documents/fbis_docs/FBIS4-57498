Some clerical employees make a living from it. The former were held in check in Havana by official provisions announced following the extraordinary session of the Cuban National Assembly on 1 and 2 May. The provisions decreed that property would be confiscated from individuals linked to the black market, illicit enrichment, and other illegal activities that are repudiated by the people. The implementation of this decree-law is consistent with requests that speculators and individuals who divert state resources be punished. The requests were made by some 3 million workers at approximately 80,000 parliaments in the workplace held over the past few months throughout the country. The decree-law is also one of several guidelines approved by the deputies to reorganize Cuba's domestic finances in view of the excess of currency in circulation, surpassing 11.2 billion pesos (equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate), and the approximately 4.2 billion peso budget deficit. The clerks are "theorizing" while these measures are being implemented in a country that must readjust 85 percent of its foreign trade because of the fall of its former commercial partners, particularly the USSR, and in the midst of the intensification of the U.S. blockade. While some people characterize the Assembly's decisions as a "drastic adjustment plan," others view it as "slow, moderate reform." According to Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and price minister, Cuban experts have confirmed that the announced measures should be implemented gradually over several months. Some even say that the black market is "the most efficient economy in Cuba," thus attempting to legalize the theft of state resources with the trite phrase used by local diplomatic sources. President Fidel Castro told the deputies that existing laws must be enforced so those who conduct illegal trade or activities will not go unpunished. Others who speculate about Cuba's reality and ruminate about the "hidden plan," go a step further and write about an imaginary power struggle that has allegedly broken out among the country's top leaders. This struggle pits politicians and economists against each other and indiscriminately links distinguished figures from either side. National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon told PRENSA LATINA that the consensus reached through the deputies' decisions resulted from that body's preparedness for the debate on the controversial subject and also from the process he described as the parliamentarization of Cuban society, which began several months ago. Cuban politicians and economists say the informational biases that certain people unwittingly represent make them see darkness where there is only light.
