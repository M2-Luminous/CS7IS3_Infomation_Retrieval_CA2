Clinton conceded that Communist China had made some progress in the human rights situation on the mainland, but was still far behind Washington's demand for overall significant progress; however, to develop "a larger and more productive framework of relationship" with Communist China, he decided to no longer "link" the human rights issue with trade with the mainland. Hence, the long-clamored question of whether the United States should continue MFN status to Mainland China is now settled. Though Clinton also announced, in passing, the decision to ban imports of Mainland Chinese-made ammunitions, this cannot serve a punitive or warning purpose for Communist China in view of current U.S. public opinion's strong opposition to the rampant privately-owned weapons in the country. Furthermore, ammunitions accounted for only a tiny fraction of the mainland's trade with the United States, which also bans imports of ammunitions from European countries. Therefore, as a U.S. congressman put it, Clinton's decision is tantamount to an unconditional renewal of the MFN trading status for the mainland as well as an open retreat from the human rights condition he insisted on during his election campaign and in an executive order last year. For this reason, though there had been signs of the Clinton administration's pending renewal of MFN, people were mildly surprised by the content of the announcement. No wonder there have been wide-ranging reactions from the Capitol Hill and mass media. In fact, even though he was clearly aware of an inevitable wave of uproar from the Congress, President Clinton still made the decision, which cannot be easily justified. This indicates that Washington, after a thorough assessment, ascertained that a practical policy toward Mainland China would be more in line with the U.S. national interests. Why? On the one hand, U.S. entrepreneurs, having placed high expections on the mainland's market potential, were strongly opposed to any government measure that would undermine trade with Communist China. On the other hand, the strategy to link trade with human rights was obviously a self-contradictory one. In countries entirely dependent on U.S. economic aid, this strategy may yield some results. However, in those which have developed mutually beneficial and interdependent trade and economic relations with the United States, the strategy of "carrot and stick" could easily be associated with and referred to as an expression of U.S. hegemonism; and hence, can be devoid of moral persuasive and practical deterrent powers. It goes without saying that human rights symbolize "universal" principles of values while bilateral trade and economic relations concern each other's "specific" interests. These two are not issues belonging to the same category. By forcibly mixing them together, the consequences would be either a serious collision between the two sides, or retreat from the strategy and admission of its failure at an opportune time after the other side responded in an appropriate manner. The results are now barred. The Clinton administration opted for the latter. From the perspective of idealism and humantarianism, the decision on MFN renewal is indeed clear proof of the failure on the part of the United States to live up to its moral standards; however, based on the concepts of peaceful coexistence, mutually beneficial trade and economic relations, and the geo-economy -- ideas that have guided the international situation in the post-Cold War era -- Washington's decision is not at all difficult to understand. At any rate, however, the announcement on MFN renewal is tantamount to declaring that the Clinton administration has changed its "Cold Peace" tactics of relaxing one minute and tightening up the next and of interweaving with contradictions -- tactics which the United States had at one point adopted in viewing Communist China as its chief imaginary enemy since the disintegration of the Soviet Union -- and has entered a pragmatic era of facing Mainland China squarely as one of its important trading partners. Washington's change of attitude was prompted primarily by the impressive progress in Mainland China's economic development in the past nearly three years. Although the mainland will not necessarily become the world's largest "unified market" at the beginning of the next century as some authoritative economic research institutes have predicted, its economic growth rate and development potential cannot be ignored. U.S. State Department officials repeatedly pointed out: While Germany, France, Japan, and other economic powers are trying hard to gain market shares in the mainland, and in the wake of numerous investment and cooperation agreements signed after visits to Peking [Beijing] by these countries' top-level economic delegations led by their premiers, it was absolutely impossible for the United States, for the sake of its economic and trade interests, to "exclude itself from the mainland's markets." In this way, the State Department officials simply pointed out the real reason behind Washington's MFN renewal to the mainland. Moreover, as far as strategy is concerned, the United States needed to prevent a renewed alliance between Russia and Communist China as well as to coordinate with Communist China to exert pressure on North Korea to defuse the nuclear crisis in Northeast Asia. For this reason, how could the United States continue to maintain its tough posture? It is noteworthy that originally the United States wanted to maintain its "Cold Peace" tactics and to wait and see what would happen in the "post-Teng Hsiao-ping [Deng Xiaoping]" mainland. If, by that time, the mainland remained stable and its economy developed smoothly, the United States, to take part in and lead the Asian-Pacific economic rim to seek hefty commercial interests, would definitely try harder to accommodate Communist China. If the mainland were to become turbulent and communist Chinese leaders lose the ability to control the political situation, Washington would go all out to deal with Mainland China as it had with Russia, by launching "dismemberment" tactics to eliminate a potential rival of the United States. Nevertheless, the Clinton administration, after viewing comprehensive assessments prepared by the State Department, the Pentagon, and the Central Intelligence Agency, tended to believe that the "post-Teng" mainland would not necessarily see turmoil; moreover, a stable mainland at that time could be more useful to the United States. Therefore, the decision on MFN renewal also vaguely contains the results of Washington's study and assessment of the future situation on the mainland as well as its policy based on the study and assessment. In light of this, it is not difficult to understand that immediately after Clinton announced the MFN decision, Undersecretary of State Lord declared that the United States had no intention whatsoever of "playing the Taiwan card" to contain Communist China. We believe that the U.S. MFN renewal for Mainland China is conducive to the mainland's economic stability and improvement of the people's livelihood, as well as to the prosperity of the "Chinese economic sphere" of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, which have closer economic exchanges with the mainland; and therefore, the MFN renewal is a practical decision. However, this does not mean that Communist China can turn a deaf ear to improvement of the human rights situation in the mainland. After all, this question has already attracted the international community's keen attention and Communist China has no reason to ignore this question even after obtaining MFN status, because not only will the United States continue to monitor closely the progress of human rights improvement, but this is also a matter involving the values of civilization and the dignity of the Chinese people.
