The economic crisis has not been overcome. The social problems have become extremely acute. In such conditions, when confidence in all branches of power has declined, Ukraine's Supreme Council, at the demand of the people, adopted correct decisions: to hold early elections. First, Supreme Council elections in March, and later, in June, Ukrainian presidential elections and elections to local power structures. Therefore, Ukraine is at the threshold of new important changes in its political and economic life. We have a possibility to continue transformations in Ukraine in a peaceful way and do this in a manner adopted in the majority of democratic countries of Europe and the world: from elections to elections, to change the parliament and, therefore, also the government; in other words, to introduce changes into the ranks of those who will determine the state's internal and external policy. However, in order for the peaceful revolutionary transformations in Ukraine to continue, elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council, appointed for 27 March 1994, must be successful. However, certain facts and statements indicate that not everybody in Ukraine is interested in a successful course of these elections. There is talk of the possibility of some "power vacuum." Some people even openly advocate sabotaging the elections, undermining them. If the Supreme Council elections do not take place, this will only further intensify the political and economic instability and will lead to a constitutional crisis in Ukraine. However, there will be no crisis of power, since the present Supreme Council will maintain its constitutional powers and will function until March 1995. However, why should we go backwards, if the change in Ukraine's Supreme Council may and must take place on 27 March 1994? For precisely that reason, Ukraine's Supreme Council appeals to citizens and to all officials and power bodies who are involved in organizing the election campaign, with a request to show high responsibility at this time, which is important for Ukraine. Any actions or statements that may lead to the breakdown of elections or to their sabotage are inadmissible. Nor are any violations of the Law on Elections acceptable. Ukraine's Supreme Council draws the attention of central, district, and local electoral commissions, the leadership of the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, and the state mass media to the need to considerably improve activity aimed at intensifying the pre-election campaign and ensuring objectivity, the comprehensive nature of coverage, and the observance of the rights of candidates for deputies and voters. Dear fellow citizens, let us use our chance to change the life of every one of us and of the entire society. Kiev, 25 February 1994
