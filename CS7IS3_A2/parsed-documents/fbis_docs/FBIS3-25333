He told the ZIANA news agency: "I know it's in the process. But I don't know if the application has been formally lodged with the Zimbabwe Government." Zimbabwe Foreign Affairs Minister Nathan Shamuyarira could not be reached for comment. Mr Michael told a press conference last week his government had been angered by recent statements by Mr Mengistu in which he defended his rule in Ethiopia and blamed unnamed members of his ruling circle for his overthrow, claiming they had been paid by "imperialist circles". The Zimbabwe Government also expressed displeasure at the statements. Mr Mengistu was granted political asylum in Zimbabwe with his wife and children about 30 months ago on condition he did not engage in any political or public activity.
