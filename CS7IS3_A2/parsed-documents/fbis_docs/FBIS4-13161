Israel has been familiar with this activity -- including that of the military headquarters in Amman -- since Hamas' establishment in December 1987. In Jordan, Hamas is enjoying the support and aid offered by its patron, the Muslim Brotherhood -- which operates openly and legally in this country. We must recall that in the first clause of its covenant, Hamas defines itself as "one of the branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine. The Muslim Brotherhood is a worldwide movement and the largest Muslim movement in the modern era." Late in 1988 Hamas opened operational branches in several Arab states: Iran, Sudan, Lebanon, Yemen, and Jordan. Muhammad Nazzal from Qalqilyah, one of the prominent Palestinian members in the Muslim Brotherhood -- who moved to Jordan in the early 1980's -- was appointed Hamas' official representative in Jordan late in 1988. He received the special status also accorded to the PLO representative in Amman. His official office turned into a headquarters for all intents and purposes. The overt activity of the Jordanian office was mainly directed at recruiting to Hamas Palestinians living in Jordan, as well as funneling funds to the territories. The office did not settle for this activity, however, and during 1990 there were several infiltration attempts by Hamas terrorists into the Jordan Valley. All this activity took place under the direction of the Amman office. The Hamas office in Jordan also included a branch of the military command, which recruited and operated terror squads, especially in the West Bank. Some of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's most senior terrorists, including the two commanders in Samaria -- 'Abd-al-Karim Hanini and Zuhayr Jubran -- were operated by the Jordan headquarters. The car bombs which exploded in Mehola and Ramat Ef'al, and the plans to activate car bombs in the Hasharon junction, near a large Jerusalem department store, and Tel Aviv's Defense Ministry complex, were all initiated and planned by the Hamas headquarters in Jordan. Jubran was the man who operated the squad whose members murdered Nisim Toledano and policemen Dani Hazut and Mordekhay Yisra'el. Since late 1988 the Jordan headquarters has been the seat of Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, an East Jerusalem engineer who moved to Jordan after the Six-Day War. Since then the office has turned into Hamas' information, public relations, and propaganda center. Over the last year Hamas' leaflets and directions to the Palestinian public in the territories have been disseminated from his office. Official Hamas statements -- including those of a military nature -- also emanate from Jordan. Until the end of 1992 the international Hamas headquarters -- including the military command -- operated from Washington and London. These locations were the source of operational directives to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's murder squads. Through fax machines and telephone calls directives were also conveyed to other Hamas apparatus. The Jordan headquarters was only a subordinate transit station for relaying directives onward. Following the detention of two senior American Hamas activists -- Muhammad Jarrad and Muhammad Salah -- in Israel in January 1993, and due to the uncovering of fundamentalist Muslim terrorism in the United States, Hamas' main military command was transferred from London and Washington to Yemen and Jordan. Muhammad Khazim Sawalihah, Hamas' military commander, at present operates from Jordan. He is being aided by several Hamas deportees who preferred not to return to the territories. Among them is Dr. Musa al-Aqtam, who was a senior lecturer in Nabulus' al-Najah University and a senior Hamas commander in the territories. Hamas terrorists caught by the Shin Bet during the last year divulged in the interrogations that they received their orders, funds, and operational directives from the Jordanian headquarters. Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of Hamas international, passes his time both in Damascus and Amman. Most of his time is spent on furthering the military operations and other covert Hamas operations in the territories. The Jordanian headquarters also handles Hamas' financial operations. Contributions from all over the Arab world reach Jordan, and from there -- via money changers -- to Hamas activists in the territories. The funds serve to buy weapons, pay rent for hiding places for fugitives, and finance their activities. The Jordanian headquarters transfers huge amounts of funds to all the Hamas-controlled civilian institutions on a monthly basis. These institutions, such as education and medical institutions, trade unions, and sport clubs, serve as a legal cover for Hamas activity in the territories and a pool for recruiting activists and terrorists. As will be recalled, Hamas pledged to carry out five attacks in retaliation to the Hebron massacre. Two have already been carried out. Jerusalem hopes that the uncovering of the links between the Jordanian headquarters and the attacks, and pressure exerted on King Husayn will hamper the activities of the Jordanian headquarters and indirectly contribute toward decreasing Hamas terrorism in the territories and in Israel. [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 17 April, in a page 1 and 2 report by Hemi Shalev and Shefi Gabay on Hamas activity in Jordan, adds that "Israel has relayed to Jordan intelligence information regarding Hamas activity in Amman and inside Israel."]
