Inacker article: "`The Debate Is One That Should First Be Conducted in Qualitative Terms and Only Secondarily in Quantitative Terms'"] [Text] Hamburg -- The new Federal Government white paper, entitled "The Security of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Current Position and Future of the Bundeswehr," is to be published on 5 April. In it, the Federal Government sets out its security and defense policy, the Bundeswehr's future mission, as well as the way in which the armed forces are to perform it. The 1994 white paper thus fulfills an important task, because the interested citizen has had to wait nine years for an assessment of German security and defense policy, which has been prompted by the dramatic changes in world politics. The very way in which the Bundeswehr and the Western alliance has reacted to the changes that have occurred until now is significant -- it is the only way in which the role of armed forces can be appreciated in a difficult political situation. The white paper provides no patent recipes for the future; what it does contain are parameters for a historically necessary discussion about the tasks and functions of the armed forces of a united Germany as the strongest power in Central Europe. The debate is one that should first of all be conducted in qualitative terms and only secondarily in quantitative terms. The WELT AM SONNTAG has listed the main points of the white paper as follows: 1. The introductory chapter "German Unity and the Bundeswehr" describes the underlying factors and point of departure for the 1989 European revolution: The collapse of communism in Europe and of the Iron Curtain, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and ultimately the fall of the Soviet Union. 2. The chapter entitled "The Situation" states the following: Germany achieved unity with the approval of all its neighbors and the world powers and now has complete sovereignty. It is now surrounded solely by democratic states, friends, and partners. However, the European landscape still represents a contradictory picture. Advanced integration processes contrast with centrifugal tendencies and tendencies toward the fragmentation of state units in the eastern and southeastern parts of the continent. Now, it is important to take steps to eliminate new risks, which are qualitatively of an entirely different kind from the risk that rightly determined Western security thinking in the past. The risk of a large-scale war throughout Europe has been replaced by an entire variety of risk factors that differ greatly regionally. Overall, there has been an increase in the number of unstable regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The readiness to resort to military means is increasing everywhere. Military conflicts, which could endanger Germany's existence, have become improbable as long as Germany, in alliance with NATO, can maintain its ability to defend itself. In the future strategic context, military risks will only be a part of a broad spectrum of security policy considerations. Risk analyses of future developments must proceed from a concept of security. They cannot be limited to Europe, but must take into account the interdependence of regional and global developments. They must consider social, economic, and ecological trends and their relation to the security of Germany and its allies. The prevention of conflicts and the resolution of conflicts in a broader geographical context with a legitimate mandate under international law must be in the forefront of concerns about security. Within the framework of a cause-based policy for the solution of crises and conflicts, the use of military means may also be necessary to prevent, limit, or end violence or war. 3. The chapter "The Concept of German Security and Defense Policy" states: Concrete security policy action is based on interests. German security policy has to take into account political constant factors and long-term framework conditions: Germany's geographical position in the center of Europe, its economic position as an exporting nation, close links with the world economy, and, finally, the experiences of German and European history. German foreign and security policy is guided by five key interests: -- Safeguarding the freedom, security, and well-being of Germany's citizens and the inviolability of its territory; -- Integration with the European democracies within the European Union [EU], because democracy, the rule of law state, and well-being outside Germany's borders also means security and freedom for Germany; -- The enduring alliance with the United States as a world power, which is based on common values and similar interests, with the potential of the United States being indispensable for international stability; -- The admission of our Eastern neighbors to Western structures in a manner that is geared toward equality and partnership; -- Worldwide respect for international law and human rights and a worldwide economic order based on free market rules. 4. The chapter "Areas for Action for German Security Policy" describes the international institutions in which Germany participates: Germany is a member of the United Nations; a participant in the CSCE; and a member of NATO, the EU, and the WEU [Western European Union]. These institutions should supplement an efficient security order in Europe and for Europe. NATO's main task remains contributing to a lasting and just peaceful order in Europe in conjunction with other institutions. The January 1994 NATO summit in Brussels sets a decisive course in that respect. It provide answers on three key points: -- The ability to exercise collective defense, which is the cornerstone of European security. Alliance defense remains the core function. However, it is unlikely that NATO will have to defend itself. On the other hand, the numerous crises and limited conflicts in Europe and on the edge of Europe, on the other side of the alliance's borders, are real. That requires that NATO should be able to participate in the international resolution of crises. -- The reform of NATO and European integration processes are now closely linked to one another. The WEU will be strengthened as the European pillar of the alliance. In the future, it will be able to seek recourse to NATO structures and forces. Thus, Europe will be in a position to act strategically, and, at the same time, dual structures will be avoided. That will relieve some of the burden on the United States and will, at the same time, create conditions for a lasting U.S. commitment in and for Europe. -- NATO has made the stabilization of Central, southeastern, and East Europe a joint task of the first order. With the Partnership for Peace initiative, the alliance has made an offer of greater cooperation in peace missions under UN and CSCE mandates to our neighbors in the East. The Partnership for Peace is an important and useful step on the road to introducing new partners into Western security institutions. It is no substitute for opening up the alliance. In a transitional period in particular it is important to take into account the interests of all. This means that the alliance must pursue cooperation with Russia just as intensively as its preparations for the integration of new members. The Maastricht Treaty of 7 February 1992 sets out perspectives under international law for European political union, which is based on and shaped by shared values and principles. It entails a joint European foreign and security policy. The CSCE is being developed into an operational instrument for the prevention of conflicts and resolution of crises. By joining the United Nations in 1973, Germany has recognized the rights and duties that that entails without reservation. To meet our increased responsibility, the United Nations also requires the support of regional organizations and alliances. In Europe, NATO and WEU are partners of the United Nations and the CSCE. The German contribution to safeguarding peace will in the future be primarily political and economic, not military. With respect to the deployment of military forces, Germany will only act in conjunction with allies and partners within the framework of a UN mission. On the Current Position and Future Development of the Bundeswehr Chapter 5. "The Bundeswehr of the Future" National and alliance defense in a markedly better security situation, especially in Central Europe, and the increased significance of effective and preventative crisis management are the new points of departure for determining military capabilities and their qualitative and quantitative form. The Bundeswehr now has a different spectrum of tasks; it is broader, more diverse, and more graduated than under the one dimensional threat of the period of East-West confrontation. It is of key importance that Germany should possess adequate forces for national and alliance defense that can be brought up to strength and will thus be able to provide forces that are immediately available for alliance crisis management and international peace and humanitarian missions. The Bundeswehr's task gives concrete form to these two main functions. The Bundeswehr: -- defends Germany and its citizens from political blackmail and external danger; -- promotes the military stability and integration of Europe; -- serves world peace and international security in line with the UN Charter: -- helps in the case of catastrophes and emergency situations and supports humanitarian operations. The Bundeswehr is and remains a conscript army. Universal military service is part of the approach to defense that has developed in Germany over decades. It stands for the readiness of citizens to assume personal responsibility for the protection of their state. It guarantees the ability to mobilize by drawing on reservists. The structure of the Bundeswehr will be adjusted to suit changed security policy framework conditions and to fall into line with the capacities that are required. The armed forces are divided into three categories: -- crisis reaction forces that are on alert; -- the extensive main defense forces, which are subject to mobilization; -- the basic military organization of the armed forces, which serve the function of the core of the armed forces. The requirements and possibilities of defense and responding to crises will in the future lead to a marked graduation of armed forces readiness that will correspond to the Bundeswehr's task. National defense capability will be consistently directed toward improving Germany's security position. The strategic situation permits a clear reduction in the armed forces for national defense. However, in view of Germany's geostrategic position, making a special contribution to the level of forces that can be mobilized in Central Europe will have a bearing on Germany's influence in alliance decisionmaking processes. The ability to mobilize on the part of the main armed forces is a decisive element in national defense and for Germany's importance in NATO's central task, collective defense. The Bundeswehr is by and large adequately equipped for national defense. What is still lacking is the ability to participate effectively in international crisis management. What is necessary is a German contingent that will be part of crisis response forces, a contingent that is in a position to conduct operations together with alliance partners and thus cover the entire range of possible missions. The formation of the contingent should be such that Germany is able to meet its obligations with respect to NATO and the WEU. It must be in a position to operate within the framework of NATO and the WEU as well as to cooperate effectively with partners under the auspices of the United Nations. In addition, it must be versatile, flexible, durable in order to fulfill the entire spectrum of tasks in crisis management, UN peace missions, and humanitarian missions in various deployment regions. The adjustments that have to be made to the Bundeswehr are based on the need to effectively develop the basic ability to resolve crisis, to implement the principle of universal military service sensibly, and obtain planning security in view of scarce resources. This means that the Bundeswehr will continue to rationalize in a consistent manner. Intelligence gathering, extensive mobility for the deployment and supply of military contingents, sea and air transportation, general supply and communications capabilities, and effective air defense are of key importance for future defense planning. The future size of crisis response forces, the more pronounced differentiation of the main defense forces, operational rationalization and the streamlining of structures will open up options for the future internal structure of the armed forces, personnel levels, and the stationing of personnel. Chapter 6. "The Bundeswehr in Transition" describes the current position of the army, air force, and navy, central Medical Corps offices, as well as central Bundeswehr offices and their specific contributions to the main tasks of the Bundeswehr. Chapter 7. The final chapter describes the role and self-perception of the "Bundeswehr in the State and Society." The transformations in security policy also have psychological and moral implications for military self-perception. The scope of this self-perception is being expanded. The active promotion of peace has now been added to the prevention of war. The soldier remains the defender of freedom and peace. He must be able to fight and when necessary, risk his life for the protection of Germany and for others within the framework of international obligations. That is the ethical core of military service and remains unchanged. However, today the focus is no longer on defense against a direct threat. Today the question is also one of helping people and peoples in need and danger, reconstructing states that have been destroyed, and keeping those who disrupt peace in check. As far as training is concerned, only forces that are ready for action can satisfy requirements and survive the extreme burdens imposed on them. These criteria determine the form, extent, and intensity of training in the armed forces.
