Debski; place and date not given: "Kaliningrad--A Special Town"] [Text] [Debski] Cooperation between Kaliningrad Oblast and Polish voivodships located near the border is most commonly associated with two "roundtables" and several seminars concerning this topic. However, are there any concrete results of those discussions? [Matochkin] We believe that "roundtables" are a good organizational form of keeping up cooperation in our region. They were necessary at the beginning of our cooperation--they created conditions for its foundation. The most important matter is the fact that both entrepreneurs and politicians have already been participating in talks at those tables; they have shared the necessary information with each other. [Debski] More specifically, could you tell us how many joint Polish-Russian companies there are in the oblast and what the size of Polish investment there is? [Matochkin] Twenty-eight percent of the trade is with Poland. We have 742 joint-venture companies; the largest portion of them, 275, are joint-venture firms with Polish companies. You are also in a good position as far as investment is concerned; you occupy the second position, close behind the Germans, whose financial possibilities are certainly much greater, and we understand this. For us, Poland is attractive not so much for the size of its investment but because it has people who are energetic and entrepreneurial. It is they who are establishing companies in the oblast and conducting trade. [Debski] Kaliningrad Oblast has been announced as a special economic zone. What does this mean to foreign businessmen? [Matochkin] By virtue of the decision by the president and the government, the oblast has obtained a number of allowances: --Tariff concessions--all merchandise coming to us is exempt from the import customs duty, and merchandise manufactured in the oblast is exempt from the export customs duty. --Tax allowances--foreign companies or companies with mixed capital are exempt from taxes entirely or partially, for a specified period. The size of the allowances and the time of their being in force is found on a special scale that depends on the type of production. [Debski] According to businessmen, however, not all of these allowances can be found in practice. [Matochkin] I can say that tariff concessions are, in fact, already in force. Indeed, the tax system is not functioning as it should yet, also because there are still only a few companies that meet all of the conditions. For example, if a company wants to get a 50-percent reduction of its income tax, it must export 50 percent of its products. We are now dealing with this problem--we are analyzing what results the allowances and reductions do or do not yield. We are also analyzing the functioning of tariff concessions and their influence on the level of our prices. It turns out that the tariff concession for food, where the tariff to be paid is approximately 30 percent, decreases the price of food commodities by 10-15 percent. Thus, reductions are more beneficial to businessmen than to the inhabitants of the oblast. We understand, of course, that the profit rate must be higher here than in other regions of the Russian Federation; however, I do not think the proportions between the profit and the reduction of prices are correct. All things considered, I can say that the special zone is functioning and yielding results, even though they are still not the results we would like to see. This is understandable. We have not been working in this system long. The most recent allowances and reductions came into effect in February 1994 and the first ones in late 1992. What is needed, then, is patience, all the more so because we want to further develop the concept of this zone. [Debski] People in Poland are deeply concerned about the accumulation of troops in the oblast. Some say that there are as many as 200,000 of them. Why so many? [Matochkin] I could ask those who say such things to prove that there are really 200,000. [Debski] How many soldiers are there really, then? [Matochkin] If we were to count the soldiers and the officers along with their families, then, if we assumed that each of the families consisted of three persons, we would estimate the figure at 200,000. [Debski] Along with the families? [Matochkin] Yes. Along with the families. [Debski] However, you yourself said once that the military people constitute 10 percent of the oblast's population, which is 920,000 people. [Matochkin] That was the case when I said this, a year and a half or two years ago. Since that time, we have been witnessing the process of limiting the armed forces. Standing units are being liquidated, such as the 24th Brigade of Rocket Cutters that has arrived here from Poland. Other units are being reduced in size--for example, divisions are being transformed into brigades. Moreover, each of the type of troops, apart from the border-protecting units, has too few soldiers. Simply, there are not enough draftees. Russian Defense Minister Pawel Gratchev has announced that we are planning, or, more specifically, that we are discussing, the idea of establishing the so-called Kaliningrad defense region. It is supposed to save money through the liquidation of parallel services. Today both the Baltic Fleet and the 11th Army have their own units of material supply, for instance, even though it would be cheaper if they were joint. This will lead to a further reduction in the number of troops. [Debski] Is there a program for these reductions? [Matochkin] Yes, there is. [Debski] For how long is it scheduled? [Matochkin] Until the year 2000 for the time being. The fact that your authorities keep repeating the figure 200,000 only proves how poorly your intelligence services are working. After all, it is not all that difficult to count soldiers. The Russian Federation does not have the possibilities to develop its armed forces; it has no money for that. It can only maintain them on a level that is necessary for our defense. I believe that the issue of the size of our armed forces is a political card that is being played on purpose. There have been proposals recently, such as the one by Algirdas Brazauskas that a demilitarized zone be set up here. But why? What are the arguments for this? Does the oblast threaten anybody? [Debski] Apparently such are the feelings... [Matochkin] If so, there must be further logic. If we demilitarize the oblast, will Lithuania and Poland be demilitarized as well? Otherwise, we will feel threatened. [Debski] This is a fundamental problem in our relations as the Polish president sees it. Now, what problems can you see? [Matochkin] There are no serious problems. We should try to cooperate more effectively, more openly; this cooperation should be more advantageous to both sides. I consider our relations to be normal. Cooperation with our Polish partners is very good. There is only one matter we want to complain about. We have started building the Kaliningrad-Elblag highway, which, incidentally, was a Polish initiative. We will complete our portion this year; we will reach the border. And what next? When will the Poles complete the rest? [Debski] So the issue of the Vistula Lagoon navigation is not a problem for you? [Matochkin] It certainly is. But, all right, let us discuss problems if you want to. I believe that controversial issues should be resolved, such as the issue of the Vistula Lagoon or the highway. Who most wants to see the issue of the Visula Lagoon navigation resolved? You do. And who wants to see the construction of the highway completed? We do. Let us, then, help each other on both issues. Otherwise, it looks like we are relenting on the issue of the Vistula Lagoon, but you are not budging on the issue of the highway. We can see three controversial issues: a) The Kaliningrad-Elblag highway: What is needed is a clear answer to whether the Poles want to build it. If you have no money for it, we will look for some together. For example, we can visit the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development together and try to get the money there. b) The Goldap-Gusiew border-crossing site: I want to know what our side will get out of it and what you will get. Poles know that this border crossing will increase traffic near the border. We want it to be the second variant of the road to Grodno--not through Lithuania. c) The Vistula Lagoon: Right now, the situation at the lagoon is satisfactory as far as we are concerned. I understand, of course, that Poles have a differing opinion. What we should do, then, is sit down and discuss all of these problems at the same time. In one issue we will make a concession, in another you will. On all of these issues, the time for discussions has ended: Specific problems must be resolved now. Postscript: When we were saying goodbye to each other, Yuri Matochkin said: If President Lech Walesa does not believe the figures we submit, he might come and visit us. I am inviting him. We will show him all of the places, all of the units he wants to see. He may see for himself that 200,000 soldiers are not there.
