I never met with DIA [Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate] Director Gianni De Gennaro. I know that he passed through the Palazzo Chigi [government seat] last Friday [7 January], but certainly not to meet with me or for a security summit." Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, flying from Rome to Brussels, denied the report in the Naples daily newspaper IL MATTINO that a top secret meeting had taken place two days ago between the head of government and the anti-Mafia leader with the aim of discussing the mysterious threats against President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Moreover, these threats were supposed to have come from opponents in possession of no less than "an arsenal of infrared missiles capable of penetrating the dark of night and striking any target with great precision." However, this was not the only denial to be heard during the prime minister's flight. Sitting beside Ciampi, his military adviser, General Giannattasio, reread the IL MATTINO article and explained: "Weapons like these only exist in films. Perhaps not even in films." Giannattasio was quite clear that this is pure fantasy. A little earlier in Rome, Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi made his position clear: "These are exaggerations that are completely unfounded but which could lead us to ridicule dangers and alarms that are serious." On the flight to the NATO summit in Brussels, the impression was that the head of government felt himself to be stronger than the venom and conspiracies, and that perhaps he hardly believes them at all. He confided in his men that he believed the alarm spreading through the country to be "perhaps a little exaggerated." In his blue cardigan and glasses the prime minister chatted at length with [Foreign Minister Beniamino] Andreatta, then started to work on his folders at his table, just as if he were in his office and despite the strong turbulence that accompanied the two-hour flight.
