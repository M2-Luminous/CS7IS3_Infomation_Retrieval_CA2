Following are some details of the new discoveries. Archeologists found 350 pottery and porcelain pieces in the southeastern part of the archipelago. They are similar to the old potteries of Hop Lu and Cay Communes in Hai Hung Province, about 50 kilometers east of Hanoi. The potteries of these two communes were seen in the plain, in the midland, and also in coastal regions in northern Vietnam. Old potteries from Hop Lu also appeared in Truong Sa. This proved that in the 15th and 16th centuries, Vietnamese fishermen and traders were using the Truong Sa Archipelago as a terminal to anchor their ships and as a stopover place on their way to the high seas for fishing and for dealing with foreign partners. On Nam Yet Island, Vietnamese archeologists also excavated 165 old pottery pieces at a depth from 44 to 52 centimeters and also [words indistinct] with heaps of shelves. These artifacts prove that Nam Yet Island was a dwelling place of people in the late Tran dynasty and early Le dynasty from the 15th to the 16th centuries. Also on Truong Sa Island, the archeologists found old coins of the Minh Mang, Thieu Tri, and Tu Duc reigns of the Nguyen dynasty in the 19th century. Scientific research is being carried out by archeologists on the Truong Sa Archipelago. The latest discoveries help the study on the social and material life of a part of Vietnamese people's history in the offshore region. They also serve as concrete evidence of Vietnam's sovereignty over the Truong Sa Archipelago through different periods of history. It is an undeniable fact.
