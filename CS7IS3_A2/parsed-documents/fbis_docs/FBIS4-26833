The Sino-British Airport Committee team leaders Guo Fengmin and Hugh Davies emerged from a three-hour meeting yesterday to say that further progress had been made and that experts will prepare a draft deal. Governor Chris Patten said "we are quite close to an agreement." "Obviously, this week has seen several strides forward but we are not quite home yet," he said. "I prefer not to use words like agreement until everything is cut and dry.... It is important for both sides to have a piece of paper which embodies precisely what's been agreed that they can use, for example, that we can use when we are talking to bankers and to others. We want to get everything sorted out as cleanly and clearly as possible." Financial Secretary Sir Hamish MacLeod said he was encouraged. "We are in a positive mood. I think both sides are working hard to try and reach an agreement and resolve any outstanding points," he said. Sources close to the negotiations said the Chinese side "seemed to be OK with the figures" contained in the latest government financial package, removing the major obstacle over the dispute which has dragged on for nearly two years. But they were concerned that substantial differences and "new problems" might crop up in the process of "putting the figures into a document". British team leader, Mr Davies, said: "We agreed that the next step should be for experts on both sides to meet as soon as possible to draw up documents which will form the basis of agreement between us. That is extremely important because without such a document it will be difficult to persuade the finance houses to provide the finance for the airport and Mass Transit Railway Corporation," he said. He hinted there were still some issues in contention. "If it had been totally resolved I think I would have come out and told you. If it were only wording without substantive issues we could have signed it yesterday or this morning. There are some issues which need to be sorted out. I hope we will reach an agreement before the end of this month. If possible within the next few days but everything depends on the drafting group." Mr Guo said the two sides "still need to study some of the details and wording in the document". The fourth financial package provides for an equity injection of $60.3 billion to contain borrowings by the railway corporation and the Provisional Airport Authority at about $23 billion. Mainland sources confirmed there was no new demand on the level of equity although China continued to hope that the government would be able to reduce the debts to run beyond 1997. The negotiators had disputed whether the borrowings by the two corporations should be considered as government borrowings, which were limited to $5 billion under the Memorandum of Understanding. It is understood that the issue was no longer contentious, with neither side insisting that a clear definition of the borrowings be written into the draft agreement. "But the details and figures used by the two sides at the talks have to be spelled out very precisely and in a sustainable form so that the agreement can be implemented," a source said. It is understood an agreement was reached on the disposal of land along the rail link and the issue of cost-monitoring. The two sides will leave further discussion on the Airport Corporation Bill to experts after finalising the financial package, sources said.
