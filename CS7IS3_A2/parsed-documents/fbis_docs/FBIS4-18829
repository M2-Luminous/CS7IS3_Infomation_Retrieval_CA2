FBIS4-18829 "drweu069cc_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-069 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 INTER-EUROPEAN AFFAIRS EU Proposes Ban on Driftnets After 1997 EU Proposes Ban on Driftnets After 1997 AU0704174694 Paris AFP in English 1415 GMT 7 Apr 94 AU0704174694 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Brussels, April 7 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] proposed here Thursday [7 April] that all driftnet fishing in European waters should be outlawed by December 31, 1997, and that particularly long driftnets should be banned at the end of 1994. Driftnets, known as "walls of death," are used to catch white tuna in the North Atlantic, salmon in the Baltic and swordfish in the Mediterranean. But they are blamed for also indiscriminately entrapping and killing seabirds and mammals such as dolphins. The European Union's executive European Commission quoted scientific studies estimating that 1,700 dolphins were captured by driftnets last year in the north-east Atlantic. The Commission agreed that French fishermen should be allowed an extra year, to the end of this year, to stop using driftnets measuring between 2.5 and five kilometres (1.6 to three miles). An EU spokesman said the Commission would propose to a ministerial council next week that the extent of fishing by means of driftnets up to 2.5 kilometres long should be frozen at end-1994, then gradually phased out by end-1997. The longer nets have been banned since 1992. But fishermen which had used them before that date -- mainly 31 French boats operating in the north-east Atlantic -- were given until the end of last year to phase them out. EU fishing ministers have been unable to agree whether to prolong the extension, despite strong pressure from the French driftnet fishermen. But a Commission spokesman said the French boats should be given the right to use the longer nets for one more fishing season. EU Fisheries Commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas also urged tighter controls on driftnet fishing. He quoted a report saying that illicit use of the larger nets was widespread.
