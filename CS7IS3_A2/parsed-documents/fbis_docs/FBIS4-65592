After assuming his post in the morning, Tasanlar told the Anatolian Agency that Turkey was a state of law and everything took place before the public. `The inspectors concluded their interrogation and could not find any element of crime against me,' he said. `There, the state was destroyed. What I regretted most was the fact that the police were injured and state vehicles were destroyed in the incidents which broke out on May Day and no one mentioned this.' Interior Minister Nahit Mentese had removed Tasanlar from his position temporarily after calls from the government's junior coalition partner Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) for an investigation into the charges of police brutality.
