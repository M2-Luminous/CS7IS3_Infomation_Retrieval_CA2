Now, in the spring of the fourth year after unity, the fruits of this immense cleanup effort are visible. Sixty-seven percent of east German survey respondents have said that things are clearly looking up in their immediate surroundings. Their observations are based mainly on the comprehensive construction work in progress, the improvements to the infrastructure, and the new shops and factories. Only a fifth of the respondents were despondent, claiming that nothing was changing and that there were no signs of any improvement in eastern Germany. The population of eastern Germany is experiencing unity differently than are west Germans, for whom unity was mainly a news story. Ninety-two percent of the east German respondents and 37 percent of the west German respondents claim that unity has changed their lives. Most of the respondents in the old laender who said they had noticed changes painted a rather negative picture, and many of them said that the financial burden of unity was a major contributory factor to the recession. The great majority of the east German respondents, 61 percent, said they had personally profited from unity, and 25 percent said they had suffered because of it. The proportion of people in the latter category has been falling for two years, whereas the proportion of people in the former category is rising all the time. What is remarkable is that many respondents mistrust their own generally positive experience and have a more negative opinion of general developments than is justified by the reality. Eighty-five percent of the respondents in the new laender are convinced that the situation of women in eastern Germany has deteriorated as a result of unity. But in fact, most female respondents, just like male respondents, have a generally positive opinion. Fifty-seven percent of female respondents said their personal situation has improved since unity, 21 percent said their situation has deteriorated, and 16 percent see no difference. The financial situation of east German households is improving rapidly. Already in October 1990, 34 percent of these households could afford to buy more than before the turnabout, one year later 39 percent could do so, and today 47 percent of households can afford more than they could before the changes. On the other hand, the proportion of those suffering a decline in their living standards is at a constant 16 percent. The widespread view that the increased incomes have been completely swallowed by rising costs is false. The amount of money east German respondents claim to have at their disposal at the end of the month after paying all their living expenses is rising from one year to the next. The financial disparity between households in the old laender and households in the new laender is rapidly equalizing. Altogether, 58 percent of the respondents in the new laender say that their economic situation has improved over the past three years. In the old laender, only 6 percent of the respondents say their situation had improved over the past three years, and 32 percent say their situation had deteriorated. But that also means that despite the high cost of unity, two-thirds of west German respondents have at least been able to retain the standard of living they enjoyed in 1990. In 1986, 12 percent of west German respondents claimed they could afford little, in 1990, 7 percent said so, and today 13 percent are saying so. In the new lander, 20 percent of the respondents still say their financial possibilities are limited. The proportion of people who say that they can only meet their living costs with great difficulty is small, both in the old and in the new lander, and hovers between 1 and 2 percent. Now that freedom is here, the present has become more demanding and the future more uncertain. Few people were prepared for the change in interpersonal relationships that occurred with the collapse of the Wall, especially the change to the small social relationships that were based on a mutual dependence and confidence that can only arise under harsh living conditions. Eighty-seven percent of the east German respondents said interpersonal relationships have deteriorated since unity. Almost every other respondent also finds that the climate in workplaces has become colder and more unfriendly than before. Many are having trouble with the new, more sober attitude that employees have toward their own enterprise, an attitude that has virtually displaced the convivial tone that existed in the workplaces of the former GDR. Many people still feel unsure and not at home in the new system. However, the joy brought by unification has never been taken seriously in eastern Germany. Despite all the disillusionment and difficulty, 56 percent of the east German population consider unity a reason to be joyful. Only 23 percent consider it a cause for concern. The advantages of unity are too great, the progress in reconstructing the new laender too obvious, and the newly won freedom too precious to be able to dampen this joy. Pride in what has been achieved is again slowly increasing. The Germans have become despondent over the problems connected with restructuring and the economic slump. The majority feared that everything was going in the opposite direction to the one intended, and would have to be tackled in a different way. For two years, bad news about the situation of enterprises and growing unemployment figures clouded people's views of the visible successes. If in 1991 most people viewed the reconstruction in the new laender as a good performance, in 1992 many were clouded in doubt. But today, pride is growing in the east and in the west -- 46 percent of west German respondents and 40 percent of east German respondents consider the reconstruction in eastern Germany a good effort. Only 33 percent of respondents disagree. This pride has not yet spread to the whole of Germany. Both east and west Germans are upset, thinking that their own contribution to the reconstruction of eastern Germany has been unfairly assessed. Eighty-one percent of the population in the new laender is under the impression that the west has not enough respect for their effort, and 69 percent of west Germans think that eastern Germany has not afforded suitable recognition to their contribution to this great work. But it is just a matter of time before pride in the reconstruction of eastern Germany joins the Germans again, just like it did during the postwar economic miracle.
