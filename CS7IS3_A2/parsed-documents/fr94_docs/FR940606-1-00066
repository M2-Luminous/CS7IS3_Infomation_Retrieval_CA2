FR940606-1-00066 FR940606-1-00010 40 CFR Part 721 [OPPTS&hyph;50612B; FRL&hyph;4750&hyph;4] RIN 2070&hyph;AB27 Aromatic Amino Ether; Proposed Significant New Use Rule AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance described generically as an aromatic amino ether which is the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 and which is subject to a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA. This proposal would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing, importing, or processing activities for a use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur. DATES: Written comments must be received by EPA by July 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Each comment must bear the docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50612B. All comments should be sent in triplicate to: TSCA Document Receipt Office (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;201, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. All comments which are claimed confidential must be clearly marked as such. Three additional sanitized copies of any comments containing confidential business information (CBI) must also be submitted. Nonconfidential versions of comments on this proposed rule will be placed in the rulemaking record and will be available for public inspection. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 for the significant new uses designated herein. The required notice would provide EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities. I. Authority Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a category of chemical substances. Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the Federal Register its reasons for not taking action. Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. II. Applicability of General Provisions General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. On July 27, 1988 (53 FR 28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPA promulgated amendments to the general provisions which apply to this SNUR. In the Federal Register of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgated a ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section 26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting significant new use notices to submit certain fees to EPA are discussed in detail in that Federal Register document. Interested persons should refer to these documents for further information. III. Background EPA published a direct final SNUR for the chemical substance, which was the subject of PMN P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 and a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA, in the Federal Register of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51672). EPA received adverse comments following publication for this chemical substance. Therefore, as required by ยง721.160, the final SNUR for P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 is being withdrawn elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register and this proposed rule on the substance is being issued. EPA is not soliciting and will not respond to comments on any of the other SNURs that were published in the October 4, 1993, Federal Register because those rules became final effective rules on December 3, 1993, or are being withdrawn and proposed in a separate action. The supporting rationale and background to this proposal are more fully set out in the preamble to the direct final SNUR for this substance and in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the Federal Register of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures for the proposal and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data. IV. Substance Subject to This Rule EPA is proposing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substance under 40 CFR part 721. PMN Number P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 Chemical name: (generic) Aromatic amino ether. CAS number: Not available. Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: November 5, 1992. Basis for section 5(e) consent order: The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. Toxicity concern: The PMN substance and similar chemicals have been shown to cause mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity (retinopathy), hepatotoxicity, reproductive effects, and aquatic toxicity at concentrations as low as 1 ppb (part per billion) in test animals. Recommended testing: A 90&hyph;day subchronic rodent study (oral or inhalation route) with special attention given to hepatotoxicity, histopathological exam of the male and female reproductive organs, and retinopathy is needed to help characterize the neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, and reproductive effects of the PMN substance. The 90&hyph;day study must also include for each treatment group a satellite group of exposed animals to be retained for an additional 90&hyph;day recovery period to evaluate the possible reversibility of retinopathy. Light and electron microscopy should be utilized to examine the ocular tissue (40 CFR 798.2650, modified). A 2&hyph;year two-species bioassay (40 CFR 798.3300) is also necessary to characterize the carcinogenic potential of the PMN substance. The consent order contains two production volume limits. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed the first production limit without performing the 90&hyph;day subchronic study. The PMN submitter has also agreed not to exceed the second, higher production volume limit without performing the 2&hyph;year, two-species bioassay. In addition, an early life stage toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1600), a Daphnia chronic toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1330), an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050), and a coupled units test (40 CFR 796.3300) would characterize the potential aquatic toxicity effects. CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.3390. V. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Because this SNUR was first published on October 4, 1993, as a direct final rule, that date will serve as the date after which uses will be considered to be new uses. If uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated through this SNUR after October 4, 1993, will have to cease any such activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing for a proposed significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance as codified at ยง721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. VI. Economic Analysis EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers, importers, and processors of the chemical substance at the time of the direct final rule. The analysis is unchanged for the substance in this proposed rule. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record for this proposed rule (OPPTS&hyph;50612B). VII. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. VIII. Rulemaking Record EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50612B). The record includes basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with additional information as it is received. EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any time between this proposal and designation of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. A public version of the record, without any CBI, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), also known as, TSCA Public Docket Office, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. NCIC is located in Rm. E&hyph;G102, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's prioritities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substance. Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule would not be substantial, even if all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms. C. Paperwork Reduction Act OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), and has assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information requirements contained in this proposed rule. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 721 Environmental protection, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Recordkeeping and reporting requirements, Significant new uses. Dated: May 24, 1994. Lynn R. Goldman, Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 721 be amended as follows: PART 721_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 721 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 2604, 2607, and 2625(c). 2. By adding new ยง721.1640 to subpart E to read as follows: ยง721.1640 Aromatic amino ether. (a) Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting. (1) The chemical substance identified generically as aromatic amino ether (PMN P&hyph;90&hyph;1840) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply once the substance has been incorporated into a final product with residual monomer 50 ppm (parts per million) by weight. (2) The significant new uses are: (i) Protection in the workplace. Requirements as specified in ยง721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(2)(iii), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5)(i), (a)(6)(i), (b)(concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c). The demonstration of an impervious barrier for gloves required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section will require testing of the gloves as follows. There must be no permeation of the PMN substance greater than 2 ppm after 8 h of testing in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F739 ``Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation By Liquids and Gases'' and ASTM F1194 ``Guide for Documenting the Results of Chemical Permeation Testing of Protective Clothing Materials.'' The employer must submit all test data to the Agency and must receive the Agency's written approval of the test results for each type of glove tested prior to use of such gloves. Gloves may not be used for a time period longer than they are actually tested and must be replaced at the end of the work shift. As an alternative to the respiratory requirements in this section, manufacturers, importers, and processors may use the new chemical exposure limits provisions, including sampling and analytical methods which have previously been approved by EPA for this substance, found in the 5(e) consent order for this substance. (ii) Hazard communication program. Requirements as specified in ยง721.72(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), (f), (g)(1)(vi), (g)(1)(vii), (g)(2)(i), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv), (g)(2)(v), (g)(3)(i), (g)(3)(ii), (g)(4), and (g)(5). The following additional statements shall appear on each label and MSDS as required by this paragraph: This substance may cause liver damage. This substance may cause retinopathy. (iii) Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities. Requirements as specified in ยง721.80(l) and (q). (iv) Release to water. Requirements as specified in ยง721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 1 ppb). When calculating the surface water concentrations according to the instructions in ยง721.91(a)(4), the statement that the amount of the substance that will be released will be calculated before the substance enters control technology does not apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the PMN substance will be treated before release, the amount of the PMN substance reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 45 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment. (b) Specific requirements. The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph. (1) Recordkeeping requirements. Recordkeeping requirements as specified under ยง721.125(a) through (i) and (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance. (2) Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements. The provisions of ยง721.185 apply to this section. (3) Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section. The provisions of ยง721.1725(b)(1) apply to this section. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13681 Filed 6&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
