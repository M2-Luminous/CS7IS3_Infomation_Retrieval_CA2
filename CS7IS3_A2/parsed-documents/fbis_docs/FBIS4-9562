In his letter to Russian President Yeltsin, President Izetbegovic says, among other things, the following: We have received with pleasure and hope your firm condemnation of the bloodshed among the civilians in Gorazde. We favor a political solution to the conflict. However, the aggressor is not giving up the idea of destroying Bosnia and exterminating our people even after two years. The keys to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina are in the hands of Belgrade and Pale, the letter states. In our hands are only the keys of resistance and determination to persevere in this unfair struggle between good and evil, between democracy and fascism. Esteemed Mr. President, we welcome the activities of your government with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the end of the letter to Boris Yeltsin, President Alija Izetbegovic officially invites the Russian President to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina. In his letter to Saudi King Fahd, President Alija Izetbegovic stressed his demand that in future peace talks on our country, in addition to the United States, Russia, the United Nations, and the European Union, the Conference of Islamic Countries also take part as a fifth equal member.
