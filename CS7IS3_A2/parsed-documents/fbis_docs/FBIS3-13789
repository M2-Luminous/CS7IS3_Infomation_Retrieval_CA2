Perhaps the most salient form is the rabid U.S. political campaign which began to escalate as the periodic UN Security Council review of the blockade imposed on Iraq drew closer. All indications are that the United States alone has continued to insist on this unjust blockade. The first and most important fact in this regard is that Iraq has implemented all its obligations vis-a-vis Resolution 687 on the destruction of chemical, biological, nuclear weapons, and missiles. Iraq has also agreed to abide by the substance of Resolution 715 concerning future monitoring of weapon manufacturing. This means that Iraq has not left any excuse for the United States to continue the blockade. The second fact is that the past months have witnessed many serious developments in the international and regional stands toward Iraq. There is a clear positive development in attitudes of a number of UN Security Council permanent member states--France, Russia, and China--on the issue of the blockade, in addition to stands by other Council member states. This change means among other things that the so-called international consensus against Iraq, which the U.S. Administration continues to arrogantly claim to exist, is neither existent nor possible to realize, that only the Clinton administration, as we have said, is insisting on continuing the embargo imposed on Iraq despite the eroding justifications and causes of this embargo. Moreover, this hostile and indiscriminate U.S. hostility to Iraq is paralleled by an international awareness, which is deepening and expanding every day, that Iraq carried out all the measures and abided by all the obligations imposed on it by the UN Security Council resolutions despite their injustice and unfairness, and that it is time to deal objectively and fairly with the blockade and implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, which clearly links the implementation of its provisions with lifting the blockade on Iraq. The question that springs to the mind is: What is behind this immoral and inhuman U.S. attitude toward Iraq? Why does the U.S. Administration indulge in its arrogance and its hostile and unbridled policy against Iraq? What will the United States reap from this war of starvation and poverty which it is launching against Iraq? In my humble opinion, the current U.S. foreign policy represents the ugliest form of arrogance, tyranny, and brute force. It may be said that the U.S. arrogance has reached its peak these days despite the appearance of international evidence and factors which indicate that the entire international community, including states that are allied to the United States, has started to take notice of this arrogance and its dangers. These states have started to grumble and even to move in one form or another against this high-handed and tyrannical U.S. policy. Differences have cropped up between the United States and its Western allies and Japan. The Zionist lobby is tightening its grip on the Clinton administration in a way unparalleled in previous administrations. Reports from the United States speak of the Zionist lobby's increasing influence on U.S. decisionmaking, especially in foreign affairs. It seems that the Clinton administration has definitively linked the preservation of U.S. interests in Arab region with the preservation of Zionist entity's strategic supremacy over the Arab nation. Can the Zionist lobby forget that among the Arab countries only Iraq was capable of undermining the foundations of the Zionist security theory and to come close to realizing parity with "Israel?" It can be argued that this hostile and conspiratorial attitude toward Iraq--this wrong U.S. attitude against Iraq in particular and against all states that differ with U.S. policy and opinion in general--is due to the Clinton administration's inability to understand the Iraqi question and the conditions and policy of Iraq, as well as the conditions of the region in general, and the administration's failure to understand the political, social, and historical facts to enable it to take the right stand toward Iraq. This U.S. political inability is due to ignorance and inexperience, as well as the U.S. decisionmakers' lack of coherence, clarity, and comprehensive understanding of international political problems. The United States realizes that its aggression against Iraq has failed, that it did not succeed in realizing the basic targets it had sought from this aggression. This feeling of failure, impotency, and bitterness has prompted the United States to continue its aggression and blockade on Iraq and to continue its arrogance and feverish attempts to harm the Iraqi people and encroach on their will and national dignity. In light of all these facts and motives, it can be said that the blockade imposed on our people and country for almost four years will become--and it could already be--a U.S. blockade which Iraq rejects ad strongly resist. No doubt, all the fair-minded people and revolutionaries will take Iraq's side against this U.S. blockade.
