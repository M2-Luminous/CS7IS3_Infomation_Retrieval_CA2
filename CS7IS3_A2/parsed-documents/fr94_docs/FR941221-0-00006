Subpart C_Annual Leave 2. In subpart C, §630.301 is revised to read as follows: §630.301 Annual leave accumulation_Senior Executive Service. (a) Unused annual leave accrued by an employee while serving under an appointment in the Senior Executive Service under 5 U.S.C. chapter 33, subchapter VIII, shall accumulate for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than 90 days (720 hours) at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period (or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods) occurring in a calendar year. (b) Annual leave accrued for any pay period during only a portion of which the employee served under an appointment to the Senior Executive Service shall be prorated. Only that portion of the leave that is attributable to service in the Senior Executive Service shall be subject to the 90-day (720-hour) limitation on accumulation of annual leave provided in paragraph (a) of this section. Other annual leave accrued during the pay period shall be subject to the limitations imposed by subsections (a), (b), and (c) of 5 U.S.C. 6304, as appropriate. (c) When an employee in the Senior Executive Service moves to a position outside the Senior Executive Service, any annual leave accumulated while serving in the Senior Executive Service that is in excess of the amount allowed for the position by subsection (a), (b), or (c) of 5 U.S.C. 6304 shall remain to the employee's credit and shall be subject to reduction under procedures identical to those described in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c). (1) If the employee has more than 720 hours of annual leave at the time of the move and has a personal leave ceiling under paragraph (d) of this section, the employee may not carry over to the next leave year an amount greater than the employee's personal leave ceiling. (2) If the employee has more than 720 hours of annual leave at the time of the move and does not have a personal leave ceiling under paragraph (d) of this section, the employee may not carry over to the next leave year more than 720 hours. (d) An employee in the Senior Executive Service who, as of the first day of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, has accumulated annual leave in excess of 90 days (720 hours) is entitled to retain that leave as a personal leave ceiling. The leave shall be credited to the employee and shall be subject to reduction in the following manner: (1) Annual leave credited to an employee shall be based on the amount of annual leave accumulated by the employee as of the end of the pay period preceding the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994. The credited leave shall exclude_ (i) Any annual leave restored to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d); and (ii) Any annual leave advanced to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6302(d) that had not yet been earned. (2) Annual leave credited to an employee that is in excess of 90 days (720 hours) shall be subject to reduction in the same manner as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) until the employee's accumulated annual leave is equal to or less than 90 days (720 hours). For the 1994 leave year, 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) shall be applied only for leave earned and used between the start of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave year. (e) Agencies shall notify affected employees and maintain records on the accumulated annual leave credited to each employee under paragraph (d) of this section and on any reductions in the credited annual leave made under 5 U.S.C. 6304(c). If the employee transfers to another agency, such records shall be provided to the gaining agency. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31245 Filed 12&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6325&hyph;01&hyph;M
