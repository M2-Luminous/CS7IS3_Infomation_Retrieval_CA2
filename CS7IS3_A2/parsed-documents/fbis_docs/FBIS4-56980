FBIS4-56980 "drlat091_r_94013" FBIS-LAT-94-091 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Peru Chief Justice Backs Decision To Delay Penal Procedure Code Chief Justice Backs Decision To Delay Penal Procedure Code PY1105005494 Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 29 Apr 94 p B1 PY1105005494 Lima EL PERUANO Spanish BFN [Text] Chief Justice Luis Serpa Segura has fully endorsed a resolution by the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) to postpone the implementation of the new Code of Penal Procedure for six months. He noted that this period of time will be used to refurbish the infrastructural facilities needed for the code to go into effect. Although he did not explicitly say so, Serpa was thus directly alluding to an executive branch decree that declared all criminal justice buildings to be in state of emergency for four months. These facilities will play a leading role in the implementation of the new code. Serpa added that the suspension of the implementation of the new code will also make it possible to adjust its articles to the new Constitution that was approved by referendum on 31 October 1993. Furthermore, the 43 Lima criminal courts functioning at the Justice Palace have not yet been able to move to their new offices on the six lower floors of the new building that now houses the Attorney General's Office (the former Economy Ministry building). This move was ordered precisely to pave the way for a better implementation of the new Code of Penal Procedure. The 43 provincial criminal prosecutors have, however, managed to move to the new offices, and are already working in the upper seven floors of the said building. The new code provides that criminal courts, prosecutors, their respective clerks, and specialized offices should be located in the same building -- such as the one designated by the government -- for the purpose of ensuring that justice be served promptly and in a timely manner. The Justice Ministry has authorized the judicial branch to hire directly, without calling for bids, contractors to renovate the floors that will house the criminal courts.
