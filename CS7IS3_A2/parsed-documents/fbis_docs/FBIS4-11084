A diplomat of the Mexican Embassy in Cuba who attended the meeting told EFE that he saw Castro "in perfect condition, as always. He even cracked jokes." Sergio Tobar, scientific attache of the Mexican diplomatic mission, added that the meeting took place at the office of the Cuban leader and lasted about one hour. The source said Castro and Alzati later went to the Mexican ambassador's residence in Havana to attend a reception, at which Castro stayed for 30 minutes. This is the first time, since 2 April, that GRANMA has reported on an activity involving Castro, while the Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry yesterday denied he suffered a heart attack or a stroke. A spokesman for the Foreign Relations Ministry said that Castro "is not scheduled" to attend the Conference on the Nation and Emigration, which will start tomorrow, but Castro will attend a special session of the National Assembly on 1 May. [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1518 GMT carries a related 250-word Havana-datelined report quoting Sergio Tobar as stating Cuban President Fidel Castro is "in a perfect state of health," adding that "we saw him and he looked as usual, very spirited; he may have the flu [gripe]." The report adds that Castro later attended a cocktail party at the Mexican ambassador's residence, where he chatted with guests for 20 minutes.]
