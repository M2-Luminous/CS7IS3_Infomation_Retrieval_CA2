The Kabo Peasant War was a patriotic and progressive mass struggle to liquidate the feudal misrule, secure the right of people to existence and defend the national sovereignty from foreign aggression. The war was a largest ever armed struggle in the modern history of Korea. The historical Kabo peasant war started with the publication of a manifesto run through with the patriotic idea of "promoting national interests and welfare of the people" and "rejecting the West and Japan" by Chon Pong-chun, commander-in-chief of the peasant army, on March 21, 1894, and the war raged as an anti-feudal struggle, an anti-Japanese national salvation struggle stirring up the whole country at that time. The war, however, ended in failure due to the outrageous armed intervention of the Japanese aggressors, treacherous acts of the reactionary ruling quarters and due to the organisational, ideological and tactical limitations of the peasant army itself. Kim Sok-hyong, president of the Academy of Social Sciences, in his report at the meeting noted that though the Kabo Peasant War failed, it dealt a telling blow at the Japanese aggressors and the domestic reactionary ruling quarters, gave impetus to the bourgeois reform movement in Korea, awakened the people of all walks of life to their class consciousness and consciousness of national independence and started the modern anti-Japanese righteous volunteers' struggle. He said "it was a principal historical summing up of the bloody lessons of the Kabo Peasant War that there must be the outstanding guidance of a great leader capable of closely rallying the popular masses and leading them along the road of struggle and victory if they were to sweep away the oppressors and reactionary ruling quarters, realise the independence of the masses and defend the country's sovereignty with the internal forces of the nation. "The national sovereignty which was so ardently hoped for by the participants in the peasant war and other people a hundred years ago has not yet been realised nation-wide and the South Korean people are in the lot of colonial slavery," he said, and stressed: "In order to realise the long-cherished desire of the nation, the anti-national, anti-democracy and anti-reunification Kim Yong-sam 'civilian' fascist regime must be wiped out and the independence and democratization of the South Korean society be achieved". Noting that the struggle against foreign aggression should be intensified to realise the national sovereignty on a nation-wide scale, he condemned the U.S. and Japanese imperialisms as inveterate enemies of the Korean people who invaded and have plundered Korea from long ago. He stressed that the Koreans in the North and South and overseas must firmly unite under the banner of great national unity and vigorously struggle to decisively check and frustrate the manoeuvres of separatists at home and abroad and achieve national reunification in the '90s at any cost. The meeting was attended by Chang Chol, vice-premier of the Administration Council, Yu Mi-yong, chairperson of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, Yo Yon-Ku, presidium member of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, other officials concerned and men of science, education, culture and art and the press and public organisations.
