There is a need to effectively appraise the factors which cause trade surpluses by principal regions such as the United States, the European Union (EU) and Asia. 3) The Ministry of Finance (MOF) recently decided to publish a trade index categorized by principal regions such as the United States. This index clearly provides numerical substantiation that the "effects of the J-curve served as the basis for the increase in foreign trade surplus with the United States in 1993 on a dollar basis. Indicators Expressed in Yen and Dollar Reflect Differing Results An examination of Japan's foreign trade trends for 1993 shows that the trade surplus declined for the first time in three years on a yen basis, but that it increased and hit a record high for three years in a row on a dollar basis. Whether the foreign trade trends are viewed on a yen basis or a dollar basis makes a difference in arriving at the result of trend analysis. The reason for this phenomenon is that when the value of the yen rises sharply as it did in 1993, shifts in foreign exchange rates are accompanied by major shifts in prices; and shifts in export and import volumes expressed in monetary values are strongly impacted by price factors. Accordingly, it is believed that an accurate appraisal of Japan's foreign trade trends requires focusing of attention on changes in volume data for "commodities," providing an unadulterated picture of foreign trade transactions without regard for indicators based on the yen or the dollar. Export and import volume data are compiled on the basis of unit for motor vehicles and tonnage for steel. Although it is possible to appraise volume by each of the respective categories of commodities, it is not possible to easily summarize export and import volume data for an entire nation as can be done in monetary terms because of the existence of unit count and weight in quantifying volumes for each commodity category. Even the trend is difficult to appraise on an overall basis. However, observations of movements in the "volume index," among the trade indices published by the MOF, can provide an appraisal for export and import trends on a volume basis for the nation as a whole. Further, export and import values can be arrived at by multiplying prices and volumes. It is known that if such data is converted to trade indices, that, generally speaking, the growth in monetary values can be expressed as an approximation of the sum of growth in the price and volume indices. This relationship can be used to analytically group export and import monetary value changes into price factors and volume factors. Accordingly, the use of foreign trade indices can provide an analysis and appraisal for the causes of Japan's trade surplus in terms of price and volume. Trade indices are one of the very important economic indices in accurately appraising Japan's foreign trade trends, and the MOF has compiled trade indices that supplement past worldwide foreign trade indices, categorized by principal regions such as the United States, the EU, and Asia, which provide the primary objective of 1) appraising export and import trends for each region on a volume basis and 2) analyzing changes in regional trade surpluses on a price and volume basis. The new indices are released beginning in March 1994, following approval by the Statistics Council. Reduction in Volume Which Lags Rise in Prices First, let us take a look at trends in the volume of exports and imports with the United States in 1993. Export volumes decreased 1.8 percent owing to commodities such as motor vehicles which declined because of the strong yen and attendant growth in local production while import volumes increased 2.4 percent reflecting increases in imports of commodities such as motor vehicles, electronic components such as semiconductors, and clothing. Also, trends in January and February 1994 were similar to those in 1993. A look at monthly volume indices for the United States further shows that export volumes are in a declining trend and that import volumes are in an increasing trend. A look at trends based on prices indicates that export prices expressed in dollars have increased 12.1 percent, but this reflects a rise of 13.7 percent in the yen's value in 1993. The 10.0 percent rise in exports to the United States in 1993 on a dollar basis reflects the effect of the strong yen, causing a rise of 12.1 percent in prices, whereas volume fell 1.8 percent. Imports from the United States rose 5.8 percent because of a rise in volume and prices. Accordingly, if an immediate decrease in export volume commensurate with the rise in export prices had been realized, exports to the United States would have failed to expand. However, as is known under what is generally referred to as "effects of the J-curve," when the value of the yen rises sharply, export prices on a dollar basis rise steeply and export volume trends lag are reflected in statistics on a gradual basis. Therefore, reductions in export volumes commensurate with rises in export prices are normally not reflected immediately. Additionally, increases in import volumes also lag in manifesting themselves in response to changes in foreign exchange rates. As a result, trade surpluses increase on a short-term basis, and the aforementioned trade indices indisputably attest to the manifestation of this phenomenon on a numerical basis. In other words, the major increase in trade surplus with the United States in 1993 is a reflection of the effects of the rise in export prices on a dollar basis arising from a significantly stronger yen as depicted in the so-called "effects of the J-curve," despite a decrease in export volumes and an increase in import volumes. Next, let us take a look at trends in export and import volumes with the EU in 1993. Export volume recorded a significant decrease of 14.2 percent owing to effects of the strong yen and drop in exports for commodities such as motor vehicles because of the recession in the EU economy. On the other hand, import volume fell 1.6 percent overall because of a decline in imports of luxury items such as fashion apparel and expensive automobiles. Additionally, in January and February 1994, export volume trends remained the same as in 1993, but import volumes rose. Price-wise, dollar-based export price hikes have been limited to 5.2 percent, but this trend conceivably reflects the effects of a strong yen and the shift of exports from high-priced items to lower-priced items owing to the recession in the EU economy. As a result, exports to the EU on a dollar basis declined substantially by 9.7 percent because of a significant drop on a volume basis while imports declined modestly in terms of volume and price and thus limiting the decline to 3.6 percent. Accordingly, the major decline in trade surplus with the EU in 1993 primarily reflects a major decline in export volume. Importance of Regional Factor Analysis Finally, let us take a look at trends in export and import volumes relative to Asia in 1993. Export volume to Asia increased 7.4 percent including motor vehicles, steel, and visual equipment owing to the favorable economic climate in that area. On the other hand, import volumes rose 6.5 percent because of increased imports of items such as clothing and audiovisual equipment owing to progress in the localization of production. Further, trends for 1993 extended themselves in January and February 1994. Both export and import volumes increased significantly in relation to Asia, but a major contributor to this trend was the active pace of trade with principal constituent regions such as China. A look at export and import volumes in relation to China indicates a favorable Chinese economy in recent times and a conspicuous rise of 37.6 percent in export volume and of 22.3 percent in import volume. Exports to Asia rose sharply by 16.0 percent reflecting a rise in export volume and an 8.0 percent jump in export prices on a dollar basis. On the other hand, imports from Asia rose 8.9 percent reflecting an increase in both volume and prices. Thus, in 1993 the trade surplus with Asia rose to a record high of $53.6 billion to a level surpassing the trade surplus with the United States, but this is a reflection of a climb in export prices based on a strong yen and an increase in export volume that exceeded the growth in import volume. As discussed in the preceding text, trade indices categorized by principal regions enable clarification of foreign trade trends for each region on a volume basis and provide for an analysis of causes in shifts relative to trade surpluses for each region. The procedures enable an appraisal of foreign trade trends which could not be adequately measured on the basis of monetary value trends alone. It is believed that the new index is very effective in providing an accurate appraisal for Japan's trade with principal regions. Further, aside from the principal regions covered in this article, trade indices are published for newly industrializing economies of Asia such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
