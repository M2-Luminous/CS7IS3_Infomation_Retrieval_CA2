FR940513-1-00054 FR940513-1-00013 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION 29 CFR Part 1609 Guidelines on Harassment Based on Race, Color, Religion, Gender, National Origin, Age, or Disability AGENCY: Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The period for commenting on the proposed guidelines on harassment based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, or disability (58 FR 51266, October 1, 1993) has been extended to June 13, 1994. After the comment period closed, the Commission received numerous comments and requests by individuals to submit comments. Since the Commission has informally been accepting and reviewing comments and letters received after the comment period officially closed, it has thus decided to formally extend the comment period in order to give all parties an opportunity to express their views. DATES: Comments must be received by June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to the Office of the Executive Secretariat, EEOC, 10th Floor, 1801 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20507. Copies of comments submitted by the public will be available for review at the Commission's library, room 6502, 1801 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Copies of the notice of proposed rulemaking are available in the following alternative formats: Large print, braille, electronic file on computer disk, and audio tape. Copies may be obtained from the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity by calling (202) 663&hyph;4895 (voice) or (202) 663&hyph;4399 (TDD). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth M.
