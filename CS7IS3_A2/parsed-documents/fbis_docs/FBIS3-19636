Meanwhile, "strange" developments have been taking place two weeks before the elections in that region; the contesting parties have threatened each other several times. Undoubtedly, the most interesting development is the fact that one of the political parties, which had no foothold in southeastern Turkey until a year ago, has become a potential winner. Furthermore, that party has challenged the PKK! The unknown aspects of the strange developments can be explained as follows: Fikri Aksay, Nationalist Action Party [NAP] mayoral candidate for the Diyarbakir metropolis, has said: "No other party exists to rival us here. All the other parties are only on the posters on signboards. Most of them are under the PKK's influence. The people do not trust the other parties. The Motherland Party's candidate expressed his views on the television series known as the 32d Day under PKK's influence. The people have been intimidated by the PKK. The political parties in power do not have any strength in this region. The PKK exists in this region and so does the NAP, which is a pro-state party. I have not been threatened. The PKK is unable to threaten me and my colleagues. It does not dare to do so. We have intimidated the PKK. We have informed the PKK militants that they are finished and that they will no longer be able to roam the mountains because we have arrived in the region." Aksay is convinced that the idealist movement will achieve success in the local elections, not only in Diyarbakir but also in every part of southeastern Turkey, without any exception. Aksay accused his rivals of following in the wake of the PKK and said that the NAP is loyal to the state. Regarding the effort made to end bloodshed in the region, he said that the NAP is the most determined political party in that regard. Of course, Aksay's views have brought up the question of which "horse" the government will bet on in southeastern Turkey. It is a fact that the government moved to convene the Religious Council and underline the view that the "call for prayers cannot be abandoned and the banner has to be kept hoisted" 70 years after the establishment of the Republic in the country. It is also a fact that the government allowed the Prosperity Party to intensify its activities some time ago. It now seems that it has moved to facilitate NAP's initiatives. Is all this an indication that the effort to resolve the problems in southeastern Turkey is only aimed at finding a "military solution?" NAP's Viewpoint: The NAP members are convinced that the Prosperity Party has lost its strength in southeastern Turkey. NAP Deputy Leader Riza Muftuoglu has said that the Prosperity Party will only be an insignificant problem for the NAP because the representatives of the Kurdish citizens in the region have asked the party to help them. Muftuoglu claimed the following: "We are being pressed by the Prosperity Party in various areas. That party is ahead of the NAP in Mus. However, it is behind our party in Bingol. It is losing its strength every day. We could have all of that party's votes if the elections were to be held a month later. We have received very favorable reports from southeastern Turkey. The NAP stands to win the elections in almost all the provinces in the region." [passage omitted] It is true that Turkey is marking the religious festival at the present time. However, is that a sufficient reason for the people in southeastern Turkey to decide to embrace the NAP? Ismet Imset, editor of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS replied to that question as follows: The NAP is supported by only a small group in southeastern Turkey. However, it stands a good chance of winning the elections if the people comply with the PKK's ban and boycott the voting. Stressing that the NAP will take over the mayoralties in at least two provinces, Imset warned that tensions will escalate in that region if the NAP wins in areas in which the Hizbullah groups are strong. Imset also claimed that the NAP is supported by the police organization, the special teams, and several local tribes. The fact that Abdulkerim Tatar, who is the NAP mayoral candidate from Sirnak, is a member of the renowned Tatar Tribe confirms Imset's viewpoint. Tatar has claimed that the NAP is quickly gaining strength in Sirnak and stressed that a move by the PKK to direct pressure against him is out of the question. He also claimed that the PKK threat in Sirnak has nearly disappeared and urged journalists to visit the town to establish the true state of affairs. [passage omitted] The NAP members wholeheartedly trust their party and believe that through its approach the most rational solutions can be found to the problems in southeastern Turkey In fact, they have ignored PKK threats and pressures and seem to have declared a "state of emergency" and "mobilization" for themselves in that region. The NAP mayoral candidate unconditionally support the concept of a "military solution" and maintain the view that the Kurds and the Turks are brothers but terrorists must be given a deserved lesson. Hamza Ugurlu, NAP mayoral candidate in Bitlis, has said that the PKK is an enemy of the Kurds and Turks, who have lived like brothers for many centuries. He described the PKK as a dirty organization that has contaminated the region. [passage omitted] Conditions in the region have made the NAP's grass roots adopt a radical approach. The NAP members have even ignored the murder of the head of the party organization in Genc district some time ago. Ismet Imset and several other observers have warned that tensions will escalate if the NAP mayoral candidate win the elections in the region. They have also claimed that the NAP receives significant support from a number of mechanisms in the state's structure. However, Riza Muftuoglu has refuted that viewpoint and noted that the NAP is supported by the people and not by certain mechanisms in the state's structure. Asserting that the success the NAP will achieve in southeastern Turkey will be a turning point for the country, Muftuoglu argued that certain forces, which wish to obstruct the establishment of tranquillity, are trying to mislead the people on the views of several NAP candidates. [passage omitted] When the situation of the idealists in southeastern Turkey is viewed, the Great Unity Party [GUP], which was established by a group that splintered from the NAP, also has to be considered. Opposed to NAP's support for a radical pro-Turkish and pro-state military solution to the problem in southeastern Turkey, the party will contest the elections in all the provinces in the region, supporting the concept of "the establishment of a civilian community and Islamic brotherhood." The GUP is regarded as the favored political party in several areas. The GUP mayoral candidate in Mus, Sirnak, Bitlis, and Adiyaman are confident that they will win the elections. Compared with NAP mayoral candidates, their approach is not as inflexible and radical. They have said that they have been threatened by the PKK, as have the mayoral candidates of other political parties. However, they stressed that they have ignored the threats. The GUP mayoral candidates are convinced that bloodshed can be avoided with an honest administration and forbearance. [passage omitted] GUP's Viewpoint: GUP leader Muhsin Yazicioglu has said that his party is confident that it will achieve success in the elections in southeastern Turkey and win in Sirnak in particular. He also said that his party will benefit from Islam's uniting nature and try to resolve the PKK problem in the region. The fact that the NAP and GUP have gained strength in southeastern Turkey indicates that balances will change after the local elections on 27 March. The NAP's extreme pro-state and pro-Turkish views, the NAP leader's claim that his party will resolve the PKK problem in southeastern Turkey in six months, and the claims that the NAP is supported by the village guards and state mechanisms have clarified the approach the government has adopted on the Kurdish problem. Nevertheless, the fact that two former NAP mayors, who held office in Bingol prior to the military takeover on 12 September 1980, have been killed has led observers to ask the following: How will the people in southeastern Turkey react to a possible NAP victory in the elections? How will the NAP emerge from the elections in the region? Will bloodshed end if the NAP wins? Will the NAP become an official side in the clash between the state forces and the PKK? Will the PKK use NAP's radical approach to gain advantages in international platforms? The outcome of the elections on 27 March will clarify these questions.
