Nonetheless, he urged Cuban President Fidel Castro to effect a democratic opening in his country. [passage omitted] Wasmosy referred to the situation confronting the Cuban nation: "We are against blockades, but by the same token we request that there be a greater democratic opening in Cuba. Resolutions taken in that country will thereby have more legitimacy." Another issue discussed by the heads of state and government was the "right to life." But no consensus was reached on it in order to draft a joint summit declaration. The subject was discussed on 15 June by Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who in a plenary summit session moved that a unified pronouncement condemning abortion be made. This motion was supported by Wasmosy. Our head of state said: "We protect the right to life. We believe that there is life from the moment an ovum is fertilized. Therefore, pursuant to our religious beliefs and laws, we deem that abortion is a crime." [passage omitted]
