FR941116-2-00133 FR941116-2-00096 The determination of need will be made by analyzing State-level rural poverty and overall poverty rates for youth, ages 16 through 24, youth unemployment, and limited English proficiency levels, using standardized uniform data available through federal agencies, such as 1990 census data, Bureau of Labor Statistics publications, and existing Job Corps centers, slots and locations. In addition to the requirements in the appropriations language, the Department will assess the facilities at proposed sites. The assessment will be in terms of property acquisition costs, the cost and suitability of existing structures and the need for, and cost of, new construction and renovation. Further, the Department will assess each jurisdiction's plan to use State and local resources, both public and private, through contributions/linkages that will reduce the Federal cost of operating a Job Corps center. Such contributions/linkages may include, but are not limited to, the provision of child care services by local jurisdictions, provision of health services, alcohol and drug counseling, referral of eligible youth to Job Corps, and job placement assistance after leaving Job Corps, as well as arrangements with public school systems, community college networks, social service agencies, business and industry, and other training programs to provide such services as classroom training, vocational training, advanced learning opportunities, and co-enrollment arrangements with appropriate JTPA programs. Contributions of this nature will make maximum use of available statewide and community resources in meeting the needs of these youth. Finally, additional points will be awarded for proposed sites located in empowerment zones and enterprise communities in accordance with guidelines in ``Building Communities: Together,'' published by the U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture in the spring of 1994. Under this program, the Federal Government will designate up to 104 areas that meet certain poverty and distress criteria and prepare creative strategic plans for revitalization. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will designate up to six urban Empowerment Zones and 65 Enterprise Communities and the Secretary of Agriculture will designate up to three rural Empowerment Zones and 30 Enterprise Communities. Announcement of these is expected to be made in December 1994. Eligible applicants for proposing sites are units of State and/or local governments. A Federal agency also may propose sites to the extent that such sites are located on public land which is under the jurisdiction of the agency. In addition, proposals submitted by Federal agencies must have the support of appropriate State and local governments. Since Job Corps is primarily a residential program and provides academic education, vocational training, and extensive support services, space and facilities suitable for the following types of utilization are required for a Job Corps center. • Residential_ Adequate housing, including bath and lounge facilities, as well as appropriate administrative space. • Academic Education_ Space for classrooms, computer labs, and library resources. • Vocational Training_ Classroom and shop space to satisfy the needs of specific vocational training areas ( e.g., carpentry, clerical, painting, culinary arts, health education). The configuration of the vocational area, with regard to classroom and shop areas, is determined by the ultimate vocational mix offered at the center. In this regard, heavy trades, such as construction and automotive, require shop areas, while lighter trades, such as clerical and retail sales, require only classroom space. • Food Services_ Cafeteria, including food preparation and food storage areas. • Medical/Dental_ Medical examining rooms, nurses' station, infirmary space for male and female students, and dental facilities. • Recreation_ Gymnasium/multi-purpose recreational facility and large, level outdoor area. • Administration_ General office and conference space.
