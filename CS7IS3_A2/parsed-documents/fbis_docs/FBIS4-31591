It is clear to everybody who has read the text that the leader mentioned there must be in the Srpska republic as it is at war," it is said in the statement by the Serbian Radical Party of Montenegro. ``Is it possible that the Yugoslav president does not know the reasons for the war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the reasons for not ending the war and for not establishing peace? He clumsily expressed his annoyance, as well as the annoyance of millions of Yugoslavs, with the fact that the civil war in Bosnia, because of which people are still being killed and suffering, is still going on. ``When it is known what the world wants from the Serbs in general and particularly from those in the Srpska republic, it is particularly inappropriate that the head of the Yugoslav federation directly accuses heroic Serbian leaders, saying that the war continues due their leadership ambitions. An insult to them is also an insult to the suffering and decimated people of the Srpska republic. "Serbian leaders can immediately decide to end the war, albeit to do so means accepting the blackmail and giving Bosnia-Herzegovina over to Alija Izetbegovic. The sanctions on Yugoslavia would then be lifted, but the Serbian people would also end the centuries-old dream of a joint state, which has already been created. However, the Serbian people would also be left without respect and dignity, and the future generations of Serbs would be ashamed of our generation for deciding on a road of humiliation out of selfishness. We hope that this was only a momentary weakness of Mr. Lilic's and that the real leaders of the Serbian people think differently," the Montenegrin Radicals point out.
