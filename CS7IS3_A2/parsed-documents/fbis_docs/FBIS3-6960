The committees also looked into the security situation as North Korea threatened war after rupturing the inter-Korean contact last Saturday, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) referred the nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions. "In case North Korea changes its posture in order to avoid U.N. sanctions, the Kim administration will map out active measures to take the initiative on inter-Korean problems," Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok told the Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee. Yi, also minister of the National Unification Board, said he will monitor North Korea's reaction to discussions at the U.N. Security Council. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said the key to resolving the nuclear question lies in either U.N. sanctions or securing China's cooperation. The government is expected to make a strong push for Chinese cooperation when President Kim visits Beijing next week, Han said. "If North Korea determines that there is no possibility of improving its relations with the United States, it may take drastic action," Han said. "It is necessary to maintain a channel of dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang." But as long as North Korea fails to honor its promises, there will be no third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, Han said. Neither South Korea nor the United States intends to compromise on the basic issues with North Korea, Han said. The foreign minister also said the world community should refrain from adopting an emotional hard-line stance against Pyongyang that could backfire. U.N. Security Council sanctions should be applied in stages, Han added. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae told the National Defense Committee that South Korea and the United States are currently negotiating the timing of the joint military exercise Team Spirit. Dates in late April, mid-May or sometime after June were mentioned, according to Yi. "Since North Korea could not satisfy the two conditions for the suspension of Team Spirit, the resumption of the exercise this year is unavoidable," Yi said. Practical military maneuvers such as river crossings and emergency landings will be added to the annual Team Spirit to realize the participation of the fewest troops for maximum effect, Yi said. The Patriot anti-missile missiles, soon to be deployed by the U.S. Forces in Korea, will also be used in the exercise, he said. One Patriot missile battalion is capable of taking on 55 incoming enemy aircraft, Yi said, adding that "its ability to destroy Scud missiles in the air is an additional function." Yi said Seoul and Washington will determine the dates for Team Spirit with maximum training and demonstrative effects in mind. He said the military also hopes to avoid busy farming periods. Once the two countries announce the resumption of the war games, it would be difficult to turn back, he said. The defense minister said, "there are no signs that North Korea will launch a provocation within a short period of time." "But we cannot rule out the possibility if the U.N. Security Council starts deliberating sanctions," he added. In order to prepare for all eventualities, the government is working out measures in two stages -- one before and the other after the U.N. Security Council decides on sanctions, Yi said. In the first stage, the Armed Forces will strengthen surveillance, hold regular meetings of the South Korean-U.S. Military Committee, report on strategy to the commander of the allied forces and request that part of a rapid reaction force be deployed, he said. Moreover, Yi said he will urge the government to request the United Nations to build up its deterrent potential, he said.
