Our prime minister is taking a step in the right direction by dismissing plans to hold direct talks with India. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in her speech to the Kashmir Committee that she will not fall prey to any kind of expedient move. This dispute is a life and death issue for Pakistan and the government will use all its resources to resolve this issue according to the UN resolutions and the desire of the people. She told the nation, "No power in the world can stop us from helping the Kashmiri people. Kashmir is burning and we cannot leave it alone. We must stop the Indian atrocities. Kashmir is not only our heritage but also our history." She further said that Pakistan will gave examples of human rights violations in occupied Kashmir to the UN Human Rights Commission. "I will present the case of Kashmir to the Human Rights Commission personally. Our efforts are aimed at making the world aware of this problem and wakening the world conscience." We know that at times the world opinion is full of double standards. However, we must continue our political, diplomatic, and moral efforts in this changing world. We are sure that in the long run these efforts will bear fruit and Kashmir will win its right to self-determination." The prime minister's decision makes it clear that the government is determined to talk about the Kashmir issue on every platform and its stand on this issue is correct, solid, and clear. The year 1994 can be a very important year for Kashmir. This is the final round of struggle for independence in occupied Kashmir. All Kashmiris are willing to embrace death and the people are supporting the freedom fighters. This was related by U.S. correspondent Martin Sugarman after spending one month in occupied Kashmir. Despite strict restrictions on journalists in Kashmir by the Indian security forces, Martin Sugarman traveled the valley extensively as a tourist. He said that there is no other example in the world of what is happening in occupied Kashmir. The people are totally unarmed and have risen against the third largest military force in the world. No outside hand is behind this freedom struggle. He said that calling their struggle foreign interference is an insult to the Kashmiri people. He said that India was not willing to permit any human rights organization or journalists to observe its dirty game. He had gone there as a tourist and had to be very careful during his one month's visit there. Three Iranian journalists who were in occupied Kashmir as tourists were caught by the security forces. These three died during interrogation by the security forces. A large number of British Parliamentarians assured their support for self-determination to the Kashmiris and ending Indian atrocities there. They have expressed their determination to raise the Kashmir issue in the Parliament. They had made this announcement while addressing the university where Sultan Mehmood Chowdhery, leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, works. Rogers Godsave, chairman of All Parties Kashmir Parliamentary Committee, has assured that 60 members of his committee will continue to support the Kashmiri people in the British Parliament. These statements make it clear that the whole world feels the need to resolve the Kashmir issue and the world opinion is against the atrocities India is committing there. Even India's friend, Russia, has expressed a similar reaction. Russian President Boris Yeltsin had expressed concern over human rights violations in occupied Kashmir in a letter to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and has asked India to solve this problem equitably. Even India's friends that support it over Kashmir are pressuring India not to delay an impartial resolution of this problem. The Indian security forces are involved in such hair-raising crimes as killing innocent Kashmiris, burning houses, and mass rape under the pretext of implementing the Public Security Act and the Terrorism Control Act. These incidents have shaken up the international conscience and are being condemned everywhere. All nations in the world and international human rights organizations are aware of this "Indian bestiality" and are raising voice against human rights violations and torture committed on Kashmiri people. Each passing minute sees increase in the volume in this voice. The whole world is aware and actively asking to accelerate efforts to solve this problem. Indian actions are condemned by the whole world. India cannot face this international pressure for long as India is already isolated in the international community. Even public opinion in India is changing. The thoughtful press there and Inderjit Gupta, a prominent Indian parliamentarian, have expressed their opinion against the Indian actions in occupied Kashmir. The Indian people have begun to question why are they fighting a losing war in Kashmir. The Indian people believe that their government's policy is not right. In addition, according to an Indian estimate, India is spending 180 to 200 million rupees per day in Siachen at a time when the people are dying of hunger on footpaths and streets. The Indian economy has deteriorated. The Indian armed forces have lost their fortitude and an army without fortitude cannot win. Therefore, India should forget that it can control Kashmir with the army for long. The sooner India agrees to resolve the Kashmir issue according to the UN resolutions, the better it would be for India itself. The present situation is very dangerous to India's internal stability and security. Kashmir has become the worst example of atrocious actions and human rights violations. According to the reports issued by the Amnesty International, Asia Watch, and other human rights organizations, 30,698 Kashmiris have been killed between January 1992 and September 1993. Four thousand three hundred and eighty incidents of rapes have been recorded. Extreme torture has resulted in the death of 4,574 persons. In addition to this all, more than 40,000 persons are in various jails and an equal number is missing. However, the brave Kashmiris are still fighting. The Kashmiri freedom fighters have opened a new chapter on 9 January 1994 in the history of their four year struggle. They attacked the radio system complex at the Avantipura airport in southern Kashmir and killed nine Indian airmen and officers. This was the first time that Kashmiri freedom fighters had entered a sensitive military zone and returned without any casualties after killing nine Indian soldiers. High Indian officials and military officers were greatly perturbed by this incident. The Indian defense forces have declared this incident to be very threatening. According to news received from Jammu, the Kashmiri freedom fighters took a light machine gun, a sten gun, five self-loading rifles, and a wireless set from the Indian ordinance storage. This incident is a new development in the struggle of Kashmiri freedom fighters and points to the new turn their efforts have taken. The Kashmiri freedom fighters have given a warning to the Indian government and high-level military officials through this attack on the Indian air base to stop crossing all the limits of atrocities, think about the consequences, and protect themselves from the vengeful activities of the freedom fighters. India has also started "aggression" in the areas bordering Azad Kashmir. At the same time, it is threatening Pakistan with a war. This situation is dangerous for peace in South Asia and the international community should take immediate notice of it. It should not only increase pressure on India to resolve the Kashmir issue, but also announce through the United States, Russia, Great Britain, France, and other major world powers that economic defense and space air space restriction would be imposed against India. The Kashmir situation has reached a point where war between India and Pakistan could erupt any time. If this war starts, we cannot say what horrible results this continent and the world will face. *
