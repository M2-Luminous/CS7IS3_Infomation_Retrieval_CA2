It is also stressed in the statement that no international-law agreement concluded by Georgia's leadership has either anything to do with Abkhazia or is valid on its territory. Observers believe such a statement has appeared now because the Georgian leaders have stepped up their foreign policy activities and signed on behalf of Georgia, as a single state, a number of interstate agreements.
