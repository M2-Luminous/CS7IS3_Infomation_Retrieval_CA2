U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, who visited Japan to urge the Japanese to make a political decision, met on 2 February with Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, and Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], but their meeting appears to have failed to produce any agreement. The negotiations on the three priority sectors of automobiles-auto parts, government procurement, and insurance are set to be concluded prior to the Japan-U.S. summit. With the summit 10 days away, however, no way is seen to break the deadlock in the negotiations. The Government's Situation The meeting between Foreign Minister Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Kantor at the Foreign Ministry lasted one and a half hours longer than scheduled. A meeting between Finance Minister Fujii and U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has been deferred until later. A Finance Ministry official angrily said, "We managed to arrange a meeting for them despite our minister's busy schedule, but he did not show up." Originally, the Japanese were in no mood to welcome Kantor's visit, saying: "Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are to be concluded at vice ministerial talks. It is hard for us to do anything even if he presses us." A senior MITI official emphatically told a group of reporters on the evening of 1 February that "I hope he will meet with people he wants to meet and then put forth a new policy after returning to the United States." The U.S. has not hidden its aim that Mr. Kantor was sent to Japan to lobby Prime Minister Hosokawa and cabinet ministers for Japanese trade concessions over the heads of Japanese bureaucrats who are still poised to "reject the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets." Japanese bureaucrats are fully confident of dealing with Mr. Kantor, saying, "He will only confirm that Japanese Cabinet ministers and bureaucrats share the same view." Of the three priority sectors of the government procurement of telecommunications gear and medical instruments, automobiles-auto parts, and insurance, the negotiations on the automobiles and auto parts have been deadlocked and no way is in sight to break the deadlock. It was once observed that "the Japanese side will try to settle the negotiations by asking Japanese automakers to work out plans to increase their purchase of foreign auto parts," but MITI, in charge of the negotiations, still sticks to its tough attitude against asking Japanese automakers to do so, saying, "We cannot ask Japanese automakers to work out plans that may be transformed into numerical targets." The present situation is that even if the Japanese Government decides to concede to U.S. trade demands, Japanese enterprises could not accept such a decision. The Japanese automobile industry, which is beset with unprecedented sluggish sales and the restored competitiveness of the American automobile industry, is in a situation where it cannot satisfy the U.S. demand for increased purchases of American-made auto parts. A senior MITI official says, "Even if aides to the prime minister instruct Japanese automakers to seek a compromise, they cannot move at all." The "bureaucrats" closet themselves in shells only awaiting concessions from the U.S. The Situation of Politics At a 30 January meeting with Toyota Motor Corporation President Shoichiro Toyoda and other business leaders, Prime Minister Hosokawa showed his irritation with the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks that have continued to face rough sailing, saying: "It seems that bureaucrats from the two countries have failed to smooth over their differences in the talks." The prime minister appears to have made the statement in response to the U.S. criticism that "the Japanese bureaucrats do not understand Prime Minister Hosokawa's aims for reform." Officials close to the prime minister have yet to fashion a blueprint for the prime minister to make a political decision. Good prospects are seen for mapping out a new package of stimulus measures that will be high on the agenda of the upcoming Japan-U.S. summit and this is the only bright factor. Commenting on the negotiations in the individual sector, MITI Minister Kumagai has said: "The Hosokawa government's policy is that it will reduce its intervention in enterprises' economic activities." As a result, it would be hard for Prime Minister Hosokawa to resort to a "political decision," which has been used as a stereotyped means in past negotiations with the United States. As for the negotiations that are entering an impasse, the Foreign Ministry has begun saying in an irritated tone: "An accord should be reached in one way or another at the upcoming Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February. We do not care about Japanese bureaucrats being criticized as villains if the United States is satisfied." Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, who is in Tokyo on a temporary visit, reported on 1 February to the prime minister that "although the U.S. Government has a good impression of the Hosokawa government, it is tough in the negotiations with Japan." The above-mentioned senior MITI official said: "We are a little bit concerned how Mr. Kuriyama explained this to the prime minister." Delicate domestic negotiations have already begun.
