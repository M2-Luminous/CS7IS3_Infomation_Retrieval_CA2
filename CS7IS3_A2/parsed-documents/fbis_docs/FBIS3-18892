You have reacted cautiously. Beniamino Andreatta, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has said, at last. Have you spoken to each other? [Fabbri] No, we have not spoken recently, but I see no substantial or fundamental differences between Fabbri and Andreatta. [Correspondent] And so his "at last," and your caution are the same thing? [Fabbri] We ought to review the facts. We are still not facing a request from the United Nations. Up until now, the United Nations has had a rule discouraging countries bordering the former Yugoslavia from participating. [Correspondent] Do you know whether or not this UN rule which forbids or discourages the intervention of forces from neighboring countries has been violated? [Fabbri] I do not think there have been departures from this rule, and I think that the United Nations should reflect because once this rule has been violated then the rule has no validity anymore anywhere in the world. [Correspondent] Then this would be the first time? [Fabbri] Yes, it would be when it happened and the result of a choice, a very important deliberate choice. [Correspondent] If the United Nations were to request this, are you ready? [Fabbri] In principle, we have already been ready to respond to all UN requests. We have done so in Somalia and Mozambique. Personally, I am convinced that a country's prestige depends, to a large extent, on its capacity to respond to these requests. In the matter under discussion the decision is still mainly to be made at the United Nations. [Correspondent] If the United Nations calls, Italy responds. This is the point? [Fabbri] Italy will study the problem. It will see... [Correspondent, interrupting] Have you discussed it? [Fabbri] For example, I would have no doubts about intervening on the ground once a peace agreement had been reached between the sides, if this were the situation. If, for example, one of the sides in the conflict was not in agreement, then this is an assessment that the United Nations has to make beforehand. [sentence as heard] Therefore, that is why it is too early to talk about this. [Correspondent] But would the first to go be the San Marco or the Folgore regiments? Have you discussed this or is it still too early? [Fabbri] No, we have not discussed this because, if you want my personal opinion, the United Nations, for reasons of convenience, taking into account constitutional matters, should not request this. [Correspondent] Is this also because elections are to be held in Italy? [Fabbri] This is a condition which the United Nations must take into account. There is a dissolved parliament. It would be difficult to undertake such a delicate mission, considering the historic precedents and the geographical position without a parliamentary vote. [Correspondent] And this is one of the reasons for your caution? [Fabbri] It is one of the reasons for my caution and above all a reason which the United Nations cannot fail but take into account. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] At present, the Armed Forces -- we saw this in the report before this interview -- have a great presence. They also have prestige abroad and at home. Is there a risk that the country is being militarized? [Fabbri] Not at all. [Correspondent] But is there a danger of a coup d'etat? We have heard about such things recently. [Fabbri] These rumors have no foundation. The Armed Forces are a healthy organ of the nation -- security for the country, not a danger. [Correspondent] Were reports on an attack on the Saxa Rubra radio and TV installations an invention or part of a destabilizing game? [Fabbri] I would call this the Saxa Rubra farce because the investigators themselves say that the organizers ordered an atomic submarine and 50 F-16's by fax. Think about it: Because of a lack of resources we have been unable to lease 24 British Tornados. Therefore, this was a subversive idea which could not be carried out and was the fruit of the ideas of a group of confused or excited people. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] So you can confirm that there is no danger of a coup d'etat in Italy? [Fabbri] Absolutely none. Even to hypothesize about one is a mistake, because there is no possible foundation, no link between any lunatics who think about carrying out a coup by taking over RAI and bombing parliament with nerve gas and the activities of the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces are loyal and faithful to the Constitution. Soldiers die for being faithful to the oath of loyalty which they have made to the state. [Correspondent] Thank you.
