Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein, written in the first third of the last century. This dead mechanism is more "alive" today than ever. The established political class has moved too far away from humanness, adopted dictatorial practices, and only knows one objective: survival at any price, even at the price of the decline of its own people: apres nous le deluge [after us the deluge]! Have we learned something from the historical catastrophe that was the result of a Nazi regime gone hubristic? Maybe that we walk upright? I have experienced the Third Reich fully aware of what it was, so I allow myself to compare it with other systems, and I claim that the people who lived at that time had a higher degree of personal courage than the present generation. Moreover, one must take into account that resistance in those unfortunate 12 years not only meant restrictions or even the loss of one's civil existence, but that quite frequently it even lead to death. We Republikaners are filled with great pride that a man such as resistance fighter Hans Hirzel, member of the "White Rose," has found his political home in our party. What legitimizes those who were born later to condemn those who were maneuvered into a bitter time by fate? The regime was criminal, but the people who lived under it were not. They were victims of a megalomania that covered up its real intentions very well at the beginning. However, they were also victims of the failure of the parties in the Weimar Republic. Those who, today, want to spare the FRG the fate of Weimar, and who want to save our people from another moral and cultural decline, have to go to the roots and not just treat the symptoms. The renewal and consolidation of democracy must be everyone's cause and not be left only to those who call themselves representatives of the people, and who frequently only represent interests of their own or of certain groupings. Petitions for referenda and referenda must be rated more highly. The watering down of traditional links and values must end, liberalism must not be confounded with libertinism. The harmful influence of the American way of life, which is characterized by success-based thinking at any price, must be forced back. These influences are particularly strong in the sphere of movies, radio, and television. The struggle for audience rating eliminates the last ethical and moral scruples. Women are made the object of lusty craving, degraded into merchandise and cheap labeled articles. The sexual act is exhibited on the screen, just like that between apes in a zoo, in all its varieties and deviations. While Africa is putting on clothes and listening to Mozart, we are taking off clothes and discovering the particular artistic value of the bush drum. Even children are harnessed to the cart of the advertising industry and confronted day after day with the representation of violence of the worst kind. Such representations seduce people into imitating them, and we citizens even promote these activities by paying excessively high fees. One has to think intensively about abolishing these fees. The churches bear a great part of the blame for the moral decline. They subject themselves almost unconditionally to the zeitgeist to deviate attention from their failure in the Third Reich. Here it is also true that churchmen showed more backbone in the Nazi state than their successors do now. I would like to mention Cardinal von Galen or Pastor Niemoeller in this connection. I am of the opinion that the spying activities of Manfred Stolpe, the current minister president of Brandenburg and Evangelical churchman, must be regarded as worse than the divisive and ingratiating attitude of the then "Reichbishop" Mueller in the Third Reich. Mueller acted openly, while Stolpe was spying behind people's backs. We Republikaners are in favor of the separation of Church and State. What Frederick the Great said is valid for us, namely that each may be saved after his own fashion. Where is the Christian way of doing things of political pastors from Hintze to Thierse? As we can see, even for somebody like Mr. Hintze a lie is a "bourgeois prejudice" -- just as it was for Lenin. The church tax has favored this moral degeneration. Church servants have become church earners. Moral regeneration of the churches will only be possible when they go back to the status of the early Christians, when they renew themselves in the catacombs, so to speak. Even many years before Bluem, who ultimately caved in anyway, we requested that the church tax not be levied by means of the state. Besides, we regard it as legitimate to hold a referendum on whether the church tax makes sense or does not. What must also be exposed is the hypocrisy, particularly in the case of "Christian" politicians, who are least qualified to moralize. In my former capacity as a journalist I repeatedly had the experience that the first thing leading Christian Social Union officials did once they arrived at their destination on an official visit was to ask for the address of a brothel, and then they exchanged their "experiences" with a twinkle in their eyes. They are the same politicians who appeared with their entire families at Catholic Church or Evangelical Academy receptions, effectively displaying their deep piety in public. If we Republikaners were to strike back with the same instruments the established parties and their foundations are using against us, I would guarantee the moral "decapitation" of quite a few Christian politicians and even Catholic dignitaries, who clandestinely live in pseudomarital conditions, while calling from their pulpits for compliance with the Church's commandments. We are all human beings. And who will throw the first stone? We will not! We will not even throw back the stones that bear a signature and are aimed at us. We want an open exchange but will not hit below the belt. We have political opponents but not enemies. If a politician like Mr. Stoiber says the "enemy stands at the right," then this proves, first, that he does not know the first thing about the rules of the game of democracy and, second, that in order to stay in power he is capable of doing anything. After all, as everybody knows, he is determined to conduct the election campaign with ideas right of center. Let us not deceive ourselves. Even our party is not yet everywhere in the best possible shape necessary to credibly represent our causes. Self-criticism must not become a foreign word for us. Our program is good. We must manage to bring our program and members to one level everywhere. The year 1994 is the year of decision -- not only for our party, but also for our people. The zeitgeist is abdicating; it has no more money. That gives us a chance! Let us do everything we can to make sure people cannot say at the end of the year: tried and found wanting! I believe in our success!
