The spokesman made the above statement when he was asked about the government's comment regarding the confession of the Kurdish fighter who was tortured by Turkish authorities into saying that he had been trained at a camp for terrorists in Greece. Venizelos underlined once again that our country will not contribute to the effort to cultivate false tension. We call on Turkey, the spokesman said, to stop implicating Greece in its internal problems. The Greek state authority, Venizelos stressed, controls the whole of its territory which is open and accessible to everyone, especially to journalists. Finally, the government spokesman expressed the government's regret for the confirmation of brutal violation of human rights, such as in the case of detained persons subjected to torture to sign forged confessions.
