This is said by Erling Stranden, who is the director of the Department for Preparedness and Security at the National Radiation Protection Board. Stranden says that it is not inconceivable that the thieves who stole three fuel rods from military storage in Murmansk either have smuggled the stolen goods out through Finnmark or that they will try to do so. ``Norway could definitely be part of a smuggling route,'' he says. Thomas Nilsen from Bellona, having worked with nuclear threats in the north for many years, agrees: ``Inspection at the border crossing at Storskog should be considerably improved. I have crossed the border about 40 times since 1988. My luggage has never been inspected; either on the Norwegian or on the Russian side. According to our sources it has been possible for a long time to buy different types of radioactive materials on the streets of Murmansk. Almost anything can be obtained at Kola as long as one has dollars. As customers for these kinds of materials are found in other countries, it is probable that Norway will be part of a smuggling route,'' Nilsen says. Easy To Smuggle Last night it became clear that the three fuel rods are 1 meter long and have a diameter of 5-6 cm. They are unused and were to be used in the reactor of one of the many nuclear submarines at Kola. It is thought to be a simple affair to transport three such metal pipes without being discovered. As the rods are unused, radiation is minimal. They are therefore relatively harmless to the thieves, as well as unsuitable as a terrorist weapon. Used rods could have been dumped in sources of drinking water, and so on, and poisonous plutonium, strontium, and cesium would have caused enormous damage. But as these three rods are unused, they are relatively harmless. They contain mainly highly enriched uranium. Even with a geiger counter the rods would be hard to detect. Departmental Director Stranden at the National Radiation Protection Board says that it would hardly be noticeable on the geiger counter if measured from the outside of a car that had the rods in the trunk. ``However, had a customs inspector found the three suspect metal tubes and measured them directly, the radiation would have been noticeable,'' Stranden says. Consul General Knut Hauge in Murmansk thinks there is no immediate reason to fear that Norway will become a transit country for stolen Russian nuclear equipment: ``We must of course be prepared, but the control at the Norwegian-Russian border is, in my opinion, so good that this route is probably not the most attractive one out of Russia,'' Hauge says. Good for Bombs As the three fuel rods were to be used in nuclear submarines, the uranium in the rods is probably highly enriched--up to 90 percent. That makes the uranium suitable for bomb production. To make even a small nuclear bomb, however, 5 to 10 kilos of uranium is needed. The three short rods are not big enough to contain that much. Russian authorities have not disclosed how much uranium the rods contained. Sources within nuclear circles in Murmansk yesterday afternoon informed the Norwegian consulate general in that city that since the rods are unused, it is unthinkable that they can be used for terrorist purposes. However, the uranium can be extracted from the rods and be used, for instance to produce bombs, according to Russian sources. Stranden agrees: ``Even though there is not enough uranium in these rods to make a bomb, it could be a first step for countries wanting to develop nuclear arms. We know there are nations having the technology and knowledge to make bombs, but which lack highly enriched materials,'' Stranden says to AFTENPOSTEN. Planned Theft The theft was discovered in the middle of the day on 27 November in connection with a routine control. Police in Murmansk so far do not know anything further as to when the rods were stolen, but have asked for help from the public. The rods were stolen from a storage facility at the military Rosta shipyard in the northern Lenin area of Murmansk. According to Hauge the police in Murmansk take it as a given that this was a theft to order. ``The thieves obviously knew what they were looking for, and according to the police, they were familiar with the shipyard,'' he says. The fact that the police are asking for help in a military theft is regarded as sensational. Spokesmen for the National Radiation Protection Board in Norway, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others reiterated yesterday how frightening it is that such a theft can happen. ``But we had to take into account that such things might happen in today's Russia,'' says spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ingvard Havnen. When the Soviet Union collapsed, much of government control disappeared. At the same time much of the control of Russia's many nuclear installations disappeared. As late as two to three weeks ago a couple of kilos of Russian uranium was discovered by Turkish police. And just over a week ago fuel rods were stolen from the Ignalina power plant in Lithuania. Nilsen thinks that the danger of radioactive materials falling into the hands of terrorists or others with no legitimate reason to possess them pose a greater security risk in the north than the nuclear reactors themselves. He refers to many episodes on the Kola peninsula as proof that security measures are terrible. In 1992 KGB agents carried out an arranged ``attack'' against the nuclear icebreaker Sibir at the Murmansk docks. The agents were able to get as far as to the reactor section before they were discovered. The KGB did this to show how poor nuclear security in the country has become. In the same year a Russian television journalist was able to smuggle 200 grams of cesium out of Atomflot, the icebreaker base in Murmansk. This comes in addition to small fires in nuclear submarines and near accidents at the nuclear power plant in Kola. Nilsen also refers to the two occasions when he visited this nuclear power plant: ``Both times we were shown around deep down in the reactor areas and in the important control rooms without anyone checking our luggage.'' No Fuss in Murmansk The nuclear theft has not frightened the city's inhabitants. Yesterday morning the city's people could read an announcement in the local paper that three fuel rods had been discovered stolen from a storage area in town last Saturday. It further announced that an investigating committee had been formed consisting of 18 people, from the military prosecuting authorities, from the counter espionage groups, and from the police respectively. A special telephone number for tips to the police was established for this purpose. Hauge in Murmansk says that nobody in the city is concerned about such matters as long as there is no danger of an increase in radiation in the near vicinity. ``It was not even mentioned in the local news this evening. I have tried all day to call the police using the published hot-line number, but nobody answered,'' Hauge said last night.
