In the recent government reorganization, the name of the Trade Bureau changed from Commercial Trade Bureau and, with this change, the bureau has yielded its leading position among all the bureaus of the ministry to the International Trade Policy Bureau. Nevertheless, the Trade Bureau, and its export promotion section in particular, is still regarded as the cream of MOTIE. In the days when "building an export-oriented state" was a catchphrase, the Trade Bureau racked its brains to map out export strategies. For anyone seeking to make his way as a trade and industry bureaucrat, this bureau was the gateway he had to go through to get on the "elite track." The elite bureaucrats in MOTIE who have passed through this gate during the past several decades proudly recall the hard times they went through and the exploits they performed during their service with the Trade Bureau as the most glorious part of their "career." Even now the finest talent in this ministry are drawn into the export promotion section. But this section, the veritable command post for the nation's export and import business, does not have on hand much statistical data that are essential to keep abreast of the trends of world trade. [passage omitted] Employees of MOTIE's export promotion section get such data from the Korean Traders Association or the Korean Trade Promotion Corporation. They need the help of the Bank of Korea, the Korea Development Institute, the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, and other semi-government research institutes for information on the domestic and international economic trends they need in working out export measures. In a word, they are fighting in the battlefield of world trade without even a single military map. [passage omitted] When it comes to various research materials on exports and imports published by world organizations or academic institutions, the situation is all the more deplorable. These materials are almost beyond MOTIE's reach in most cases. Says a young grade 5 official: "When we request a budget allocation to get those materials stressing that we cannot do without them, we are turned down in most cases. The reason given is that there are not enough budgetary resources. The section which is supposed to have overall charge of imports and exports does not have the latest research materials, and even the most basic statistical materials for that matter, to consult when it wants to check on the current and future trends in trade. It has to beg other organizations for them. Naturally, the section's analytic ability is weak. Under these circumstances, how do you expect to create conditions conducive to widening our horizon?" The young official laments that his organization is apt to be "information-blind" when it has little opportunity to keep abreast of (or get materials on) the cultures of advanced countries. The slogan "internationalization" has become a buzzword of our time uttered even by children. This slogan began to spread late last year at the initiative of senior officials and the press. President Kim Yong-sam set forth internationalization as a major goal of our government for this year. The Administration is in step with this policy. A government-wide campaign to remodel the mindset toward the economy is under way in gear with the campaign for internationalization. Ministries are vying with each other to have their employees revamp their way of thinking through retraining courses offered on a commission basis by private corporations reputed to be leaders in internationalization. Reflecting the definition that internationalization in its narrower sense means "economic internationalization," economic ministries are more active in their efforts for internationalization than others. Under the policy of modernizing economic structures, deregulation is under way in all areas as if it were the "order of the day," with each ministry mapping out diversified strategies for internationalization. However, many critics are skeptical about the role and function of the government in leading the internationalization drive. To begin with, there is controversy over the concept. But internationalization is of great significance as a strategic means for national survival in the age of a borderless economic war. To survive in the age of a global village, we should exert an effort to adapt our way of thinking and systems to international changes and elevate them to advanced international standards from a national strategic point of view. To adapt ourselves to the changing international situation and to survive in it, it is imperative to do away with ultranationalism and isolationist practices and search for the loftier common good of the world and accept it on our own. This idea holds good as the concept of internationalization. From this point of view, the role of the government as the steward of the national economy should be highlighted. The private sector is the runner, but it is the duty of the government to make it run well. Under an incompetent and uninformed government, the private sector--the command post of the borderless war--would sink in the high tide of opening up to the outside world, directly endangering the very survival and prosperity of the country. If any regulation is binding the hands and feet of private enterprises and making them powerless in the borderless economic war, the government should lose no time in easing such regulation; and when obstacles stand in the way of our enterprises in their efforts for internationalization, it should actively remove them. [passage omitted] In fact, economic laws and systems have been established and have operated as if their purpose were to block rather than stimulate free business activity. In the name of protecting our industry, the government imposed so many cumbersome conditions on foreign firms trying to enter our market that foreigners brand Korea as "a country with the worst investment conditions." [passage omitted] Some critics go so far as to brand our government a "force resisting internationalization." This criticism is directed at the state of affairs in which the government, instead of leading the effort to revamp outmoded systems and ease various regulatory controls, is playing only a passive role, unable to free itself from isolationist thinking. In some quarters there is a manifestation of the extreme distrust that officials are fettered so much by departmental egoism that they are reluctant to deregulate, or they are concerned so much about their job security that they are absorbed in devising still more controls. Of all government organizations, the economic ministries, such as the Economic Planning Board (regarded as the originator for all economic policies), the Ministry of Finance [MOF], and MOTIE become the main target of criticism whenever internationalization becomes an issue. This is because when we hold "economic internationalization" or "the internationalization of policy" as the cardinal point, these ministries are the principal agents in implementing internationalization policy. Objectively, it is valid to say that the economic ministries have a better sense of internationalization than others. For one thing, these ministries are crowded with the elites who passed the difficult higher civil service examination, and by the nature of their business they have had ample opportunity to come into contact with developments abroad in the age of the global economy. Yet they remain the target of criticism because they are not playing a positive role in the vanguard of the drive for "economic internationalization." True, underlying this criticism is the view--and the eager expectation based on it--that the success of internationalization depends on the efforts of the economic ministries to remake themselves. Before determining why they are being criticized as "a backward group in the internationalization drive," we should first examine their objective conditions. We cannot categorically condemn economic bureaucrats, for quite a lot of them are working hard in their own way with a sense of duty to the state. [passage omitted] The stark realities of absurdly low government salaries compared with those in private firms, and the ever- increasing jam in personnel appointments are far more serious than the general public thinks. The economic administrative bureaucracy is regarded as an elite group among all classes of our society. These outstanding people huddle together all night mapping out national policies. But one wonders why these ministries are regarded as backward when it comes to internationalization. Each official is outstanding individually, but as a group the ministries are not. This proves that their organization has internal structural flaws. It is no exaggeration to say that the nature of the bureaucracy and its inefficiency are principal factors impeding the internationalization of the government organization and its devoted personnel. The climate that causes "information blindness," and the kind of customary practices in MOTIE's export promotion section cited above are points worthy of note. [passage omitted] Private enterprises are constantly making efforts to adapt to changes by giving full play to their creativeness. But the bureaucracy still hangs on to old ways when the country was in the initial stage of a development-oriented economy. In this age of radical change, the gap between "running enterprises" and the "crawling bureaucracy" is bound to widen. Economic bureaucrats argue that their ministries were ahead of private business in internationalization until the mid- 1980's. "In the early 1980's it was easier for the economic ministries than for other ministries to obtain foreign data and meet with foreign businessmen and collect information from them. But with the arrival of the period of surplus balance of payments in the mid-1980's, private enterprises began to turn their eyes overseas relying on the know-how and resources they had accumulated." Says a section chief in the Economic Planning Board: "Those enterprises which previously depended chiefly on government assistance in export-import activities now began to speed up the pace in setting up overseas branches and to dispatch their employees for on-the-spot training overseas, thereby making themselves internationalization-minded." While doing business overseas, they gained access to information and were able to turn out a large number of personnel versed in the languages of their host countries. As a consequence they naturally had ample opportunity to get accustomed to the way of thinking and behavior of foreigners and the cultures of advanced countries. On the contrary, bureaucrats complain that they could find relatively little opportunity to get in touch with the advanced cultures partly because of budgetary constraints and partly because of the public sentiment that "looks askance at government employees traveling abroad." Argues a grade 5 MOF official: "Government employees often talk about internationalization. But what other sources of knowledge on internationalization do you think they have except papers written by domestic scholars and newspaper articles? They have little opportunity to travel abroad, much less to train overseas and get accustomed to foreign lands and people. Under these circumstances, it seems too much to demand that they get rid of their narrow outlook." The above explanation of why the bureaucrat lags behind big private corporations in awareness of internationalization is valid to some extent. Samsung, which ranks at the top among our big business groups, has sent hundreds of its employees abroad at its expense each year for the past several years. Needless to say, this is patterned after the management style of advanced Japanese enterprises. But certainly, it is a radical idea. Now many other firms are following suit? When these corporations send employees abroad, they encourage them to get acquainted with as many people in their host countries as possible and learn their customs, without worrying about the company business. Our firms have come up with the idea that going abroad and adapting oneself to the culture of the host country will in itself provide an opportunity to cultivate an international sense. This is proof that our corporations are adroitly taking measures to promote "the internationalization of human resources," and through it "the internationalization of ability." What about the bureaucracy? In a word the climate of our officialdom is keeping its members ignorant of what is going on in the outside world. While private firms are actively sending employees abroad for work or study at company expense, the government--because of all kinds of restrictions--fails to provide an adequate opportunity for its employees to go abroad. Private citizens have been free to travel abroad since the mid-1980's when the government liberalized foreign travel restrictions. But for government employees, foreign travel is still beyond their reach in most cases. In this connection, one must mention problems relating to the screening of applications for official travel abroad and government employees' overseas training. In fact, civil servants' foreign trips are currently restricted by the screening system. All overseas trips for official business require advance approval. Even when a government employee wants to take a vacation abroad with his family, he has to get the approval of the head of his organization. [passage omitted] Government employees study abroad under various arrangements: the government-wide program under which personnel are selected by the Ministry of Government Administration for study abroad at state expense; the program of each ministry under which it sends its selected employees at its own budgetary expense; the use of an IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] credit (under the jurisdiction of the MOF); the use of cooperation funds of foreign countries; the use of special funds including those tied to special trade contracts; the use of the Humphrey and Fulbright Funds and various university scholarships. The number of government employees sent abroad under the Ministry of Government Administration's program of study abroad at state expense is very limited, with only about two for each ministry on average. That is why the competition is so keen that in major ministries where many employees have passed the higher civil service examination--such as the Economic Planning Board, the MOF, and MOTIE--officials have to prepare for several years to get selected for study abroad. [passage omitted] Another major problem is the failure to assign those employees who returned after studying abroad to the right jobs and make the best use of them. There are quite a few employees in MOTIE who have returned home after studying law overseas. They studied law abroad to make the best use of their expert knowledge in the area of trade and commerce. But for administrative reasons of personnel management, these employees upon their return from abroad are often assigned to positions in industrial fields rather than in the field of trade and commerce. In this way they are deprived of the best opportunity to make the best use of the expertise which they studied so hard to acquire. The sector of MOTIE that deals with trade matters may be said to be "the vanguard of internationalization." The ability to speak English is an essential requirement, but the time is gone when a man with only a good knowledge of the English knowledge could pass as a trade expert. To be able to resolve complex trade issues and promote national interests through sticky negotiations, one needs to have expert knowledge on the matters on hand. It is not an easy thing to find people with an expert judicial knowledge in our government sector which deals with trade. When a legal problem crops up, the government could use international lawyers in our country, but these lawyers cannot participate in the policy-making process. [passage omitted] A grade-v official made this comment: "As a matter of fact, there is little chance of training trade experts among government employees under the current personnel policy and method of organizational management. When a trade expert is transferred to an industrial department, his transfer should be temporary for the purpose of gaining experience there to deepen his expertise on trade. But in our country, that is not the case. Our government pursues a personnel policy of mass-producing generalists. [passage omitted] What is more deplorable is that those who returned home from abroad after studying law are assigned to jobs which have nothing to with their specialities in law." In MOTIE, there is a trade expert who has a license to practice international law. But he is working in the industrial sector (electronics) of the ministry. Young grade-v officials who have gained a vision for internationalization while handling trade matters argue that the current overseas training programs should be shortened from the current one- to two-year period to three to six months. The reason is that what is needed is not lectures on theory but a practical course that will give trainees an ability to resolve pesky trade disputes through negotiations. [passage omitted] The following are the words of a certain bureau chief who once served as a international cooperation officer at MOTIE: "An international cooperation officer must handle all kinds of negotiations: UR, OECD ship-building, and multilateral steel. He must go to Geneva or Brussels each time there is a conference. When I was on an official trip, a Japanese official gave a dubious look when he saw me. He said to me, "You must be very powerful." I just laughed it off. But I felt ashamed inside. In Japan's case, the officials attending specific negotiations are seasoned veterans with years of experience in their specialty. In our country, when an official takes charge of negotiations after drifting from place to place under the government's personnel management practice, he attends negotiations in every field. This can be found only in the bureaucracies of developing countries." The organizational structure of our government and the inefficient way of performing official business are other major factors that make government employees blind to the needs for internationalization. Our government still maintains the same organizational structure established in the 1960's when the country was absorbed in economic development. Government functions are not rationally distributed among ministries, and this often generates interagency squabbles going beyond the level of controversy, impeding efficiency. In competing with foreign countries, information on them is essential. But the total number of government employees stationed abroad is slightly over 200 from 21 ministries and agencies. These officers use their positions as stepping-stones for promotion and are more interested in accommodating high-ranking officials on overseas trips than in prompt reporting of accurate information on their host countries. Working conditions of government employees is poor compared with that of private firms. Private firms have introduced various office automation systems, But the computer terminals in ministries and agencies are primitive. [passage omitted] Private firms already have high-tech systems and are generating paperless reports and holding conversations and making decisions via computer. On the contrary, government employees prepare each report on dozens of sheets of paper and submit it to higher authorities. [passage omitted] It is unreasonable to force only the economic ministries to remold their thinking when the public's thinking is not remolded to an advanced level. [passage omitted] Our people are not happy about foreign firms remitting their profits to their home countries. When our firms want to invest overseas, the public feels that a large amount of foreign currency is going to flow out of our country. Economic bureaucrats maintain that unless the exclusionist sentiment against foreign countries, the vague subconscious delusion of persecution against internationalization, and blind patriotism are corrected, legal and institutional improvements cannot be carried forward effectively. [passage omitted] An Economic Planning Board official made this point: "Before stressing the need for pushing the internationalization of the bureaucracy, there must be a clearly defined concept of internationalization in the Administration." According to him, internationalization is constantly being discussed in the bureaucracy, but there is no clear guideline on how to carry it forward. According to the same official, the internationalization of ministries should be pushed forward by fully reflecting public opinion and only after going through interagency consultations, but currently, the atmosphere is swayed by one word from the president. Faced with an internationalization motto unilaterally decided at the top and conveyed to the bottom, each ministry unfolds its own strategy without consultation with others. Many economic bureaucrats argue that this leads to confusion of policies and discord among ministries. [passage omitted]
