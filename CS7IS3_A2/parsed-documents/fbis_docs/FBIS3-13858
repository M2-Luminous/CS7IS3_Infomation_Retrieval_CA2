It has been learned from the PLO headquarters that these talks are focussing on the formal resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations after the UN Security Council condemned, in its Resolution No. 904, the massacre at the Tomb of Patriarchs [in Hebron]. The Palestinian president had earlier met, for the second time since yesterday, an Israeli delegation that is carrying proposals on security measures to be taken by Israel to ensure the protection of the Palestinians in the occupied territories. The Israelis have said that they would implement these measures only after a date for the resumption of talks on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho is announced. In an interview with the U.S. newspaper NEW YORK TIMES, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat had said that it was very difficult to resume talks with Israel under the pressure of aggressive practices [as heard] and that talks held under such conditions would not last very long.
