FBIS4-7836 "dreeu067_i_94019" FBIS-EEU-94-067 Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Data on Bosnian Serb Army Data on Bosnian Serb Army 94BA0219A Ljubljana DNEVNIK in Slovene 8 Mar 94 p 9 94BA0219A Ljubljana DNEVNIK Slovene CSO [Article by Zeljko Katancic: "Accumulated (Obsolete) Equipment"] [Text] According to published data, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] has spent half a billion dollars for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina; the guerrilla battalions, of which they are reportedly 26, are the most dangerous to the peacekeeping forces' units. In a certain sense, the present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina could also be considered as a cat playing with a mouse. The Serbs already thought that with Russian backing they had escaped the West's excessively severe pressure, but they were obviously mistaken. By shooting down four aircraft, the West proved that it was nevertheless serious about it, and consequently what the Bosnian Serbs are doing now is perhaps extremely risky. Obviously the spokesman for the international peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo did not say too loudly that the Serbs had renewed their attacks within the 20-kilometer protected zone around Sarajevo and were also using heavy weapons in doing so. The guarantee by General Rose that trucks would take humanitarian aid throughout Bosnia without asking anyone at all for permission also had its purpose. Perhaps something even worse than the downing of the four aircraft may really happen during the coming days. It will therefore not be superfluous to know what the NATO aircraft and the international peacekeeping forces' infantry will have to deal with if they do decide to punish those who are challenging them too much. The loudest and most dangerous among them are the Bosnian Serbs, who are also the best armed. Western intelligence services have surely collected quite solid data on the positions that they would have to destroy. There are somewhat fewer than 3,000 such targets on the Bosnian Serbs' side. They include 460 tanks, 300 armored personnel carriers, 50 self-propelled howitzers and 30 self-propelled cannons, 77 multiple rocket launchers for Plamen missiles, six missile launchers for the more powerful Orkan missiles, and 10 missile launchers for the already known Luna missiles, of which one missile launcher is near Sarajevo. In about 180 barracks and military posts, there are approximately 80,000 military conscripts, many of whom were only recently called up. Approximately 50,000 of them are soldiers from the permanent forces of the army of the self-styled Srpska republic. The Serbian air defense has old short-range, medium-range, and long-range missiles and artillery systems. Western military experts are quite familiar with them, and consequently it will not be difficult for their pilots and infantry to find and destroy them. According to some information, there are supposed to be 67 positions with the Dvina and Neva missiles, better known by the Western designators SAM-2 and SAM-3, and Cub missiles, or SAM-6 according to their Western designator. There is probably a missile launcher with three missiles at each position. Also quite probable is the fact that every year about 80,000 fresh conscripts from the Serbian-Montenegrin army and its reservists complete at least part of their military service, if not all of it, as reserves in the army of the Srpska republic. The Serbian guerrilla battalions are still the most dangerous to the infantry and armored units of the international peacekeeping forces. There are reportedly 26 such battalions, with from 550 to 780 soldiers in each of them. That means about 20,000 well-trained and hardened Serbian warriors. That army operates with very good coordination with the Serbian rebels in Croatia. Fresh conscripts and reservists from the Serbian-Montenegrin army also perform part of their military service in the so-called Serbian Krajinas. Every year about 40,000 of them discharge their "patriotic" duty in the army of the self-styled republic of Serbian Krajina. According to published data, last year and this year the Serbian-Montenegrin Yugoslavia spent a full $1.5 billion for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and approximately an additional $650 million to aid the people of the Krajinas in Croatia. The Serbian armies in Croatia and Bosnia receive approximately 40 percent of even more of everything produced by the rebuilt defense industry of the former and present Yugoslavia. The Serbian armies in Croatia and Bosnia consist of 130,000-160,000 soldiers. Most of them are reservists who were called up recently. The latest events have also pointed out the Serbian armies' quite strong air force. According to some information, the one in Bosnia is supposed to have over 50 combat aircraft. They are deployed at three of the eight airports that are on the territory controlled by the Serbs in Bosnia and in Croatia. All of the former Yugoslavia was thoroughly prepared for some sort of general popular war. On its territory there were about 3,000 areas that were suitable for mobile military airports, and about 100 of them are on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Serbs' air force has its main bases in Mahovljani and Zaluzani near Banja Luka, and at temporary airports near Bosansko Grahovo, and there are also some Serbian aircraft in neighboring Croatia near Udbina. Until now, the army of the self-styled republic of Srpska had 75 aircraft and helicopters. About 20 helicopters were intended for transportation and communications. The aircraft include five MiG-21's, 12 Jastrebs that are already old, and 16 G-4 Super Galebs. The Bosnian and Croatian Serbs are supposed to have about 14 of the larger and more powerful Orel fighter-bombers. Intelligence services have observed 17 MI-8 and 17 Gazelle helicopters, and eight Gama military helicopters. The latter are most often observed in the vicinity of Bihac and the Cazin Krajina. Some intelligence data also mention 12 MI-8 transport helicopters, which are mostly under repair. These are older helicopters whose service life has already expired.
