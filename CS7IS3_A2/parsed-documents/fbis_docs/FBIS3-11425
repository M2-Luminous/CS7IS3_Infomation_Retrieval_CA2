The other elections will stand because it is [word indistinct] constitutional. At this time, current trends lead us to think there will be a runoff. I insist (?we do) what the law states -- namely, hold a runoff election. [end recording] Zaldivar admitted that there were shortcomings in the balloting process, but he added that these will be corrected in the future to guarantee and improve similar electoral events: [Begin Zaldivar recording] For example, the voting did not start at the time mandated by law. Many polling stations opened after 0700. This happened because this was the first time in the nation's history that the entire political spectrum was involved in one general election. Everyone wanted to serve as either president or secretary of the voting table boards. Delays were prompted by discussions along these lines among people who, according to the law, represented the various political parties. In some places, voting started after the scheduled time; nevertheless, everything settled down later, and I think everyone who wanted to vote did vote. [end recording] Dr. Zaldivar pointed out that if there is indeed a runoff, steps will be taken to avert the same logistical problems encountered in Sunday's elections.
