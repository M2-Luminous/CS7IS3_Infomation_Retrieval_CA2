Last year some 500 township agroscience and education centers were set up in the province. Now over 2,200 towns have set up such centers, 70 percent of the total number of towns in Hunan. The centers play an important role in promoting advanced farming techniques and training in rural areas. In 1993 Hunan Province built 251 farm technical training and demonstration areas based on the centers to introduce 1,057 new farming techniques and help 200,000 households to get rich. The use of the new techniques has helped increase agricultural output value by 450 million yuan. After learning the techniques of growing elevated gastrodia tubers over 30 farm households in Linjiang town, in the Tongdao Dong nationality autonomous county, made an average income of nearly 20,000 yuan per household only by planting the Chinese medicinal herb last year. The farmers' per capita income in Youxian County was over 1,000 yuan after they learned to use new techniques of grain production, making it one of the richest counties in eastern Hunan.
