The EU battle in Norway will not be over with the referendum. If the majority say yes to the EU there will be an intense battle in the Storting around the final decision. In Norway a referendum is only advisory. The final decision as to whether to adopt the government's recommendation to become a member of the EU lies with the Storting. According to Article 93 of the Constitution, it requires a three-quarters majority of the Storting for Norway to join. In the election campaign last year the Socialist Left Party and the Center Party made it clear that they would not vote for EU membership if the yes side in the referendum won by a slim margin. Together the two parties have 45 members in the Storting: more than one-quarter of the seats. The problem became apparent long before last year's election, and the Conservative, Labor, and Progress Parties have as a result proposed various constitutional amendments that would make it possible to bypass the three- quarters requirement. To amend the Constitution only requires two-thirds majority. The problem the yes parties face is that there are more opponents to the EU than those in the Center Party and the Socialist Left Party. In addition the Christian People's Party had made it clear that they do not wish to "change the rules of the game in the middle of the game." So far this has been interpreted as the Christian People's Party's not wanting to lend support to any of the proposed amendments. The Christian People's Party, the Socialist Left, and the Center Party have 58 Storting representatives together: two representatives more than they need to block a constitutional amendment. The EU agreement this week, coupled with the assumption that there will be a referendum in November, has given new life to speculations on how the Storting in the final analysis will view the referendum. Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland has previously stated that there will be some in the Center and Socialist Left Parties who will respect a slim majority in a referendum. The belief is that the pressure from the public to respect the people's decision will become so strong that many will yield. Other EU supporters in the Storting think some in the Christian People's Party will decide, at the decisive moment, to vote for a constitutional amendment, thus leaving it up to the cabinet, not the Storting, to make the final decision about EU membership. It will be a while before the issues are fully thrashed out. For tactical reasons the parties will want to wait as long as possible before taking a stand. Additionally, there may be instances where individual representatives break with their own parliamentary groups.
