A majority of the board of trustees of each Fund currently consists of trustees who are not ``interested persons'' of that Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act. The non-interested trustees receive annual fees from the Funds. Applicants propose to offer a deferred fee arrangement to the trustees (the ``Eligible Trustees'') who receive fees from one or more of (i) the Portfolios and (ii) Funds that do not invest all or substantially all of their assets in a Portfolio (the ``Participating Funds''). Under this arrangement, the Eligible Trustees will be entitled to defer to a later date the receipt of all or part of their trustees' fees in order to defer payment of income taxes or for other reasons. 3. The proposed deferred fee arrangements would be implemented by means of a deferred fee agreement (the ``Agreement'') entered into between an Eligible Trustee and the appropriate Participating Fund. Under each Agreement, the deferred fees will be credited to a book reserve account (the ``Deferred Fee Account'') established by a Participating Fund with respect to each of its series. The deferred fees will be accrued in an amount equal to that which would have been earned had such fees (and all income earned thereon) been invested and reinvested in shares of any of a selection of the Participating Funds (the ``Investment Funds'') that may be designated from time to time by the management of the appropriate Participating Fund and the participating Eligible Trustee. Such shares of the Investment Fund that are purchased by a Participating Fund are referred to as the ``Underlying Securities.'' The return on the Deferred Fee Accounts will be based upon the return of the Investment Fund(s) selected by the particular Eligible Trustee or, to the extent one or more of the Investment Funds selected for investment are no longer in existence, upon a recognized measure of prevailing market interest rates ( e.g. , the Treasury Bill rate). 4. The obligations to make payments from the Deferred Fee Accounts will be general unsecured obligations of each series of a Participating Fund, and payments from the Deferred Fee Accounts will be made from the general assets and property of such Participating Fund. The Agreement will provide that the Participating Fund is under no obligation to purchase, hold or dispose of any investments, but, if the Participating Fund chooses to purchase investments to cover its obligations under such Agreement, then all such investments will continue to be a part of the general assets and property of the Participating Fund. 5. As a matter of prudent risk management, the Participating Funds will purchase and hold shares of the Underlying Securities in amounts equal to the deemed investment of the deferred fee accounts of its Eligible Trustees. Thus, in cases where the Participating Funds purchase shares of the Underlying Securities, liabilities created by the credits to the Deferred Fee Accounts under the Agreement are expected to be matched by an equal amount of assets ( i.e. , a direct investment in the Underlying Securities). The Agreement will not obligate any Participating Fund to retain the services of any trustee, nor will they obligate any Participating Fund to pay any particular level of compensation to the trustee. 6. Under the Agreement, deferred trustee's fees (including interest accrued thereon) will become payable in cash upon the Eligible Trustee's retirement or disability. Payments shall be made in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments. In addition, in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the appropriate Participating Fund or the distribution of all or substantially all of the Participating Fund's assets and property to its shareholders, all unpaid amounts in the Deferred Fee Account shall be paid in a lump sum on the effective date thereof. In the event of the Eligible Trustee's death, the deferred compensation will be paid to his or her designated beneficiary. In all other situations, the Eligible Trustee's right to receive payments will be non-transferable. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an order under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act to exempt applicants from sections 13(a)(2), 13(a)(3), 17(a)(1), 18(a), 18(c), 18(f)(1), 22(f), 22(g) and 23(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to offer certain deferred fee arrangements, and section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder to permit the Funds to effect certain joint transactions incident to such deferred fee arrangements. The finding required by section 17(b)(2) is predicated on the assumption that relief is granted from section 13(a)(3). 2. Sections 18(a) and 18(c) restrict the ability of a registered closed-end investment company to issue senior securities. Section 18(f)(1) generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing senior securities. Section 13(a)(2) requires that a registered investment company obtain shareholder authorization before issuing any senior security not contemplated by the recitals of policy in its registration statement. Applicants state that the Agreement possesses none of the characteristics of senior securities that led Congress to enact these sections. The Agreement would not: (a) induce speculative investments or provide opportunities for manipulative allocation of any Fund's expenses or profits; (b) affect control of any Fund; (c) confuse investors or convey a false impression as to the safety of their investments; or (d) be inconsistent with the theory of mutuality of risk. All liabilities created by credits to Deferred Fee Accounts are expected to be offset by equal amounts of assets that would not otherwise exist if the fees were paid on a current basis. 3. Section 22(f) prohibits undisclosed restrictions on transferability or negotiability of redeemable securities issued by open-end investment companies. The Agreement would set forth all such restrictions, which would be included primarily to benefit the participating trustees and would not adversely affect the interests of such trustees or of any shareholder.
