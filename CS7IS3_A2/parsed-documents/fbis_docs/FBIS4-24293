After checking with all the civilian and military authorities, Tele-Zaire has been able to establish the facts. Having gone to the area from Kinshasa, Mr. Lambert Mende, chairman of one of the wings of the Congolese National Movement [MNC]- Lumumba, began to incite the local population to attack the interests of so-called pro-government firms and French interests. Reacting to this call to hatred and violence, Western Kasai Governor (Bachala Kamtua Milandu) called Mr. Mende to order, asking him to put an end to all forms of agitation. Mr. Mende promised not do that any more and said he was simply going to visit his family at Mwene Ditu. On reaching the area, however, he started all over again. He was never kidnapped and should, in principle, have returned to Mbuji-Mayi today. Also, in a release to the press passed on to us only a few minutes before we entered the studios, sources close to the National Intelligence and Security Service say that according to their information a peaceful atmosphere reigns at Mbuju-Mayi, chief town of the Western Kasai Region, where Mr. (Mende Omalanga), an influential Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] member, freely held a public debate. The said sources say the man is continuing his tour of the Western Kasai Region smoothly without harassment. This release categorically denies reports carried today in certain newspapers in Kinshasa alleging bloody incidents which, they claim, took place at Mbuji-Mayi between security forces and USOR fighters.
