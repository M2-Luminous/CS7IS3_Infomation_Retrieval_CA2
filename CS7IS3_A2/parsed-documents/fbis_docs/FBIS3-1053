He accused Western governments and big business of withholding funding to the PAC to ensure an African National Congress [ANC] election victory. Mr Makwetu said PAC officials from the president down had not been paid for nine months. "We are living from hand to mouth. Nobody from the president down has been paid. We need everything we can get," Mr Makwetu told a media conference. He said arrangements had been made to restore the PAC's telecommunications -- disconnected this week after a R94,000 [rand] bill went unpaid -- but that "we must live up to these arrangements". "If we don't find the funds we might find ourselves in trouble," he said. "Our members...are donating amounts of between R5 to R50, with a few giving us a few hundreds," Mr Makwetu said. "Big business and the overseas community is determined to ensure that these are one-sided elections. The unholy alliance between the international community and big business will deny this country the multiparty democracy overseas countries claim they enjoy." He said the United States had given at least US10 million to the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party. "The PAC and other organisations have been ignored and our efforts to get the same kind of assistance has fallen on deaf ears," he said. The Scandinavian countries had donated R25 million to the ANC. The French had also donated to the ANC. "However, despite this, we are not pulling out of the elections. We are not throwing in the towel and already creating excuses in case we lose. Despite our poverty, for this is what the struggle is about, we will make the necessary sacrifices for victory. Some of our posters are handwritten on cheap paper and done in townships and squatter camps for this is where the struggle starts in the first place."
