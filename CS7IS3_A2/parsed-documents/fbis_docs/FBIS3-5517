Fujii expressed his views on the current state of the country's economy, plagued by the longest recession in the postwar period, during a speech in Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture, north of Tokyo. Fujii also expressed strong hope to raise taxes designed to fund welfare programs by increasing the current 3 percent consumption tax. He said that financing Japan's increasingly aging society with income tax revenues has reached its limits. Fujii said that while in office he wants to lay the groundwork for setting up a tax system to finance pension funds and a care system for the elderly.
