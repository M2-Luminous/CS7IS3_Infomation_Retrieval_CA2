During the past year, more than 2,900 enterprises were sold or merged through the 16 property rights exchange centers in cities like Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Shenzhen. Altogether 400,000 workers have been relocated. State-owned assets still make up the biggest proportion of total social assets in China today. The assets are under the mandate of central or local governments, or various administrative ministries. However, under the old planned economic system, state-owned enterprises did not have enough latitude to decide their own management affairs and their fixed assets could not be circulated on the market. It is estimated that about a third of the state-owned enterprises are running at a loss while another third are running with poor management. The transfer of property rights is mainly conducted by way of enterprise mergers or transformation into a share-holding system. In the 1980s, more than 6,900 enterprises were merged, with over eight billion yuan of property rights transferred. Consequently, 4,095 enterprises came out of the red and the annual level of losses by state-owned enterprises was reduced by 522 million yuan. In addition, some other practical methods such as contract and leasing systems have been taken to revitalize state-owned enterprises and at the same time to prevent the drain of state fixed assets. With regard to the share-holding system, in which China began pilot schemes in the mid-1980s, the government had approved the setting up of 13,000 share-holding companies by the end of 1993. By the end of last year, a total of 122 companies, with 208.6 billion yuan in capital, listed their stocks on the Shenzhen or Shanghai stock exchanges. So far some 25 million Chinese people are involved in stock transactions. Hainan, designated to be a province by the State Council in 1988 and now China's largest economic zone, is striving to become a regional center for property rights transactions. The province has about 3,000 state or collectively owned enterprises, one third of which are running at a loss. Experts say that the small proportion of state-owned enterprises makes them easy to be auctioned or merged without too much social impact. By the end of 1992, the province had more than 2,000 foreign- funded enterprises and 83,400 industrial and commercial enterprises dealing with various industrial sectors, retail selling, catering trade, tourism, and real estate. The bankruptcy of firms has made transactions in property rights a brisk business. The province now has ten auction institutions, with fairly experienced auction businessmen, for these transactions. Specialists and bodies handling property assessment, transaction notarization and property lawsuits have also come into being. So far, the province has 30 bar associations, a dozen accountancy offices and some 50 auditing offices. To coordinate the transactions, the province has set up a unified social insurance system covering workers in varied ownership sectors. The system deals with unemployment, pensions, medical care and injuries at work. Sichuan is also one of the country's first provinces to implement trial reforms in the transfer of property rights of enterprises. In 1993 alone, 408 enterprises in the province eliminated losses and began to create profits after their property rights were transferred. With the development of the property rights business, China has promulgated a series of relevant laws and regulations on bankruptcy, company and state enterprises. Economists believe that the development of the property rights business will play a more and more important role in re-organization of the country's production factors and in raising its productivity.
