The text does not contain a clause on the superiority over armed forces. The National Defense Committee [KOK] has excluded this issue for separate examination. National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, when presenting the guidelines of the document on the fundamental issues of Poland's defense, said that it would be possible to embark on modernizing the Polish Army when the state budget expenditure on defense reaches the level of 3 percent of the gross domestic product. At present, the Ministry's budget stands at 2.1 percent of the state budget expenditure. Minister Kolodziejczyk believes that, if expenditure on the Army is increased by 0.3 percent each year, the Polish Army will achieve Western standards in 20 years. [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] The pace of technological modernization within the armed forces will depend on the amount of money guaranteed by the budget. We are pressing for 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Only then will we be able to say that we are embarking on a gradual, slow, 20-year process of modernizing the Army. The modernization should bring our technological standards up to those of Western armies in roughly the year 2015. [end recording]
