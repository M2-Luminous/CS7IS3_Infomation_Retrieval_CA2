The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc. (Formerly De Havilland; Hawker Siddley; British Aerospace, PLC): Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;137&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model Hawker 800 and 1000 series airplanes and Model DH/BH/HS/BAe 125&hyph;1A through&hyph;1000A series airplanes; equipped with main landing gear (MLG) sidestay assemblies on which Post-Mod 252091 steel jack pivots have been installed; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the inability of the MLG to deploy and a consequent wheels-up landing, accomplish the following: (a) Perform a detailed visual inspection, using a 10X magnifier, to detect cracking of the sidestay assembly jack pivot of the left and right MLG, in accordance with Raytheon Corporate Jets Service Bulletin SB 32&hyph;233, dated June 24, 1994, at the latest of the times specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this AD. (1) Within 28 days after the effective date of this AD; or (2) Prior to the accumulation of 3,000 total landings on the sidestay assembly since new; or (3) Prior to the accumulation of 1,000 total landings since overhaul of the sidestay assembly. (b) If no cracks are found and the sidestay assembly has been overhauled prior to the accomplishment of the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this AD: Accomplish the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD in accordance with Raytheon Corporate Jets Service Bulletin SB 32&hyph;233, dated June 24, 1994. (1) Repeat the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings. (2) Prior to the accumulation of 4,000 total landings on the jack pivot assembly since the sidestay assembly was last overhauled, or within 300 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later: Replace the jack pivot assembly with a new assembly. Thereafter, prior to the accumulation of 4,000 landings, remove the jack pivot assembly and replace it with a new assembly in accordance with the service bulletin. (c) If no cracks are found and the sidestay assembly has not been overhauled prior to accomplishment of the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD: Prior to the accumulation of 4,000 total landings on the jack pivot assembly, or within 300 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, replace the jack pivot assembly with a new assembly in accordance with Raytheon Corporate Jets Service Bulletin SB 32&hyph;233, dated June 24, 1994. Thereafter, prior to the accumulation of 4,000 landings on the jack pivot assembly, replace it with a new assembly in accordance with the service bulletin. (d) If any crack is found that does not exceed the limits specified in Raytheon Corporate Jets Service Bulletin SB 32&hyph;233 dated June 24, 1994, accomplish the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) of this AD, as applicable, in accordance with the service bulletin. (1) For sidestay assemblies that have accumulated 4,000 or more total landings since new that have been overhauled prior to accomplishment of the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this AD: Accomplish paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this AD. (i) Repeat the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 landings.

Thereafter, prior to the accumulation of 4,000 landings on the jack pivot assembly, replace it with a new assembly in accordance with the service bulletin. (2) For any sidestay assemblies that have accumulated 4,000 or more total landings since new that have not been overhauled: Accomplish paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) of this AD. (i) Repeat the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 landings. (ii) Within 300 landings after the effective date of this AD, replace the jack pivot assembly with a new assembly. Thereafter, prior to the accumulation of 4,000 landings on the jack pivot assembly, replace it with a new assembly in accordance with the service bulletin. (3) For sidestay assemblies that have accumulated less than 4,000 total landings since new: Accomplish paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this AD. (i) Repeat the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 landings.
