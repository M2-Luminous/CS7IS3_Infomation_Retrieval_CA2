FR941028-2-00062 FR941028-2-00044 [FRL&hyph;5098&hyph;3] Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Extension of public comment period. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce the extension of the comment period for the ``Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy'' (OW&hyph;FRL&hyph;5062&hyph;2) for 30 days. The comment period will close on November 30, 1994. The original notice, announcing the availability of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy, was published on August 30, 1994, and the public comment period closed on October 31, 1994. Because the proposed Strategy is a unique plan of action developed to address a significant national environmental problem, and to streamline decision-making within and among EPA programs, the Agency is requesting comments on the Strategy. EPA is extending the public comment period because the Agency has received requests to extend the comment period to ensure an adequate and thorough review of the Strategy. DATES: Written comments must be postmarked or submitted by hand on or before November 30, 1994, and should be addressed as indicated below. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed or delivered to: Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy Comment Clerk, Water Docket MC&hyph;4101, Room L102, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Commenters are requested to submit an original and 3 copies of their written comments and enclosures. Commenters who want receipt of their comments acknowledged should include a self addressed, stamped envelope. No facsimiles (faxes) will be accepted. Requests for copies of EPA's Contaminated Sediment Strategy (EPA document number EPA 832&hyph;R&hyph;94&hyph;001) should be sent to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Environmental Publications and Information, 11029 Kenwood Road, Building 5, Cincinnati, Ohio 45242; telephone: 513&hyph;891&hyph;6561, fax: 513&hyph;891&hyph;6685. The proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy and the administrative record for its development are available for public inspection and copying during normal business hours at the Water Docket, Room L102 (basement) Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. For an appointment to see Docket materials, call 202&hyph;260&hyph;3027 between 9:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. As provided in 40 CFR Part 2, a reasonable fee may be charged for copying services. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas M. Armitage or Jane M. Farris, Risk Assessment and Management Branch, Office of Science and Technology, Mail Code 4305, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460; telephone 202&hyph;260&hyph;7301. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA announced the availability of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy in the August 30, 1994, Federal Register (OW&hyph;FRL&hyph;5062&hyph;2). Contaminated sediment poses ecological and human health risks in many watersheds throughout the United States. In these watersheds, sediment serves as a contaminant reservoir from which fish and bottom dwelling organisms can accumulate toxic compounds and pass them up the food chain. EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy was developed to streamline decision-making within and among the Agency's program offices by promoting and ensuring: the use of consistent sediment assessment practices, consistent consideration of risks posed by contaminated sediment, the use of consistent approaches to management of contaminated sediment risks, and the wise use of scarce resources for research and technology development. A summary of the information provided in the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy and the issues relevant to sediment contamination are discussed in the August 30, 1994, Federal Register notice. Readers are referred to that notice for additional details. The agency has received requests to extend the public comment period to ensure an adequate and thorough review of the Strategy. Therefore, the comment period is extended from October 31, 1994, for 30 days, to November 30, 1994. Dated: October 24, 1994. Robert Perciasepe, Assistant Administrator for Water.
