Villegas] [Text] Amid reports on the possible breakdown of trade talks between the United States and Japan and Washington's perceived threat of withdrawing most favored nation (MFN) status on China over human rights issues, Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo reiterated the Philippines' concerns for an early conclusion of the aforementioned conflicts. Mr. Romulo raised this matter after meeting with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed Bolkiah of Brunei and Abdul Rahman Bin Mohamed Taib, Minister of Industry and Primary Resources in the tiny oil-rich state, the other night. Mr. Romulo said Washington's trade conflicts with Tokyo and Beijing are counterproductive to the collective efforts of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in helping realize the organization's desire to facilitate the flow of trade among its 17 members. "The countries in the region cannot help but be affected by these difficulties," the foreign affairs chief said, as trade talks between the United States and Japan, as well as those between the United States and China, seem to have been inconclusive and have failed to adequately address the concerns of the parties. He called on Washington, Tokyo, and Beijing to view their bilateral trade issues in the context of further encouraging trade and economic development in the region. "The Philippines is calling on all parties concerned to come to terms and resolve these trade issues before it adversely affects the stability of the region," he added. The United States and Japan have been trying to address the latter's massive trade surplus over the former. On the other hand, Washington has been linking the granting of MFN status to the alleged failure of Beijing to prevent human rights violations in China. Mr. Romulo earlier raised these concerns during the recent call on him by Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan in the country. "Countries in the region are all trying to agree on the kind of process we should take in order to solve trade problems affecting us instead of having two of our largest trading partners go directly head on with each other in ways that are not of interests to other economies on this side of the globe," the Australian Trade Minister earlier said. In an interview with BUSINESS WORLD before departing for Kuala Lumpur last Saturday, Mr. McMullan said Australia wants the nascent APEC to become "more effective" by promoting trade liberalization in the region. He said Canberra's priorities at the moment regarding APEC's role in the region is focused on addressing trade matters that would help developing countries benefit from their trade relations with the industrialized ones. Although Australia has been vocal on the institutionalization of APEC, Mr. McMullan said Canberra does not see this move as a priority at the moment. "A lot of people in Asia have different views on this," he said, referring to the proposed transformation of APEC into a more formal structure. "Australia is quite relaxed on the institutionalization of APEC. We don't want to press too far on that," he added. "Whether we come to agree on this matter or not, the best way to address APEC's future direction is to do it by consensus. No single (member) country in APEC pretends to have all the answers on APEC's future. Everyone's searching. Whether APEC becomes institutionalized or not is unimportant ... although the establishment of a Secretariat in Singapore seems to indicate that APEC is probably becoming institutionalized already," the Trade Minister said. He said Australia would rather have two sides of the Pacific work together instead of being in conflict with each other. "That is essentially our priority. If the best way to realize APEC's goals is to institutionalize the organization, then, so be it. But if it's not that necessary, then it's not a priority for us," said Mr. McMullan. APEC groups together Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States. Chile is expected to join the organization when the APEC ministers meet this November in Indonesia for their annual talks.
