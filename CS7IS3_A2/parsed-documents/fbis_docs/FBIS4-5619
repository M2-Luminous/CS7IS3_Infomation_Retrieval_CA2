FBIS4-5619 "dreas071__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-071-A Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Government To Provide Full ODA to Mozambique Government To Provide Full ODA to Mozambique OW1204144194 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1204144194 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The government will provide full-scale official development assistance (ODA) to Mozambique in the form of bilateral assistance, in parallel with the participation of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] in the UN peacekeeping operations [PKO] in the country. This was disclosed by a source at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] on 6 April. The government plans to display Japan's attitude in making international contribution by providing its utmost "assistance for reconstruction work" to the African nation. This will be the second full-fledged ODA to a country, in which the SDF is engaged in PKO activities, after Cambodia. Japan plans to provide tens of millions of dollars to Mozambique, though the amount is less than a total of $300 million given to Cambodia for its reconstruction work. While a MOFA survey team has already arrived in Mozambique, together with survey teams from European countries and the United States, the government intends to promote the plan in a concrete manner to lead other nations. Moreover, the government plans to positively help Mozambique smoothly conduct its general elections scheduled for October, and it has begun studying a plan to send an election-monitoring team based on the PKO Cooperation Law. Since Japan regards the southern Africa region as an area to which great emphasis in its ODA programs should be attached, it has decided to provide aid to Mozambique. From now on, the government intends to extend ODA to the peripheral region, including South Africa, which will be newly born following a constituent assembly election. SDF members have been dispatched in rotation to Mozambique since last May, and 53 members are currently engaged in duties there. Moreover, Japan provided Mozambique with approximately $200 million through bilateral assistance centering on food supply and acceptance of trainees (between 1988 and 1992). However, because the government army and the antigovernment army have been smoothly conducting disarmament under the monitoring of the UN peacekeeping operations in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), a focal point of construction work has now shifted to improvement of infrastructure in the country. For this reason, Mozambique is now waiting for assistance from foreign nations. Under these circumstances, the government has sent to the country a survey team headed by Mitsugu Saito, chief of the Development Cooperation Division under MOFA's Economic Cooperation Bureau, saying: "More positive ODA will be necessary from now on. If soldiers, who will lose their job, have no place to go after disarmament is completed, all efforts will come to nothing," (according to a MOFA source). The government intends to hold the final consultations on working out possible cooperation, including improvement of social infrastructure and technical assistance after the survey team's return home set for 15 April. Among possible projects are: road repairs; the improvement of water supply and drainage; and assistance for the electric power industry. While Japan provided aid to Cambodia as a partner in the Asian region, ODA to Mozambique is believed to "have an epoch-making significance as Japan's visible assistance for reconstruction in Africa, which is far from Japan" (as stated by a government source).
