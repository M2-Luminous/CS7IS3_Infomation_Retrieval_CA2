He added that the subsidy granted to transportation workers to guarantee this benefit will be maintained to support students. When leaving the Council of Ministers, the minister of transport and communications denied a newspaper report published in a Caracas daily on an alleged elimination of the subsidy. [Begin Quintino Rosales recording] In response to a report published in last Tuesday's press regarding an alleged elimination of the subsidy to student fares, the Ministry of Transport and Communication expressed emphatically the following: The subsidy to student fare will be maintained as an incentive to support students. With this declaration, the government ratifies and maintains firmly the commitment signed last March to preserve the current system until the last day of July, and later replace it by a form of payment more transparent, equitable, and clear. Additionally, we state our strong opposition to blackmail and illegal measures of coercion, violence, and public order alterations, which result in loss of life among our youths. [end recording] Meanwhile, given the surprising announcement of a new transportation strike by the Single Union of Independent Vehicles for next Monday, the faction of councilmen of the Social Christian Party, Copei, asked the leaders of said union to reflect on the consequences of the strike. We consider, Councilman Moises Benaim said, that the situation of the country demands greater tactfulness at the time of making decisions, such as leaving Caracas once more without transportation, following an action in which the population displayed their civic behavior. People could react negatively if they are pressured and made to suffer by leaving them without service, he added. [words indistinct] a Chamber of Deputies Financial Commission led by Legislator Gonzalo Perez has appointed a subcommission to begin an investigation on the 50-percent discount on the student fare. The announcement was made by the very deputy, in statements to our reporter Vinicio Sanchez. [Begin Perez recording] Engineer (Maya Ortega) and Carlos Sindoni have today come to the subcommission I preside to ratify their report. These former officials of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who have to do with the directorate created to subsidize transportation for students, have ratified the Ministry of Transport and Communications has made timely payments for many years to transportation workers not offering this service. They stated they presented their report to the Rafael Iribarren, former deputy minister of transportation and communication, to whom they presented 12 folders. Those 12 folders were requested by the Financial Commission and they have not been forwarded by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. They also expressed Eng. Iribarren's report on student subsidy is a gimmick, adding he has acted irresponsibly. The former officials noted Iribarren dismantled the operating structure of this subsidy at the Ministry of Transport and Communications, adding this is why today there are no controls. We will process all these reports, and next week we will talk with Eng. Rafael Iribarren to hear his account of the events. [end recording]
