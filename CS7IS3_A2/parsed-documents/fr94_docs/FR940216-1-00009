ACTION: Proposed rule; dismissal. SUMMARY: This document dismisses a Notice of Proposed Rule Making issued in response to Buckley Broadcasting Corporation of Maine requesting the substitution of Channel 265B1 for Channel 265A at Westbrook, Maine, and modification of the license for Station WYNZ to specify the higher class channel. See 58 FR 38547, July 19, 1993. Saga Communications of New England, Inc., the current licensee of Station WYNZ, has filed an application seeking to take advantage of the Commission's new rules permitting an upgrade in facilities by the application process rather than the rule making process (BPH&hyph;930818IC). See FM Channel and Class Modification by Application, 58 FR 38534, July 19, 1993. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.
