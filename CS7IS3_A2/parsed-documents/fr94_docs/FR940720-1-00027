FR940720-1-00027 FR940720-1-00008 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 111 Revisions to Standards for Walk-Sequenced Bulk Third-Class Mail AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule will amend the standards for walk-sequence rate mail to require an identifying marking on each piece. DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed or delivered to Manager, Advertising Mail, USPS Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260&hyph;2412. Copies of all written comments will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in Room 5540 at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph D. Moeller, (202) 268&hyph;2660. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Postal Service uses the In-Office Cost System (IOCS) and the Carrier Cost System (CCS) as tools to develop cost information for each class and subclass of mail, and for special services. This information is used to develop proposals for new postal rates and to assist in management evaluation of new rate structures. The IOCS uses work sampling to provide data for attributing labor cost to each class, subclass, and special service. The CCS is used to collect data regarding the volume of each type of mail on sampled delivery routes. These data are used to assign delivery costs to the pertinent categories of mail. In order for the IOCS and CCS to be used to examine the costs of distinct groupings of mail, each piece in the grouping must have a distinctive marking. When an individual sample is conducted, information regarding markings on the mailpiece is recorded. To better quantify the value of mailer walk-sequencing, the Postal Service would like to track the cost of third-class pieces claiming the 125-piece and saturation walk-sequence rates using IOCS and CCS. Currently this is not possible because walk-sequenced mail can be identified as such simply by including a facing slip with the phrase ``WALK-SEQUENCE CARRIER ROUTE MAIL'' on the top of each package. The proposed change would require that each individual piece contain a ``WS'' marking either on the carrier route identification line or as part of the carrier route presort endorsement. Although facing slips would still be allowed, they would no longer fulfill the requirement for identifying the mail as walk-sequenced. Although exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b), (c)) regarding proposed rulemaking by 39 U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites comments on the following proposed revisions of the DMM, incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39 CFR Part 111. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 Postal Service. PART 111_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 111 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(a); 39 U.S.C. 101, 401, 403, 404, 3001&hyph;3011, 3201&hyph;3219, 3403&hyph;3406, 3621, 3626, 5001. 2. Amend Domestic Mail Manual M304, Walk-Sequence [Carrier Route Mail Preparation], by adding a new subsection 1.3 and revising subsection 3.2 to read as follows: M304␣Walk-Sequence 1.0␣Basic Standards * * * * * 1.3␣Marking In addition to the markings required by M303, each piece claimed at a walk-sequence rate must be marked ``WS'' immediately preceding either the carrier route information on the carrier route information line (e.g., **WS CARRIER ROUTE 017) or the carrier route presort marking shown in M303 (e.g., WS CAR-RT SORT). Pieces not claimed at a walk-sequence rate must not bear the ``WS'' marking. * * * * * 3.0␣Preparation * * * * * 3.2␣Labeling In addition to the labeling required in M303, a facing slip with a phrase identifying the mail, such as ``WALK-SEQUENCED CARRIER ROUTE MAIL,'' may be placed on the top of each package. A facing slip does not satisfy the marking required on each piece by 1.3. * * * * * An appropriate amendment to 39 CFR 111.3 to reflect these changes will be published if the proposal is adopted.
