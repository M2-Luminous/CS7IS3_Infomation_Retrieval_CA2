They consider this a plot to keep the DP out of the goverment. Even worse, they claim that the CSV [Christian Social People's Party] and LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg] have already decided to form a government again after the 12 June elections. Everyone knows that this is a big lie. In Luxembourg no coalitions are formed before the elections. But accusing political opponents of this is as old as the elections themselves and as such does not need to be taken seriously. We wonder why the DP is upset right now by the attacks on its program. If I were a DP strategist, I would be very delighted by this instead of being upset. I would be glad because criticism proves that the neoliberal DP program has "reached" the voters and that its content and statements with all their social consequences are being taken seriously and are feared. Or would the DP suddenly be afraid of its own courage and shortly before the elections want to pour water in the neoliberal sacramental wine?
