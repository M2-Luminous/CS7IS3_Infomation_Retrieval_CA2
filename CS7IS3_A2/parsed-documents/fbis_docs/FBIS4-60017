In countries such as Syria and Yemen, defence and security expenditure consumed nearly half the total government spending while in the oil-rich Gulf states it far exceeded allocations for public and social services, said the report by the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). The report gave no new figures for Saudi Arabia, which has sharply boosted defence spending since the Gulf war. It also did not cover Iraq, believed to be the region's biggest spender on defence as it had the strongest army in the Arab world before being crushed by a U.S.-led coalition in the Gulf war in early 1991 after it invaded Kuwait. Most Arab states do not divulge figures on defence spending but Gulf nations have made no secret of their intentions to bolster their armies. Military experts believe Saudi Arabia and its five partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) may spend more than 50 billion dollars on arms by 2000. "High defence spending is one of the reasons for the economic problems in the Arab world and persistent budget deficits in wealthy Gulf states," said a Western diplomat in the region. "Imagine what could have happened if half of the defence allocations had been channeled into development." The AMF said defence expenditure in the 22-member Arab League accounted for 28.07 percent of the total 1992 spending of 172 billion dollars. This compared with 34.78 percent of the 1991 spending of 180.16 billion dollars. Syria, which is still technically at war with neighbouring Israel, emerged as the top spender on defence and security in the region, with allocations of 54.5 percent of the 1992 budget of 3.12 billion dollars. Yemen, now torn by civil strife, came second, with allocations of 44.55 percent of the total 1992 spending of 4.83 billion dollars. Defence spending stood at 43.75 percent in Oman, at 39 percent in Kuwait, 36 percent in Qatar, 35.89 percent in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 34.54 percent in Bahrain, 32.23 percent in Jordan and 27.8 percent in Libya. In Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia and Mauritania, it ranged between 14 and 26 percent while there were no figures for Lebanon, Djibouti and Somalia. Defence spending in Algeria was the lowest, standing at 8.23 percent. The report gave figures for Saudi Arabia in 1989, when the defence budget accounted for 25 percent of the total expenditure of 40 billion dollars. But experts believe the level could have risen as the world's top oil producer and exporter has pressed ahead with massive armament plans. Except for Jordan, Arab states suffered from budget deficits in 1992 while foreign debt, excluding that owed by Iraq, Libya and GCC nations, exceeded 150 billion dollars. A trade and balance of payments deficit also persisted in Arab states, except in major oil producers. In Kuwait, the budget deficit soared as high as 84 percent of the Gross Domestic Product while it reached 10.3 percent in Sudan, 10 percent in Yemen, 8.71 percent in Saudi Arabia and 7.28 percent in Jordan. The AMF report showed Arab spending on public services accounted for 18.67 percent in 1992 while allocations for social services stood at 26.43 percent and for economic development at 12.78 percent. "High defence allocations underscore the importance of peace in the Middle East," a Gulf-based diplomat said. "It will pay off not only in political and military terms, but in economic terms.
