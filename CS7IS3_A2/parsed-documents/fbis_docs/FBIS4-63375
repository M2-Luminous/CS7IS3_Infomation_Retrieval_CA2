He is to meet Chilean President Eduardo Frei Ruiz and hand over a message from Boris Yeltsin to him. Shumeyko said he is satisfied with the current state of bilateral relations and, in particular, in trade and economic cooperation.

Chile is the first leg of Shumeyko's trip to Latin America. "I do not share the opinion that Latin America lies far away from Russian interests", he said and added that the experience of certain countries of the region in democratic transformations and economic reforms can be useful for Russia.
