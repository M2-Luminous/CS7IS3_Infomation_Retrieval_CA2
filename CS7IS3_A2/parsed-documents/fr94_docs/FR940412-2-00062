FR940412-2-00062 FR940412-2-00043 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;328&hyph;000] National Fuel Gas Supply Corp.; Request Under Blanket Authorization April 6, 1994. Take notice that on April 1, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;328&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate a delivery point under National's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;4&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. National proposes to construct and operate a delivery point located in Ashland Township, Clarion County, Pennsylvania, for additional deliveries of gas to National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution), an existing firm transportation customer. National states that the total volumes to be delivered is estimated to be 910 Mcf annually. National indicates that this will have a minimal impact on its peak day and annual deliveries. National states that an emergency tap was installed at the proposed location on February 4, 1994, because seven residential customers of Distribution were without gas. National explains that the seven customers were out of gas due to frozen wells and related facilities which previously provided for their needs. On March 24, 1994, Distribution filed for waiver of the initial time limitation because the wells have not returned to sufficient production. National further states that it is now seeking authorization under its blanket certificate to assure continuation of service beyond the expiration of the current emergency authorization. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
