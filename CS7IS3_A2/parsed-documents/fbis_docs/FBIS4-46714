I met Georgian member of parliament and former defense minister Tengiz Kitovani in Moscow, in the Georgian embassy, at a time when people in Tbilisi were saying the Interpol had arrested him in Germany. [Saneblidze] Where are you now, Batono Tengiz, and what are you doing? [Kitovani] You're probably asking because the city is full of rumors about me. Naturally you are interested; so many changes are taking place that.... I was in Germany and flew to Moscow. There is a lot to do, because here in Moscow there are major forces working against us, both politically and economically. We should have been doing this work earlier. If you remember my speeches in Parliament, I have always said that if we lose our connections and fail to restore our good old traditions with Russia, we will suffer both economically and politically. I have said this many times to Batoni Eduard, but reactionary circles in Georgia have to some extent blocked Georgian-Russian relations. [Saneblidze] In some circles people are saying that Georgia's joining the Commonwealth is tantamount to returning to the Russian Empire. If you had attended the 1 March session of Parliament, would you have supported the ratification? [Kitovani] I am one of those who signed the Declaration of Georgian Independence. I went into the government from the national movement, I always fought for freedom, and naturally I would have abstained in every way. I wouldn't have voted for either one. We should have signed it earlier, on 3 September, when Russia wasn't even demanding that we join the CIS. By signing then, we would have signified that we were an independent country signing a treaty with a neighboring state. The whole world is divided into spheres of influence. Creating the CIS does not mean restoring the Soviet Union, it means shaping that sphere of influence. We should have known that Georgia did not and could not escape that sphere. Some big state would have swallowed up our little country, and neither the United States nor Europe had the kind of influence on Russia to keep us a separate entity, an independent country. We should have accepted our fate of remaining under Russia's influence. The examples of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan should teach us something. And Uzbekistan thinks that Russia is the guarantor of peace in Central Asia. Russia would not let Georgia go, because of our geopolitical position. History confirms this. [Saneblidze] If I understand you correctly, a Georgia without Russia is inconceivable, a fantasy, mere populism. People are saying that you have met with one party leader who refuses to think of Georgia as an independent country and believes that at best Georgia should be a Russian gubernia. Did you really meet Zhirinovskiy? [Kitovani] I did in fact meet Zhirinovskiy. I got a call from some friends in the Urals, including Sergey Lvov (they are all old dissidents), who know him well, and through them he and I met one another in the Mir Hotel, where he has an office. We had an interesting conversation. Incidentally, he showed me the Georgia-Russia Treaty document, which he was against; he is especially against Russia helping Georgia. He said, "I can't support that treaty; you said you want to quit, so go, and Russia isn't going to give you any help. Our party, and our faction in the Duma, will oppose ratification of the treaty in Parliament." [Saneblidze] Did you meet him to try to persuade him to support the treaty in the State Duma? [Kitovani] Yes. [Saneblidze] He's against it.... [Kitovani] Yes he is. We knew that, and that's why I met with him. He gave me a copy of his book "Posledniy brosok na yug" [The Last Surge to the South], where he presents a precise outline of his conception of dividing up the world. Everything he writes there is nonsense, but there is a lot behind that nonsense. Zhirinovskiy is not alone; his allies are the politicians who are interested in carrying out their policies and suppressing Georgia. [Saneblidze] Do you mean Georgian politicians? [Kitovani] Yes, Georgians, and, in particular, others as well. He is backed by a rather well known gang of four. I won't name names, because some neighboring countries may take offense, countries which are fighting us, smiling to our face and digging our grave behind our backs. They also include people who have been financing him. [Saneblidze] This move of yours--talking with Zhirinovskiy, which, for understandable reasons, was not advertised (our readers only recently found out)--was it by any decision of some parliamentary commission, an assignment by the government, or your personal initiative? [Kitovani] You know, as a member of Parliament who is concerned for our country's fate I probably have the most right to look into such a situation. I am not one of those deputies who care only about being a deputy. You are well aware that when the nation's fate was in the balance, I alone decided my nation's fate; I had no ally to stand by my side, and I am still making my own decisions. Our embassy's working conditions are difficult; they don't know what's going on here, there's no intelligence effort going on. For example, they don't know what orientation local political circles are taking. There is much we should have known earlier, because it is here that the fate of various countries--and perhaps the world--is being decided. Since Georgia's fate is being decided here, we ought to have taken more interest in Moscow. [Saneblidze] Do you think that the parliament vice speaker and the group of parliamentarians who came to meet with their Russian colleagues should have done that earlier? [Kitovani] Of course they should have started that earlier, back when we were at the pinnacle and had the Abkhazian situation won. We lost time, we were too late. Meanwhile, people like Zhirinovskiy consolidated their position, as did Ardzinba, and powerful intermediaries financed them. Not one of our politicians gave thought to the idea that many things could take a turn for the worse against us in Moscow. Water wears down the stone drop by drop, you know. It was like that here, exactly. While the war in Abkhazia went on for a year and two months, they were doing their business here. They had the press in their pocket, and they did a lot of work with the military people. We used to work with the military ourselves, but after that--well, you know what happened. [Saneblidze] On the subject of Abkhazia, I have a question. During the Sochi negotiations, at a very critical time, General Grachev offered our side the use of Russia's military forces. We refused. If you had been Defense Minister then, what decision would you have made? [Kitovani] You're referring to the 10 September meeting. Both Karkarashvili and the head of state made a big mistake. They admit that themselves. They should have accepted Grachev's offer. Abkhazia would still be ours today. Russian troop units would have come in as a force to stop the fighting, after which we should have started talks to regain the territory beyond the Gumista and place it under our jurisdiction. Of course they should have accepted it. I learned from certain sources that right after the refusal, Grachev flew off and immediately gave the order for the troops to return. [Saneblidze] Let's get back to Zhirinovskiy. There have been press reports of a split in Zhirinovskiy's party and his parliamentary faction, reports of serious opposition to him. Did you also meet with representatives of the opposition? [Kitovani] Of course I did. The opposition members are my friends. Very serious efforts are being made against him, and cracks have appeared in his policies and in the faction; one group has split off and is fighting him. My reason for staying here is to enlist these forces to put Zhirinovskiy in the same fix which he planned for us. The democrats here have not yet consolidated their positions, but the future is theirs. Another reason for my coming to Moscow was to implement the proposal to create CIS countries' peace-keeping forces. These countries' military coordination center represents virtually nothing. Each country will have to create such troops. We have experience of that kind in Georgia, for example when we and Russia together created joint peace-keeping forces in Samachablo. [Saneblidze] Such troops need to have the necessary weapons and equipment; we probably should join the peace-keeping troops with our own share of weapons. What did you all leave to the Georgian army? [Kitovani] War destroys and wrecks everything.... I'll tell you what we left the army--112 tanks, for example. There were 200 tanks in all of Transcaucasia. Half of them were ours. Also 12 aircraft, about 30 helicopters, about 24,000 or 26,000 machine guns, and ammunition for more than six echelons. Over 100 million rounds have been fired. Georgia had a pretty powerful mobile force then. [Saneblidze] You said that war destroys everything, but has it really destroyed so much that practically nothing is left? [Kitovani] The Abkhazians received quite a lot of power, and with the confrontation of these forces a lot of equipment was burned on both sides. The ammunition which we had was supposed to be enough for a 500-kilometer zone. With that potential, we should have been able to win anywhere. [Saneblidze] The Defense Ministry's archives have been sealed. Do you think some criminal actions might come to light? [Kitovani] That's ruled out, because during my time the Defense Ministry carried out no criminal transactions. I didn't take part in any financial transactions. It is not a Trade Ministry, with something to buy or sell. During my time, for example, not a single ruble was spent to purchase weapons. Everything we had was either a gift or had been transferred to us. The Abkhazian War cost about 75 billion rubles, and the things which I acquired for the Georgian Army--this is the truth--add up to more than 100 billion dollars. Every rocket that flies costs 7,000 dollars, so you can imagine how many dollars were shot off into the sky. The three air facilities which fell into the hands of the Abkhazians each cost 7 billion dollars. The equipment and weapons that were transferred to us were worth a total of 105 billion dollars. [Saneblidze] Irakli Batiashvili, the former chairman of the former Information and Intelligence Service, stated emphatically in IVERIA-EKSPRESI that General Sufyan Bepbayev--that is, the Transcaucasian Military District--had turned dilapidated tanks over to you. [Kitovani] There were no dilapidated tanks. When we retreated from Abkhazia, we moved over into Svanetia in order to avert a civil war, bypassing Zugdidi. Those tanks were operating at an elevation of 3,600 meters. If they had been dilapidated they couldn't have gone that high. But equipment requires maintenance, repairs, someone to take charge. Without maintenance your own car would fall apart. [Saneblidze] He also says that during the events of December-January you were armed by the Transcaucasian Military District, so that you could fight the Gamsakhurdia regime, and that it was they who dictated the idea of the coup to you and had you carry it out. [Kitovani] I beg your pardon! We began to oppose Gamsakhurdia when he sided with the communist putsch in August 1991. On 19 August the Guard refused to obey the red putsch and the orders of the president, who disbanded the Guard and took to the woods. Everyone knows that the military people took the side of the GKChP [the State Emergency Committee during the coup of August 1991], and why would they help us in the fight against their ally Gamsakhurdia? Our only goal was to defend democracy, and ultimately democracy won in Russia and we won in Georgia. [Saneblidze] He also said that Russian soldiers were fighting in your ranks in December-January.... [Kitovani] No way. Name one Russian who died in that--but the fighting sure took the lives of a lot of Georgian boys! Do you think bullets don't hit Russians? At that time we had quite a lot of money, Russian troops were demoralized and were selling off everything while we bought machine guns and ammunition. [Saneblidze] You used to have good relations with the top brass of the Russian Army. Is that what people have in mind when they talk about arming you? [Kitovani] You know, Grachev was with me before he became Defense Minister, and we had good relations. Human contacts like that are much more effective than official ones. When they gave us that tank division, did they give one to any other country? It was for my sake, for the sake of forming a new Defense Ministry, that they officially gave us the 108 tanks of the Akhaltsikhe Division. It is also not the case that we looked fondly upon them. They borrowed certain ideas from us too. I was the first one in the territory of the former Soviet Union to use cannons in the center of a city, when we fired on Government House. And last October, when the Russian Army was having trouble in the battle against Rutskoy's and Khasbulatov's forces ensconced in the White House, they said, Let's use Kitovani's method. And, you recall, they fired on the White House and made them give in. [Saneblidze] When are you coming back to Georgia? [Kitovani] In a while. Right now I have to go to the Urals; certain people are waiting for me there. Incidentally, the situation is tense there. I'll go, look around, and meet with workers and Cossacks who have requested a visit from me and with whom I have good relations. [Saneblidze] Your travelling and your stay in Moscow take a lot of money. Is someone financing you? [Kitovani] Of course. I have friends who are helping me financially. It's a little depressing that rumors are being spread about me in Tbilisi, but maybe it's a good thing; at least they remember me. P.S. Back in Tbilisi I called him in Moscow: "People are saying that you met Dudayev, Shanibov, Kobalia...." "Why would I do that?! Nothing of the kind took place. I had gone to Yekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk. I came to Moscow yesterday, the 22nd. There was a television report here about my unofficial visit."
