The refugees issue must also be sorted out in line with UN resolutions, including Resolution 194, the minister told a delegation of the American Peace Now Group, who were calling at his office in Amman today. The minister outlined to the delegation, visiting Jordan in the course of a regional tour, Middle East developments with special accent on the peace process and Jordan's key role there. Al-Hasan reiterated Jordan's abiding commitment to a just, durable, and comprehensive peace based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the land-for-peace formula, a complete Israeli pullback from the occupied Arab territories, and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people on their national soil. The minister spelled out the burdens placed on Jordan by the Palestinian question over the past four decades and the economic difficulties faced by Jordan as a result of the siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah. On the latter case, al-Hasan emphasized that this unjustified blocakade must be brought to an end in light of Jordan's contribution and constructive and positive approach to the peace process. The minister outlined to the delegation Jordan's democratic experience, its pluralistic multiparty system, and its respect for human rights as an irreversible option advocated by His Majesty King Husayn. On their side, the American delegation applauded Jordan's preeminent and significant contribution to the efforts to make peace and bring stability and security to the region. They were impressed by the major achievements made by Jordan and appreciated the difficulties it has been experiencing. They also expressed the need to extend assistance to Jordan to help it play its anticipated role in the peace process and to bring security and stability to the region. The meeting was attended by the American ambassador in Amman and Foreign Ministry officials.
