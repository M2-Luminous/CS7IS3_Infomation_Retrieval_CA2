"We are very satisfied. We didn't expect it to be that warm so quickly," she says, just two years after diplomatic relations were established. With the first flush of high-level contacts now over, the excitement and romance of the Sino-Israel honeymoon has begun to wear off. Diplomacy is now aimed at the practical co-operation essential to the success of the marriage. When Israeli Economics and Planning Minister, Shim'on Shetrit, arrives in Beijing today for an eight day visit, he will not be discussing glamorous international affairs, but comparing notes on the development of free-trade zones, privatisation of state enterprises, inflation control, and regional development. "We will be bringing a message of mutual co-operation and respect, not telling them we know best," he told the South China Morning Post. The visit, at the invitation of Zou Jiahua, vice premier and head of the State Planning Commission, is an indication that ties are normal and continuing to grow steadily. Officials and academic observers seem surprised by reports from Hong Kong of a three-month cooling of relations after a helicopter crash in Israel last November killed the visiting Mayor of Shenyang. The crash, said Ms Ben Abba, also killed three Israelis and nobody suspected foul play. A report on the incident is expected to blame the incident on an engine fault. "The Chinese understand accidents like this happen," she said. On another level, however, it is evident there has been some disappointment on both sides with the concrete results of two years of Commentary on-operation. "It's because expectations were too high in the first place," said Yitzhaq Shichor, associate professor at the Department of East Asian Studies of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Israel is disappointed at China's continued sales of arms and weapons technology to Iran and the Arab countries, although Foreign Ministry officials believe China has kept its pledge not to supply missiles to Iran.
