Here is what he said in his message; [Begin Delic recording] Behind us is a difficult, war-ridden 1993 during which the brutal aggression on our homeland continued. Despite the unjustly introduced embargo, the fact that the world indifferently observed the war horrors in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the difficult conditions in which members of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina waged the war, they endured in their heroism and defended their homeland and people. As a soldier of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like to wish to all the fighters of the Armed Forces, all patriots of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in both free and occupied territories, that next year, 1994, will be a year of freedom and peace. I want arms in this region to go silent. I wish for a just peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina and its people. I want people to return to their homes, families, and jobs that they performed in peace. Our people -- and by this I mean all citizens that consider Bosnia-Herzegovina their homeland -- have the right to that because of the sacrifices they made in this struggle. Regardless of everything, my message to all fighters is to remain firm and ready to stop all future offensive intentions of the aggressor. If the peace negotiations fail, we must be ready to secure the freedom and peace of our people with arms and, above all, enable them to return to their centuries-old hearths. I appeal to all those who have so far not fully participated in the struggle not only to fully contribute with arms next year, but to also strengthen in all other ways the front of our just struggle for the freedom of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. I wish the fighters all the luck in their honorable tasks and peace and freedom to all citizens of our homeland. [end recording]
