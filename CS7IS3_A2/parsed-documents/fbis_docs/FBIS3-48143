The economy "remains stagnant" with personal consumption and capital investment -- the key pillars of domestic demand -- "staying lackluster," Mieno said in an opening address to a two-day meeting of branch managers and overseas representatives. Against this backdrop, labor conditions have become "tougher," and the business sentiment has turned "more cautious," he added. Although the latest fiscal and monetary measures are expected to continue showing their effects, an economic recovery seems to require "more time," Mieno said. But the central bank intends to watch the effects of past measures, he repeated, stressing that credit easing to date is "contributing to set the environment for macroeconomic recovery" by facilitating corporate restructuring programs. Meanwhile, Mieno noted that lending by private financial institutions has remained weak and the money supply has continued to post low growth despite record-renewing drops in lending rates in line with the latest discount rate cut in September to an all-time low of 1.75 percent. Mieno attributed the distant recovery outlook to cautious activities among companies and financial institutions stemming from lingering problems in clearing losses incurred during asset deflation after the collapse of the "bubble" economic boom of the late 1980s. He also cited continued corporate restructuring in "trade divisions" to cope with the yen's appreciation. But Mieno reiterated that capital stock adjustments have progressed, and "pressure in this sense" is expected to "head toward easing." Under these circumstances, Mieno called on banks to continue liquidating bad loans "steadily." He stressed the importance of "fully" utilizing market "vitality" in promoting adjustments and putting the economy on a path toward sustainable growth without inflation. BOJ branch managers from 30 domestic branches and three overseas representatives gathered in Tokyo to report on the economic conditions of their repective areas. Attention is fixed on whether the two-day meeting would lead the central bank to ease its monetary policy at a crucial time for the government that on Friday failed to pass the political reform bills through the upper house of the Diet. With the failure expected to cause a possible delay in the launching of a new fiscal package slated for this week, and with the market plunging again, hopes for a rate cut are rekindling after receding amid the stock market rally over the past week. Tokyo stocks took a steep dive of more than 800 points in the key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues Monday morning.
