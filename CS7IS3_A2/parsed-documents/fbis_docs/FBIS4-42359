Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos indirectly criticized the labor minister, stressing that the government always had the prospect of a four-year term. Yiannopoulos said: "National elections will most likely be held when the president's term expires in May 1995. I hope the parties will agree on the election of a new president to avoid new elections, but I am afraid we will have national elections." Commenting on Yiannopoulos' assessment, the spokesman said: "We have repeatedly said, as can also be seen from the parliamentary and political facts, that the government had the prospect of a four-year term from the outset. Besides, the least of the Greek people's demands is political stability and on this basis it elected the country's government last October." In a statement yesterday, during the presentation of a social tourism program, the labor minister questioned the other parties' goodwill (particularly Political Spring and KKE) toward a common candidacy (Samaras spoke about a premature discussion and Papariga about disorientation) and predicted elections.
