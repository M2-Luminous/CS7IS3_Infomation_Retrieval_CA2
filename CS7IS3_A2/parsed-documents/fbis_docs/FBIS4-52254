They hope either to settle in Russia or defect to the ROK. It has been learned that these North Korean agricultural technicians are living scattered in such areas as Moscow, Siberia, Sakhalin, and Uzbekistan. Some of them have already visited the ROK Embassy in Russia, Korean Russians, or ROK businesses to express their desire to defect, a diplomatic source in Seoul said on 7 May. The source said, "They are all specialized technicians who have been dispatched to Russia after meticulous screening by North Korean authorities. Therefore, they enjoy a better life economically and are treated better in Russia than the escaping North Korean Siberian loggers. For this reason, they pose a less urgent problem than the escaping loggers in our effort to resolve the problem for them." In fact, many more of them than the loggers who are in the similar situation have married Russian women and hope to settle in Russia. A considerable number of them are working at a Russian agricultural institute or research institute. Therefore, they will pose a far less problem than the loggers in respect of their settlement in Russia or defection to the ROK. The source, however, said, "In view of their moves, living conditions, and relations with Russia, it is too early for the ROK Government to deal with the problem of assisting their defection and settlement in Russia." Therefore, the problem of these agricultural technicians may well be dealt with after the settlement of the problem of the escaping loggers. North Korea began dispatching the agricultural technicians to Russia in the latter half of 1980's to learn agricultural technology in order to improve North Korean agriculture and increase its food production. However, some of these technicians made moves for defecting to the ROK and settling in Russia after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the ROK and the Soviet Union. Therefore, North Korea began to summon them against their wishes. The North Korean agricultural technicians dispatched to Russia are estimated to number about 150.
