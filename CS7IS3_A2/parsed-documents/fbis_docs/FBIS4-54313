The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The government of our Republic is striving consistently to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. It is a consistent stand of our party and the government of our Republic to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We have already put forth on several occasions the most reasonable and fair proposals and suggestions for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and are doing all we can for its realization. However, the United States and the South Korean authorities are viciously clinging to the anti-Republic commotions, finding fault with the fictitious nuclear issue of ours. The nuclear suspicion commotions staged by the United States and the South Korean authorities while absurdly placing blame on us are an extremely unjust act that will never get through anywhere. Its purpose is to strengthen the country's power industry base while speaking of our country's nuclear activities. Our nuclear program is, to all intents and purposes, peaceful. We have clarified more than once that we have neither any intention nor capability to develop nuclear weapons. The whole world knows about this. As a matter of fact, we feel no need to develop them and, even if we were to manufacture one or two of them, they would be useless. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has been raised by the United States, not by us, which brought in the nuclear weapons into South Korea and posed the nuclear threats against us. As has already been exposed, the United States occupied South Korea, a strategic point, and brought massive nuclear weapons into South Korea from the mid-1950's to realize its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy opposing our Republic. Since then, South Korea has been turned into a nuclear advanced base which is the largest in the Far East region in which some 1,000 U.S. made-nuclear weapons of various type are deployed. In order to make a preemptive nuclear attack on us, extremely dangerous nuclear war exercises, such as the Team Spirit joint military exercise, are continuously staged in South Korea. This shows that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has cropped up entirely due to the United States and the South Korean authorities. This is also clear proof that the nuclear threat comes from the South, not from the North. Regardless, the United States is frenzied in the nuclear suspicion commotions while placing blame on us. In recent years, the Cold War has ended internationally and the non-aggression agreement and the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula have been adopted between the North and South. Under such conditions, the United States has lost any justification for the presence of the nuclear weapons and aggressive troops in South Korea. Therefore, the United States has conjured up a fictitious nuclear suspicion about us and is deliberately increasing the tension on the Korean peninsula to a critical point so as to trump up an excuse for a continued occupation of South Korea and in order to isolate [korip] and crush [apsal] our republic which is advancing under the banner of socialism. The South Korean authorities are also frenzied in the new war provocation maneuvers, following the U.S. nuclear commotions, to crush the fellow countrymen with swords borrowed from outside forces so as to achieve reunification by prevailing over communism. The United States and the South Korean authorities, the ones who brought the issue of nuclear threats on the Korean peninsula, are perpetrating the nuclear suspicion commotions by placing blame on us who have neither will nor capacity nor need to develop nuclear weapons. This is an act like a thief turning on the victim with a club and should never be tolerated. Since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has stemmed from the United States' hostile policy towards the DPRK, it must be resolved through dialogue between us and the United States. The United States also admitted the need and negotiated with the DPRK last year. The joint statement agreed upon and published by both sides at the talks points out explicitly that the United States should not pose nuclear threats against us; that both countries should respect each other's sovereignty and should not interfere in domestic affairs; and that they support the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the United States has overturned the agreements it reached with us and brought the DPRK-U.S. talks to a rupture, driving the situation in our country to extremity and setting even international organizations in motion to put pressure upon us. This shows that the United States is persistently adhering to the anti-Republic maneuver even after the announcement of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. However, pressure can never be a solution to the problem. It is a miscalculation if it thinks that our people who regard independence as their lifeblood, will be brought to their knees by means of pressure and force. If the United States continues to clamor for putting pressure on our republic, we will be compelled to take due measures of self-defense to safeguard the dignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country. Whether the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is resolved in a peaceful way or not depends entirely on the attitude of the United States. If the United States sincerely wishes the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it must suspend the international pressure commotions against our republic and take a sincere attitude towards the DPRK-U.S. talks. International organizations must not comply with the unjust demands of a big country, but abide by the principles of justice and fairness to render contribution to the resolution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula.
