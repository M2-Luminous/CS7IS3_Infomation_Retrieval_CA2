Mr. Athon said the money has not yet been provided to any private agency as the ministry has not yet completed drafting regulations to control spending. As the 100-million-baht allocation involves both a revolving fund and grant aid, Mr. Athon said strict control is needed to prevent any loopholes in funding administration. Secretary-general of the Environmental Policy and Planning Office Santhat Somchiwit said private projects aimed at solving serious environmental problems such as forest deterioration and water pollution will be given priority. Mr. Santhat said private firms can apply for loans for the construction of waste water or industrial waste treatment systems. Nonprofit nongovernmental organisations can request grants. He said about 90 percent of the 100 million-baht fund will go to NGOs involved in environmental protection and conservation. Each group is expected to receive about five million baht. Special consideration and promotion will be given to action-oriented projects whose implementation is practical and has bright achievement prospects, said Mr. Santhat. Thirty-three NGOs are registered as agencies working on protecting the environment in Thailand. Mr. Santhat said he wants NGOs to help ``narrow the gap'' between the state and the people over certain development projects facing opposition from local people. Information about those projects will be passed on to the NGOs for further dissemination to the local people. Although 100 million baht was considered minimal, Mr. Santhat said the amount could be adjusted in the future. The Environment Fund was established under the 1992 National Environmental Quality Preservation and Promotion Act, with contributions of 5.5 billion baht. Seventy percent of the fund was government allocation. The remaining 30 percent came from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Parts of the fund have already been provided for the drafting of provincial-level environmental protection master plans with special focuses on installing waste water treatment systems and tackling pollution, Mr. Santhat said.
