FR940921-1-00003 FR940921-1-00001 The FAA estimates that 141 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $124,080, or $880 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: De Havilland, Inc.: 94&hyph;NM&hyph;127&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;102, &hyph;103, and &hyph;106 series airplanes, serial numbers 3 through 369 inclusive; and Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;301, &hyph;311, and &hyph;314 series airplanes, serial numbers 100 through 370 inclusive; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent engine flameout following a lightning strike, accomplish the following: (a) Within 45 days after the effective date of this AD, perform a visual inspection of the mounting clamps and ``breakout junctions'' in the metal overbraid to verify the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the electronic engine control (EEC), in accordance with de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;18 (for Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes), or S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;19 (for Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes), both dated April 29, 1994, as applicable. If any discrepancy is found, prior to further flight, correct the discrepancy in accordance with the applicable service bulletin. (b) Within 45 days after the effective date of this AD, perform an electrical resistance measurement of Class A and Class B shield grounds in accordance with de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;18 (for Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes), or S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;19 (for Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes), both dated April 29, 1994, as applicable. (1) For Class A shield grounds: If the electrical resistance exceeds the value specified in the service bulletin, within 50 flight hours after performing the resistance measurement repair in accordance with the applicable service bulletin. (2) For Class B shield grounds: If the electrical resistance exceeds the value specified in the service bulletin, within 180 days after performing the resistance measurement repair in accordance with the applicable service bulletin. (c) For Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;102, &hyph;103, and &hyph;106 series airplanes on which an interim shield ground is installed in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 93 of the Accomplishment Instructions of de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;18, dated April 29, 1994: Within one year after the effective date of this AD, restore the airplane to the Post-Modification 8/0772 configuration in accordance with paragraph 161 of the Accomplishment Instructions of that service bulletin. (d) For Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;301, &hyph;311, and &hyph;314 series airplanes on which an interim shield ground is installed in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 112 of the Accomplishment Instructions of de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;19, dated April 29, 1994: Within one year after the effective date of this AD, restore the airplane to the Post-Modification 8/0772 configuration in accordance with paragraph 200 of the Accomplishment Instructions of that service bulletin. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), ANE&hyph;170, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199), to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on September 15, 1994. Donald L. Riggin, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
