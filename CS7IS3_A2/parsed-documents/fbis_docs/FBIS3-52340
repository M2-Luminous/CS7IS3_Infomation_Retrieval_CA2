He began his talks in a meeting with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz at the Foreign Ministry. After a news conference, the two proceeded to the Presidential Palace, where a meeting was held with President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. President al-Hirawi held a dinner banquet in honor of Hurd, which was attended by Birri, al-Hariri, Buwayz, and a number of ministers. At a news conference following his talks with Buwayz, the British foreign secretary said that his visit to Beirut has two goals: The first is to learn all the latest developments regarding the peace process that pertain to Lebanon. He said: We in Britain realize that peace must be comprehensive and involve an agreement between Israel and Lebanon as well as the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 to open the way for the implementation of the al-Ta'if Agreement and to enable Lebanon to regain its full independence. This is important to us. Hurd added: The second goal goes beyond the peace process. You in Lebanon are embarking on a reconstruction process after the war with skill, enthusiasm, and dynamism, as anyone would expect from the Lebanese on economic issues. I am anxious to understand what is happening so that we in Britain can translate this into cooperation and assistance, and this is what I did. I am pleased to note that our British exports to Lebanon increased quickly in the last month of last year. I am very pleased that British companies are interested in the airport project. I hope that the increasing exchange of trade and ministerial visits will help promote such cooperation. He added: I want cooperation to expand to include the cultural field, cooperation between our armed forces, and cooperation in combating drug trafficking. Hurd explained that he did not come as a mediator in the Middle East negotiations. But Britain has an interest in the success of the peace process, and if it can do something to help, it will do so without becoming a mediator. Hurd said: Lebanon is a principal partner in the Middle East peace process. Peace must be comprehensive. We welcomed the September agreement between the PLO and Israel. We think that this is a very important step forward. But it is clear to me that it will not become final until agreements are concluded between Israel and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. We are maintaining close contacts with the Jordanians, the Israelis, and the Syrians. He noted that the summit meeting between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad is very important and expressed the hope that it will advance the negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track and make it possible to overcome the difficulties. He noted that he is in touch with the U.S. secretary of state on the peace process. Hurd affirmed Britain's support for UN Security Council Resolution 425 and said: All these matters are linked to the al-Ta'if Agreement, which we strongly support. These matters must be implemented in stages. Resolution 425 and the al-Ta'if Agreement-- which we support--are the basis for progress and for Lebanon regaining its complete freedom. Minister Buwayz said: [Begin recording] [Buwayz] I would like first to welcome His Excellency Minister Douglas Hurd on his visit to Lebanon. As you know, and as I have already said during my visit to the United Kingdom, Britain has a long history that qualifies it to understand the problems of this area. There is no doubt that as Arab foreign ministers we have repeatedly called for effective participation by the European countries. When we refer to the European countries, we include Britain, of course. We think that in view of Britain's historical role in the Middle East, it is qualified to play a role in bilateral negotiations and in the peace process. The talks between us dealt with the regional situation, the peace process, and ways to promote economic and cultural cooperation between Lebanon and Britain. We think that Lebanon's democracy, its free economic system, and the effectiveness of the Lebanese private sector provide numerous common denominators between the two countries and peoples and make it possible to discuss ways for fruitful cooperation. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did Secretary Hurd suggest anything new to advance the peace process? [Buwayz] Mr. Hurd is closely following the peace process. There is no doubt that as a result of his visit and becoming acquainted with the Lebanese views on the occupied territory in the south, he will be able to play a role in one way or another. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] implementation of Resolution 425? [Buwayz] I think that you have heard Mr. Hurd clearly state Britain's frank position on this resolution. I imagine that Britain is known for its firm views and positions. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you regard the British role today as complementing the U.S. role [words indistinct]? [Buwayz] I imagine that there is cooperation between Britain, the United States, and a number of European states to promote the peace process. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what about the British role in the reconstruction of Lebanon? Were there new developments on this matter? [Buwayz] Of course, we held talks on this matter. As you know, British companies specialize in various sectors. I think that Britain is interested in Lebanon because of its democratic system and free economy and because of the things we have in common. [end recording]
