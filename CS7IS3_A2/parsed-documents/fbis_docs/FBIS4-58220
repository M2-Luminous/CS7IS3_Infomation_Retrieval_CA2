FBIS4-58220 "drnes085_j_94002" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Kuwait Reporters Refute CNN Report on `Prisoners of Conscience' Reporters Refute CNN Report on `Prisoners of Conscience' LD2804205494 Kuwait KSC Television in Arabic 1800 GMT 28 Apr 94 LD2804205494 Kuwait KSC Television Arabic BFN [Statement issued by the Association of Kuwaiti Correspondents; date and place not given] [Text] Quoting a report by the U.S. Overseas Press Club, the Cable News Network, CNN, has reported that there are 22 correspondents held in jail in Kuwait as prisoners of conscience. The Association of Kuwaiti Correspondents, which was astonished by such a report and its timing, especially as it was carried by a network that is particular about its sources and its information, would like to indicate that the information and figures contained in this report are totally false. The association would also like to express its deep disappointment and indignation at the release of such reports on the State of Kuwait. Through this statement, the association would like to stress that there is not one single prisoner of conscience in Kuwait, and that the State of Kuwait is one of the few countries in the world where there are no prisoners of conscience. The truth of the matter, and in order to correct the information, is that the report carried by CNN, which was quoting the U.S. Overseas Press Club, concerns those who collaborated with the authorities of the treacherous Iraqi enemy during its occupation of the State of Kuwait. Those collaborators took part in the publication of what was called AL-NIDA paper. This paper was the mouthpiece of the despotic Iraqi regime and it expressed its criminal and erroneous policies and harmed Kuwait's political and diplomatic standing during the period of the tyrannical occupation. Those collaborators, which were concerned by the totally false report, worked for the benefit of the Iraqi enemy occupying the land of Kuwait and carried out actions aimed at weakening the morale of the Kuwaiti people and their spirit of resistance by taking part in the publication of what was called AL-NIDA paper. Those mentioned in that fabricated report are now in prison because they collaborated with the Iraqi enemy and not because of an opinion they wrote in the Kuwaiti press or because of a viewpoint they expressed in that press. It is worth noting that all those prisoners are craftsmen and technicians specialized in printing and maintenance of printing equipment, and that the majority hold Iraqi and Jordanian citizenships. As is common knowledge, these people were tried by the Kuwaiti justice -- which is renowned for its fairness -- for collaborating with the Iraqi occupying enemy. Their trial was held in open sessions and in the presence of the international press, TV stations, news agencies, Red Cross delegates, and organizations concerned with human rights. The CNN correspondent was one of those attending those trials. All legal guarantees were offered to the prisoners concerned during their trial. Everyone witnessed the impartiality and fairness of those trials. The Association of Kuwaiti Correspondents would like to reaffirm that there are no prisoners of conscience in the State of Kuwait and it wishes the CNN and the U.S. Overseas Press Club to check the accuracy of their information before reporting them. The Association is also totally prepared to cooperate to clarify any piece of information that any side would like to verify on the situation of journalists and the press in the State of Kuwait.
