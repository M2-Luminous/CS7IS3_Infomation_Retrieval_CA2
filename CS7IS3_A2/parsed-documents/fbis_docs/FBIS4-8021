According to the article, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] of Russia, "will pay a private visit to Bratislava from 16 to 19 May this year," at the invitation of Bratislava businessman Ladislav Mojzis, 37, owner of the West Club, a discotheque, cafe, and restaurant in the Koliba district of Bratislava. Mojzis, who claims to be "Zhirinovskiy's friend of long standing," tells the PRAVDA reporter that the visit "will have an exclusively private character" and that "our guest does not wish any contacts with political parties and mass media." The date of the visit was reportedly arranged by Dr. Jozef Lauko, another Bratislava resident and "friend of Zhirinovskiy," during the recent LDP congress in Moscow, where Lauko had been invited as "guest of honor." Mojzis claims that he had known Zhirinovskiy "long before he became involved on the political scene of the former USSR." According to the PRAVDA reporter, Mojzis denies that he is a member of the Slovak National Party "or any other party." He also rejects the reporter's suspicion that the visit's main objective is to promote his business. Although Mojzis concedes that Zhirinovskiy will be staying in the West Club, he asserts that "we do not need any advertising."
