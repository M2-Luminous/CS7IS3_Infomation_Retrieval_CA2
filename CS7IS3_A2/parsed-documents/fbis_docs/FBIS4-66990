He also said that "the reason why they call us that is that banks in Thailand accept deposits freely with no questions asked. Thus, money is flowing into the banks from all corners of the world and from within the country. Some of this money may come from illegal activities such as heroin, marijuana, and cocaine trafficking, trafficking in war weapons, activities carried on by international gangs, corruption, numbers rackets, embezzlement, fraud, and smuggling. Even though this money comes from illegal activities, once it enters the banking system, it becomes `clean money.' It has in effect been `laundered.' In the end, that money will be used to buy land, build hotels, buy stock shares, build huge entertainment establishments, or invest in major business activities. The result is that those people become millionaires. Wherever they go, people praise them. They engage in merit-making activities as a front or donate huge sums of money," said Mr. Khanin. "If we know that people are laundering money like this, why hasn't something been done about this?" asked the reporter? The MP from Chonburi took a deep breath before replying. "It's because our banks do not impose any conditions on making deposits or transferring money into an account. And they have never had to check to see where that money comes from. Instead, they view money like a god. The more the better. In effect, they are helping to promote the illegal activities of those people. Because regardless of how tainted the money is, it can be laundered in a second," said MP Khanin. He then talked about what other countries are doing about this problem. "In other countries, they conduct an investigation if large sums of money are deposited or if there are unusual deposits. If it cannot be proven that the money was earned legally, the money is seized. They have laws to control the laundering of money obtained illegally. But Thailand still doesn't have such a law. I think that the ministries of finance and interior should push for the promulgation of such a law. We must take quick action on this. Otherwise, Thailand will become the money-laundering center of the world," said MP Khanin about what will happen. Yes, if we continue to ignore this, some people may think that the government itself is laundering money.
