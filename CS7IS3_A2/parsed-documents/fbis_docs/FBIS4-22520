To what extent is all of this topical for the current Russian economy? [Dyuryagin] In cooperation with the republic timber exchange, we decided to establish and properly adjust an instrument for the gold futures market and titles of ownership for gold. Insofar as futures trading in freely convertible currency is developing fairly successfully in Russia at present, in particular for the American dollar and German mark, we concluded that the time has come to provide the opportunity for those who so aspire, to accomplish the preparatory work for possible liberalization of gold trading in accordance with the president's decree on creation of the precious metals exchange and formation of the gold market. The creation of such a futures market seems entirely realistic to us, insofar as gold is a commodity even more liquid than freely convertible currency. As we know, the state is not yet regulating the free circulation of gold in the country. Therefore, trading session participants have decided to provisionally consider as gold "gold certificates" of the Ministry of Finance and their shares issued by certain banks. [Kalinkovich] What structures are participating in the futures trading? [Dyuryagin] Today 36 participants have joined together in the futures market for gold. These are mainly insurance and financial companies and banks. In the present stage, we see our main objective as developing the technology of exchange futures trading in gold. It is important here to have a certain technological base, and in the event the Council of Ministers adopts a resolution on creation of a "gold exchange," we will be prepared to conduct full-fledged futures trading based on accumulated experience. This is our strategic objective. As far as today is concerned, market participants have the opportunity to gather together twice a week in the exchange building and carry on futures trading. This is purely an exchange game in which all the participants have the opportunity to derive profit from short-term price fluctuations. I would particularly like to emphasize that the entire operation is built on pure enthusiasm insofar as there is no ready market, you understand, and we all have a sense today of being pioneers in this endeavor. [Kalinkovich] How do your brokers feel? [Dyuryagin] The fact that brokers working in the exchange would so accurately divine the dynamics of price changes with respect to futures right from the initial sessions, I will state candidly, was a pleasant surprise to me. Their assessments coincide virtually entirely with the conclusions of their colleagues on the New York exchange. And today, now that a month of operation has gone by, I find it pleasant to realize that we are acting in unison with people who have far greater experience. Despite the fact that there has been no shortage of forecasters in Russia in recent times announcing the imminent and rapid rise in price of gold to $410-450 per troy ounce, the predictions of our brokers turned out to be the most accurate--in actuality the price fluctuated between $380-390 per troy ounce, which coincided virtually entirely with the dynamics of world prices for gold. Incidentally, the recent drop in prices at many world exchanges was accurately divined by the brokers at our exchange. And the price has dropped here as well over this time. [Kalinkovich] So the fact is--all 30 or more trading session participants do not lose? They only win? [Dyuryagin] Naturally, winning and losing are two sides of the same coin. But here is where the chief meaning behind the exchange game lies. I will note that the banks that participate in our trading sessions do not play with the assets of their clients, but rather with their own money.
