Both partners signed a research and development agreement on Monday, according to Cedra. This four-year agreement will make it possible to conduct research activities in two laboratories, one on Sweden's Aspoe Island, the other in Grimsel, Switzerland. In Grimsel, Cedra has been operating a laboratory 450 meters below the Juchlistock summit. With this agreement, both countries will reinforce and enhance the existing scientific relations, Cedra said. Scientists will establish new safety measures with a view to applying them at disposal sites.
