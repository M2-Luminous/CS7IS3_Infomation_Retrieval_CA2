Yesterday, Bernard-Henri Levy [French writer] announced a "Sarajevo" list. Today, Alexandre Minkowski [French professor] is due to confirm his intention of fighting a campaign in which the Bosnian tragedy would be one of the central themes. The emotional impact of these initiatives, if they are confirmed, will be strong and will give the campaign an unexpected tone. The leaders of the "big" lists will be questioned on ground which they were planning to avoid. The intrusion of this tragic war into the debate on Europe will strengthen the public's image of the Twelve's impotence and hence revive the question of European legitimacy. Indeed, how can people be criticized for questioning the meaning of Europe if it cannot help to settle conflicts causing bloodshed within it? But, at the same time, how can they be made to understand that the Twelve's responsibility lies not so much in their present paralysis, to which they are doomed, as in the criminal lack of foresight they demonstrated before the war broke out? Even if Europe had had or now had the political will to become involved in the conflict, it does not have the military means of doing so. This obvious fact should not calm our revulsion, but it should prompt us to moderate our European fervor. Maastricht is only at stake in this lamentable affair to the extent that the misleading campaign waged during the referendum presented that treaty as a panacea serving a utopia. The Bosnian tragedy brings us back to the reality of Europe. It is a good thing that it should emerge in the campaign. Not to generate new illusions, which could lead us to believe that there is still time for the Twelve to intervene (what intervention and stemming from what unity?), but to ensure that we finally understand that, for a long time to come, Europe, and especially if it is expanded, will never be more than a community of interests, in the least lofty sense of the word.
