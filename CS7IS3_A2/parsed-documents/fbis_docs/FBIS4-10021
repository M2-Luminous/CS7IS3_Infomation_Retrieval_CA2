During an encounter with national and international media, Robaina said that even though political affiliations are not expected to dominate the meeting, scheduled to take place at the end of April, "there will be lots of color" in its composition. The foreign relations minister explained that issues to be analyzed jointly with the emigres evolve solely around immigration matters, but the meeting is a door that is being opened and a bridge leading to future meetings. He immediately rejected the possibility that the meeting could be negatively affected by positions adopted by those groups headquartered in the United States, which he described as hysterical. Robaina pointed out that the gathering constitutes a meeting between those Cubans of goodwill living overseas and those living on the island. In another part of his statements, he referred to relations with the United States, explaining that Cuba is always willing to accept any economic arrangements provided Washington does not attach any preconditions. Robaina explained: We maintain excellent economic ties with numerous countries that have political systems different from our own. Regarding the United States, we do not want to have such abysmal differences exist as a result of an obstinate attitude that has not changed, except for the dropping of the aggressive language used in the past. The foreign minister also criticized the U.S. decision to exclude Cuba from the so-called continental summit to take place in Miami at the end of this year. We must evaluate the real intentions behind this type of meeting, Robaina stated, and if it is in any way related to interest in isolating a country that in no way accepts conditions. The Cuban foreign minister also expressed satisfaction with the results of his recent trip to several Asian nations and indicated that he was able to determine these nations' interest in Cuba's sugar, education, and public health experiences. He added that the nations visited expressed interest in investing in areas such as crude oil, nickel, textile industry, and much more. Robaina confirmed that on Monday he will be heading to South America in answer to invitations from the Governments of Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, as well as an unofficial visit to Paraguay.
