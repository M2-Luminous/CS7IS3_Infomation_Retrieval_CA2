Could you please confirm this and tell us how much? I also have another question. Has the government decided to support the candidacy of Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Bernd Niehaus for the post of OAS secretary general? [Cristiani] There is no final word on fuel prices yet. Right now we are in the final negotiations stage with the oil companies to open up or liberate oil imports or their finished byproducts. In other words, fuels that do not necessarily require handling by RASA [Autonomous Refinery of El Salvador]. RASA is an enterprise that has two of the main oil companies as shareholders. There is another oil company that has requested permission to import finished products. We have been waiting because this requires facilities and these are being built by the company in Acajutla. We believe the negotiations on how the free import scheme is to operate should be finished in the next two weeks. The government would still retain certain controls, although not in pricing. This is a complicated matter not just because of refining but because of the San Jose Pact, which is an agreement between governments. We believe, however, that with the drop in oil prices it is quite possible that when the prices are liberated these in turn will drop. The question remains as to how much and I cannot say right now. Current prices are based on, I believe, $19 a barrel, and I understand the price is approximately $17 right now. Do not take these as hard and fast figures, but more or less this is the proportion. The idea is to take advantage of the liberalization and not have the government, like what has been done in the past, fix prices. Regarding support to Bernd Niehaus' candidacy, an agreement was signed during the presidential meeting in Nicaragua, wherein we Central Americans pledged to support him. El Salvador continues supporting Bernd Niehaus' candidacy. [Moderator] Jorge Barahona, Teleprensa. [Barahona] [words indistinct] public workers will get a new wage increase. We would like to know when will this become effective and what will be the amount? [Cristiani] We believe that the increase will be sometime in the middle of the fiscal year. We must remember the budget does not include a specified amount for wage increases. Savings, however, have been made from the time the budget was implemented to meet this increase. The other thing that must be taken into consideration is no amount has been decided on, but we would try to match the yearly inflation rate taking into account the latest rate and the projected one to try and ensure public workers are not unduly affected in their purchasing power, and that they even receive a real increase, like last year. These are the overall parameters, but naturally, we have the defense minister [chuckles] [pauses] I mean the finance minister, who analyzes how the budget itself is executed. We are sure we will be able to grant a wage increase about the middle of the year. Logically, our administration ends 1 June, so we would have to decide on the increase before, even though it becomes effective after we leave office, but bear in mind that we cannot leave a budget problem for the new administration. Regrettably, when we took office we were left with a completely unbalanced budget. You will recall that during the electoral campaign all public workers got an unbudgeted 200 colon increase. When the second half of the fiscal year came, which was when we took office, there were no funds. This became a very serious problem. We do not want to leave this sort of problem. If we grant an increase it will be because the funds are available. [Moderator] Mauricio Ramirez from Megavision. [Ramirez] Mr. President, in light of FMLN's [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] concern -- the left-wing's concern about not having representatives in the department juntas, an FMLN delegation has traveled to the United Nations. Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] magistrates have said the United Nations have no say in the country's electoral affairs. Would your government be willing to follow UN secretary general recommendations? [Cristiani] We, as the government, have nothing whatosever to do with electoral topics. You must remember the peace agreements changed the Central Election Council to the TSE, raising the member to the rank of magistrate. The law specifies that the TSE magistrates are the only ones who can interpret or execute the electoral law. The electoral law is also the result of the peace agreements, therefore not only was it raised to the rank of tribunal and the peace agreements yielded an electoral code, but the TSE was formed as a formula resulting from the peace agreements. Perhaps we should take into account that the result is nothing more than what the TSE has considered the current law should be. We, as the government, have nothing whatsoever to do with this and do not plan to exert any influence one way or the other. What has been done over the weekend was to hold an ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] party meeting to study the FMLN-Democratic Convergence [CD] coalition request. We consider their claim as a political party is partly justified. I believe ARENA is going to do something about this. Their claim is partly justified when one takes into account the complexity of the various coalitions or the ways they are participating in the elections, and this is where, I believe, the main problem lies, and where the TSE does not have much latitude. Upon examining the electoral code and its reforms, perhaps what takes place every 15 years was not taken into account. In other words, if we think of elections only in terms of the president, or if elections for deputies and mayors are only held, which is what normally takes place in the country, then there would be no problem because it would be a single coalition, and therefore the current electoral code covers it. When studying this in comparison with ARENA, we saw there are gaps when both types of elections are held simultaneously every 15 years. We believe the FMLN-CD coalition is partly correct in their claim. We do not think their complete claim is justified; they want more than they deserve. I am not going to take a stand on this now; this will be up to the party. ARENA is willing to discuss certain methods of resolving this problem. The United Nations is not in a position to interpret our electoral code. This task pertains only to the TSE. We believe it is a mistake to run and get outside help everytime a domestic problem arises. It is as if we need to complain to someone abroad and have someone resolve our problems. I think these problems need to be resolved domestically. To my way of thinking this has no other purpose than to stir things up for propaganda purposes. I repeat, the party studied this and their claim is partly justified. I believe this problem can be resolved. [Moderator] Mr. President, the last question is from Mario Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast. [Jovel] Mr. President, which parties in the Electoral Code are you referring to when simultaneous elections for president, vice president, deputies and mayors are held? The other question is: Does the government have information on Salvadorans who could have suffered in the Los Angeles, California earthquake? The third question is: When will the deployment of the [words indistinct] in Santa Tecla and Cuzcatlan? [Cristiani] When I mentioned the complexity of the electoral process, it was in regard to the following. There are problems with the diverse coalitions because in one department they can be participating as political parties -- individually -- however, at the same time they could be part of another candidacy within a coalition formed by those same parties in which they are participating individually. For example, in the San Salvador Department or at national level, the CD as well as the FMLN participate as political parties individually for deputies. Nevertheless, for the presidential ticket, they do not participate as individual parties; they participate nationwide as a coalition. We believe this can be partially resolved so all interests -- individual as well as coalitions' interests -- can be represented in the department juntas or have representation in the department juntas to oversee the interests of the individual party as well as of the coalitions. This would be without duplicating representatives because this would mean wanting to have more than what is allowed. This makes reference to all those who form a coalition. Up to now we only have knowledge of seven different coalitions in seven departments. I am not sure how all of this has been worked out. They organized a mix up of sorts. They are running individually on one side and in a coalition on the other. It is legal to form coalitions, no one is questioning this; however, this is what has probably created the problem. In addition to the fact that the Electoral Code did not foresee these general elections for president, vice president as well as for deputies and mayors at the same time. One has a tendency to think of the elections in terms of only for president and vice president or only for mayors and deputies. This has been the general rule. Nevertheless, any party that forms a coalition in this fashion -- that is, a persons runs individually on one side and in a coalition for another candidacy -- will face the same problem. I believe this can be resolved by having representatives on the juntas. This was analyzed within ARENA. The party has offered to do something to avoid problems with this. What was the second question? [Jovel] Do you have knowledge of Salvadorans who have been victims of the earthquake? [Cristiani] We have not had any report on this so far. We are waiting for our Los Angeles, San Francisco consul to report to us, probably through the Foreign Ministry. For the time being, we do not have any information. [Words indistinct] The new deployment will take place this week. I believe today approximately 300 new agents will graduate from the Academy. They are always granted a couple of days to prepare for the serious issues they will have to face. As the saying goes: Dating is a different thing than living with someone. [laughter]. The Academy is one thing and once they are out on the streets, it is something else. They are given two days to strengthen themselves morally and rest up. We expect to initiate the new deployment in those two municipalities this week. We would like to leave you now with the finance minister. He will make a couple of announcements and then he will take your questions.
