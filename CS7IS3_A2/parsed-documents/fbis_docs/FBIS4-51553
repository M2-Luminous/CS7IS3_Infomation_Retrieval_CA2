Hata will explain to European leaders the political developments that led to the breakup of the seven-party coalition, government officials said. Hata, who formed a minority government after the coalition's biggest party, the Social Democratic Party, defected from the alliance, will pledge to continue the reform drive launched by his predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa in the field of politics, administration and economy. Hosokawa's coalition government ousted the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last August after almost four decades of its unchallenged rule. With the annual summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations in July drawing close, Hata will also elaborate on Japan's efforts to boost world economic growth, such as income tax cuts, deregulation, market opening and pump-priming measures to stimulate domestic demand, the officials said. Foreign Ministry officials, however, expressed concern whether Hata will be able to put on a strong performance as it is widely believed that his government will be short-lived. The majority opposition could force Hata and his cabinet to step down or to dissolve the House of Representatives to call a general election as soon as the budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1, has been adopted by the Diet. He might want to ask for some advice in Italy, the first leg of his trip and host of the Naples summit, where the average lifespan of postwar cabinets has not exceeded 309 days, with the power vacuum between the formation of cabinets averaging some 33 days. In Rome, Hata, traveling in the company of his wife Yasuko and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura, is scheduled to hold talks with both outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and incoming Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose rightist Freedom Alliance won a landslide victory in March general elections. The agenda in Paris, where Hata will meet President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, will include Japanese-French cooperation in Indochina and Africa, the officials said. In Bonn, Hata will reconfirm in talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl that Japan and Germany will join forces in their bid for a permanent seat on a revised U.N. Security Council. They will also likely formally launch a Japanese-German cooperation council on high technology and environment technology, proposed during Kohl's visit to Japan in March last year, which is to sound out areas for joint research and development. Before returning to Japan on May 7, Hata is scheduled to meet Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and the president of the European commission, Jacques Delors, in Brussels.
