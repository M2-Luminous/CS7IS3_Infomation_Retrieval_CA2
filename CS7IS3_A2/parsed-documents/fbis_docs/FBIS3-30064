Most observers considered it unlikely that either of the rival Fijian groups would emerge from the poll strong enough on its own to provide this Pacific republic with a stable government. Mara's job would be to hammer out a compromise agreement on a premier and a government as soon as possible after counting is complete, probably early Sunday. Under a constitution stemming from a 1987 army coup, ethnic Fijians have a lock on the politics of this sugar-producing archipelago, with 37 seats in the 70-seat House of Representatives. Ethnic Indians have 27 with five for European, Chinese or mixed-race members and one for the autonomous island of Rotuma. The same constitution says the president picks the premier, who must be a Fijian and have the support of the majority of the multi-racial parliament. The big question Friday was how many votes the Fijian dissidents grouped in the Fijian Association (FA) would take from the ruling Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party. The dissidents broke from the SVT over controversial budget proposals in November. This split among the Fijians has spurred regional rivalries and SVT leader and premier Sitiveni Rabuka fears the election could further deepen divisions between Fijians. Rabuka says the SVT should win around 33 seats but shaky economic policies and criticism of Rabuka's mercurial management style could cost it votes. Josevata Kamikamica, the FA's leader, is confident of wounding the SVT. "We are going to do well. We will get around 12 seats," he told AFP Friday as he sat quaffing kava with supporters outside a Suva polling station. "I would be quite happy to be premier. And we could look at having Rabuka in a goverment which I lead, but I won't serve in a government led by Rabuka," he said. Mara, a 73-year-old veteran former premier, is Fiji's most seasoned politician and is one of the last of the great paramount chiefs. He sees himself in a role as father of the nation. Political sources expect the hard-headed chief to move swiftly and decisively to get an agreement from Fiji's political party leaders on an acceptable premier. He seeks prompt agreement on a solidly-based government so as to boost both local and international confidence in the country, the sources said. "He could summon Rabuka and Kamikamica and tell them that he wants a quick agreement on a premier and a government," one Fijian source said. One suggestion in political circles is that Fiji may emerge from the election with a minority government which had an understanding with other groups in parliament, particularly the Indian-dominated parties. The long-established National Federation Party (NFP) is widely expected to emerge stronger from the vote at the expense of its rival for the Indian vote, the National Labour Party. NFP leader Jai Jam Reddy is seen as a Kamikamica backer, but it is suggested that his party could cut a deal with Rabuka if they thought him more open to their policy views. Top among these is a review of the constitution which has to be completed by July 1997. Nine parties and 23 independents contested this poll in the country's scattered islands. [passage omitted]
