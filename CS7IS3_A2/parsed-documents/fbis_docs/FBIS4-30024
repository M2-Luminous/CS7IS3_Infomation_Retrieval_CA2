The NSC chief made the statement at a seminar on "Policy and Guidelines on International Terrorism" which was jointly organised by the NSC and the Interior Ministry. The seminar at Government House was attended by about 450 senior government offices, provincial governors and high-level authorities concerned with international terrorism. Gen Charan said that since 1972 there have been eight incidents regarded as acts of international terrorism, the last being the huge water-tank bomb containing C-4 plastic explosives found in a truck in front of Lumphini police station in March this year. Most of the events involved the hijacking of aircraft. In these events, Thailand had never been a party in the conflict, he said. For example, the water-tank bomb was aimed at an embassy by terrorists from another country who chose to use Thailand as the venue for their activities, he added. Gen Charan said that Thailand, as a member of the International Terrorism Suppression Organisation, has exchanged information and intelligence on activities and identities of blacklisted international terrorists. The NSC itself has coordinated with the National Intelligence Agency and Police Department on this matter but people in general are usually unaware of such activities, he said. Gen Charan said Thailand has a policy of not wanting to see any terrorist activities in the country. If an event of this nature takes place, Thailand would solve the problem in a way it can to maintain the country's interests.
