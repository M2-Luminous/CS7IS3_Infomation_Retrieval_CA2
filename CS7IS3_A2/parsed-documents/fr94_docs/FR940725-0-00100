FR940725-0-00100 FR940725-0-00013 A State may, in accordance with section 1915(c)(9) of the Act, replace individuals who die or lose Medicaid eligibility for State plan services. However, the State is still limited to serving no more than the number approved in its model waiver request, or 200 individuals, at any time. Section 411(k)(10)(A) is effective as if included in the enactment of OBRA `87, that is, December 22, 1987. Thus, States may continue to serve less than 200 recipients under approved model waivers and renew these requests by any number of recipients up to the new 200-person limit. States with model waivers approved prior to December 21, 1987, may submit an amendment to obtain approval to serve clients in excess of those originally approved, up to the new 200-person limit. We received the following comments on the proposed rule: Comment: Two commenters recommended that States be allowed to substitute recipients in a home and community-based services waiver program under section 1915(c) of the Act, as is permitted under a model waiver program. Response: The model waiver program derives its legal base from the same statutory authority as the section 1915(c) waiver program but administratively it has been limited in the total number of recipients that could be served. The original limit was 50 individuals. As we stated above, the amendment made by section 4118(b) of OBRA `87 increased the limit on model waivers to 200 individuals and the amendment made by section 9502(i) of COBRA authorized substitution for recipients who die or lose Medicaid eligibility. Although States may replace recipients, there is no authorization for exceeding (at any point in time) the 200-person limit on the model waiver request. In contrast, HCFA has never prohibited the substitution of recipients under the section 1915(c) waiver program. In fact, we require that the utilization estimates submitted prior to approval must be based on unduplicated recipient counts, not ``slots'' or full-time equivalents. ``Unduplicated'' means that once a recipient is counted in a particular setting (in a NF, for example), that recipient cannot be recounted in that setting if readmitted during the reporting period (waiver year). This is the same reporting principle used in HCFA Forms 64 and 2082. State waiver utilization estimates must include an adjustment for Medicaid recipients who die, lose eligibility, or leave the program for any reason (institutionalization, for example). Therefore, substitutions are expected, and all persons replaced should already be incorporated into the waiver utilization estimates approved for each year of every waiver program. Because the unduplicated recipient count includes reasonable estimates of substitution and the statute requires reasonableness of estimates and cost-neutrality, we are requiring waiver amendments if the State expects to exceed its approved cost and utilization estimates, regardless of the reason for the change.
