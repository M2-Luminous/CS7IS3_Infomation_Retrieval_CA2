I. Background Since the inception of the Series 7 General Securities Representative Examination program (``Series 7'') in 1974, 9 the NASD has continually maintained limited qualification programs for specialized product areas. 10 The NASD represents that the limited qualification programs provide qualification mechanisms that are appropriate to NASD-only member firms that are involved in limited aspects of the securities industry. 11 Until 1988, the NASD maintained two limited representative qualification programs: (1) The Series 6, for investment company products and variable contracts; and (2) the Series 22, for direct participation programs. 12 In 1988, the NASD implemented the Series 62 examination (``Series 62'') which qualifies candidates to sell only stocks, bonds, rights, warrants, closed-end investment company shares, real estate investment trusts, and money market funds. 13 The NASD has also acted as the administrative agent for the Series 52 Municipal Securities Representative Examination since it became effective in 1978. 14 9 The Series 7 was jointly developed by the Amex; CBOE; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., NYSE, Phlx, NASD, and Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. The Series 7 qualifies candidates to sell the full range of securities products, including options. 10 See NASD September 27 Letter, supra note 8. 11 Id. 12 Id. 13 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25719 (May 20, 1988), 53 FR 19076 (May 26, 1988) (``Exchange Act Release No. 25719''). 14 See NASD September 27 Letter, supra note 8. II. Description of the Proposal The NASD is now proposing to establish a Series 42 examination which would be used to qualify persons seeking registration as registered options representatives (``RORs'') for options overlying equity, debt, foreign currency, and index options. The Exchange represents that the Series 42 examination, when combined with the NASD's other limited product examinations and the Series 52 examination would provide an alternate to the Series 7 for full general securities representative registration. 15 15 That is, the combination of the Series 6, 22, 42, 52, and 62 cover the same range of products as the Series 7. Id. The examination will be a ninety-minute, 50 question multiple-choice examination, covering all option product areas. A prerequisite to registration as an ROR is registration as a Corporate Securities Limited Representative which requires passing the Series 62, or registration as a General Securities Registered Representative which requires passing the Series 7. 16 16 According to the NASD, only registered representatives who passed the Series 7 exam prior to the revisions to the Series 7 in 1986 when only equity options were tested, would opt to take the Series 42 exam. Telephone conversation between David Uthe, Assistant Director, Qualifications, NASD, and Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, on April 11, 1994 (``Uthe April 11 Conversation''). III. Comments Received on the Proposal The Commission received comment letters from the Amex, Phlx, NYSE, and CBOE in opposition to the proposal, and response letters from the NASD. 17 The commentators raised objections regarding the utility of the Series 42 and believe that the availability of an alternative qualification scheme to the existing Series 7 could result in investor and regulatory confusion, and could limit investors' access to the options markets. 17 See supra notes 4 through 8.
