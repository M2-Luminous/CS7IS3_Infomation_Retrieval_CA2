Referring to recent trends in the foreign exchange market, which saw the dollar plummet nearly 6 percent Monday and Tuesday on trade woes, Mieno told a Diet panel that "the movements have gone too far." Answering questions in the House of Representatives budget committee, he stressed an agreement is still in effect among the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial nations that calls for exchange rates to move in a stable fashion reflecting economic fundamentals. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii made the same point earlier in the morning. Mieno said he wants to work in close contact with other G-7 members for exchange rate stability. Tokyo currency dealers reiterated Friday that the Bank of Japan appeared to be intervening in the market, selling the yen. Mieno also appeared to quash expectations that the central bank will soon cut its already record low official discount rate to spur the economy. If capital stock and other adjustments proceed smoothly, "current interest rate levels are sufficient to support an economic recovery," he said. He repeated that the economic picture is a mix of good and bad, citing recent yen gains and gradually worsening employment conditions as minuses, pitted against the expected effects of last week's record 15.25 trillion yen fiscal stimulus package.
