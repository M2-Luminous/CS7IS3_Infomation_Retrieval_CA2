The meetings with the Russian minister are above all expected to provide clarification of the prospects for developing relations between Russia and NATO and consequently of the blueprint for a future European security system. Everyone in NATO agrees that a nuclear power with a huge economic and military potential must play a special role in the international security system. But NATO does not want to formally enshrine this in the framework document of a program which has already been signed by 18 countries, including eight former USSR republics, in addition to the alliance members. The framework document, NATO leaders say, is a kind of "protocol of intent" which entails no commitments. It is proposed to cooperate under an individual program, that is to say on a bilateral basis. This is where Russia's special status will be established. But if Russia does not join the program it will find it hard to influence the creation and operation of this mechanism.
