In a political statement issued on March 7, the twelve EU Member States welcomed the measures recently adopted by the Israeli Government to ensure the safety of Palestinians, and pointed out that Israel is responsible for the safety and protection of all inhabitants in the Occupied Territories. They appealed to the parties to the Middle East conflict for talks on the question of "the safety of Palestinians, including the issue of certain settlements, and to agree on appropriate measures." They called on the UN Security Council to adopt "an appropriate Resolution" as swiftly as possible and advocated the establishment in the Occupied Territories of "an international presence in which the European Union declares its willingness to participate." The Greek Foreign Minister and current President of the EU Council of Ministers, Carolos Papoulias, said after the debate on the Middle East that all his colleagues agreed on the need to support the case of the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, who is viewed as a vital element in the peace process.
