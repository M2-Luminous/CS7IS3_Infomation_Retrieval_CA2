"Many people say the EU is sufficient to solve our environmental problems. They do not know what they are talking about," Johansson said during a lunch break during a ministers' meeting of the Nordic Council at the Riksdag building in Stockholm. Center and Social Democrats Most Split He has not yet taken an overall position on membership. The Social Democrats and the Center Party are the two parties that are most divided over the EU issue. Unlike Social Democrat Ingvar Carlsson, Johansson believes that a party leader cannot push his personal views on the EU question. If the Center Party Assembly wants the party to oppose the EU in the referendum, then Johansson must support that position. Thus, he finds it difficult to understand how Carlsson believes he can stay on as party chairman and speak in favor of EU membership if the party recommends that the people oppose it. Carlsson has stated that it is the people who will ultimately decide in the referendum. Then all members of Riksdag will have to accommodate themselves -- for example, Gudrun Schyman of the Left Party may have to press the yes button. Wants To Be In Step With Party Johansson believes it is his duty to "be in step with the party." He also believes that Carlsson and others who have taken a position have done so for ideological reasons. "But then the negotiations are less important. They are almost irrelevant. I believe this is an issue for party platforms. ``In the position Ingvar Carlsson has taken, I would not stay on as party leader if the party was of a different opinion.'' Has Not Taken a Position Johansson maintains that he has still not taken even a personal position. A number of questions are still being negotiated, such as how many votes Sweden will have in the Council of Ministers. "The Swedish debate is also ignoring what will happen on the national scene. I am against any attempt to use the results of the EU negotiations in regional and agriculture policy or in any other area to reduce our national efforts." Responsibility for Important Areas The Center Party was responsible for three of the most important areas in the EU negotiations: agriculture, regional policy, and the environment. Johansson believes they exceeded expectations in the first two areas and, based on the results of the negotiations, they make him "lean toward a yes vote." On the other hand, Johansson believes that the EU is not very good at tackling the world's environmental problems. He still remembers quite well that the EU countries could not agree to support a carbon dioxide tax at the world environmental conference in Rio in 1992. Environmental Affairs Minister Johansson has noted that EU countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark would like very much to see Sweden, with its good reputation in environmental policy, become a member and help push environmental issues. Good Results of Negotiations Despite everything, the results of the negotiations are good, according to Johansson, considering the strong interests of industry, agriculture, and transport in the EC countries. These interests saw Sweden's environmental demands as an overriding threat to free competition, which seems to be more important than a better environment and health protection in some cases, according to Johansson's impressions of the negotiations. Sweden was given a transition period of four years and may not have to lower its environmental standards after that period. If the Swedes adapt to the tougher attitude around the negotiating table in Brussels, then Sweden can be a driving force in the future, as well, Johansson believes. "It is a real battle. You have to be damn strong and single-minded." [passage omitted]
