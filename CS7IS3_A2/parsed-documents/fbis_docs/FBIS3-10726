Will it influence the start of yours? [Frei] It is a national problem. It does not involve an administration, it involves our country and it must be solved. Apart from the proceedings to resolve this case -- which are being handled by the courts, the office of the comptroller general, the state defense council, and the Chamber of Deputies -- the country is interested in our future actions. We want to establish a very strong modernization process. We have already begun by not appointing an executive vice president: Each managing director will be responsible for his area. When formed, we will announce the new board of directors. We will announce it when the new Codelco executive officers are appointed. We will very strongly encourage the modernization of this company, which is a key company in the country. [De la Maza] When one views what happened in Codelco, one believes it maybe is without solution. It apparently involves a man who -- acting wrongly -- took the money of Chileans and -- in a nutshell -- speculated on the international markets and lost more than $200 million in just a few weeks. What can be done to prevent this type of action? [Frei] I believe there must be a control system. Every company in the world ... [changes thought] I am also an entrepreneur, I have worked for many years in private companies. There was no control. We must find out why there was no control. Within the modernization process, we must clearly establish responsibilities and ensure that control is applied every day. [De la Maza] It has been said recently that no one will pay for this loss, that Chileans will not have to pay it because there was some reserve money. Do you agree? [Frei] If Codelco receives less money in the next few years as future transactions are completed, it is obvious that Chile will receive less money. [De la Maza] So all Chileans will have to pay for this loss in some way. [Frei] Exactly. [De la Maza] It has also been said that the Codelco case negated the idea of loyal and constructive opposition to the administration of President Patricio Aylwin. Do you agree? [Frei] I do not. I have spoken with members of the opposition. I invited the presidents of the two main opposition parties, Andres Allamand [National Renewal] and Jovino Novoa [Independent Democratic Union], to dine at my house. We met when I was elected president. We will work together because I believe a president must deal with national issues and should always seek agreement on national issues. We may have different view points and disagreements, but there are national issues with which we must deal. As president I will deal with them from the national point of view. Regarding the opposition, I would like it to be loyal and constructive; an opposition that states its differences. In a democratic system it is good to have a rotation of governments, opposition, and control; and that is the task of the opposition. [De la Maza] Do you expect disloyal opposition over the Codelco case? [Frei] No. Of course, in a process as complex as the Codelco case some people may make inappropriate comments. This is part of our popular tradition but I believe the investigation must continue. [De la Maza] As of next Monday you will be the president in La Moneda Palace. Among the measures you will be unable to adopt is that of removing the Army commander [General Augusto Pinochet]. As a democrat how do you feel, faced with this situation? [Frei] From the point of view of principles -- as I have always said -- I would like the president to have that right. But I respect the Constitution and the laws because this is a process we started in 1988. We will continue it because , as we always said, this is how we would do it, this is how we did it, and this is one of the successful aspects of the transition. [De la Maza] Will you suggest to General Pinochet that he leave the Army Command? [Frei] He has the constitutional right to remain in his post until 1997. As of 11 March, following my inauguration, ours will be a relationship appropriate between the president of the Republic and the Army commander. [De la Maza] The fact that this situation continues -- a situation that does not fully coincide with a democratic regime, along with the situation of appointed senators, etc. -- do you believe the transition is not fully completed? [Frei] I believe -- as pointed out in the 1989 program -- that some tasks were established for the transition and some were established for the next government. Some were not fulfilled, but we hope to fulfill them during my administration, including those mentioned. These tasks should be fulfilled within a framework of agreement, because under those conditions laws and agreements are permanent and no government will attempt to change them. We will work on those tasks under that spirit. [De la Maza] Regarding this and other political reforms, such as the electoral law, do you like to move fast or slow? [Frei] In the appropriate manner because the people are waiting to see how we will solve their real problems, how we will work on issues such as poverty, education, health, environment, and social security -- the big issues. [De la Maza] Will you move faster on those issues? [Frei] These issues will have priority. This does not mean we will forget other issues. Every issue will be dealt with at the appropriate time. On 21 May [opening of Congress] I will clearly point this out. [De la Maza] How can the people interpret your decision to appoint a socialist as interior minister? [Frei] I would say this shows the full consolidation of democracy and that nothing is prohibited for any Chilean. [De la Maza] As a former businessman -- you are known as a businessman -- do you believe capitalism is cruel to the poor. [Frei] Obviously, and this is what we have been trying to change in this country. In only a few countries has it been shown that accelerated development is compatible with social justice and equity. This is what we have been working on during the last few years. We need investments and efficiency to overcome poverty, but we also need a real effort because, as I have said many times in the interior, many Chileans live in conditions similar to the most developed countries in the world, while near us many live in misery. From the point of view of ethics and solidarity, I believe we can and should make an effort. My government will make an effort. [De la Maza] President Aylwin provided aid, will you increase it or do you feel it is sufficient? [Frei] I believe we can increase it because the country is in a different condition than when Aylwin received the government in 1989. Agreement has been reached on taxes which allows to spend more on social issues. I will also propose from the beginning of my administration -- perhaps make it the number one priority of my government -- that the struggle against poverty should be a national issue, not just for the government but for all sectors of the country. We will invite all sectors -- workers and businessmen -- to a great national crusade against poverty. In my speech on 12 March, I will announce that I will preside over the ministers social committee, emphasizing from the beginning the priority issues of our administration. [passage omitted]
