The League said that Yemeni unity, which represents national interests and pan-Arab achievements, must be preserved. It announced, however, that unity cannot be imposed by force. The League issued a new appeal to the Yemeni parties to hasten to end the tragedy in their country, as the victims are none other than the sons of the fraternal Yemeni people.
