They discussed the grave developments in our country and the continued barbaric attacks led by the military leadership in control in Sanaa against the people of the southern and eastern provinces. Prime Minister al-'Attas reviewed the peace initiative proposed by the Yemeni Socialist Party and the principles for national salvation accord proposed by the nationalist forces which were both rejected along with other political initiatives by the leadership in Sanaa. The U.S. official expressed the U.S. Administration's satisfaction with and welcome of this initiative stressing his country's keen interest in stopping the war. He pointed out that whatever the result of the war is, it cannot be a solution to the current political problems. It will rather lead to more ruin, destruction, and victims and will create hatred and bitterness and expose the union to danger.
