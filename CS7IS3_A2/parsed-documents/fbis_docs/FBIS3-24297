The current situation is really not too clear and definite. The Supreme Council is awaiting its own reelection. Perhaps those 194 deputies who proposed their own candidacies for a new term are exactly the ones who constitute its capable nucleus. Because those who want to be reelected have the best chances of this today: It is not so much that people are yearning for changes for the better as that they are afraid that things might get worse. In the event the elections are not held, the old staff will hardly be able to work for several reasons: as morally antiquated, the continuous lack of a quorum, and in connection with inadequate representative political forces. There should be no place for illusions regarding its participation and the current composition of the government that is headed by a temporarily acting premier. Finally, after Leonid Kravchuk's announcement, serious doubts have surfaced about the reliability of and prospects for the president's vertical chain of command. State authority in its full structure attested to its temporariness, which is analogous to an acknowledgment of its ineffectiveness already today. The impression is being created that all the participants of the long and exhaustive struggle for the real levers of control that was waged from the day of acquisition of independence have simultaneously become deathly sick of each other and of themselves and, therefore, have said in typical Ukrainian philosophical manner: "Go to hell!" As a matter of fact, moral fatigue is truly a dominating factor at all stages of Ukrainian post-Soviet society. But according to physical and metaphysical laws, the obvious cessation of the struggle and movement denotes only their transition to new forms. Thus, the present political entropy which, it seems, even the political campaign is not in a condition to stop, may, in our opinion, have two explanations. It is possible we are observing the last stage in the building of a national state in the style of the well-known anecdote about how it was recommended that a Ukrainian be a tsar: He ate one goody after another, loaded up on goodies, stole 100 rubles [R], and ran away. That this happens with an inexperienced and dispirited elite was shown to me not only by our historical experience, but also by a parade of objections to sovereignty that started in Minsk, the capital of the CIS. It is difficult to judge how much the Ukrainian nomenklatura and directorate matured before returning under the influence of the Moscow boss, but the program provisions of the Kuchma-Grinev bloc talk of a readiness to go the Belarusian way. Under these conditions, Kravchuk should take the lessons of Shushkevich into account and be concerned that catapulting from a doomed aircraft should occur with the necessary solemnity and caution. The second version of that which prompted Kravchuk to make a "move with the knight" lies in the recognition that the domestic political factor and not the foreign factor is decisive. The struggle for the Ukrainian mace is not ending, but it is undergoing a certain transformation. New rules in this case are being written for new players. The popularity rating of Ukrainian politicians "tolls" the collapse of the political system. When not one of them is able to count on the trust of at least a fifth of the population, it becomes understandable why there is no elementary order in the country. The existing situation is a consequence, first of all, of the defeat of the old nomenklatura, which in the person of the president received exceptionally authoritative powers two years ago. The fact that Leonid Kravchuk in the matter of trust actually was the equivalent of his primary competitor, Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the people's Rukh [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka], and former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma is a very alarming symptom for the "party in power" that he heads. This means that the categories of national intelligentsia and economic managers of the middle echelon that are traditionally under control are coming out from under the heel of the nomenklatura and, very likely, will seek an alternative source of power. It is interesting that the one and same nomenklatura in an almost unchanged personnel structure has already suffered defeat twice before our eyes--first under the guise of the communists, and later also under the sign of the national-democrats. In addition, the righteous anger of the "fathers of the nation," who in both cases consecrated the ruling structure with their lyrical-epic talent, looks rather comical. The participants of the so-called Assembly of the Intelligentsia of the City of Kiev held on 26 February frequently drew an analogy with the first Rukh congress, which occurred in the very same House of the Cinema four years ago. The former passion returned to the leaders of national-democracy (chairmen were Ivan Drach, Les Tanyuk, and Levko Lukyanenko), and once again one could hear summons for a decisive struggle with the "occupying administration," but the populist audience did not bring this out of a state of deep inertness. There are other attitudes and other problems in the corridors of power. President Leonid Kravchuk and Chairman of the Supreme Council Ivan Plyushch cannot cope with their competitors in a direct sense. They only represent different administrative models. Kravchuk tried to conduct a strict executive vertical chain of command that would possess the public levers of influence and rely on the authority of the nationally elected president. However, it is difficult to impart the norms of an open society to our society, and especially to the officialdom of the lower and middle echelons. But this is exactly the sphere of Ivan Plyushch's competence, the master of the apparatus game and concealed control levers. The amorphous system of the representative organs is the best ground for the nomenklatura coverup, with which the idea of state power is traditionally identified in our country. However, this is by no means a reason for quarrels between Leonid Makarovych and Ivan Stepanovych. They have common corporate interests and different spheres of realization of personal ambitions. This means that common decisions are not only possible, but also natural. It is precisely this that the statement of the president should indicate. It is difficult to guess what his true intentions are now. In the logic of events, both the new membership of parliament and the new president, who could be elected in the current situation, should win authority with a sharp negation of the existing regime. Therefore, both these and other elections for the "party in power," let us put it this way, are not opportune. At the same time, it is impossible to disrupt them openly, as this puts the cards in the hands of the opposition. It is better to "let it drop." All of this evoked a new wave of emotions and a new stream of reproaches. This time Kravchuk is accused by all sides of a lack of political will and betrayal of national interests. But at the same time public opinion, imperceptibly to itself, is already beginning to perceive the far from indisputable claims of the president as an objective reality, and the problem of elections falls by itself... Kravchuk's statement literally has forced everyone to look into the abyss: By it the chaos and fragility of the political situation have been brought to a culmination. And this is an ideal condition for the appearance of a savior of the fatherland.
