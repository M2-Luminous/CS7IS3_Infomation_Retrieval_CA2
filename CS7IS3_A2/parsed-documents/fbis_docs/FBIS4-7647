He had never seen EU entry as a kind of competition between the region's countries. Hungary has an interest in its neighbors, facing similar economic problems, joining the EU at about the same time, he added. He said Hungary could well become a full EU member by the end of the century. All political groups contesting May's elections support entry and the mood of country is unlikely to change considerably on this at the 1994 election, the Foreign Minister claimed. "Among Visegrad countries, EU membership coordination talks were most successful with Poland. The Polish bid, even if submitted a few days later than Hungary's application, will be discussed at the ministerial conference on April 18. We proceed together, but may not necessarily reach the goal at the same time," Jeszenszky said.
