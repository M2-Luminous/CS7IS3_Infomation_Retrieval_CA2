FR941117-1-00015 FR941117-1-00004 We propose to revise existing regulations to establish a definition of the term ``psychiatric residential treatment facility'' (PRTF) and conditions of participation for this type of facility. A PRTF is a community-based facility that provides a less medically intensive program of treatment than a psychiatric hospital or a psychiatric unit of a general hospital. The proposed PRTF standards are based on existing standards for these facilities developed by CHAMPUS, the Joint Commission, and a number of States and other organizations. We have tried to structure the PRTF conditions of participation to ensure practical outcome-oriented benefit to patients, rather than establishing ``paper'' compliance with procedures and policies. We also would revise ยง441.152, which specifies the requirements for certification of the need for admission to all psychiatric L 21 providers. These provisions are discussed in detail in section V of this preamble. Any State that chooses to offer the psychiatric L 21 benefit would be required, at a minimum, to provide acute psychiatric care in a psychiatric hospital or a psychiatric unit of a general hospital. States would have the further option of also providing inpatient psychiatric services in the freestanding PRTF setting. If a State does not choose to include PRTF services as part of the psychiatric L 21 benefit, it would not be required to certify freestanding PRTFs if it determines that medically necessary residential treatment services for EPSDT patients can be provided in a certified distinct part PRTF located in a general hospital or psychiatric hospital setting. PRTFs would provide a type of care that is distinctly different from the care provided by acute care facilities and therefore a PRTF that is affiliated with a participating psychiatric hospital or general hospital would need to obtain separate PRTF certification in addition to its hospital certification. The setting(s) that a State chooses to use for the psychiatric L 21 benefit would be indicated in its State plan. PRTFs would be certified in the same manner as other inpatient providers of Medicaid services. States may contract for specialized personnel to perform surveys if they wish to. Currently operating residential treatment facilities include a wide range of providers, from facilities that provide care similar to that provided in psychiatric hospitals to facilities that are more similar to group homes. In addition, many residential treatment facilities are part of multi-service mental health organizations which also provide a range of outpatient services. A number of States have developed or are in the process of developing licensure requirements for these facilities. Treatment in residential treatment facilities generally costs less per day than treatment in a psychiatric hospital, but because the length of stay in residential facilities is generally longer, treatment in a residential facility is not always less expensive for the total inpatient stay. Rates for residential treatment facility services now range from approximately $140 to $420 per day, including professional fees. Some States have developed managed care systems for mental health services and, in some cases, States have combined Medicaid funding for these mental health benefits with funding for related services administered by other agencies in the State. These arrangements tend to ensure that treatment programs are developed in response to the individual's service needs rather than being structured according to the funding criteria of various programs; we support these coordinated efforts. Under these programs, Medicaid is only billed for Medicaid covered services provided to Medicaid eligible individuals.
