As a first step, the government will establish a credit line of 200 million dollars for the east European country on condition that the country smoothly repays outstanding external debts in line with rescheduling accords in the latest meeting of the Paris Club of western creditor nations, MITI said. The restart of Bulgaria-bound trade insurance coverage came after Japan's assessment of the recent economic developments in the country, including its accord with the International Monetary Fund on economic reforms, MITI said. Japan had suspended accepting trade insurance for Bulgaria after the country froze external debt repayments in March 1990. The Paris Club in its April meeting agreed on a 10-year rescheduling for part of Bulgaria's official debts totaling an estimated 4 billion to 5 billion dollars, including a grace period of six years.
