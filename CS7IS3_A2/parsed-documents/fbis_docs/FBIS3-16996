A Russo-American agreement to this effect is planned to be signed as early as in summer. The arrangement was reached during a visit of Russian specialists to the United States, Valeriy Bogdan, business manager of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. Three reactors producing weapon-grade plutonium continue to operate in Russia (one in Krasnoyarsk-26 and two in Tomsk-7). But these are dual-purpose reactors. They supply energy and heating not only to Krasnoyarsk-26 and Tomsk-7, but also to regional centres. The Ministry of Atomic Energy planes to phase out these reactors in 1997-1998. Their service life is almost completed. District power plants will be built instead. Storages in Russia are now filled to the limit with weapon-grade plutonium and with plutonium released from dismantled nuclear weapons. There are large plutonium stockpiles in Russia and in the United States and there is no sense in continuing to manufacture plutonium. However, Russia is now short of funds, and from the economical viewpoint it cannot stop plutonium-producing reactors and replace them with district power plants. Valeriy Bogdan believes it is necessary to reach agreement with the United States so that it help resolve the financial problem. The United States has stated the intention of helping to get funds, without giving guarantees of money, he said.
