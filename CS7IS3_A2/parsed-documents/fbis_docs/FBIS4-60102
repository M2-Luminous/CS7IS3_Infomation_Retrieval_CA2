Expectedly, the focus of the White House talks was on India's economic reforms and the opportunities they offer for strengthening Indo-American economic ties. There are differences, no doubt, in the two countries' approach to issues like nuclear nonproliferation, missile technology control and human rights. But as President Clinton himself put it, they have to be viewed in the totality of circumstances. Being friends does not mean one must see eye to eye on every matter. A major gain of the summit meeting was the resolve by the two countries to continue discussion on issues of which India and the United States hold different views. As the prime minister put it while talking to the Indian and ethnic media personnel, the only way to resolve differences is to talk to and understand each other. So far as Indo-U.S. relations are concerned, this dialogue has not been as emphatic as it promises to be now. Significantly, President Clinton acknowledged that with the economic reforms now under way, India is destined to emerge as one of the biggest free markets of the world. Both he and Mr. Narasimha Rao recognized that with the expansion of its economy, India would be able to contribute more meaningfully to the shaping of the world, both politically and economically. Another positive outcome of last night's talks in Washington is the decision to have regular consultations at the Foreign Office level. Such continuous dialogue will help the two countries to identify and remove the irritants and misunderstandings hindering a closer relationship. The United States' recognition that India is poised to play a more significant role in world affairs is likely to put the relations between the two countries on a sound and realistic footing. It is also an acknowledgment by the only superpower in the world today that India as a potential major economic power cannot be wished away.
