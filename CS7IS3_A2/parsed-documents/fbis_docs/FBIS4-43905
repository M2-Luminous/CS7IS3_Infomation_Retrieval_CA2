The population cannot be expected to bear another four years of Kohl. The SPD is missing its historical task if it does not manage to bring about a change of power in the autumn because of its own problems. "Attack is the command of the hour. Up and at 'em!" Verheugen said during the discussion. Thomas Westphal, chairman of the Young Socialists, openly came out in favor of committing the party to a red-green coalition, but he remained clearly in the minority with this proposal. Brandenburg Social Affairs Minister Regine Hildebrandt said it is incomprehensible and unacceptable that many people in the east still vote for Helmut Kohl, despite all the social cutbacks imposed by the coalition. [Lower Saxony Minister President] Schroeder stated that, with its new program, the SPD has a good basis to win the Bundestag elections. After the "failure of the Free Democratic Party of Germany," the SPD must make sure that it does not give up liberal principles in domestic policy and that it does not fall into the trap of FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther's rigid ideological concepts.
