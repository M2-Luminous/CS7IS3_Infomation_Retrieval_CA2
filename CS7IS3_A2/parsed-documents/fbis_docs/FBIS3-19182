The visit is primarily a political one, following the devaluation of the CFA franc. In an interview given to LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, the Congolese president wondered: "Who asked for the CFA to be devalued? That was one of the conditions that had long been demanded by the World Bank. I do not wish to get emotional. The devaluation is a fact. I do not wish to manage the negative aspects of this decision; this is an opportunity that I want to seize. First, at the regional level, we must reinforce economic and monetary integration. Next Monday, I will be in N'Djamena in the company of other central African heads of state to debate the prospects of an economic and monetary community." Pascal Lissouba affirmed that after the devaluation of the CFA franc, Congo and France found themselves confronted with three types of problem: "First, the problem of the French private sector which, if not supported, will face disaster. Second, the problem of the social aspects which the structural adjustment programs have always underestimated. France has made proposals for aid to the program. The implementation of these programs has yet to be determined. And third, investments in the future will cost two or three times more than they do now, and I do not have any funds for supporting investment." Referring to his meeting with the leaders of the CNPF, the Congolese president said that "French employers have a card to play because they have experience in Africa. They have friends in Africa, and they definitely have business to do, provided that a minimum level of justice is respected. France itself also has interests. French banks in Africa are suffering from the lack of liquidity. For more than a century, we have had links with France. We are blithely eliminating them out without really realizing that we are sucking out the core too." What is the purpose of Pascal Lissouba's visit to Paris? "I did not come here to try and get myself liked, but to get myself understood," he affirmed, "to explain our difficulties, our limitations, and our expectations." Congo, which is facing a foreign debt of some 15 billion French francs (more than 70 percent of which is owed to France as government debt and trade debt), has experienced social and political unrest in recent months. The country has what the IMF and World Bank feel is an exorbitant number of civil servants. "Human dignity lies in work, not unemployment. Should the choice be to die of hunger or die from a bullet? The people who participate in riots do not ask themselves that kind of question," the Congolese president explained.
