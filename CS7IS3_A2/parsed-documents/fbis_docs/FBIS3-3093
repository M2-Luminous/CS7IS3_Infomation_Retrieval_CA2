Qian made the assessment at a news conference here today. China's military expenditure was 43.2 billion yuan in 1993 and in 1994, the figure is 52 billion yuan, Qian said. On the surface, there has been an increase, but inflation in 1993 hit 13 percent. And this year inflation is expected to reach 10 percent. An increase in this year's military expenditure is to offset inflation, he said. "For the Chinese military, therefore, the actual buying power has not gone up," the foreign minister said. Military expenditure in 1994 accounts for 11 percent of the state budget, a proportion which has remained largely unchanged in recent years, he said. And military spending accounts for less than 1.7 percent of the country's GNP, which actually represents a slight drop from last year's level. In U.S. dollar terms, there is no change in the level of China's military spending, Qian said. Compared with the military spendings of the United States and Japan, China's military spending is "a pittanc," Qian said. China's central budget shows that the Chinese Government is concentrating its financial resources on developing its national economy instead of seeking to be a military power, he said.
