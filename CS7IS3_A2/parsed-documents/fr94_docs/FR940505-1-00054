FR940505-1-00054 FR940505-1-00012 (2) Commitments to adopt measures before 1996 to contribute emission reductions in the period 1997&hyph;2000. The South Coast Rate-of-Progress Plan also includes SCAQMD and ARB committal measures, with adoption and implement schedules, to reduce VOC and NO X emissions during 1997&hyph;2000. The SCAQMD commitments are to adopt the following VOC and NO X measures by the years shown: P&hyph;A&hyph;2, Further Control of Emissions from Auto Assembly Coatings (1995); A&hyph;B&hyph;7, Control of Emissions from Over-Filling of Vehicle Fuel Tanks (1994); A&hyph;D&hyph;3, Control of Emissions from Residential and Commercial Water Heating (1994); A&hyph;E&hyph;1, Control of Emissions from Pesticide Applications (1994); A&hyph;E&hyph;2, Control of Emissions from Livestock Waste (1994); M&hyph;G&hyph;1, Zero-Emission Urban Bus (1993); M&hyph;G&hyph;8, Aerodynamic Devices for Trucks (1994); M&hyph;I&hyph;1, Control of Emissions from Ship Berthing Facilities (1995); M&hyph;I&hyph;4, Control on Marine Diesel Operations (1995); This list does not include SCAQMD committal NO X measures which have now been subsumed in the NO X /SO X RECLAIM program, adopted on October 15, 1993. For the period 1997&hyph;2000, the CARB committal measures and adoption dates are: ARB&hyph;7, Low Emission Vehicle Standards for Heavy-Duty Engines (1995); ARB&hyph;15, Emission Standards for Recreational Vehicles (1994); ARB&hyph;16, Retrofit/Operational Requirements for Locomotives (1994); ARB&hyph;17, Emission Standards for Marine Vessels (1994). In section III of this NPRM, EPA proposes to promulgate as part of the FIP attainment demonstration federal measures comparable to some of these SCAQMD and CARB committal measures. If any of the State or local committal measures for these categories are adopted and submitted as a SIP revision and achieve emission reductions comparable to the FIP controls, EPA will approve the SIP rules and modify the FIP rules accordingly. d. Implications of EPA's Proposed Actions. If EPA issues final conditional approval of the SCAQMD commitments, the SCAQMD must fulfill the commitments to adopt the rules by the date specified in the plan and shown above, and the State must submit these rules to EPA. If the SCAQMD fails to adopt or CARB fails to submit any of the rules to EPA within this time frame, this approval will become a disapproval following EPA written notification to the State. If the rules are submitted to EPA within the applicable time frame, the SCAQMD commitments will remain a part of the SIP until EPA takes final action approving or disapproving the new submittal. If EPA disapproves the submittal, the measures on which the conditional approval was based will also be disapproved at that time. If EPA approves the submittal, those newly approved rules will become a part of the SIP and will modify or replace the measures on which the conditional approval is based. As discussed above, EPA's proposed conditional approval of the committal measures does not mean that the State has satisfied the initial 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress plan requirements of section 182(b)(1). EPA's current policy would not allow such approval until all necessary measures are submitted in fully adopted and enforceable form. EPA's final conditional approval of the SCAQMD commitments to adopt measures to achieve minimum progress requirements for the 1990&hyph;2000 period will establish a federally enforceably obligation on the part of the SCAQMD to adopt these measures in fully enforceable form according to the committed schedule. It is essential not only that SCAQMD but also CARB and all other responsible agencies follow through on their commitments to meet the Act's near-term progress requirements through expeditious adoption of enforceable regulations to achieve the necessary creditable reductions. III. California FIP A. Basis for the FIP Actions in Applicable Law and EPA Policies 1. FIP Obligation a. Introduction. In 1988, in the wake of lawsuits and ensuing court orders, EPA disapproved the 1982 South Coast ozone and CO plans and the Sacramento and Ventura ozone plans on the ground that, among other things, they failed to demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS by the December 1987 statutory attainment date, as required by Section 172(a) of the Act. See 53 FR 1780 (January 22, 1988). In March 1989, EPA entered into a settlement agreement with the South Coast plaintiffs which obligated EPA to promulgate federal plans for the South Coast in final form by February 1991. EPA issued a proposed FIP in September 1990. For Sacramento, EPA also negotiated settlement agreements containing schedules by which EPA would propose and promulgate a federal plan. Pursuant to these schedules, EPA published Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemakings (ANPRMs) on April 5, 1990 (55 FR 12669) and May 27, 1992 (57 FR 22194). For Ventura, EPA similarly entered into settlements setting a schedule, and published an NPRM on January 17, 1991. But as time progressed, it became increasingly clear that the South Coast, Sacramento, and Ventura_all areas with difficult air pollution problems_could not possibly meet the ambitious requirements of the 1977 CAA Amendments without severe economic dislocation. (1) Passage of 1990 amendments. On November 15, 1990, Congress enacted the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2422&hyph;2423. Among other things, Congress completely revised the Part D nonattainment provisions of the Act. In so doing Congress repealed the provisions of Section 172 that had required SIPs for the South Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento to demonstrate attainment by December 31, 1987. Those provisions had formed the basis for EPA's disapprovals of the California SIP submissions for those areas, and thus the 1990 Amendments removed the statutory justification for those disapprovals. Congress replaced the provisions of section 172 with a detailed scheme of new requirements and extended deadlines specifically applicable to ozone and CO nonattainment SIPs. Sections 171&hyph;193, 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515. In particular, the 1990 Amendments established a graduated series of requirements for different areas, depending on the severity of the air quality problem in each. Congress established five classifications of ozone nonattainment areas based on the level of each area's ozone problem_ranging from ``Marginal'' to ``Extreme''_and two classifications of CO nonattainment areas. The Amendments also set new, extended deadlines for the attainment of the primary NAAQS for each classification. Sections 181(a)(1) and 186(a)(1). Consistent with the new Amendments, EPA issued a regulation classifying Sacramento as a ``Serious'' area for ozone nonattainment; under the statute, ``Serious'' areas must attain the ozone standard as expeditiously as practicable but no later than November 15, 1999. 40 C.F.R. 81.305 (1992); CAA section 181(a). Ventura is classified as a ``Severe'' area for ozone, and must attain as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than November 15, 2005. The South Coast is classified as the only ``Extreme'' area for ozone, and must demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than November 15, 2010. For carbon monoxide, the South Coast is classified as a ``Serious'' area, and must demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 2000.
