He is happy about the changing of the guard in Danish foreign policy that clearly has made defense matters popular. The days are gone when he had to be introduced as Per and Grete Haekkerup's oldest son. Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup has come into his own. Admittedly he does not have his parent's outgoing charm; he is even somewhat shy, but on the other hand he has turned out to be one of the Nyrup government's best cards. Along with Minister of Justice Erling Olsen, he ranks as one of the government's best ministers from the nonsocialist opposition, maybe even the [best] defense minister a nonsocialist government could hope for. "That is very nice of them," Haekkerup says. "But that is also the kind of compliment one would rather do without." The 48-year-old, a bachelor of polital science, who studied Russian during the six years he served in the military -- "no, that does not make me a spy" -- is at present, "after the most stressful year of my life," reading John Le Carre's romantic thriller The Night Porter, which deals with defining the bad guys after the fall of the wall. As for himself, he can tell the exact moment when he realized that the time of the villains is not over: "The action of the Serbs when they started the bombing of Dubrovnik was what convinced me that the war in Bosnia was not about people simply trying to make life secure for themselves. I know the city, and it is an extremely beautiful city, but there is absolutely no military reason for bombing it. The line had been crossed where one could [meaningfully] talk about an element of self defense. Then came ethnic cleansing, the camps, and the gross violations of human rights." [Haekkerup] Had we not lived through the World War II, one would not believe that such things could happen in Europe in our time. What we have seen in the former Yugoslavia is the worst since the Nazis broke through the thin layer of civilization. It Can Still Go Wrong That is why Haekkerup is only "cautiously optimistic" after a week in which peace may be coming closer in the Balkans. The Serbs have withdrawn their heavy weapons from Sarajevo; Yeltsin has invited [the parties] to a peace conference; a rather fragile armistice has been established between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia. And finally the 10 Danish Leopard tanks reached Tuzla. [Bistrup] To good to be true? [Haekkerup] Yes, after everything we have seen we are of course somewhat skeptical. But I am still more optimistic today than I have been in the last nine months. This might be a decisive turning point in the war. That depends on our own will to persevere in a positive development. I cannot predict when we will have 100-percent peace in the Balkans. I think that this will remain a corner of unrest in Europe, and that we have to live with conflicts and ethnic tension in this region. Just now the pendulum is swinging the right way. But if events move in another direction, there is the risk that the conflict will spread to Kosovo, Macedonia and possibly Albania. I do not think that possibility can be excluded. * * * Haekkerup also thinks that we must live with the fact that nobody emerges as a winner in the Balkans: [Haekkerup] Several hundred thousand people are dead, and the only thing the UN has been able to do is to try to limit the losses. That is what is so difficult about the UN mission in the former Yugoslavia; the fact that one does not emerge with great and impressive results. I still think that even though it is involved, risky, and complicated, the UN has made a clear difference. But we still have a long way to go. * * * He can also live with the fact that it was the Russians who made it easier for the Serbs to meet the UN's demand to withdraw from Sarajevo before NATO's ultimatum expired: [Haekkerup] Russia is an important participant no matter which conflict we are talking about. The Russian democrats, who are in the minority in the Duma, have a great need to feel and show that they are a part of our world order and that they also will be recognized as such. There is a risk involved if one acts for only one of the parties. But that is not only a Russian problem. The necessary political will to agree has been missing among the large Western powers and it took so long to find a common attitude because we, historically and culturally, have felt closer ties to one of the parties in the conflict than we have to the other. A Bad Signal [Bistrup] Is it not a shame and a disgrace both for the EU [European Union], NATO, and the UN that so many should die before one could pull oneself together and do what should have been done a long time ago? [Haekkerup] The conflict could have been limited, but maybe not stopped, at an earlier time if the will to behave in unison and apply the necessary means had been present. But NATO's secretary general must once in a while point out the fact that it was not NATO, the EU, or the UN that started the war. It is a conflict which the different factions have inflicted upon each other. The truth of the matter is that the war is being continued by fairly small groups. But they are the ones that are armed. There are many bandits, but there are also some who fight, or have fought, for some ideas, some ideals. The problem is that political and economic power has been transferred to military factions lead by single individuals, generals, or whatever we should call them. It is a different political culture with different rules from those in our part of the world. [Bistrup] But the world society's hesitation has also revealed that crime pays. [Haekkerup] An incredibly bad signal has been sent in that it has been proven that he who seizes a weapon will be rewarded; that he who conquers land will be in a stronger position at the negotiating table regardless of which human rights he has violated. And that signal has been sent. We have also learned that the longer a conflict is allowed to continue, the more costly it will be to stop it. The longer one waits, the higher the price. The UN became involved in Macedonia at a relatively early stage when they sent in soldiers for preventative reasons. That prevented, at least at first, the conflict from spreading. [Bistrup] Have we also learned that the threat of sanctions is an empty one? [Haekkerup] Sanctions are still an important measure, but they are also a very simplistic measure. At first it is bloodless compared to sending in troops, but in the long run sanctions might have "bloody" results. I was in Belgrade between Christmas and New Year's, and even though there was a steady stream of cars on the street, it was obvious that the sanctions were having an effect. More than half of Serb industry had been destroyed, unemployment was sky-high and inflation was raging. I think that Serbia in the long run will pay a very high price for this. Even at the time when sanctions are lifted, there will be a reluctance on the part of the rest of the world to help them get going again. New Danish Reality Haekkerup has taken into consideration the fact that he is politically and morally responsible for the possibility that Danish soldiers might have been hit in retaliatory actions if NATO had undertaken air strikes against the Serbs; the fact that it would be he who would receive the coffins. [Haekkerup] Yes, there is some risk still present even though we have tried to ensure the safety of Danish soldiers as much as we can. One of the good things to come out of this affair is the fact that we have had many debates in the Folketing in which each member has had an opportunity to personally address the situation. I will not shift my responsibility to others, but it is important to have gone through this process. And for each debate we have had concerning our participation in the UN peacekeeping forces in Yugoslavia, the majority behind our political line has increased. * * * For Haekkerup there was a regular changing of the guard in Danish security policy the day it was decided to send Olfert Fischer to the Gulf -- even though he was ordered not to shoot. [Haekkerup] It is not only the world that has changed. Even the SF [Socialist People's Party] voted to create the International Brigade. At present only the Progress Party is against it. When we lived under the peace of the Cold War, things were simpler. The final apocalypse was a possibility, but a theoretical possibility. Today we live with the everyday reality of Danish soldiers being in a war zone and being shot at every day. Danish solders are not only being sent out on peacekeeping missions. As members of the International Brigade and as peacemakers for the rest of the world they might participate in real battles. [Bistrup] Are we mentally equipped to pay the price for such an engagement? [Haekkerup] I think I am finding an incredible maturity in the Danish people. There is no doubt but that public opinion has become more robust. Something has also happened in the development of Danish public opinion. UN participation has contributed to giving our defense forces a completely different profile from what they had before. Our defense forces have become a cooperative partner and an instrument of our foreign policy. Previously our mission was to deter our enemy. We have now become cooperative partners; an instrument for foreign policy. It is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that negotiates, but it is we who deliver the hardware. We are training Baltic soldiers in Denmark and they will go with us to Croatia to see how we conduct a peacekeeping effort. Such is the present reality. * * * In a very short time Minister of Defense Haekkerup will travel to Sarajevo in order to meet the hardy reality there. And John Le Carre's romantic reality must wait a little longer.
