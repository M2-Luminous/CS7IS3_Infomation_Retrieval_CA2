In terms of Caracas, the city is paralyzed. The strike was called because the government owes transportation workers student fare subsidies but has failed to pay, despite an earlier announcement that the payments will be made. Passenger buses and cabs shut their engines off last night. The government has warned it will crack down on any public disorder. Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom addressed the nation last night and called on students not to be influenced by the professional agitators taking advantage of the transportation strike. The government, through the Interior Ministry, called today's transportation strike illegal and urged reflection on the situation. The minister also said the transportation strike is unfounded. He said the government has the funds to pay the subsidy on preferential student bus fares, which is the reason behind the call for the strike. [Begin Escovar recording] A strike like this affects the poorer sectors of the population and harms the general interest of the community. Therefore, it is an affront against the nation's basic interests, which the government is obliged to defend as established by the Constitution and the law. [end recording] Minister Escovar Salom reminded the transportation workers that routes and permits are granted by the government and must be used to serve the public and not personal interest.
