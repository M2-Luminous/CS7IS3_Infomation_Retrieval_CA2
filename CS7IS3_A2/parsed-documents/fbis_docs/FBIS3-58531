Aided by Kohl and Kinkel at the Bundestag, in Moscow Clinton assured his Kremlin host loquaciously that the West would continue to count on him and to place its trust in him. In the opinion of Zhirinovskiy, that bizarre international rabble-rouser, Washington and Bonn are banking on the wrong person, although that is the very reason why in the current situation, from the West and East European viewpoint, the Russian president can be the only right person. Also it would have flattered Yeltsin to learn from Clinton that it was above all up to the United States and Russia to assist the old continent in developing a new security structure. However, there must be serious reservations about that as long as not only right-wing extremists, who did so alarmingly well in the Duma elections, but also the old Bolsheviks cannot come to terms with the collapse of the Eastern empire. Nevertheless, that will scarcely cast a shadow over the satisfaction that Clinton as well as Yeltsin will have particular reason for feeling this Friday. Both are being offered the kind of foreign policy success that they badly need at home in President Kravchuk's agreement to join them in Moscow to conclude a treaty on destroying the nuclear arsenal that was left in Ukraine following the collapse of the Soviet Union. If the parliament in Kiev, which will shortly face new elections, does not behave awkwardly once again, Russia will remain the only nuclear power among the republics that succeeded the Soviet Union. In this respect, too, Clinton was given strong support from the chancellor and foreign minister in Bonn on Thursday; on the previous evening in Kiev, Clinton knew how to use sensitivity and diplomatic skill to convince Kravchuk that foreign assistance and international recognition were much more important for an economically deprived Ukraine than nuclear muscle-flexing. The West should, of course, stop continually issuing warnings about isolating the core country of the former Soviet empire as soon as Russia's neighbors talk about their security needs. It is not for the United States or Europe, but solely for Russia, to decide whether or not it wants to isolate itself.
