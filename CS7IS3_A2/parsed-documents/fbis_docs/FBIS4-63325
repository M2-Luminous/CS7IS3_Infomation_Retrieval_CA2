Nemtsov asking the Russian president to relieve both him and Ye. Krestyaninov, the president's representative in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, of their duties. The reason for this resignation is that economic reform in the oblast has allegedly been a disaster, a wave of anti-Semitism is on the rise, and, under these conditions, "people must not be fooled any longer...." Whereas before there were sometimes rumors about Governor B. Nemtsov's possibly transferring to work in Moscow, this time the "resignation question" regarding the two oblast leaders has turned out to be a crude forgery. IZVESTIYA was told by Ye. Krestyaninov that the appropriate organs will now be investigating just who sent these letters to the mass media.
