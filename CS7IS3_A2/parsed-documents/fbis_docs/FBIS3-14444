I will also be discussing the policies and decisions that must be made in social and political realms in the current year, 1373. Last year, we observed the architects of the new world order. We saw how they put forward a new order for the world. However, we also saw that the so-called new order was in fact a new tyranny. There are times that the tyrant indulges in injustice and oppression, but the victims do not realize what is being done to them. This is because the tyrants justify their oppression. This new order proved to be a new mode of tyranny, injustice, and crime. They imposed such tyranny, and committed crimes at will in different parts of the world. However, they invariably gave different names to their deeds. We only need to look at a number of Muslim countries, such as, for instance, Bosnia-Herzegovina. We saw what justifications they constantly provided for merely observing the continued genocide of Muslims by the Serbs. The sad thing, however, is that nations are in a deep slumber. World radio and television stations control the ebb and flow of the public opinion. This is an ugly and very dangerous phenomena. For instance, when they chose to condemn someone, they do it in a way that people readily accept their words. [passage omitted] When one looks at the situation in the world, and when one sees nations in their deep slumber, one realizes that these nations resemble children, trying to remain in their happy slumbers. [last phrase in Arabic from an Islamic tradition] Like children, until they reach their puberty, they can easily be fooled. They can be given a dummy or a bottle and yet believe that it is the mother's milk which they are being given. [passage omitted] One only needs to look at Palestine. What can one understand from viewing as a whole the issue of Gaza and Jericho on the one hand, and all the crimes committed by the Zionists in an ever-increasing manner, on the other hand? What should the world understand from all this? The world is able to understand, but refuses to do so. This is because people listen only to a particular brand of propaganda. They fail to understand that Zionism is an entity which, as the revolutionary nation of Palestine have found out, can only be confronted by resorting to fire and bullet. The Palestinians have grasped this issue very correctly. [Crowd chants in support of the Islamic revolution and its leaders, and in condemnation of U.S., Israel and counterrevolutionary elements]. Of course such is the nature of falsehood. But falsehood cannot always hide its nature. One day it will show its ugly nature and what it has done to people. They said: Come and sit at one table. They propagated this across the world. The Islamic Republic stood up and announced this as a trick. The revolutionary forces in Palestine too came together and said they would not accept this. At the time maybe many people and nations asked: Why don't you accept this and put an end to the conflicts? But now they look and see how vicious a wolf Zionism is. It is a vicious wolf. The crimes it has committed in the world. There is no time now. But I have read in books that even the distortions in the four Bibles, and I found the evidence, were made by Zionists. It was they who distorted the Bible. Whereever they penetrated and whatever political and economic affair they involved themselves, their criminal hands were greater than the rest. Such is the new world order and repression. When some one attacked another, the latter would say: Oh, oppressor why are you attacking me? But now they attack and plunder the wealth of Muslim nations and exploit Muslim nations, but the latter do not say: Oh criminals why are you doing this to us? This is except for a group, a handful, including the Islamic Republic, and some others here and there. This is unfortunate and the only solution is the awakening of nations. And I have to tell the designer of such oppression led by American arrogance -- although you might bot believe it but we do -- that the Koran states that infidelity will be destroyed and oppression will be destroyed. As the honorable prophet [Muhammad] graciously said: A government may survive if blasphemous, but not if tyrannical. [last sentence in Arabic] The tyranny of the West will collapse as did the tyranny of the East [the former Soviet Union]. We hope that [Western tyranny] is uprooted by the Lord of the Age [12th Shiite imam]. That does not mean that we should sit and wait for him to come. The wait means that we should also make a move. Exactly as we have, the way we have determined our path, guided by our eminent imam [Khomeyni]. The same path which is followed by the honorable leader of the revolution [Khamene'i], supported by our officials, the system, and the nation. That is the way it should be and that is the path. Let not the unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves. We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity. But they will have a shameful punishment. [Koranic verse, in Arabic]. Masterminds of the new world order, we pray to the Lord of the Age that your establishment is turned upside down, God willing, God willing. We hope: Leave them alone, to enjoy the good things of life and to please themselves. Let false hope amuse them. Soon will knowledge undeceive them. [Koranic verse, in Arabic]. Another issue I would like to talk about is this year's hajj. From this great base of Friday prayers I convey this wish of the Iranian nation to the Saudi Government. As the dear leader of the revolution said, the Saudi Government must not make trouble for the people's pilgrimage. Creating problems would be harmful to nations and beneficial to the enemies of Islam. You, yourselves, know that arrogance really wishes harm for Islam. But Islamic countries are all brothers and united. I hope that, God willing, the Saudi Government gives a positive response and, God willing, stops creating problems. Another thing I would like to say is to pray for the souls of the passengers of the aircraft that crashed in Karabakh. We say to the Russian Government: You must correct this fault in your air traffic control system. That is a very regrettable situation. [passage omitted]
