A document was signed at the talks in Geneva that have just ended aimed at halting the combat in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- by which a one-month cease-fire will come in force throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina as of noon 10 June. In a statement for the B-H PRESS [news agency] Dr. Ejup Ganic, head of the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation and vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, emphasized that the delegation had accomplished [words indistinct] set by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. We have secured the withdrawal of Karadzic's military formations from the 3-km zone around Gorazde and afterward an agreement on cessation of combat activities for the duration of one month. In this way the aggressor will be forced to negotiate a political solution to the clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dr. Ganic believes. Karadzic tried to accomplish a total cease-fire for the duration of at least four months in Geneva, which would, on the ground, freeze the existing situation and practically mean the recognition of the aggressor's conquests. The agreement reached in Geneva is interpreted by the international media as a complete success for the Bosnia-Herzegovina diplomacy. Our delegation has left open the option of extending the cease-fire if the negotiating process about the political solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis shows [word indistinct] progress, but rejected meeting the aggressor's side in Geneva directly. The talks were carried out with the mediation of UN representatives.
