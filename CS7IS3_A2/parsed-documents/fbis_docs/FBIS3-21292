According to the report published recently by the customs authorities, seized imports consisted essentially of Marlboro-brand cigarettes, fabrics, cosmetics, and automotive spare parts. The products intended for export consisted of Lahda-brand milk and infant formula, sugar, semolina, pasta, household soap, table oil, and fuel. In this respect, although their resources are very limited, the customs were able to recover in 1993 large quantities of price-supported staples that would have been fraudulently exported to neighboring countries (Mali and Niger). They included, among other things, 10,888 cartons of Lahda milk and infant formula, 25 tons of pasta, 26 tons of semolina and flour, 3.5 tons of sugar, 5,018 cakes of household soap, 2,700 liters of table oil, 1.5 tons of rice, and 1,970 liters of gasoline. In addition, 222,450 packs of Marlboro cigarettes, 12,068 meters of fabric, 16,450 cosmetic items, 1,855 automotive spare parts, and 20,000 electric bulbs, which were smuggled into the country to be sold on the domestic market, were seized in border zones. As a result of the seizure of these goods, 527 cases were investigated by the judicial authorities, the report indicated. However, according to the Tamanrasset regional director, Mr. Abdelkader Atmouni, 1993 saw a marked decrease in the volume of seized goods and the number of cases, compared with 1992. This is because of increased crime and insecurity in the region, which deterred smugglers, in addition to the closing of the border with Niger, he said. In this context, we should also mention a considerable decrease in population movements through border posts. Thus, there were 3,431 exits and 2,556 entries through the border posts of In-Guezzam and Tin-Zaouatine. These travelers are essentially inhabitants of border regions. As far as barter is concerned, the Tamanrasset customs authorities noted a marked increase in trade among Algerians, Malians, and Nigeriens. They thus reported that over 5.7 billion centimes' worth of goods were imported from Niger and Mali, while 4.2 billion centimes' worth of Algerian goods were exported to these countries. These figures denote a rather strong export/import imbalance which, according to customs authorities, is due to the unavailability of Algerian products for export, especially those that are in very great demand in neighboring countries, such as plastic items and blankets (the exportation of which is authorized). We should stress that, since its creation last May, the new Algerian customs general directorate has undertaken another territorial reorganization. As a result, the Tamanrasset customs regional directorate now consists of three district inspectorates (Tamanrasset, In-Guezzam, and Bordj Babji-Mokhtar). The latter two were promoted to inspectorates. In addition, following the last visit of the Algerian customs general director to border posts in the Algerian far south, measures were taken to redeploy customs personnel, appreciably improve agents' working and living conditions, and provide more material resources. The objective was to make it possible to bring smuggling under control and fight fraud so as to halt the sapping of Algeria's economy.
