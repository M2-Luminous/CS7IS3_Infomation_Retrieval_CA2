With his call for a rapid enlargement of the European Union [EU] toward the East, Delors took a very large step. Ironically enough his call sounded with the echo of Margaret Thatcher's appeal in her famous Bruges speech. The great champion of European federalism and his most important opponent are now strangely in agreement: The former communist countries of East Europe must be included in the European structures and the Union must play an important role in this respect. Since the fall of communism the "integration" of East Europe has been an objective which is ritually professed at every European meeting and then in practice just as ritually ignored. The former communist countries could not of course stand up to competition from highly industrialized economies. For this reason these countries were offered association treaties which ostensibly arranged their phased membership into the EU, but in reality said nothing about the criteria for full membership and a timetable. The argument that these treaties were the best possible was dangerous, precisely because it appeared so reasonable. East European countries wanting to join the Union under conditions approaching the current economic convergence criteria would have to double their gross national product before the end of the century. But, because a large part of the capital stock in these countries is worthless, sustainable growth would require foreign investments of some $100 billion per year until the year 2,000. Everyone knows that this is out of the question. The present inequality in welfare between East and West cannot be bridged in such a short time. At the same time both Portugal and Spain, despite 10 years of full Union membership and high investment levels, are still relatively poor. Therefore the membership decision is a political question which does not rest solely on economic indicators. But just as Portugal and Spain were able to develop better inside rather than outside the Union, so could the East European countries. Ever since it was established, the EU has been based on the assumption that closer economic links will lead eventually to more political cooperation, which will prevent future wars in Europe. The same approach is required for East Europe. This whole region is in a sort of hibernation. Rather than having governments representing a social contract which has been achieved from below, East Europe still has political structures and constitutions which are imposed from above, and leaders who are determined to instill their people with democratic principles. Barring a few exceptions, the first generation of postcommunist leaders is rightly convinced of the mission which Europe can fulfill. If their efforts remain fruitless, then eventually these leaders will probably be replaced by more sinister politicians. This logic has never got through to Brussels. The East Europeans, rather than being warmly welcomed in West Europe, received a full broadside of protectionist self-interest. In the short term East Europe's agricultural products are its strongest export sector. As a European cereals producer, Poland is second only to France; its potato harvest is as big as the whole of the EU's put together. Hungary is an efficient meat producer. But the EU, where despite the promised reforms half the budget still goes on the common agricultural policy, was not prepared to allow the East Europeans to sell their products on European markets. France even blocked a compromise proposal under which Hungary, in its first year as an associated country, would be allowed to export an extra 550 tonnes of beef to the Union. Last year, the Union decided to make its trade policies more flexible, but they are still restrictive and arbitrary. For example, over the last 10 years East Europe halved its steel production, while the EU member states increased their steel production by 20 percent. Yet the East Europeans are still accused of "dumping" their steel on European markets and punished with high tariffs. The Western leaders spoke of lofty principles and the bureaucrats in Brussels played their quota game as before. A cynical game was taking place behind the scenes. After the end of the Cold War, France was obsessed with binding the German giant into a closely united Europe, and until this goal was successfully reached it vetoed the enlargement of the Union. The United Kingdom, determined to prevent this, made impassioned calls for East European membership, above all to weaken cohesion within the Union. Both countries agreed on one thing: That the East Europeans themselves played no role. But what had not been understood in either Paris or London was that the end of years of ideological contradictions threatened all European institutions and structures with destruction, both in the East and West. A union which calls itself "European" will never be able to maintain itself for long as a club of 12 rich countries on the western edge of the continent while there are wars and social collapse in the surrounding countries. The Yugoslav war was the first warning. The return of the communists in Poland and increasing unrest in Russia quickly followed. But more was necessary to convince some governments that enlargement is the only option. France and the United Kingdom can still allow themselves some hesitation. But Germany, which borders numerous East European countries, cannot. It was curious how the more Paris did to tie Germany to the West, the more Germany became concerned about the East Europeans. And London's appeal on behalf of the East Europeans, no matter how seriously it was intended, was not taken seriously for a moment as long as the British, while knowing what they wanted to fight within the Union, still did not announce their own goals. The recent comments by Delors indicate that this impasse will be broken quickly. In the meantime, the Union has realized that import levies on East European goods are unpopular and cannot be maintained in the long term. Last year's crazy "meat war," proclaimed for "health reason," was a political debacle for Brussels. Delors also knows that Germany wants to use its Union presidency -- in the second half of this war -- to bring about enlargement. And finally it has got through to the Brussels bureaucrats that after a painful fight to ratify the Maastricht Treaty and the endless discussions on monetary union, all Europeans now need a popular, comprehensible goal. The reconstruction of the continent by removing the old dividing lines between East and West meets these needs. Enough problems remain. Six associated East European countries could not join the Union overnight. Constitutional changes to the Union's voting procedures and a new division of subsidies and resources would be necessary. Long and difficult debates are ahead, but the time is ripe, because in 1996 the Union must in any case discuss its constitutional structures. By acknowledging now that enlargement is inevitable in the long term, Jacques Delors can have a resounding conclusion to his presidency. His successor will then have to take care of the heavy work. And if the new president were to be Dutch, then the dream of the founders of the European Community would be completely realized: A European from a relatively small but old democracy would welcome other small but young democracies to the family of peaceful European nations -- not from charity, but because this is the essence of a truly unified Europe.
