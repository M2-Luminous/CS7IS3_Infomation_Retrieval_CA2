The repayment deadline is included in the March 5 contract between Latvijas Gaze and Gazprom on Russian gas supplies to Latvia in 1994. The enterprise will not be able to pay the debt on time because a World Bank credit may be delayed. As reported, the Latvian Government allowed Latvijas Gaze to use the Japanese Import-Export Bank's credit, part of a G-24 credit to Latvia, to fulfill its obligations to Gazprom. The debt of the CIS and the Baltic states to Gazprom in 1993 constituted 4 billion U.S. dollars. On the other hand, consumers owe Latvijas Gaze 44 million U.S. dollars. The largest debtors are Latvenergo (Ls 11,000) and Sloka papermill (Ls 3,200). Latvijas Gaze sued more than 80 enterprises to the Economic Court. The court has ruled in all cases in favor of Latvijas Gaze but the debtors fail to fulfill the court rulings.
