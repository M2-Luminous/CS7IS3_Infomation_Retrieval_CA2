Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid welcomed the Palestinian offer of mediation, which would have been carried out by Fatah Central Committee Member 'Abbas Zaki, who enjoys excellent relations with the Yemenis, especially in south Yemen where he worked as representative of the Palestinian revolution in Aden several years ago. That is what Zaki himself said. He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that he would have left for Yemen had President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih accepted the mediation, but the Yemeni president's announcement three days ago rejecting any Arab or foreign mediation, on the grounds that what was happening in Yemen was an internal affair, prevented him from carrying out the mission entrusted to him by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.
