The request to reopen the case could lead to his extradition from Argentina. Priebke's recent statement to the U.S. TV network ABC, in which he admits his involvement in the German invasion of Rome, prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Center to file this request. Priebke, who admitted having had a hand in the killing of 330 Italians while serving in the SS, was discovered by a team of ABC reporters in San Carlos de Bariloche. A Simon Wiesenthal Center spokesman for Latin American affairs said Priebke "served in the German forces in Italy during World War II and participated in the so-called Rome Massacre." On that occasion "in response to an attack by Italian partisans, the Germans shot over 300 people." Priebke told ABC reporters that he participated in the massacre but did so "under orders." [passage omitted] It is up to the German courts to file for the extradition of the former Nazi. The statement by the war criminal could prompt the German courts to reopen the case it will also depend on how likely the extradition will be granted. Swastikas -- the well-known symbol of the Third Reich which persecuted Jewish people in European countries invaded by Germany -- appeared on the walls of stores in Once neighborhood, Buenos Aires, on 6 May. This neighborhood, some 30 blocs from downtown Buenos Aires, is where a lot of Jewish people live, although Asian immigrants like the Chinese, the Taiwanese, and the Koreans have also been settling there lately. Swastikas were also painted on the walls of two neighborhood synagogues.
