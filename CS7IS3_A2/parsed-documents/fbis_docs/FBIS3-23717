For official Bonn this issue is a unique indicator which determines the degree of our interaction. Moscow has an understanding attitude toward the position of the FRG leaders since a large proportion of the 2 million population of Germans of the former USSR are living in Russia. This is why the new democratic Russia has taken a number of steps to rectify the mistakes of the past. The Edict of the President of Russia "On Immediate Measures for Rehabilitation of Russian Germans," was adopted in February 1992. The Protocol on Cooperation Between the Governments of Russia and the FRG took effect in March 1993 with the objective of stage-by-stage restoration of the state affiliation of Russian Germans. This situation was also registered in a joint statement from President of Russia Boris Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl of 21 November 1991. The implementation of practical measures in this area, including preservation of cultural uniqueness and vital rights of the aforementioned category of citizens are being handled by the intergovernmental commission of the Russian Federation and the FRG on problems of Russian Germans. Four meetings have already been held in a businesslike and constructive atmosphere. Bonn is scrupulously and promptly fulfilling the commitments it has made in keeping with the agreements. Last year the FRG Government allotted more than 120 million marks for improving living conditions for Russian Germans in densely populated areas. So far only 70 million marks has actually been spent. Programs for the development of education, culture, and study of the German language are being actively supported. At the same time Germany has been reproaching Moscow more and more recently for the fact that it is not keeping its own promises for creating a Republic of Germans of the Volga Area and building up national regions for Russian Germans. It would seem that the time for this was not chosen randomly. In March there will be another meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission of the Russian Federation and the FRG on Ethnic Germans. Is this not an attempt to exert pressure on the partners and thus force the process? As far as we know, official circles of the FRG up to this point have accepted in a positive spirit Moscow's initiatives for solving problems of Russian Germans. And in principle a good deal has been done here. The Intergovernmental Commission has coordinated about 60 joint projects for economic and cultural development. Some 5.4 billion rubles [R] has been received from the state budget for these purposes, including for the needs of culture and education. Considerable funds have also been allotted by the Russian regions. A large share of the projects are being implemented with assistance from the Ministry of Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy of Russia in German regions of Omsk Oblast, Altay Kray, and the Volga area. The administration of St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast and the government of the Land of Baden-Wuerttenberg have approved the project for creating farmer settlements of Russian Germans in the village of Nazie in Kirovskiy Rayon in Leningrad Oblast. In the first stage 25 of these facilities and 15 handicraft enterprises will be constructed. A large-scale project for resettlement of Russian Germans in Pskov Oblast is being developed with the participation of the Russian side. Additionally, there is a directive from the president of the Russian Federation to establish a Russian-German university. Because of the efforts that have been made we have managed to influence to a certain degree the emigration attitudes among this part of the Russian population. Thus the number of applications to go to Germany submitted from ethnic Germans from the republics of the former USSR in 1993 (according to German figures) has decreased by 150,000 as compared to 1992. Last year about 200,000 Germans left for Germany from Russia and the CIS countries and another 200,000 have exit documents in their hands but have not yet used them. For the FRG the retardation of the rates of repatriation of compatriots should signify a considerable plus on the economic plane. Of course, the reproaches against the Russian side heard in the mass media in the FRG are sometimes not unfounded. Things are not moving as rapidly as they would like. And the main reason is our economic difficulties. They make it impossible for Russian authorities to begin to implement the earmarked projects in full measure. Last year we failed to allot our 5.4 billion from the budget for improving living conditions for Russian Germans. And German representatives working directly in the regions where ethnic Germans live are well aware of this. The Russian mass media are always writing about this as well. So is there any point in inflaming passions any more? It would seem that a position of calm and complete mutual understanding regarding this issue would make it possible to resolve in stages the problem of creating a German autonomous entity and improving living conditions in national regions for Russian Germans.
