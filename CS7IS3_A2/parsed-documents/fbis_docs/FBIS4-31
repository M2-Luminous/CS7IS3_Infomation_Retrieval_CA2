FBIS TRENDS-13APR94-CHINA-IRAN PRC Foreign Minister's Visit Reflects Enhanced Ties with Iran PRC Foreign Minister's Visit Reflects Enhanced Ties with Iran SUMMARY Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's early March visit to Iran as part of a five-nation tour has served to underscore Beijing's expanding bilateral ties with Tehran. Although Qian hinted at Beijing's interest in supporting regional economic cooperation efforts, he adopted a neutral stance on Iran's role in this regard and appeared wary of Iran's desire to lead efforts to resolve the political crisis in Afghanistan. END SUMMARY As the latest high-level Chinese visitor to come to Iran (See Note 1), Qian used his 4-6 March official goodwill visit to reaffirm the value Beijing attaches to its expanding relationship with Tehran. Meeting with his host, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati on 5 March, Qian reiterated Beijing's intention to further deepen bilateral ties, noting that the Chinese Government "pays great attention" to developing "friendly and cooperative" relations with Iran (Xinhua, 5 March). Although no specific agreements were reported signed during the visit, Xinhua's account of the meeting reported that the two foreign ministers said that China and Iran have agreed to "further enhance" their cooperative relations in "various fields including politics, economics, and trade." (Note 1) Qian's visit was the latest in a series of high-level exchanges between China and Iran in recent years--including visits to Iran by PRC Premier Li Peng and then-President Yang Shangkun in 1991, then-Minister of Defense Qin Jiwei in 1992, and Politburo member and Vice Premier Li Lanqing last summer; and trips to China by Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati and President Rafsanjani in 1992. Qian's visit comes on the heels of a significant expansion of economic ties between the two countries promoted by Vice Premier Li Lanqing's visit to Iran last July. Li signed a memorandum of understanding to provide Iran with a $100 million loan for reconstruction efforts, while Iran agreed to help the PRC "reform its oil refineries" to allow China to import more crude oil from Iran (Xinhua, 6 July 1993). Underscoring progress in developing economic ties, Xinhua accounts during Qian's visit noted that PRC exports to Iran had grown from textiles and light industrial products to "heavy machinery" and "high technology" and that in 1993 trade volume between China and Iran rose to $712 million, a 63.2 percent increase over the previous year (4,6 March). Caution on Nuclear Cooperation Apparently reflecting Beijing's sensitivity to recent Western news reports about possible Chinese nuclear exports to Iran, PRC media departed from recent practice and reported no remarks by Qian on China's nuclear cooperation with Iran. By contrast, during Li Lanqing's visit to Iran last July, PRC media quoted him as "reiterating" Beijing's standard claim that nuclear projects with Iran are "only" for the "peaceful use of nuclear energy" (Xinhua, 6 July 1993). Beijing had announced its decision to provide nuclear power plants to Iran during President Rafsanjani's September 1992 visit to China (Xinhua, 10 September 1992) and since then Chinese media have claimed that the plants will be the largest that the PRC has built abroad (Xinhua, 22 February 1993; Beijing radio, 6 June 1993). On 19 January, the Hong Kong-based PRC-affiliated wire service Zhongguo Tongxun She reported that the president of the China National Nuclear Corporation "disclosed" that China expected to begin work this year on the installation of two 300,000 kilowatt nuclear power generating units it had agreed to provide Iran. Hints at Regional Economic Cooperation Although Qian expressed Beijing's support for greater regional economic interaction in general terms, he stopped short of satisfying Iran's apparent efforts to elicit a public endorsement of the Iranian-supported Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), an attempt to create a regional economic alliance similar to the European common market. In contrast to Iranian media reports before and during the visit that attributed to Qian statements of explicit support for the ECO (Tehran Hamshahri, 22 February; Tehran Abrar, 1 March; Salam, 5 March), Xinhua quoted Qian, at a press conference on 6 March, as observing only that "all" countries he had visited during his tour are trying to "improve their economic situation" and are "ready for regional cooperation" (6 March). China's Concern over Afghanistan PRC media reporting on the visit also suggested that Beijing and Tehran do not see eye to eye on the question of resolving the Afghan crisis. Suggesting that Beijing is wary of Iranian efforts to impose a settlement on its terms, Qian failed to endorse Velayati's proposal, made at their meeting on 5 March, that Afghanistan's "neighboring countries" should play a greater role in bringing an end to the civil war there because of the "failure" of U.N. mediation efforts (Xinhua, 5 March). Instead, Qian stated only that Beijing was "deeply concerned" about the Afghan situation and repeated China's standard position on such regional disputes, calling on "all factions" to resolve the confict peacefully. By contrast, in Qian's 22 February meeting with Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali in Islamabad at the beginning of his tour, Qian expressed his "appreciation" for Pakistan's efforts to "settle differences" among the various Afghan factions and "restore peace and stability" there (Xinhua, 22 February). Implications PRC media commentary on Qian's visit underscores Beijing's continuing efforts to develop closer bilateral ties with Iran, particulary in economic and trade relations. At the same time, although Beijing supports more regional cooperation in principle, it appears concerned about greater Iranian involvement in the countries along China's borders. (AUTHOR: SIMON.
