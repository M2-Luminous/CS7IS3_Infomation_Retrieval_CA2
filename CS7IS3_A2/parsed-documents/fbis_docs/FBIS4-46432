It was learned at the weekend the three were arrested in a small villa on the coast north of Naples in November or December last year and found in possession of counterfeit documents, ten passports which had been stolen in the United States and address books packed with the names and telephone numbers of people resident throughout the Middle East. The suspects were named as Echen Oyechei, 22, from Nigeria, Barle Binda Brown, 32, who claims to come from the United States, and Yvette Perbach, 21, from former East Germany. Policemen from Castel Volturno, on the southern Tyrrhenian north of Naples, took the trio into custody in a villa rented in the names of foreign nationals, including that of Echen Oyechei. Many of the residents of the area are members of the military attached to the nearby NATO base and their families. Also turned up during a search of the small villa, it was learned at the weekend, were notes written in coded Arabic, credit cards and other documents in the name of Italian journalist and writer Roberto Gervasi and newspaper clippings of reports of bombings, terrorist acts and protest demonstrations which had occurred in the Israeli- occupied Arab territories, especially Gaza. Also found were maps of the centers of cities and towns on the southern Tyrrhenian around Naples and photographs of Castel Volturno law enforcement personnel and notes on their movements in patrolling the area. Oyechei declared himself a political prisoner at the time of his arrest and, later, claimed that he was working for Israeli intelligence on a search for a Palestinian terrorist, said the U.S. FBI was looking for him and threatened suicide if he were turned over to U.S. authorities. The woman who identified herself as Barle Binda Brown reportedly was found to speak English with a Ukrainian accent when she was questioned in what she claimed was her native language. Shortly before her arrest, she and the other woman taken into custody arrived in Italy together on a flight from Istanbul. As investigations into the three were pursued, the Caserta police chief, Luciano Rosini, ordered tighter surveillance and checks of the area ahead of the Group of Seven industrialized nations summit in Naples, on the calendar for early next month.
