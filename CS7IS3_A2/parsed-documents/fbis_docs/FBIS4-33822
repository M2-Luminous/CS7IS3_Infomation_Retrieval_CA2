The calendar was good justification for him. No one can ignore the extent and depth of the changes produced by the current international situation -- quite different from the situation 30 years ago in the middle of the Cold War. At that time of tension and confrontation, Cuba undoubtedly represented a threat to the Americas' common choice of the liberal, democratic system of government, which inspired the OAS. It was almost a nightmare: The path on which Fidel Castro put his country a few months after the ousting of Fulgencio Batista brought the Cold War to Latin America, disrespecting all borders. The socialist bloc never had any complaints about Fidel Castro's performance as its forefront agent. Without much work by foreign ministries or information offices, the Cuban revolution became an export product to all of Latin America. It was copied, like here in Brazil with a Sierra Maestra-type guerrilla in Caraparo, or in Angra dos Reis. The death of Che Guevara gave the revolution a proto-martyr. The revolution also created the Latin American Solidarity Organization (OLAS) as an alternative to the OAS. None of this could survive the end of socialist regimes. Cuba was left drifting away, and it gradually approached the market economy, like China and Vietnam. The obsolete speeches by Fidel Castro have not been consistent with the increasing number of concessions he has been forced to make. "No matter what we have do to save the revolution and the conquests of socialism, we will never quit socialism," Castro said this year on the revolution's 35th anniversary. These are the last signs of an ideology that already has been placed in the museum of history. Under such circumstances, it makes no sense to keep Cuba isolated from the community of the Americas. It makes even less sense to support the commercial embargo that is punishing Cubans while turning obstinate Castro into a hero. The lucid and persistent diplomatic action undertaken by Baena Soares is more significant for the Cuban people than the regular solidarity campaigns. Early this year, the UN Human Rights Commission report advocated the end of the embargo in order to strengthen its diplomatic-negotiating capacity. In June, while abstaining from using commerce to pressure China, the United States renewed China's most-favored-nation status without any strong evidence of progress in this country's human rights record, which the United States had demanded. Putting an end to Cuba's banishment is just a matter of consistency.
