The COPEI leadership believes the country's problems will not be solved with simple cabinet changes. The National Committee's conclusion was announced by Acting Deputy Secretary General Freddy Delgado Dalo who said that it is necessary to establish a coherent policy. [Begin Delgado recording] The National Committee believes that simple cabinet changes, in this case by rooking [enroque], will not solve the country's problems. The country is demanding the definition of policies and coherence in government policies, not the substitution of some men for others. [end recording] Meanwhile, Segundo Melendez, leader of the Movement Toward Socialism [MAS], said that these changes are appropriate. [Begin Melendez recording] As you know, we expressed our views on this last week. The decision made by the president is aimed at something we believe to be essential, and that is the need to create coherence and unity in the economic cabinet. This is very important for conducting the overall economic policy. [end recording] Democratic Action Party leader Pedro Tabata Guzman has said that it is necessary to see how effective these changes really were. [Begin Tabata recording] With this rooking move made by the president, all he did was create expectations. For some time now we have been saying that there was much incoherence among those who formed President Caldera's economic cabinet. I believe we must now wait to see if things change. [end recording] Meanwhile, the Radical Cause Party believes that the changes have been appropriate. This was announced by party leader Pablo Medina. [Begin Medina recording] Some appointments seem to be appropriate. We believe that naming Pompeyo Marquez as head of the government's social programs is quite appropriate. Also appropriate is the appointment of Ciro Zaa as transportation and communications minister since the former minister's actions had been questioned by former Deputy Minister Rafael Iribarren. However, in general terms, we do believe the bankers have greater control of this cabinet. The fact that Julio Sosa remains as finance minister, that Carlos Bernardez was appointed president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, and that Gustavo Roosen remains in an overly privileged position, indicates that the country's bankers have made progress in controlling the cabinet. Despite this, some of the changes made do seem appropriate. [end recording] However, National Convergence believes that the growing number of bankers in the cabinet has a clear purpose. This was said by National Convergence Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui. [Begin Uzcategui recording] There is a financial crisis, and the least that can be done is to reinforce the financial sector. If there is need to create an environment of trust in our economy and the future of our currency, then appointing experienced men, successful men--these men have not failed in their profession--is positive. Therefore, I do believe it is a positive move to create this image of credibility. All of them have been involved in banking activities with substantial and excellent banks. [end recording]
