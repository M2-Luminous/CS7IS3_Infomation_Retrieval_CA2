The Palestinian opponents of the peace process call the decision a capitulation on the part of the PLO. Statements by PLO activists in support of the process have barely been heard. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: [Begin recording] [Amir] Notables in the territories have criticized the resumption of the negotiations between the PLO and Israel. The Security Council resolution disappointed many people in the territories who hoped for greater UN support for the Palestinian cause in the wake of the Hebron massacre. Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, who is identified with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and returned to the territories following deportation to Lebanon, said that the current resumption of the talks signifies another PLO capitulation to Israel and will seriously undermine the scant level of support 'Arafat still enjoys in the territories. [Al-Zahhar, in English] The people's reaction now very simply is that is a new giving up or renounce from the PLO for the benefit of Israel and at the expense of the Palestinian side. So I think this will cancel the rest of the popular support for 'Arafat in particular. [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] Palestinian notables from Hebron also criticized the decision to hold talks between Palestinian and Israeli officials in Tunis today while Hebron residents remain under curfew and a closure is still in force in the territories. Palestinians rioted in the territories over the weekend in protest against the closure, the Hebron massacre, and subsequent incidents. Palestinian sources reported that at least 45 people were injured by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. [end recording] [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 20 March carries a related report with recorded remarks by Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar in English. Commenting on the results of the peace talks between Israel and the PLO so far, Dr. al-Zahhar says: "This policy is actually practiced with the PLO and the end result was a big zero." Dr. al-Zahhar adds: "I think this failure is temporary because of the marked pressure created by the people as a result of the massacre in Hebron's al-Ibrahami mosque. Sooner or later, they are going to implement autonomy." When asked about the possibility of a mass terrorist attack by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the Hamas' military arm, Dr. al-Zahhar says: "Nobody can actually tell what is going to happen, because you know, this is a very secret organization. Nobody actually understands their attitude at this moment. They are a very secret organization and have no relation to the well-known people."]
