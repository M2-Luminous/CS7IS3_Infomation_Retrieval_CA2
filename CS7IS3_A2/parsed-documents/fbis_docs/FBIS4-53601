Foreign Minister Gareth Evans says Australia will not offer troops to the force until there is a proper mandate and enough soldiers to do the job. Senator Evans said it was unclear whether the Rwanda operation could be done with the 5,500 troops proposed by the United Nations, and he said there was some distance to go before the Security Council decision could be translated into something that was workable in Rwanda. The international medical aid organization Doctors Without Borders says the deployment of United Nations troops to Rwanda may come too late to help save thousands of Rwandan civilians. It urged the Security Council to speed up deployment, saying that there are hundreds of people facing systematic slaughter.
