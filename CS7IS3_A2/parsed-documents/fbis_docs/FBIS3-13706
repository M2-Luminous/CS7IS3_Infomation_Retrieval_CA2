What is your comment? [Sha'th] My comment is that we are not setting impossible conditions, nor do we want to delay these negotiations. We are aware that these negotiations are our path to a just peace. In other words, these negotiations are the way leading to the beginning of the Israeli troop withdrawal and the arrival of the Palestinian police force. In the long run, this is the genuine security tool for our Palestinian people and all regional states. We are not setting difficult or impossible conditions. We would not have asked for the issuance of a UN Security Council resolution setting a mechanism of specific security measures if it had not been for this appalling massacre in Hebron. Such a resolution could have been issued two weeks ago. There has been a two-week delay in the issuance of the resolution. Tomorrow, this resolution will be put to the vote. Those who want a swift resumption of the negotiations should see that this resolution is approved by the UN Security Council tomorrow, Friday, so we can begin implementation of the mechanism of security measures and so we can return to the negotiations. [Mu'addi] What point have the consultations, contacts, and efforts to resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations reached? [Sha'th] Efforts are continuing on all levels. Contacts were held in Tunis last week with Dennis Ross, an Israeli delegation, a Russian Foreign Ministry envoy, a Norwegian Foreign Ministry envoy, and others. Here in Egypt, too, contacts are being led by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. Efforts are also continuous in Washington. All efforts aim at securing the resumption of the negotiations. However, this resumption must be accompanied by security measures, which are neither irrelevant, difficult, nor impossible. Such measures are necessary to provide security for the Palestinian people so we can go ahead with the peace process. [Mu'addi] Is the Palestinian side awaiting the UN Security Council resolution and a U.S. response to the Palestinian demands? [Sha'th] The issuance of the UN Security Council resolution with U.S. approval is a very important matter. This is because this resolution includes some executive measures, including the responsibility of the United States and Russia in their capacity as the cosponsors of the Madrid peace conference, in following up the implementation of these measures. Therefore, we believe that the issuance of this resolution tomorrow will provide an important opportunity for meeting our demand to resume the peace process and achieve security at the same time. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin proposed that Palestinian policemen who resigned during the intifadah be recalled so that they may be deployed in the Hebron area. What is your comment? [Sha'th] As I said before, many of the measures that have been taken by Prime Minister Rabin and the Israeli Government are part of a sound orientation toward admitting that the Palestinian people face a real security problem. However, the proposed solutions are not the required ones. For example, regarding the Palestinian police force, why should we recall previous Palestinian policemen when the Declaration of Principles [DOP] we signed in Washington provides for the deployment of a Palestinian police force affiliated with the Palestinian authority throughout the West Bank and Gaza -- in Gaza to implement the agreement and in the West Bank to implement so-called early empowerment. We want to see the DOP implemented. Its implementation should begin with the immediate deployment of the Palestinian police force instead of recalling old police personnel, some of whom, anyway, could be fit to join the new police. This is desirable. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much for this interview. [Sha'th] Thank you.
