The loan, through the International Development Association, will support the Songliao Plain agricultural development project, which will cost a total of 382.3 million dollars, the World Bank said. Most families in the project area have an annual income of about 140 dollars. "They are constrained by single crop production, low productivity, and an uncertain market for the crop," said project manager Rapeepun Jaisaard. The project, the official said, will increase the amount of available farmland and overall productivity by reclaiming currently unarable land and expanding irrigation on already farmed land. About 6,200 hectares of saline-alkaline wasteland in Liaoning Province will be reclaimed under the project.
