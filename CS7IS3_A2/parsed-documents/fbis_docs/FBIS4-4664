The objectives of Canberra and Washington are the same -- to persuade Beijing of the intrinsic merits in political as well as economic liberalisation. Both nations have criticised China for its recent crackdown on dissidents. However, while Australian policy is to treat human rights separately, the US risks boxing itself into a corner by making these issues an integral part of trade and foreign policy. Australia does not have the economic clout of the US and our interests as a member of the Asia-Pacific community are not always in harmony with those of the US. Our approach on human rights, set during last year's visit to China by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, is a quieter one. Yet it has resulted in two parliamentary delegations being invited to study conditions in China. These have provided a foundation for informed and patient lobbying in Beijing. The US approach is founded on President Clinton's readoption of "linkage" -- tying progress on human rights to the rest of US policy. Hence the threat to withdraw China's most-favoured-nation [MFN] trading privileges. Such a move would severely damage China's economy. The US takes about 30 per cent of China's exports and the raising of tariff barriers would have a punishing effect on the remarkable economic expansion led by southern China. But there would also be collateral damage to Hong Kong (the conduit for Sino-US trade) and Taiwan (which has invested heavily on the mainland). The stakes are also high for the US. While trade sanctions might pressure China into a positive response, this would be inconsistent with past responses by Beijing's leadership. It is more likely the present tension will further cool relations between China and the US and harm the latter's own interests in the region. The US Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, drew a predictable response with his forceful remarks in Canberra on Tuesday [8 March]. Angered by China's arrest and detention of several dissidents over recent days, he said: "These actions will have a negative effect on my trip as well as on the subject under review" -- that is, MFN. Beijing's response was to make more arrests while saying it would not tolerate external pressure over human rights, even if it meant losing preferential trade arrangements. It is difficult to see how Mr Christopher's visit to Beijing over the next few days can lead to productive results in such a hostile climate. The US posture on human rights reflects the best aspects of the American ethos. However, there are problems in linking it to foreign policy. Former president Mr Ronald Reagan's secretary of State, Mr George Schultz, was a critic of linkage, and for good reason. He showed the US could, without fuss or fanfare, achieve real results where noisy criticism had failed -- especially in cajoling the former Soviet Union to ease restrictions on Jewish emigration. But President Clinton's more aggressive and overt approach arouses concern about the direction of US foreign policy, especially in this region. The Clinton policy has been driven by the US Congress. It was congressional outrage over the violent suppression of political dissent in Tiananmen Square and Dili that led to MFN reviews for China and Indonesia. (Jakarta reacted more favourably to US trade pressure than has Beijing because it was in line with Indonesia's trend towards gradual political liberalisation.) Congressional demands for faster growth in US employment were also behind the President's ill-considered decision to pick a fight with Japan over trade access. The US should be in no doubt that these issues are all capable of causing unintended but real harm to Australia's interests.
