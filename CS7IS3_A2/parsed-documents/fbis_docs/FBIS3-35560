He said: Muslims and officials in Islamic countries should not not be tricked by the Zionists' deceitful rationalizations. It would be foolish for anyone in the world to think that a few extremist or mentally ill Jews could commit such a crime without a hand from the Israeli and American military. Explaining the reasons for the crime, the head of the legislature said: Presently due to the blessing of the Islamic revolution the Zionists are facing great waves of popular struggles and Israel with America who are well aware of the consequences of the deep rooted resistance by the children of the intifadah, Hamas, and other revolutionary children of Palestine, are committing such horrendous crimes. He also expressed regret over and criticized the silence of international organizations and associations regarding the crime. He said in this respect: What is being presented today as the Middle East peace plan has no other aim than the expansion of the hegemony, crimes, and ominous aims of the Zionist regime. Stating that this crime would not have happened if 'Arafat and his cronies had not accepted the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Majles speaker referred to the principled Iranian policy on the Zionist regime and said: Muslim nations and governments should accept the reality that the enemy will come forward a step for every step that they take back. Finally Nateq-Nuri hoped that the children of Palestine will continue their struggles with greater morale and uproot the usurping regime occupying Jerusalem.
