Economists said the figure appeared moderate and could augur well for future budget deficits, but noted it was not yet clear what it comprised and exactly how it would be financed. Politicians slated the figure as an understatement of the true cost of the programme. NP [National Party] spokesman Marthinus van Schalkwyk said the R39bn figure was a "deliberate and spectacular underestimate". Preliminary results of an independent study costing the programme indicated that about R75bn would have to be spent in the first year alone. The study, commissioned by the NP two months ago, would be published next week. He called on the ANC to release full details of its own costing, and how it had been arrived at, so people could decide whether it was convincing. "The time has finally come for a serious public debate about how much voters will have to pay for the ANC's promises." The ANC plans to release a detailed study of costs and priorities, drawn up by the National Institute for Economic Policy, after 22 April. Institute head Max Sisulu said that was the date scheduled for handing over the study to the ANC/COSATU[Congress of South African Trade Unions]/SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance leadership. The R39bn figure quoted by ANC economics head Trevor Manuel represented new outlays over and above existing social expenditure by the state. It could be financed by a variety of sources, ranging from cutting other budget items to introducing user charges. Rand Merchant Bank economist Rudolf Gouws told a Centre for Policy Studies seminar in Johannesburg yesterday that he welcomed the release of the spending figure as it would help bankers convince foreign investors that government would not "explode the deficit to 10 percent." ANC parliamentary candidate Alec Erwin, speaking at the same seminar, said it would take at least another 10 years for the vision outlined in the RDP to come to final fruition. He said there was a misunderstanding that the state would carry out the entire programme. He reiterated that an process of consultation was being conducted with the private sector, and boasted that its expertise would be harnessed through the National Economic Forum in drawing up the Budget. He appealed to business people to "talk hard and talk fast" if they had any problems with the programme. Witwatersrand University professor Charles Simkins warned that the next government might be so preoccupied with managing a balance of payments crisis that the aims of the RDP would get let behind. SA would not be able to sustain the economic upswing without further IMF loans, which meant economic policy conditions would be imposed on the country. SAPA reports that the DP finance spokesman Ken Andrew said the omission from the ANC's plans of a commitment to contain the budget deficit confirmed the DP's fears that an ANC government would mortgage SA's future by borrowing excessively to finance its extravagant promises.
