Where does economic information end and spying begin? [Farner] Indeed, the legal status of economic intelligence agencies in Poland is not specified in definitive detail. However, this is also the consequence of the fact that many other things in our economy have not been properly legally defined. Economic intelligence agencies are not particularly loved anywhere in the world, but their role in the stabilization of the economy is nonetheless appreciated. Their existence minimizes the risk inherent in all economic initiatives that require cooperation with one, several, or even more contractors or subcontractors. Economic intelligence agencies make it their business to gather generally accessible information about such firms and to analyze their findings. Their conclusions can provide a basis for deciding whether to enter into cooperation or terminate negotiations. [Winiarski] What does "generally accessible information" mean? [Farner] It means information that reports companies' turnover, profitability, and credit rating, and supplies lists of their contractors and subcontractors as well as regular clients. The better these data look, the more attractive the given firm's business image, which in turn helps to make business contacts and secure new contracts. In Poland, that sort of information is often deliberately withheld and made "classified" by the firms themselves, which usually does more harm than good. A business partner who has something to hide is simply not very credible. Of course, I refer here to information that should not be kept secret. Consequently, many firms, both Polish and foreign, use the services of economic intelligence agencies not in order to analyze the available information but to obtain it in the first place. This secrecy undermines the credibility of may Polish enterprises. [Winiarski] So you believe that all information should be for sale? [Farner] Most emphatically not! Paradoxically, our companies do not attach any importance to the protection of information that is really essential to their interests. I am thinking here mainly of technological processes and information networks and data bases that can be penetrated very easily, without even needing to enter company premises. There are firms in our country that pursue such activity in the guise of economic intelligence agencies. That is a most dangerous phenomenon. [Winiarski] Do Polish companies often turn to firms like the AIG to secure their help in checking out foreign, or even domestic, contacts? [Farner] In my view, they do it far too seldom, and even when they do turn to us, it is usually five minutes before they are due to sign a contract. That is when the real trouble starts. It is only large companies, with properly developed marketing networks, that have come to appreciate the "preventive" role of economic intelligence agencies and use their help from the very start of the negotiating process. This not only allows them to save time but also saves them a lot of money. The truth is that, unless we begin to treat our own money seriously, we are bound to lose it. We still need some time before we can come to appreciate that truth properly. Nevertheless, even now there are some discernible changes for the better in our economic landscape. The number of fraudulent operations actually carried out or attempted in our business circles is decreasing, although it is still difficult to check out and assess the credibility of business partners with 100-percent certainty. We are still waiting to see the creation of trade and industrial organizations, membership of which would be tantamount to a guarantee of a company's credibility and reliability. It is also quite hard to put proper information dossiers together in our circumstances and to build up adequate data bases for economic analysis. [Winiarski] So how do you solve this problem? [Farner] During the three years our firm has been in operation, we have collected information on nearly 800,000 economic entities throughout Poland. We have standing cooperation agreements with 15,000 partners, and we have accumulated a considerable pool of information on foreign firms operating in our country. This gives us a significant overall bank of information, which enables us to carry out many commissions thoroughly and accurately. It also helps us in work involving finalization of completed negotiation processes before the signing of final contracts. This sometimes enables us to save our client firms from getting into serious trouble. [Winiarski] Have you handled such cases in our region? [Farner] Yes, there were several such cases here. Not long ago, a Szczecin manufacturing plant was virtually on the eve of finalizing a rather large contract for the amount of $100,000 with a foreign partner. The name of the foreign company sounded good, and its letterhead looked impressive, but the Polish firm still turned to us--at the last moment--to check out its potential partner's credibility. And what did we find? It was a typical front company, intending to cheat the Polish partner. Fortunately, we were able to ascertain this before the final contract was signed. [Winiarski] So what guidelines should our companies follow before they move to finalize any business transactions? [Farner] First of all, they should adopt the principle that "a lack of confidence in a potential partner means that you take your own interests seriously." They must not be impressed by the way the partner's representatives look and dress, by their cars, the equipment and interior design of their offices, or their declarations of a splendid financial condition. Everything should be checked and cross-checked several times over, and expert assistance should be sought for that. [Winiarski] But where are the trustworthy experts to be found? After all, you admitted yourself that there are occasional black sheep among economic intelligence agencies. [Farner] There is no precise recipe here. One possible successful method of choosing such a partner is through the grapevine--that is, obtaining a report on the work of an economic intelligence agency from people who have used its services before. And it is definitely essential to make use of their services, just as it is essential to treat one's money seriously and not invest it in risky undertakings. It is not enough to find a potential partner; you must still sign a satisfactory contract with him, which will offer a good chance of profitable business to both sides. Business dealings require not only mutual respect but also mutual confidence. However, you have to work hard to secure both.
