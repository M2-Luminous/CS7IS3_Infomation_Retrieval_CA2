"I can't deny the possibility of a little delay," Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] told reporters after the regular morning cabinet meeting. Her agency is working on the package as instructed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for compilation by "mid-January," Kubota said. But she indicated the chances of delay while citing the need for further discussion among coalition parties and some uncertainties still remaining over political reform, Hosokawa's previously stated "top priority" for his administration. Kubota said there were no questions or comments over the stimulus measures at the cabinet meeting. Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency chief quoted Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno as saying that the recent rally in Japanese stock prices stems from "bargain-hunting" against strongly rising overseas stocks. Mieno was speaking at a meeting of economic ministers held before the cabinet meeting. On the dollar-yen exchange rates, Mieno stressed the dollar has recovered "half" of its losses against the yen since January last year with the weakening of the yen since December to the range of 110 to 112 yen to the dollar, Kubota said. She also quoted Mieno as saying that interest rates have fallen to record levels, but bank lending has remained sluggish.
