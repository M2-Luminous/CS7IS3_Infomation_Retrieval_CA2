The radio quoted an Interior Ministry statement as saying Mohamed 'Abdallah Abdul Rahman al-Khilaifi, who was first identified as a Moroccan, is a Libyan. Khilaifi, who has been in Sudan for one year, was injured when security men engaged the attackers in a shoot out last Saturday. The statement said his family migrated from Saudi Arabia to Libya in 1928 and live in the north African country. The statement identified two attackers who were killed in the shootout as Abdulabgi Yousif from Chad and Yassir Mohamed 'Ali from Sudan. The two had been described only as "West Africans" on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir, said on Wednesday that those accused of involvement in the mosque attack would be given a fair trial. He said the attackers also planned to kill a Saudi businessman, Usama bin Ladin, who lives in exile in Sudan. The Sudanese Government has said there is no link between the gunmen and the radical Islamic movement, the Takfir and Hijra Islamic fundamentalist organization. The movement, which was born in Egypt during the days of slain Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, was known for terrorist activities.
