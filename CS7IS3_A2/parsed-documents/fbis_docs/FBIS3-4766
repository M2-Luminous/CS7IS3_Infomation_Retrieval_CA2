They also identified the cause for these changes for the better. During his second working visit to Vietnam, Mr. Lee Kwan Yew, the famous Singaporean statesman who has been called an adviser to Vietnam in the market economy by the foreign press, frankly commented that the Communist Party of Vietnam was the best leadership for Vietnam. It is capable of maintaining the country's security. It is also the party that has been leading the Vietnamese Revolution since its embryo. The party was experienced and the party leadership was needed by the people. Vietnam has made steady progress. More changes will take place in Vietnamese society. Those comments by Mr. Lee acknowledge an irrefutable fact and that is, in the past, in the present, and in the future, Vietnam and the Vietnamese need the Communist Party leaderhip for their renovation process. There exists in the world a scheme to change the political system in Vietnam under the theory that pluralism and the multiparty system are required to create real renovation. Those who advocate this theory are doing what they can to carry out their scheme. However, whether they can implement their scheme remains a question. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese people are seriously looking straight at the painful and costly lessons from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. They see that pluralism and multiparty system only lead to chaos and collapse. [Words indistinct] fruits of the revolution which were obtained by blood and sweat of many generations and without which they cannot have independence, freedom, and prosperity. These opposition forces are shamelessly making use of the human rights issue in order to interfere deeply into Vietnam's internal affairs. Proceeding from the essence of democracy reserved for the majority of people, Vietnam is prepared to dialogue to have those who want to know all aspects of human rights. They absolutely do not accept the imposition of human rights concept from any countries as well as all plots which make use of the human rights issue to interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs. They are ready to consider opinions saying that the human rights aspect in Vietnam is different from international law in order to perfecting laws and courts in service of democracy by the people and for the people. [sentence as heard] In Vietnam, we are aware that current democracy must be further constructed in the interest of the majority of people. In its essence, this democracy is better than the one who reserved for the minority of people or a certain class. Only a democracy by the people and for the people can maintain a lasting security for the country and lead the renovation process to success.
