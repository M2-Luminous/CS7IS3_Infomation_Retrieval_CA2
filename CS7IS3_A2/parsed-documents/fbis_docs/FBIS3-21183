When corporations can correctly understand the import of these guidelines for an area that was previously ambiguous, they can be at ease as they carry out joint work. However, they may get into unforeseen trouble if they don't pay careful attention to issues such as the total market share of the participating members or to deciding how the research results are used. In July 1993 ten VTR manufacturers including Sony, Matsushita Electric, and Philips of the Netherlands announced their proposal for an international unified standard for consumer digital VTRs. It is not determined that the ten manufacturers will aggressively develop products using this standard. However, it appears that, insofar as leading manufacturers have lined up behind this standard, if a manufacturer developed other specifications it would be at a disadvantage. Creation of this kind of de facto industry standard is a kind of joint development, but would it fall under antimonopoly law? Judging on ``Rationality'' The JFTC says ``in principle, OK'' under the current guidelines when it deems that technological innovations encourage competition. The background to this includes the merging of computer and consumer electronics technology, increasing joint R&D, and and European and American antimonopoly policy. Auto parts development conducted by American auto companies in the 1960s and 1970s in response to auto emissions regulations was a victim of antimonopoly policy. However, when the Joint R&D Law was enforced in 1984 with the aim of improving corporate competitiveness, not all joint R&D was under suspicion. Instead it was judged by the ``principal of logic.'' In 1984 in the EC also antimonopoly law application was softened with regard to R&D. The world is shifting from strict application of antimonopoly law to emphasizing competitiveness. Corporations must keep in mind that this is limited to that which is actually linked to competitiveness in the market. Selection of participants and research themes, rights granted in development contracts, the technology that is developed, and the products that use that technology are points to consider. However, the most important point is the line-up of members. Access is Condition If the combined share in the direct market of the members of a joint research project is 20% or less, then there is no problem even if the members are rivals. Even when share exceeds 20%, a decision will be reached by looking at the overall character of the research and of the need for the research. A project supported by the government won't necessarily be overlooked, while there's little likelihood of problems with a topic such as environmental policy which is clearly too difficult for one company by itself. In the case of de facto industry standards, ``there's no problem if assuring compatibility will benefit consumers,'' according to Kenji Kawakoshi, attorney. However, the conditions are that the use of other standards cannot be restricted, others who aren't original members can participate in making the standards if they desire, and there must be access to the completed standards. In the case of digital VTRs, a conference was set up to consider specifications for HDTV. Any company could apply to the secretariat, pay a membership fee, and then participate in drafting the standards. If the company became a member of the working group it could cast a vote on deciding the final specifications. The final specifications are public information. The secretariat says, ``we explained the conference to the JFTC,'' so concern was shown for the transparency of procedures. When the total market share of the members is high, then naturally the way in which the development contract determines price and sales territory for products based on joint development is an issue. ``To avoid suspicion, it is better not to decide by contract which items members will discuss nor to exchange information on market competitiveness,'' advises attorney Yoshikazu Takaishi. However, development results are to be protected by intellectual property rights for patents or know-how. Legal experts say this point has been clarified by the guidelines. For example, with an eye to avoiding disputes over rights, it has been decided that there will be no problem if limitations are placed on members doing joint development with other companies on the same theme for a logically fixed period of time after completion of the original joint development project. Conditional Access Technology (Coatech) Research Institute, which developed a method for encrypting pay broadcasts, did not disclose technical information about the three key integrated circuits until March 1993. Coatech was established jointly as a specially licensed basic technology research promotion center by NHK, Japan Satellite Broadcasting, Toshiba, Matsushita Electric, and NEC. Manufacturers who were not members had to buy an IC unit in order to manufacture signal decoders. Emphasis on Individual Judgment To the extent that encryption is a technology that allows only subscribers to see broadcasts, there is a reason to maintain secrecy. However, non-participant manufacturers want to manufacture from the IC stage to lower costs. In fact, only the three participating manufacturers have produced decoders since 1991, even after JSB began pay broadcasts. Coatech arranged to maintain secrecy by disclosing information on only two of the integrated circuits. Two audio-visual manufacturers had already received permission. The JFTC has now set up an advance consultation system for joint development. ``If we say it is legal, no legal action will be taken as long as that is not withdrawn,'' says Hidekatsu Hirabayashi, regulation section chief in the JFTC's economics division. However, Shozo Obune, advisor to the Sanwa Research Institute which proposed clarification of policy on joint R&D to the JFTC's study group, emphasized that ``corporations should exercise their own judgment since the effort has been put into publishing the guidelines.'' To avoid problems, it is a good idea to report to the JFTC ahead of time and to report outside on the nature of joint work. However, joint R&D is an area of great strategic importance. There will probably always be cases of joint R&D that will not surface. There is no need to fear antimonopoly law excessively if a company takes advantage of the guidelines' clarification to set up a structure so that corporation's own research and legal departments regularly engage in frank exchange of information. Items and Excerpts from ``Antimonopoly Guidelines on Joint R&D'' Implementation of Joint R&D 1) Items which are recognized in principle as not coming under unfair methods of trade (terms for innocence): imposing requirement that necessary technical and other information be disclosed to participants, imposing requirement that secrecy be maintained regarding technical and other information disclosed by other participants, limiting appropriation of technology etc. disclosed by other participants for purposes other than the joint R&D project, limiting individual R&D and R&D with third parties on the joint research theme during the term of the joint R&D. 2) Items which may be considered as coming under unfair methods of trade (terms for gray areas): exceeding the scope necessary for preventing appropriation of technology etc. and limiting the use -- for purposes outside the joint R&D theme -- of technology etc. disclosed by other participants, exceeding the scope necessary for implementing joint R&D and limiting the introduction of the same kind of technology from other sources. 3) Items which are extremely likely to be considered as coming under unfair methods of trade (terms for guilt): limiting R&D on themes other than the joint R&D research theme, limiting production or sales by participants of competing products other than those based on joint R&D results. Products Using Technology Resulting From Joint R&D 1) Terms for innocence Requiring a minimum level of quality or maintenance of standards necessary to assure the effectiveness of the resultant technology when a supply of products based on the research is procured from other participants in the R&D 2) Terms for gray areas Limiting the production or sales region of products based on the research, limiting the production or sales quantity of products based on the R&D. 3) Terms for Guilt Limiting the price at which the products based on the R&D can be sold to third parties.
