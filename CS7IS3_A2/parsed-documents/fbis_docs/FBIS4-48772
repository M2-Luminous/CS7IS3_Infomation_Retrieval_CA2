President Taylor said these attacks are heavily concentrated on areas where NPFL has demobilized its forces, particularly in Compound No. 2 in Grand Bassa County. The NPFL leader said his organization is holding ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] responsible for these attacks, because they were present in these areas where the NPFL originally demobilized its forces. He reminded ULIMO and ECOMOG that, under the Charter of the United Nations, peacekeepers are posted to countries where conflicts have gone beyond internal control, requiring the involvement of neutral forces to end the conflicts.
