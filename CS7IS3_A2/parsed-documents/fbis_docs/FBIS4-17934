Vovers explained that during the experts' talks the main attention was paid to an additional protocol to the agreement on the discharged Russian military personnel initialled on 15 March, the draft of which Latvia submitted on Tuesday [26 April]. The draft protocol provides for the possibility of repatriation of the discharged Russian military personnel who wish to return to Russia, as well as setting up a repatriation fund. The Russian experts have agreed to the idea of such a fund. However, the standpoints of the two sides are controversial on many points of the additional protocol, Vovers said. The Russian side has submitted a list of approximately 150 military who were discharged by 28 January 1992 but have not carried out all the corresponding formalities until now as a supplement to the above-mentioned agreement. According to the initialled agreement, in the event of signing the list [as heard] these people will have the right to remain in Latvia, Vovers explained. He added that to tackle repatriation problems the Latvian side would need the list of all the discharged Russian military living in Latvia. Sergey Zotov, the head of the Russian delegation, who today discussed these problems with Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, for his part expressed the view that the talks were very difficult because the Latvian side shows excessive stubbornness and does not wish to unilaterally give in on several issues.
