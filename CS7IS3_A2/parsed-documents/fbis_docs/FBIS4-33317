She flew to San Salvador to attend the inauguration of President Armando Calderon Sol. President Violeta Chamorro said she met with Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, and Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs. The U.S. officials requested her support for the U.S. initiatives at the United Nations and OAS directed at restoring democracy in Haiti, because Nicaragua is an example of democracy. This opinion is shared by the other officials with whom she met during her visit. [Begin Chamorro recording] Everyone looks positively at Nicaragua and its people. I held interviews with representatives of the United States, China, Spain, and many other countries. All of them said: Dona Violeta, we congratulate you for your good administration. I have heard many expressions of support and received many ovations, which I sincerely believe are for the Nicaraguan people. [end recording] When asked about the U.S. request for support in receiving Haitian refugees, she said that her colleagues in the region are studying the situation and will respond during the December Summit of the Americas in Miami. [Begin Chamorro recording] I believe that working together or alone to find well-being for Haiti is worthwhile. I remember perfectly well when members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front came and asked me: What can we do, Dona Violeta, to start talks in El Salvador and find peace there? I told them that the best way was to try, and now they have peace. That is what they told me. [end recording]
