FR940325-1-00056 FR940325-1-00008 The proposal presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to eliminate suspended nonuse generated concern that property rights and financing agreements would be affected. The Department does not agree with these comments. For the most part it appears that these suspended AUMs have no real impact on ranches or on the condition of public lands. The initial proposal was intended to remove all reference to suspended nonuse because only in rare instances has forage placed in this category been made available for livestock consumption. However, given the contentious nature of the issue and the fact that the Department views the matter as merely an administrative record-keeping issue, this proposed rule does not carry forward the elimination of suspended nonuse presented in the advance proposal. Numerous comments were received on the Department's proposal to levy a surcharge when the private property serving as a base for public land grazing is leased or when livestock owned by other than the grazing permittee or lessee are pastured on public lands. This proposal was made in response to findings of the General Accounting Office (see, e.g., RCED&hyph;86&hyph;168BR), the Office of the Inspector General (see report # 92&hyph;1&hyph;1364) that permittees and lessees who sublease are unduly benefitting from their permits or leases. A major criticism of the initial proposal was that it would penalize leasing arrangements with sons and daughters of permittees and lessees who are grazing a few animals as part of an educational or group project, or sons and daughters who are trying to build a livestock herd in anticipation of assuming all or part of the family operation. The Department recognizes the need to avoid penalizing children of grazing permittees and lessees in these situations and has provided for an exemption from the authorized subleasing surcharge for sons and daughters of public land permittees and lessees. A broader criticism, which surfaced during meetings in Nevada, is that most pasturing agreements are a means of financing available to ranchers who might not be able to finance their own inventory, and that contrary to the findings of the General Accounting Office reports, they do not involve windfall profits taken by absentee landlords and permit or lease holders. Some Nevada participants also suggested that any surcharge on the subleasing of permits and leases should be formulated as a percentage of the return on the sublease rather than a percentage of the Federal grazing fee. The Department invites comment on these two considerations. Some of the comments received on the proposals relating to prohibited acts suggested that the proposed wording was subject to broad interpretation that could lead to punitive action in response to violations unrelated to grazing use. Subpart 4140, ``Prohibited Acts,'' would be amended to modify the list of acts that are prohibited on public lands that could result in the loss of grazing permits or leases under subpart 4170. Particular attention is invited to proposed section 4140.1(b)(12), which refers to Federal or State laws or regulations concerning, among other things, conservation or protection of natural and cultural resources or environmental quality when public lands are involved or affected. There are, of course, a great many laws or regulations that might fit within this category. These laws have independent enforcement authority; that is, violations are dealt with under penalty provisions in these laws themselves. This section of the existing regulations provides the possibility, in addition to these penalty provisions, of loss of the grazing permit or lease for violations. It is not the intent of the proposal for the authorized officer to take enforcement steps involving the grazing permit or lease for any and all violations, no matter how de minimus or technical; or for violations of laws that, while they do deal with protection of natural and cultural resources or the environment, do not centrally reflect upon the ability of the permittee or lessee to be a good steward of the public lands. Rather, the intent is to provide the possibility of loss of the grazing permit or lease whenever more than de minimus violations of laws occur that do concern, in a more than remote way, the management of the public lands. Subsection (b)(12) (i) through (vi) contains a narrative description of the kind of laws that, in our judgment, do directly concern stewardship ability on the public lands. It is difficult to go beyond such a narrative description to list such laws with precision, particularly in the text of the regulation itself. If that were done, a new rulemaking would be necessitated each time a law were changed by the Congress, which happens not infrequently. Furthermore, a detailed list of laws, with statutory and section numbers, would be lengthy and probably require the assistance of a law-trained person to decipher.
