At this televised news conference Walesa replied to many questions. Among other things he said the Constitution should be adopted before the presidential elections. We have for you but a few minutes from this long meeting. There are three questions, the first one about political options. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You have recently called the right-wing leaders nincompoops. You said about the leader of the left that his idol was Stalin. About Solidarity you say it is no longer your Solidarity. So I wanted to ask what is your option. [Walesa] I am carrying out precisely that which I have been asked to do by politicians, political parties, and the public. Recall, ladies and gentlemen, that during the period when I was forming the Belweder [presidential palace] set up, everyone thought that the president should be above parties, that he should not be linked to anyone, that he should be a mediator, that he should stand guard over, and so on. That is precisely what I have carried out. In connection with this today, I do not represent an option directly, although I have one. I hope I will not have to change this conception, which I also like. [Unidentified correspondent] Your choice, as far as the latest foreign visit was concerned, was Latvia. Latvia, as we all know, is probably the country most at conflict or at odds with the Russian Federation because of its Russian minority. At the same time the president voiced hard words--received, by me for instance, with satisfaction--addressed at Russia. Is the president playing out some sort of major issue here of, say, positioning with respect to a powerful neighbor? [Walesa] Ladies and gentlemen: As far as my trips outside the country are concerned, this too is perceived in a variety of ways by the public. My trips are programmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is not my whim that I want to go somewhere. Whereas as far as Latvia is concerned, it is indeed a big problem, and as far as Russia is concerned that is another problem. Ladies and gentlemen: Here there is--and yesterday, this sort of quarrel with you comes from us having enormously grand topics. [sentence as heard] For example, Russia and Latvia. Well, we have to speak about them. Is it just me who is supposed to speak about it? After all, we have stopped calling them to account for Katyn [burial site of murdered Polish officers in World War II], for the murders. The things that had been done, the things old Russia and the Soviet Union used to do, you just would not believe it; Hitler was a mere understudy. Don't you know that? Now it is like this, we are now forgiving them, because it is no longer the same Russia, because there is no Soviet Union, we behave--we, we understand this. How does Russia reply to this? It wants to be a superpower! It wants us again in its embrace! You have to--of course not like me just now, not so emotionally--you have to write about this, you have to tell the world: Listen, then it was our grandfathers and tomorrow it will be you, unless the whole of Europe defends itself against this, unless the whole of Europe says: Hang on a minute, is Poland free, Minister Kozyrev? Is it entitled to make independent decisions? What business is it of yours? We do not threaten--we want a free Russia, we are going to--we are prepared to defend a free Russia. But say it the other way. Poland chooses its own partners. For as long as I am president no one is going to choose partners for me. I am going to do it in accordance with the will of the people. Will the Western partner withstand this? Well, here, as you can see, things vary. During my term of office, I am going to want to bring about greater security in Europe, I am going to want greater prosperity. As I say, I am going to say what I think both to President Clinton and to President Yeltsin. I am not going to wear kid gloves. The truth will always be the truth and Poland's freedom will be Poland's freedom. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, regarding this question from the viewers, why are you overthrowing the government, why are you questioning the legality of the government, how do you intend to resolve your conflict with parliament? A whole series of questions, well, accusing you of badly arranging your relations with parliament and what are your answers... [Walesa interrupting] Hang on a minute, hang on a minute, why is it that some people are always seeing me as the guilty one. I do not want to overthrow any government. I am just saying that the coalition said one thing and is doing another, that it proposed one program and is proposing another. That is one. I am not overthrowing any government. Well, I think that the government should rule as long as possible but it should rule in accordance with the will of the people. But (?first)... [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to pick up here, is that all right? [Walesa] Hang on a minute, hang on a minute. So far, as you have noticed, between the government there have been no large conflicts. Of course there might have been some squabbles dragged into the daylight by journalists, but so far there has not been any conflict, let us make it clear, there is none from my side. On the other hand with parliament, well, it arose not through me--there too there hadn't been a conflict, in spite of everything we walked about together without stepping on each other's toes. It was only when they rejected the first reading--and that was arrogance, that was spite--so I am not going to play spite. Ladies and gentlemen: I am, in spite of everything, the president. That is, even if I am merely submitting a draft, they should start discussion. I am not a little boy. In connection with this, it was not I who made this conflict, I would not have made it, I am a very accommodating man. But no one is going to walk all over me. [end recording]
