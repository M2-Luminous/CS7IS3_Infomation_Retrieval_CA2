Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news conference that the Group of Seven (G-7) nations agree on promoting "stable economic growth without inflation" and that Japan is cooperating as a G-7 member. But he said each country is making its own policy to further that goal and they "are not necessarily (cooperating) for the sake of foreign exchange alone." Reports have surfaced in recent days that Japan, the United States, Germany and other major nations are acting together on interest rates, in addition to recent concerted central bank interventions in the currency markets to boost the dollar. Germany's Bundesbank on Wednesday cut two key rates by 0.5 percentage point each, with other European central banks following suit. The Bank of Japan has been guiding market rates to record lows through generous liquidity funding operations. On the other hand, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise rates again Tuesday. Higher rates in the recovering U.S. economy and lower rates in the other still-sluggish economies are expected to boost the dollar, which bounced back from near-record lows around 100 yen after the market interventions of the past two weeks. Saito said the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan do not differ on monetary policy. Central bank chief Yasushi Mieno said Wednesday he intends to keep rates low.
