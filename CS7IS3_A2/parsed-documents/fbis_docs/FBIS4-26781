Li, 51, was released Saturday from his prison in the central city of Xian. The sources said he was weak and in poor health. The former journalist was arrested June 26, 1989. He was sentenced to five years jail for "anti-revolutionary propaganda" in February 1991. The dissident had organised a strike at the Xian publishing house where he was chief editor and openly supported deposed Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang during the pro-democracy demonstrations that were brutally suppressed in 1989. He was freed on parole in February 1993 for medical treatment after suffering severe heart problems but continued his pro-democracy activities and was imprisoned again in February of this year. Li's family said he was refused proper treatment while in hospital.
