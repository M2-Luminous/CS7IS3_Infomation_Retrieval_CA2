The price index of investment goods [tou zi pin 2121 6327 0756] will rise by approximately 15 percent, lower than last year. This "spring forecast" points out that China's commodity price level has kept rising since the fourth quarter of 1992. The situation is even more serious in 1994. In the first quarter of this year, the country's retail sales price index rose by 21 percent over the same period of last year. Now, the central authorities have taken various measures to control these excessive price increases. In March, price increases began to slow down. The "spring forecast" indicates that if excessive price increases are not stopped quickly, this will endanger reform, affect development, and also cause instability in society; therefore commodity prices should not be treated lightly. Since the introduction of reform and opening up in 1979, until 1993, China's average annual economic growth rate was 9.3 percent, and the average annual rate of price increases was 6.4 percent. This situation was comparatively ideal, the "spring forecast" adds. But inflation and economic growth reached a critical level in 1993, and the inflation rate has tended to exceed the economic growth rate in 1994. Therefore, the first task in macrocontrol and regulation is to maintain a rational balance between economic growth and inflation and to strive to bring about healthy development during which the national economy will grow fast and inflation will be controlled at a low level.
