In accordance with the new statute, which is included in the political document adopted at the meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Union that took place in Luxembourg, these nine associate members will regularly participate in the meetings of the Council, will be able to attend meetings of certain working groups of the organization, and will have a permanent connection with the central planning body of the WEU in Brussels. Similarly, according to reports by our correspondent Andrei Barsan, the countries in Central Europe will be able to participate in peacekeeping operations or military activities initiated by the WEU. Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who attended the meeting together with Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca, stressed the importance of yesterday's decision, noting that it is the first time that an established security structure in Western Europe is opening up to other countries as well. Similarly, Melescanu said that for Romania the act of becoming an associate member of the WEU -- that is, the armed wing of the European Union and at the same time the European pillar of NATO -- reflects the steady efforts of the Romanian Government to achieve integration into all European structures and recognition of the path traveled by our country, as our country has recuperated certain arrears in a spectacular way compared with other countries in the region as far as integration is concerned.
