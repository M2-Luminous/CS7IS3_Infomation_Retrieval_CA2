FBIS4-58890 "drnes089_o_94006" FBIS-NES-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 SYRIA Japanese Foreign Minister Pays Official Visit Japanese Foreign Minister Pays Official Visit Kakizawa on Nagano's Remarks OW0705024494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0230 GMT 7 May 94 OW0705024494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Damascus, May 7 KYODO -- Japan will convey to China and South Korea soon what Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is thinking about Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remark on Japan's World War II campaign, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Friday [6 May]. Kakizawa told Japanese reporters traveling with him that he has instructed Japan's embassies in Beijing and Seoul to inform the countries of Hata's thinking. Kakizawa said that the justice minister has taken back his remark that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication and that he thinks it wrong to define the war as a war of aggression by Japan. Asked whether Nagano should leave the post of justice minister, Kakizawa said it is up to the prime minister to decide. Kakizawa also said he will convey his own idea to Hata after returning home Sunday. Hata, at a news conference in Brussels on Friday, said he regrets Nagano's remarks but skirted the issue of whether he will seek Nagano's resignation. Hata said that he has reprimanded Nagano over the telephone for his remarks, which he characterized as "not appropriate." Hata, however, said, "I don't want to talk about (Nagano's) resignation at this stage." In an interview with the mass-circulation daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN published Wednesday, Nagano, a former chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force, said "the Nanjing incident was a fabrication," and "I still think it wrong to define the war as a war of aggression (by Japan)." He called a news conference Friday and retracted the remarks. Following the invasion of the then Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates. Japanese historians, however, tend to cite lower estimates. According to estimates given at the war crimes tribunal in Tokyo, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the vicinity over the next six weeks.
