Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina to publish an official report about the attack on the Serb town of Brcko in northern Bosnia on Saturday [21 May]. A team of the U.N. military observers in Brcko, headed by British Captain Sean Fawcett, on Saturday inspected the scene of the attack and established from where it had come, Colonel Guzvic told TANJUG. While inspecting the place where the first shell had landed, Captain Fawcett and his team found the remnants of a rocket fired from a multiple rocket launcher which had visible Croatian Army markings on it. Five people were seriously wounded, including a one year-old girl, in the simulataneous shelling of Brcko from the Croat-held village of Vucilovac eight kilometres west of Brcko and from the territory of neighbouring Croatia. Brcko is situated at the neck of the strategic corridor along the Sava river which links the western and the eastern parts of the Bosnian Serb republic. The material damage from the latest attack is considerable. Captain Fawcett declined to comment on the attack and said he would submit a detailed report on it to his command.
