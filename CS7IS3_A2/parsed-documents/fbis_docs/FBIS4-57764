It contemplates creating 8 million new jobs in the next four years. The Workers Party (PT) leadership is keeping this program secret. It was prepared so as not to depend on legal or constitutional changes and use resources that already exist, although the PT leaders believe said resources have been badly distributed. The program, which is entitled "Impact Plan Against Unemployment," will cost nearly $25 billion. These funds will be obtained from social and constitutional funds in addition to budget allocations. The plan is coordinated by Deputy Aloizio Mercadante and has been drafted by five economists linked to the PT. It is divided into three lines of action: the creation of jobs, assistance to unemployed people, and active job policies. The program will reassign funds from the Workers' Assistance Fund and the Severance Payment Fund, among others, to investment in the fields of civil construction, agriculture, agro-industry, and tourism. The PT economists believe these fields to be the most adequate ones for creating jobs. One of the economists responsible for the program said: We will be using the funds that have financed the sugar and alcohol industry without ever benefiting those who work in the field better. They continued to be temporary workers, itinerant rural workers, and miserable. According to him, the companies that evade taxes or do not transfer Severance Payment Fund contributions to the government will be left out of all benefits. The idea is to create an data processing system that places information at the disposal of the Ministries of Labor, Social Security, and Health and makes it possible for these ministries to exchange data, thus revealing discrepancies. The agricultural cooperatives, the labor cooperatives, and the micro enterprises, which are destined to absorb large contingents of workers, will be favored when funds are allocated. PT studies indicate that as a result of ever-increasing production automation, industries such as chemical laboratories and car-manufacturing companies no longer create jobs in Brazil. In view of their economic importance, however, these industries will not be abandoned. The economist added: We believe there is a social emergency. If nothing is done in this regard, there will be 14 million unemployed people in the country in four years, and we will be sitting on a powder keg. He believes low-quality jobs must be created in massive numbers and at an speedy pace in order to absorb unqualified labor. In addition to financing machinery and equipment for cooperatives, the program contemplates the establishment of enterprise nurseries, which are common in Italy and Spain; hangars equipped with infrastructure in which the micro-entrepreneurs do not pay rent and contribute to the government only by paying taxes on their activities.
