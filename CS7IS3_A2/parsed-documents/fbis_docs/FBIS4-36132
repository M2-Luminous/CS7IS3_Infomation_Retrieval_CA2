"An interesting place, the Knesset," he wittily said earlier this week in a bid to mask his plans. "The heads of several Arab local councils in the Negev and the north called on me and urged me to found up a new movement." [Peri] And what did you tell them? [Al-Tibi] I did not say either yes or no. As far as I am concerned, you can write "he did not slam the door on them." [Peri] And what if your friend Hayim Ramon were to run in a separate list in the Knesset elections and propose you join him? [Al-Tibi] I appreciate Hayim Ramon very much and he is my friend, but such a move is not on the agenda. I do not see him running in a separate list. However, I would definitely like to be the Hayim Ramon of the Arab sector. [Peri] Will you run for the Knesset alone? [Al-Tibi] That is a weighty question which must be given proper consideration. I listen to suggestions and hear rumors. Although there is a serious vacuum in the Arab leadership in Israel, I am presently busy with other issues. This is a gray and decadent leadership, an old generation which must be replaced. Some Arab Knesset members [MK] do not deserve the people's confidence. They have contributed nothing toward promoting the Arab sector, except for making minor headlines in local newspapers. I foresee a change in the next Knesset elections. The Arab sector wants people with a track record and with influence. They want young leaders to replace these outdated men. [end al-Tibi] In the meantime, he tries very hard to extinguish 'Arafat's fires. The hot cassette from Johannesburg begat two scandals, and al-Tibi reacted swiftly. Earlier this week he summoned a news conference in Haifa to explain to the Israeli people what the Quraish tribe and the Hudaybah Treaty were all about, and to emphasize that 'Arafat is not secretly conspiring to violate the agreement with Israel. A busy week. When 'Arafat forces the Israeli people to learn chapters in the history of Islam, his Israeli adviser has to run back and forth between the newsreels on Qol Yisra'el and IDF Radio, talk shows on television, and a joint appearance with Yosi Beilin in the campus of Beersheba University. Dozens of journalists phone him and get an answering machine on the other end. 'Arafat's adviser recognizes the voices and decides when to pick up the phone. [Peri] How did the idea of appointing you as an adviser come about? [Al-Tibi] Nine months ago, me and my wife May (a dentist from Tulkarm) were invited to Tunis. I was sitting in on an extended session of the PLO Executive Committee on the eve of the signing ceremony in Washington. 'Arafat took everybody by surprise when he announced: Out of appreciation for his contribution to the Palestinian people, I decided to appoint Ahmad as a special adviser on all matters pertaining to the Israeli issue. [Peri] What does being 'Arafat's adviser mean? [Al-Tibi] It means not sleeping regular hours, being busy all day with overt and covert contacts in Israel and abroad, preparing 'Arafat's meetings with Peres and Rabin, getting a phone call from 'Arafat at 0620 on the morning of the massacre in Hebron and hearing him yell: Tell Rabin and Peres that a horrible massacre is under way in the mosque. It means that I have to sit in my office and listen to the grievances and problems of people, although this is not in my brief. People even come to me with problems such as family feuds and neighbor disputes. As far as I am concerned, the main target audience of the Palestinian leadership are the people in Judaea and Samaria, and the Israeli public immediately afterward. Let me emphasize: We must be more understanding of the feelings of the Israeli people. [Peri] What is the salary of 'Arafat's adviser? [Al-Tibi] I have not received a cent since the appointment; neither a salary, nor reimbursement for phone calls and plane tickets. However, I do not complain. Others have not received anything either. I have a gynecological practice in East Jerusalem four-five times a week, and my wife earns a living for the two of us. According to my calculations, to date I have spent $52,000. How to put it? 'Arafat owes me. [Peri] Do you believe you will ever get your money back? [Al-Tibi] Two months ago I complained to 'Arafat that the bill was getting bigger and he smiled at me. "Go to Abu-Ahmad," he suggested. I smiled back at him. [Peri] Who is Abu-Ahmad? [Al-Tibi] He is my father, and he really helps me here and there. Now that there is an agreement, he is finally pleased about what I do. [end al-Tibi] Al-Tibi is not everybody's pet. In Orient House, for example, he is known as "Ahmad Tizi." Our government ministries use other nicknames, most of them aimed at 'Arafat. Israeli Arabs are also quite critical of him, but four times already he was elected the most popular figure in public opinion polls in the Arab sector. He is 36 years old, talented and smart as a whip, hard-working, sharp, and articulate in two languages. He is telegenic and relishes a good fight with our extreme right wing. His relationship with his old friend, MK Dedi Zucker, recently soured. On the morning of the signing of the agreement on mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO in Washington, al-Tibi snuck into the Mayflower Hotel to the floor in which Rabin and Peres were staying. At the last minute, an argument emerged over the identification of the signatories. Rabin demanded "the Palestinian delegation." Al-Tibi, speaking for 'Arafat, announced that if the agreement does not bear the word "PLO" 'Arafat would stay in his hotel and there would be no signing. Al-Tibi made three shuttle trips between the hotels of the Israeli and the PLO delegations. When the bargaining was over, 'Arafat had won. Al-Tibi says that to be 'Arafat's adviser on Israeli affairs means to be attentive to feelings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and the settlements; to update 'Arafat about the results of the Histadrut labor federation elections and their repercussions on our political map. At the same time, he has the impossible mission of improving 'Arafat's dismal image in Israel. [Al-Tibi] I believe 'Arafat must take Israel's sensitivities toward him into account. After such a bloody conflict, 'Arafat should have considered Israel's sensitivities, just as Rabin and other Israelis should be attentive to our side. [Peri] Do you think 'Arafat's talk about a jihad was right? [Al-Tibi] Let me put it this way: 'Arafat should have known that the word jihad has belligerent connotations to the Jewish ear. We could have done without this sentence. [Peri] You have not been very successful in improving 'Arafat's image in Israel. Quite the contrary, his image is deteriorating by the day. [Al-Tibi] I get the impression that politicians are trying to thrash 'Arafat left, right, and center in order to score points with the Israeli public. It is really an Israeli national sport. [Peri] Tell us the secret: How did 'Arafat react to Rabin's and Peres' remarks that they cannot stand the contact of his hand? [Al-Tibi] I do not want to say how he reacted, but he definitely did not jump for joy. [end al-Tibi] All sorts of patients come to Dr. al-Tibi's clinic on Salah-al-Din Street in East Jerusalem: Palestinian women, members of the diplomatic and UN corps, Israeli women from Jerusalem's Rehavya and Pisgat Ze'ev and even from the settlements who first met al-Tibi when he worked at Hadassah Hospital and lived in the Neve Ya'aqov neighborhood. ("I ran away from there after one year because I could not afford to replace dozens of slashed tires, and I got fed up of hearing that I was a dirty Arab.") Perhaps, the epitome of normalization is taking place in the gynecological field: young women whose families are identified with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are being referred through "discreet channels" to Israeli gynecologists in Tel Aviv and Petah Tiqva for hymen reconstruction surgery. It seems the young women only trust Israeli gynecologists to be discreet, keep their privacy, and see to it that they can marry respectably. On the walls of the living room of his rented apartment in Bayt Hanina hang framed photographs of al-Tibi with 'Arafat, Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], Faruq Qaddumi, Hakam Bal'awi, and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. There is also a historic photograph of 'Arafat, al-Tibi, and Nayif Hawatimah, leader of the rejectionist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. It was al-Tibi who managed to bring Hawatimah and 'Arafat together two years ago. They have not met since then, and Hawatimah keeps firing verbal barbs at 'Arafat. However, what al-Tibi considers the jewel in his crown, the real cherry on the cake, is closing a circle of at least 10 years between Weizman ("the president of my state") and 'Arafat ("the president of my people"). [Al-Tibi] It was a dream that came true after 10 years. I am personally attached to both men. Weizman attended my wedding in Ramla, 'Arafat invited me and my wife to Tunis after our daughter Yara was born. Weizman is the most prominent Israeli politician who was ahead of his time. When he talked about what everybody is doing today he took quite a lot of criticism. I, too, feel that I was ahead of my time and took quite a few blows. Who else in the Arab sector can pride himself of sharing a true friendship with Weizman, Sarid, Yosi Beilin, Hayim Ramon, and Eli Dayan? [end al-Tibi] A specific phone call al-Tibi made six years ago from Tunis to Weizman's home in Caesarea almost led to the expulsion of Weizman, then a minister without portfolio, from the government. This week, al-Tibi discloses the full story behind that famous phone call. [Al-Tibi] Six years ago, when Secretary of State Baker presented his five-point plan and the PLO responded with a categorical "no," I went to Tunis to try and soften the PLO's No. 2 man, Abu-Iyad [Salah Khalaf]. I met Abu-Iyad and 'Arafat in Hakam Bal'awi's office. A stormy four-hour argument ensued, during which I insisted that instead of saying "no" they should say "yes, but." In the end, together with Sa'id Kamal, the PLO ambassador in Egypt, I managed to persuade them. I proposed to fly back to Israel at once and relay the message to the Labor Party, but Abu-Iyad insisted: "Call Weizman from here and inform him." I phoned Caesarea and said what I said. Weizman called Peres on the other line, and we had a conference call. Abu-Iyad and 'Arafat were sitting and listening, but did not interfere in the conversation. When then-Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir learned about it, he hit the ceiling because the PLO's positive answer pushed him into a political corner. Shamir would have preferred that the PLO's reply had been negative. To punish me, he banned me from traveling abroad for two years, while Weizman was reprimanded by the head of the Shin Bet. [end al-Tibi] The meeting between Weizman and 'Arafat in Johannesburg, after the drama 'Arafat caused in Cairo when he refused to sign the agreement, was rather cold. [Al-Tibi] I felt good with the two of them, but I had been expecting a warmer meeting. After all, they knew each other well and had exchanged political and personal messages. [Peri] The first meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat was also very tough. [Al-Tibi] It is very hard to reach out to Rabin. With Peres it is easier. [Peri] What did you want Rabin to think of 'Arafat, after being informed that 'Arafat was behaving like a man possessed, stamping his feet, screaming, and throwing a fit? [Al-Tibi] Those publications left 'Arafat very bitter and helped him to get acquainted with the intricacies of Israeli politics and the incumbent officials in the Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry. And, believe you me, 'Arafat does not forget. The fact that he smiles to people does not mean anything. [Peri] You probably rushed to inform 'Arafat what Rabin said two days ago about Netzarim, that "if this is a settlement, I am a monkey's uncle." [Al-Tibi] Everything possible must be done to make the life of the settlers in the Gaza Strip unbearable through nonviolent means and to cause them to leave of their own free will. [Peri] What do you mean by "nonviolent means?" [Al-Tibi] I do not have to elaborate. [end al-Tibi] Behind his back, people in Orient House say that he will soon find himself outside the picture, that 'Arafat will be done using him and will dump him. [Al-Tibi] 'Arafat definitely crowns and dethrones people, but I will know when to step down before they get tired of me. Although I was offered, I do not see myself as part of the Palestinian Authority in the territories. I was offered a Palestinian passport, and I responded with a big smile. I see my future in al-Tayyibah. Contrary to others, I have a place to go. [Peri] Will you retire quietly and dedicate yourself to your gynecological practice? [Al-Tibi] I do not know. I have never forsaken Israel's Arabs, and all I have done to date has been designed to meet the avowed expectations of Israel's Arab population. At the same time, I will act in any way I can for the establishment of a Palestinian state. [Peri] Do you envision yourself in the Knesset cafeteria in two years from now? [Al-Tibi] I have been to the Knesset cafeteria more than once. The question is whether I will then be a guest or I will be inviting you as my guest.
