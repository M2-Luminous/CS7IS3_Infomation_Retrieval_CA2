Furthermore, he has been received by Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. He wants a coordinating committee of the Democratic Forces for Change to be established, and he explained to Monique Mas what he expects from the international community: [Begin Twagiramungu recording] The international community should first of all help us -- and at all cost -- to establish an international tribunal to try the criminals and the perpetrators of the crimes and massacres which have been carried out in Rwanda from 6 April up to the present day. Second, we have to try to create authorities for the protection of refugees and also to ensure their safety within the framework of the supply of food aid. The role which UNAMIR plays, for example, should be redefined, and if there is any question of another force, then this force should be in a position to protect the refugees, so that they cannot be attacked by other forces, such as the militias, for example. As for the genocide, we cannot mix up the war and the massacres. The massacres which have been ordered in Rwanda quite clearly differ from the war, and I must specify that this war is the result of the massacres. Here I differ quite frankly with those who claim that it is the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] which brought about the resumption of hostilities. [end recording]
