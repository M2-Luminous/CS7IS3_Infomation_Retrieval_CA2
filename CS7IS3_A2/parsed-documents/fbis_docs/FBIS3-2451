It was founded jointly by the Communist Party of China (CPC), democratic parties, individuals without party affiliation, people's organizations, and personages from various social circles. The first plenary session of the CPPCC was held in Beijing between September 21 and 30, 1949 and attended by 662 representatives from all sections of the Chinese society. At the time, CPPCC exercised the functions and powers of the later-formed National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature. The first CPPCC session adopted the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and elected the committee of the central people's government of the PRC with Mao Zedong as its chairman. It also decided the national flag and anthem, elected the first 180-member National Committee of the CPPCC. The Second CPPCC National Committee convened its first plenary session in Beijing in December, 1954. It declared that because of the convention of the First National People's Congress (NPC), CPPCC ceased to function as the country's legislature, but continued to exist as an organization of the People's Democratic United Front. The plenary session elected Mao Zedong honorary chairman and Zhou Enlai chairman of its national committee. The Second National Committee of the CPPCC held three plenary sessions. The Third CPPCC National Committee held its first plenary session in Beijing in April, 1959. From this session on, CPPCC members have begun to attend NPC sessions without voting rights. The session elected Mao Zedong honorary chairman and Zhou Enlai chairman of the National Committee. The Third CPPCC National Committee held four plenary sessions. The first plenary session of the Fourth CPPCC National Committee was held in Beijing between December 1964 and January 1965. It re- elected Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai its honorary chairman and chairman respectively. CPPCC was forced to stop operation during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and, as a result, the Fourth CPPCC National Committee held only one plenary session. The Fifth CPPCC National Committee convened its first plenary session in Beijing in February 1976. Deng Xiaoping was elected its chairman. The National Committee held five plenary sessions. The Sixth CPPCC National Committee, which convened its first plenary session in Beijing in June 1983, elected Deng Yingchao its chairwoman. The National Committee held five plenary sessions. The Seventh CPPCC National Committee, which held its first plenary in Beijing between March 24 and April 10 of 1988, elected Li Xiannian its chairman. The National Committee convened five plenary sessions altogether. The Eighth CPPCC National Committee held its first plenary session in Beijing during March 14-27, 1993. Attended by 2,093 members, it elected Li Ruihuan its chairman. CPPCC has always been an organization for patriotic united front work under the leadership of CPC. It consists of members of CPC and eight democratic parties, democratic personages without party affiliation, members of people's organizations, representatives of minority nationalities, prominent figures from all walks of life, representatives of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and returned overseas Chinese, and specially invited people. CPPCC is an important instrument for promoting socialist democracy in China's political life. It participates in political consultations on major state policies and important issues concerning people's life, and exercises democratic supervision over CPC and the government by making suggestions and criticisms.
