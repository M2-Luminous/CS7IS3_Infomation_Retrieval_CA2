"Whoever said or recommended that should review the One-China policy," Press Secretary Jesus Sison said when asked by reporters whether Ramos should offer an apology. [sentence as received] "President Ramos and the Philippine government have not done anything to violate the provision of the One-China policy. The president of Taiwan came here only for four hours and it was all about trade and investment. We see nothing wrong there," he added. The Chinese foreign ministry and the local embassy here have strongly protested Li's low-profile visit on Wednesday at Subic Bay Freeport en route to Indonesia and Thailand, saying it was a breach of the policy. Ramos, whose late father was a longtime ambassador to Taipei, secretly slipped out of Manila to welcome Li in Subic. He also hosted a luncheon for him and his 40-member delegation of senior officials and business leaders. The Philippines has recognized the mainland as the ruler of all China since establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1975, but has recently increased trade contacts with Taipei for economic reasons. Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo on Monday also defended Li's visit and his meeting with Ramos, saying Beijing should understand that the Philippines needs investments from Taiwan at a crucial stage when it's economy is taking off. Opposition Senator Francisco Tatad on Monday, however, said that even though only economic issues were discussed, Ramos's meeting with Li was a "political act" and a violation of the One-China policy. Federico Pascual, a columnist with the mass circulation Philippine Daily Inquirer, described the visit as a "deliberate assault on cordial relations between Manila and Beijing" and suggested the two leaders could have discussed economic issues without meeting personally. "The two presidents cannot rendezvous in that scandalous manner and, when caught in flagrante delicto, insist that they do not recognize each other," he wrote. But the TODAY newspaper defended Ramos, pointing out in an editorial that the Philippines did not give full planeside honors to Li as it accords to other visiting foreign leaders. "The surreptitiousness (of the meeting) belies a sovereign intent to accord Taiwan a wider diplomatic recognition beyond the bare essentials of an economic relationship, that, surely, Beijing will not deny us since it enjoys far more of it in southern China," the editorial said. "If anyone should feel offended, it is Taiwan -- for a meeting that went more like a liaison than anything else."
