FR940627-2-00077 FR940627-2-00031 The provisions of the Act have been implemented through regulations issued by the Department of Commerce and adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services 2 . 2 The Department of Commerce regulations are at 37 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 401 and supersede applicable portions of 45 CFR Parts 6 and 8. The Act serves the public not only by encouraging the development of useful commercial products such as drugs and clinical diagnostic materials, but also by providing economic benefits, and enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the global market place. Since its passage, the Bayh-Dole Act has been effective in promoting the transfer of technology from Grantees to industry as evidenced by the aggressive pursuit of patenting and licensing and the proliferation of university/industry collaborations. 3 In addition, the development of many new and important drugs and devices have been facilitated by increased industrial support for academic research 4 and the explosion in the licensing of university owned inventions. 5 Furthermore, statistics indicate that the Act has provided significant economic benefits which are projected as increasing between 25 to 30 percent per year. 6 3 Approximately one in every four university patents issued in the late 1980s was for a biomedical or health related invention. In the early 1970's, the ratio was one in eight.

The institutions also reported that they had over 5000 active licenses in place at the time of the survey.

Grantee Responsibilities In keeping with the objectives and policy of Bayh-Dole, it is incumbent upon Grantees to effectively and efficiently transfer technology to industry for commercial development. However, in doing so Grantees must also comply with the specific terms of the Act, its implementing regulations, and the terms and conditions of each NIH award and ensure that such compliance is reflected in their agreements with commercial entities. In carrying out that responsibility, at a minimum, Grantees need to concern themselves with issues involving maintenance of academic freedom for institutions and investigators, fair access to information, timeliness of notification and other requirements, rational licensing to commercial entities, and adherence to the specific requirements of the Act and NIH funding agreements.
