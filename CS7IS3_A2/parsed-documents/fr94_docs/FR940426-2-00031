FR940426-2-00031 FR940426-2-00018 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. RP88&hyph;44&hyph;048] El Paso Natural Gas Co.; Tariff Filing April 20, 1994. Take notice that on April 15, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), tendered for filing, pursuant to Part 154 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act and in compliance with the Commission's Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Requests for Rehearing and Clarification issued March 1, 1994 (March 1, 1994 order) at Docket No. RP88&hyph;44&hyph;044, certain tariff sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A. El Paso states that on November 5, 1992, in compliance with the Commission's order dated October 9, 1992 at Docket No. RP88&hyph;44&hyph;020 El Paso filed revised tariff sheets to provide, among other things, correlative (comparable) discounts when El Paso discounted the rate it charged for the transportation of its sales gas or the gas of marketing affiliates on the mainline. On May 21, 1993, El Paso states that it filed modifications to the comparable discount provisions in compliance with the Commission's order dated May 6, 1993, which granted rehearing in part of the October 9, 1992 order. El Paso states that the Commission, in its March 1, 1994 order, found that it was a mistake to apply the comparable discount requirements of Order Nos. 497 and 636 to El Paso prior to restructuring and the spin-off of its merchant division. Accordingly, El Paso states, the Commission reversed its prior decision to require comparable discounts under the requirements of Order Nos. 497 and 636 before pre-restructuring. El Paso states that it is filing in compliance with the March 1, 1994 order. El Paso states that it has removed the comparable discount requirements for the time period prior to El Paso's implementation of restructuring. El Paso requests all necessary waivers of the Commission's regulations so as to permit the tendered tariff sheets to become effective on October 9, 1992. El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all of El Paso's interstate pipeline system transportation and sales customers and interested state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before April 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
