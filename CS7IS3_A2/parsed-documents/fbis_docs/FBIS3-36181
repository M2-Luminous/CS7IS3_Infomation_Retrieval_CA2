If peace is to be maintained, all countries must equally be involved, he told Interfax on Wednesday [2 February]. "Although it is a good document politically, said Grachev, the Defence Ministry's response to NATO's new plan is rather cautious." Grachev is concerned at the fact that all former Warsaw Pact nations and the Baltic states were seeing the plan as an intermediary stage towards full NATO membership. "If the Partnership for Peace plan will gradually drag those states into the North Atlantic Alliance without consent or consultations with Russia, we will not support it," he said. In the minister's view, NATO's enlargement poses a certain threat to Russian security. Grachev says the PP [Partnership for Peace] plan provides for coordinated effort by NATO and other countries, Russia included, over "an interim period following the break up of the Warsaw Pact." Until European political structures emerge, all states must cooperate to defuse tensions in the continent, particularly in the former Yugoslavia, he said.
