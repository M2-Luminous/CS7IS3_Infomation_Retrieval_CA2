Over 5,000 police forces broke into Kyung Hee University in northeastern Seoul around 5 A.M. Sunday to scatter about 1,800 striking railroad and subway workers and sympathizing students and arrest key striking members. Most of the workers and students who had been staging a sit-in at Kyung Hee University against the government's hard-line policy on railroad and subway labor disputes fled the Kyung Hee campus just before the police raid. Some of the students and workers resisted strongly to the police raid hurling hundreds of firebombs and wielding steel pipes for about 20 minutes before running away to Dongduck Women's University where their colleagues fled. Police then raided Dongduck Women's University again around 6:30 A.M. to apprehend 62 unionized workers and 23 students and to forcibly disperse others. The operation lasted about 20 minutes. Informed about the imminent police raid, most of the workers and students had escaped Kyung Hee University around 4 A.M. and about 800 of them gathered at Dongduck Women's University later. Police, in the meantime, secured arrest warrants for 12 leading striking workers including Kim In-hwan, head of the labor union of Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corp. (SMSC) and So Son-won, chairman of the unauthorized unionized group of train engineers and mechanics "Chongihyop" for their suspected violations of labor dispute laws and obstruction of official duties, according to a police spokesman. Police said in a statement that it was forced to mobilize the police forces to arrest the SMSC union leader Kim In-hwan and four other core members in the strike and to soon reinstate those who want to return to their works so that the crippled subway and railroad operations could be normalized. Police accused the striking workers of violating labor dispute laws because they embarked on a general strike last Friday despite the fact that the laws prevent unionists from staging a strike or any form of collective actions within 15 days from the central labor committee announced the cooling-off period for mediation. The committee had issued the 15-day cooling-off period last Wednesday. Police, meanwhile, decided not to break into Myongdong Cathedral in downtown Seoul, the largest opposition Democratic Party (DP) headquarters in Yoido and a Seoul church hall where striking railroad and subway workers are staging sit-ins, taking into consideration the status of the venues as religious and politically sensitive ones, according to the police spokesman. The SMSC unionists have been staging a general strike since Friday, three days earlier than they originally set for the strike in protest against the police raid last Thursday on the place where Chongihyop members were staging a sit-in. Since then they have occupied the DP headquarters, Myongdong Cathedral, and a few other religious and academic institutions to stage sit-ins. The SMSC has so far filed a complaint with the prosecution against 41 leading union members for their alleged labor dispute law violations and relieved 24 union leaders of their posts in connection with the ongoing strike. In the meantime, 3,647 workers or 55.7 percent of the total railroad workers reported to work by 10 a.m. Sunday, the deadline set by the Korean National Railroad (KNR), arousing hopes that the operation of railroad could be put to a normal condition sooner or later. The KNR said that it expected part of the railroad services in Seoul and its vicinity to be normalized starting Monday, adding it was still accepting intentions by striking workers to return to their works although the initial deadline expired Sunday morning. Only 36.7 percent or 3,204 workers of the total Seoul subway workers, however, reported to work as of Sunday morning, thwarting hopes to resume normal subway operations as early as possible, according to the SMSC. In particular, only 5.0 percent or 46 of the total 920 locomotive engineers returned to their works and just two percent of the total conductors reported to work. To help normalize the railroad operation, the Ministry of Defense decided to provide the KNR with 350 additional 350 military personnel who are capable of assisting in the operation of locomotives, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. The Ministry of Defense also said that it will soon put into service 270 military locomotives in Seoul and Pusan to ease traffic congestion stemming from the railroad workers strike. Last Thursday, the Defense Ministry had sent 64 soldiers capable of operating locomotives to the Transportation Ministry.
