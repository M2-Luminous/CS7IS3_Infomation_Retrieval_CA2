In 1991 the industrial list was replaced by a "Core List" containing nine sections: electronics, materials processing, advanced materials, telecommunication and navigational equipment, data security devices, sensors and lasers, marine vessels and equipment, and engines. In July 1992 restrictions on telecommunications equipment were eased, as were restrictions on computer exports in October 1993. With the dissolution of COCOM all restrictions should now be lifted. As of yesterday COCOM may be considered officially defunct. That means that more than 300 various restrictions have been lifted with regard to Russia alone. Specifically, the White House announced that as of Monday it will allow computers capable of performing 1,000 million theoretical operations per second (roughly 100 times less powerful than the most modern supercomputers) to be exported to Russia. This kind of "concession" holds out to Americans the promise of expansion of their potential market by $1.3 billion in the field of computer exports and another $15 billion in the telecommunications field. But problems still remain for Russia. Back in October of last year Secretary of State Warren Christopher put it this way: "The greater portion of export-import architecture rests on an outdated Cold War foundation. It is clear that the time has come to rebuild it." That rebuilding began with little delay. On 6 November 1993 the NATO countries plus Australia and Japan conferred and agreed in principle to remove the cornerstone of that foundation -- COCOM. And by 17 November COCOM was already sentenced to die. The money-conscious Americans long ago calculated that if all restrictions on exports to Russia and China were not lifted by the end of the 1990's the losses to U.S. companies would be as much as $250 million annually, with as many as 5,000 new unemployed joining the soup lines each year. Bill Clinton first referred to his intention of lifting COCOM restrictions at a meeting with Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver last year. That comment soon grew into the "New U.S. Export Doctrine," and specifically to the call therein for an easing of export restrictions on computer equipment, including exports to Russia. Exporters had complained that under new geopolitical conditions the COCOM restrictions were like a sieve anyway and did the most harm to exporters. It was not surprising that probably the most active proponent of eliminating this favorite child of the Cold War was the National Association of U.S. Industrialists. Resilient COCOM retreated but did not surrender, immediately agreeing to lift restrictions on the exports of computers to Russia and China with a capability of 67 million theoretical operations per second (MTOS). It also allowed exports of more powerful computers: up to 100 MTOS "on a discretionary basis" and up to 194 MTOS "by agreement with COCOM." But for fairness' sake it should be noted that the COCOM cause is alive and triumphant. Firstly, the former members of COCOM intend to replace the defunct committee with a body of a fundamentally different political orientation and composition. It will deal with multilateral coordination of control over the proliferation of high technology. They also intend to invite Finland, Sweden, Austria, Ireland, New Zealand and Hong Kong, as well as Russia and China, to join what was formerly virtually an all-NATO structure. Countries that have been found to have used or are suspected of using imported high-tech equipment for military purposes -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya -- will be left out for now. They are the ones that are going to be monitored. Incidentally, this blacklist, along with the list of members in the "new COCOM," remains open. Secondly, it is still too soon to drink a toast to the lifting of trade restrictions against Russia. Specifically, during recent meetings in Moscow the attention of U.S. Secretary of Trade Ron Brown was repeatedly directed to the existence of the long-outdated and discriminatory Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Nor is the situation any better with regard to trade with other former COCOM members. Boris Yeltsin threatened Brown with bringing up the issue of lifting restrictions against Russia at this summer's G-7 summit in Naples. So even though the last hatchet of the Cold War may have been buried, Russia still has something to fight for.
