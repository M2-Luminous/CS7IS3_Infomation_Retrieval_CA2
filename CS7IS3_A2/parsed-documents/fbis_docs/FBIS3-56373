This originated during the Vancouver summit in April last year. It was not fortuitous that the word "Vancouver" was pronounced repeatedly in Moscow these days. And still, the Moscow dialogue of the two presidents has its own value: intentions and promises predominated last year, whereas this time the two sides stated that they begin to work. This is of importance in itself because not every intention gets rapidly translated into life, which has been evidenced, in the opinion of the Russian side, by its experience of contacts with the Group of Seven (G7) as a whole. Out of all G-7 leaders, Boris Yeltsin believes, only Bill Clinton fulfilled all his promises to Russia. Mr Cliton also attained the goals of his current trip, according to his own estimates: To reaffirm partnership relations between the U.S. and Russia and express U.S. support for economic and political reforms in Russia. Singled out among subjects of discussion can be economic reforms in Russia, a European security system in the post- cold-war era, disarmament, and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Partnership is the leading idea of the Moscow declaration -- the central document signed by the two presidents. It is stated in the declaration in particular that "the two presidents announced that they would direct the detargeting of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective commands so that by not later than May 30, 1994 those missiles will not be targeted. Thus, for the time in nearly half a century, virtually since the dawn of the nuclear age, Russia and the United States will not operate nuclear forces, day- to-day, in a manner that presumes they are adversaries." In a joint statement, the two presidents undertook jointly to seek ways to strengthen guarantees of security for states which renounced the possession of nuclear weapons and strictly observe their obligations. The January 14 signing of a Russo-american-Ukrainian agreement on the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine's Territory became a real breakthrough in this respect. President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, who had arrived in Moscow by air expressly for this purpose, described this as a historic moment. Ukraine in actual fact agreed to become a non-nuclear country. In exchange for that, Kiev received guarantees of security and compensation for getting rid of nuclear arms in the form of fuel- grade uranium which Russia together with the U.s. will produce by processing weapon-grade uranium, and the removal of obstacles to the development of Ukraine's economic relations with foreign countries. Support for Russian reforms was, perhaps, the principal aim of Bill Clinton's mission. Only provided there is a stable and democratic Russia with a free economy, it is possible to build a new world order in the post-cold-war era on the basis of those values which are close to America and other civilised nations. Previously, Washington declared its support for the liberalisation of the Russian economy in general -- the quicker the better. This time Bill Clinton placed social problems related to the transition to a free market economy almost in the centre of attention. Although Clinton, during the Ostankino teleshow, jokingly remarked that he was not going to give up Alaska, in response to pronouncements by another well-known hero of live broadcasts, everything seems to indicate that the leader of the country with the classical liberal economy has come to realise the essence of the problem: disregard for social welfare development may cost one dear. Mutual understanding was also reached to the effect that Russia does not count on U.S. direct assistance in this respect but suggests opening the U.S. market to Russian commodities and technologies and lifting trade restrictions, proceeding from the assumption that Russia itself, according to Boris Yeltsin, will seek ways to resolve social problems upon effecting an economic restructuring. Among the 12 documents adopted during the summit, there are those which mark the beginning of the removal of cold-war obstructions in the trade-and-economic sphere. With the consent of other countries concerned, the U.S. announced the Export Control Committee (COCOM) -- the body which hindered the export of high technologies to Russia -- would be dissolved not later than March 31. Discriminatory restrictions on the export of Russian uranium have been lifted. The understanding of the role of Russia as a great power, the position of which has a decisive influence on the development of events in the world, on peace and security, also manifested itself in the fact that the U.S. president brought with him to Moscow the "Partnership for Peace" concept which had been endorsed by NATO leaders during the Brussels summit. The day before in Prague, those former Warsaw Pact countries which seek to join NATO as soon as possible had also agreed with the concept. Boris Yeltsin supported the concept which makes it possible to avoid the division of Europe again into two camps but this time along the border of the former Soviet Union. America's reaffirmation of the role of Russia as a great power also manifested itself in the fact that the influential group of seven economically most developed countries may soon become G-8. Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton will meet next time precisely at a G-7 summit in Naples in July. The problem of Russia's relations with the Baltic states was discussed as well. Although a joint Russian-U.S. statement on human rights contains rather general formulas, Bill Clinton publicly warned "other countries" that they should respect the rights of ethnic Russians and with this end in view promised to have talks with the leaders of Latvia and Estonia. In response, Washington expects that those states and Russia Conclude agreements as soon as possible on the withdrawal of Russian troops from there. Of course, a lot of differences were revealed during the Russian- U.S. summit talks, in views on a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. But the two presidents pointed out that there was a basis and goodwill to look for joint solutions. Herein is the chief result of the Moscow summit.
