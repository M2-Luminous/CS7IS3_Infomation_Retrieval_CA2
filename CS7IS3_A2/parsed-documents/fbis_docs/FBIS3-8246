Some people thought that they do not want to do it. They have done it. This is the biggest clear-up in the Radio since 1956. The MTI statement "Dismissals at the Hungarian Radio" in which this was officially published, is a historical document of this age. The statement formulated by Deputy Chairman Laszlo Csucs is a rare example of cynicism and hypocrisy. He, who has been working on, caressing, and polishing up the list of names for weeks, knows very well how much truth is in this statement: "The dismissals -- contrary to the published accusations -- were made on the basis of professional and ethical points of view, rather than political ones." It is enough to examine the list of names to understand what Csucs -- who with one stroke "streamlined" and beheaded the "168 ora" program -- means by professional and ethical viewpoints. Csucs's right to refer to ethics is well shown by the fact that he justified the "streamlining" by referring to the National Audit Office's [ASZ] investigations. The only unpleasant factor is that the chairman of the ASZ protests strongly against this. A few weeks ago, Istvan Csurka's Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] was ready to support Laszlo Csucs as a parliamentary candidate. This was the only party he could definitely rely on. Now it is much easier to understand the reason: Csucs has indeed implemented Csurka's program in Hungarian Radio. Presumably, others also encouraged him to do this. Some people in the Hungarian Democratic Forum would like nothing better than to build bridges toward the Hungarian Way Circles, to "prove themselves," and to gain votes from Csurka's supporters. It will be an expensive bridge but, cost what it may, there are not any free votes left anywhere else. The question, of course, is what the cabinet and the biggest governing party say about the "slaughtering on Friday" [4 March]. So far -- unofficially -- we could hear that the prime minister is unfortunately in a trap, because, although he could relieve Csucs, what would come after that? The parties are unable to agree on a successor.... And: Due to the circumstances, the government is not responsible for Csucs's actions. Naturally, it is conceivable that [Prime Minister] Boross was serious about this. However, this will not improve his position: Those people, who will demonstrate on the eve of 15 March [Hungarian National Day] -- which is also the day of the freedom of the press -- people, who are justifiably concerned about the cleanness of the elections, will not be writing to Csucs. No one wants to correspond with Csucs, who wanted to have the police remove his colleagues from the Radio building in Sandor Brody street. It is a waste of stamps. The addressee of the protest letters will be Peter Boross. There will not be many people either in Hungary or abroad who will believe that he and his colleagues -- the government members -- could not have done anything. Only to mention one factor, if more than 100 million forints from the tight budget had not been voted for partly financing severance pay then the dismissed people could not have been sent away. Naturally, after all this, we will not have a media law, and we fear that the consensus on certain issues on which there was a hope for reaching it, will also be endangered. If it has been difficult to escape from the trap up to now, it is twice as difficult now: It is a double trap. Finally, Csucs's statement also contains the weighty argument that the "radio in Canton prepares seven programs with 600 employees for 60 million people." It will be interesting to observe if the government that so steadfastly advocates joining Europe will be able or willing to do anything to prevent the complete cantonization of the public service media.
