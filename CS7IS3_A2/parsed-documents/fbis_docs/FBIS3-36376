The consignment was valued at $4 million. ETA has reported that Estonia's defense forces are now fully equipped with modern weapons. Admittedly, an Army spokesman refused to say just what had arrived and in what quantities. A year ago the Estonian Government signed a secret contract -- secret even to parliament -- with the firm of Taas [name as transliterated] Israel Industries Ltd for the delivery of weapons. Information reaching the press caused a stir among opposition factions -- deputies demanded that the deal be discussed, and the government was forced to offer an explanation. The legislators are complaining that the weapons that have been bought are not the best, and that the government overpaid almost by 100 percent in signing such a major deal arbitrarily. Prime Minister Mart Laar has been trying to show that the reverse is the case. His main argument is that Western countries have been refusing to deliver weapons to Estonia owing to the unstable situation there, but Israel agreed. And the Taas firm has supplied the weapons on credit -- until the year 2000. By late 1995 Israel will have delivered weapons worth $50 million. But, when interest payments are taken into account, the total cost will be $60.4 million. Under the contract Estonia will receive "Galil" assault rifles, "Negev" machine guns, "Mini-Uzi" pistol-type machine guns, marksmen's rifles, grenade launchers, 81-mm mortars, 106-mm guns, antiaircraft guns, missiles, guided projectiles, and ammunition. The Israeli weapons will be enough for the republic to have 12,000 men under arms. "When everything covered by the contract has arrived, Estonia will be able to resist an aggressor for as long as it takes until the international system of assistance starts working," Reyn Khelme [name as transliterated], chairman of the parliamentary Defense Commission, believes. The problem of cartridges is also being resolved. The assault rifles and machine guns meet NATO standards, so ammunition can also be bought in Europe. The republic is organizing its own cartridge production. The arrival of the Israeli ship coincided with the opening of the hearing in Tallinn City Court of the suit brought against the prime minister by State Assembly member Juri Toomepuu [surname as transliterated]. A former U.S. Army colonel, a veteran of the Vietnam and Korean Wars, commander of a "Green Beret" unit, and now Estonian citizen, Toomepuu believes that the head of government's deal with Taas has greatly damaged the republic and himself personally as a taxpayer. The parliamentarian puts his own material damages at 1,075 krooni (around 140,000 rubles) and his personal damages at 10 million krooni. We do not know whether the war veteran and weapons expert will become an Estonian millionaire. The first court hearing ended noncommittally -- the judge asked for additional material. Judging by everything, the dogged colonel will yet do some damage to the nerves of the government, which undertook to arm the republic without consulting this highly experienced serviceman....
