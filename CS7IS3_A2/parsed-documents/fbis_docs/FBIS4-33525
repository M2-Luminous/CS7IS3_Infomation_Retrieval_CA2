FBIS4-33525 "drlat110bb_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS OAS Meeting Opens, Discusses Intervention in Haiti OAS Meeting Opens, Discusses Intervention in Haiti OAS Resolution Opens Door to Intervention PA0706203994 Paris AFP in Spanish 2004 GMT 7 Jun 94 PA0706203994 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Belem do Para, 7 June (AFP) -- The 34 countries of the OAS approved a resolution on Tuesday that leaves the door open for a future armed intervention in Haiti. The foreign ministers approved the resolution, the product of long hours of negotiations, within the framework of the General Assembly that has met since Monday in Belem do Para, Brazil. The matter that extended the private negotiations, according to diplomats who participated, dealt with the insistence by some countries that the new actions that are endorsed in a general manner in the last paragraph of the preamble of the draft resolution be limited to the "peaceful" area. In the final version of the draft seen by the foreign ministers, this limitation was left out of the text. The above-mentioned paragraph takes into account "the relevancy for the members to strengthen the necessary political and diplomatic actions to bring about a lasting solution to the Haitian crisis within the framework of the OAS Charter and international law." "It is a triumph for the United States because, although it does not endorse or even mention an intervention, it does not exclude it either," a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity told AFP.
