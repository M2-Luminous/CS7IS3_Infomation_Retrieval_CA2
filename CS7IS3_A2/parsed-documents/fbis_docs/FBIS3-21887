Bristol Crown Court was told how Jamaican-born Derek Gregory had organised the smuggling of more than 100 lb of the drug in gift-wrapped packages inside four passenger suitcases at Stansted airport in July 1992. Customs and Excise officers moved in as the suitcases were being brought through the "nothing to declare" channel. The haul was the largest seizure of drugs in passenger luggage in Britain. Gregory's half-brother, Ernest Ford, 33, was jailed for 12 years and Lee Cameron, 22, for 13 years, for their part in the scheme to bring cocaine into Britain. Gregory, 26, from Paddington, west London, showed little emotion as he left the dock after being sentenced. Judge McCarraher, passing sentence, said the court knew well the evils of cocaine, "which destroys people's lives and their families, and produces crime among those who want to use it and obtain it illegally." Gregory and Ford, both of Streatham, southwest London, and Cameron, of Bristol, were convicted last month on a joint charge of conspiring with others to smuggle cocaine. The court was told Ford was the "minder," watching over the arrival of the drug consignment. Cameron was described as "the recruiter," seeking out young jobless men in and around Bristol and offering all expenses-paid trips to South America. The would-be couriers were told they would be smuggling diamonds. Three co-accused who brought the suitcases through Customs were cleared of conspiracy charges. They said they believed they were smuggling precious stones. Gregory, known as "the Boss" by his associates, had led an "international jetset lifestyle" visiting known drug locations in Africa, India, South America and the U.S. He was deported from Britain in 1989, having served a two-year sentence for smuggling cannabis.
