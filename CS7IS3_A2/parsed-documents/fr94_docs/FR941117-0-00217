FR941117-0-00217 FR941117-0-00014 In addition to the proposal by the MSRB, the PSA has proposed two initiatives to convey municipal securities pricing information to retail investors. First, the PSA proposes to develop a generic scale and yield curve for AAA-insured revenue bonds. This information, which will be made available to daily newspapers, is intended to provide customers with grade information on the price and yield of a representative range of bonds. Second, the PSA proposes to establish a 900-number which investors could call to obtain price information regarding particular municipal securities. Although the MSRB's initiative is in a developmental stage, the Commission believes it ultimately could provide the public with improved information about the price of municipal securities. If widely published, this information would allow investors to better assess the prices provided by their broker-dealers in a municipal securities trade. In light of these proposals, the Commission has decided to defer for a period of six months adoption of that part of Rule 15c2&hyph;13 requiring the disclosure of mark-ups for riskless principal transactions in municipal securities. The Commission has deferred adoption of the riskless principal mark-up disclosure proposal in order to ascertain whether the proposed price information systems can provide more meaningful benefits to investors in the long-term and to assess the progress of the industry in developing the proposed systems. Price transparency, if fully developed, will provide better market information to investors on a timely basis ( e.g., before the transaction). Potentially, price transparency also could provide investors the ability to determine the value of their municipal securities purchased in principal transactions. The proposed mark-up disclosure, on the other hand, would have provided cost information to investors only in riskless principal transactions and would not have applied to other principal transactions, the majority of transactions in the debt market. Price transparency, if fully developed, meets investors' need for information without focusing on only one portion of the market, which commenters argued could lead to a deleterious restructuring of the market, thus reducing market liquidity and narrowing the available choices of securities sold to customers. 51 51 See, e.g., Letters from Philip T. Colton, Maun & Simon (June 14, 1994); Lawrence T. Lewis, III, Managing Director, Clark Melvin Securities Corporation (June 8, 1994); and Adam Crews, President/Chief Executive Officer, Crews & Associates, Inc. (June 1, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. The Commission recognizes that these benefits depend on the sound design and successful implementation of transparency proposals. Their value to investors further depends on widespread availability of the information, and customer understanding of how it should be used. At the end of six months, the Commission will assess the need for further action based upon the prospects for the availability of meaningful pricing information to a broad range of investors about a full range of securities. If such information is not likely to be available, the Commission will explore alternatives to better provide information to fixed income investors. To this end, the Commission similarly is deferring the proposed amendment to Rule 10b&hyph;10 requiring mark-up disclosure for other debt securities. While the Commission believes it is appropriate to address transparency in municipal securities initially because of the presence of a large proportion of individual investors in that market, during the deferral, the Commission expects the industry to address the extent to which customer price information can be increased in debt markets other than the municipal securities market. The Commission recognizes that the government, corporate, and mortgage securities markets have different levels of price information publicly available. For example, GovPx, a joint venture of primary dealers and interdealer brokers formed in 1990, provides to investors real-time quotations, trade prices, and volume information for U.S. Treasury and other government securities via a worldwide network of 12,000 terminals. In addition, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') developed the Fixed Income Pricing System (``FIPS''), which collects, processes, and disseminates real-time firm quotations for 30 to 50 of the most liquid, high yield bonds traded in the over-the-counter market. 52 The Commission expects the industry to review the availability of information to investors in each of these markets and consider methods of increasing transparency as an alternative to riskless principal disclosure in these markets. 52 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32019 (March 19, 1993), 58 FR 16428 for a discussion of the order approval allowing the NASD to implement FIPS. Even though the Commission is deferring the adoption of riskless principal mark-up disclosure, the Commission continues to believe that, absent transparency in the debt markets, the disclosure of the dealer's cost along with the mark-up would be of use to customers in assessing the value of their debt securities. In the absence of progress on transparency, the Commission will revisit its riskless principal proposal. The Commission also may consider whether to require the disclosure of all mark-ups in principal transactions based on the underlying inventory costs, 53 or the prevailing market price 54 or to mandate alternative price transparency systems. 53 To comply with this disclosure, broker-dealers would have to assign a value to a security bought into inventory on either a last in, first out or first in, first out accounting basis. 54 See 17 CFR 240.15g&hyph;4 and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30608 (April 13, 1992), 57 FR 19022 for a discussion of compensation disclosure requirements for transactions in penny stocks. The Commission strongly believes that real progress is needed in a timely fashion to achieve the goal of better customer information for market prices in the debt market. Achievement of this goal will add strength to and confidence in the debt markets, to the benefit of both broker-dealers and investors.
