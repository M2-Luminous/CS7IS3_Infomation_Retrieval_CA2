Wu Yi said that MFN was the foundation for developing trade and economic cooperation between China and the United States. China has always maintained that MFN status is purely a trade issue. China has never accepted linking MFN with other issues which have nothing to do with trade. Wu Yi said: We hoped there would not be confrontation between China and the United States on the MFN issue. If confrontation were to emerge between the two sides on the MFN issue, it would not be in the interest of either country. Besides, the impact on Hong Kong and the losses the territory would suffer would be even greater. Therefore, we hope that the U.S. Government can properly settle the MFN issue between China and the United States. Wu Yi pointed out: We have expressed our appreciation to any country or stratum which has lobbied the United States to renew China's MFN status. The British Hong Kong Authorities and personalities from Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles have lobbied in the United States for China's MFN statue, and we would like to express our appreciation for this. At seven o'clock yesterday afternoon, Wu Yi arrived in Macao from Hong Kong for a three-day visit. She had just returned from a visit to the United States and had come to Macao via Hong Kong to attend a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Nanguang Holdinqs Company Limited. Wu Yi will meet Macao Governor Rocha Vieira and will attend a meeting of the Chinese Enterprises Association of Macao tomorrow morning. At noon tomorrow, she will attend a welcome banquet held in her honor by Ma Man Kei, president of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, at the Manyuen Restaurant.
