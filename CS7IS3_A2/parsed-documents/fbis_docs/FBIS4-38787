We, the deputies of the Lvov Oblast Council of People's Deputies are gravely concerned with the escalation of the activities of separatist antistate anti-Ukrainian forces in Crimea, supported by the Crimean president, the Crimean Supreme Soviet leadership, and imperial-chauvinistic forces in Russia. Supporting the Ukrainian president's recent statement regarding the situation in Crimea, we hope that the administration will take decisive consequent measures to safeguard the unity and integrity of the Ukrainian state, and thus, prevent the escalation of anti-Ukrainian moves on its territory. In light of the tense political situation in Crimea we demand that: Measures be taken to discontinue the antistate and anti-Ukrainian propaganda carried out by Russian mass media on the territory of Ukraine; Measures be taken to strengthen Ukraine's northern and eastern borders to prevent the infiltration into our territory of foreign military formations and arms. Appropriate governmental structures be requested to pay attention to the deployment of Russian troops along Ukrainian borders. To discontinue further development of separatist activities in Crimea a state of emergency be proclaimed there and direct presidential rule introduced. Proceeding from the provisions of the tripartite agreement of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States, unilateral nuclear disarmament of Ukraine be suspended until the international community provides distinct guarantees of Ukraine's territorial integrity and Russian troops are altogether withdrawn from the territory of the Ukrainian state.
