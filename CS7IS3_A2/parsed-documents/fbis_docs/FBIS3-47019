The proposal to tax such fees will be studied under fiscal 1994 tax reform plan, but the officials say opposition is expected from the Finance Ministry and the Health and Welfare Ministry on the grounds that life insurance companies are facing a severe management environment. The employees' pension fund system was created in 1967 and the government exempted from taxation the fees charged by the insurance companies for managing the funds. Home Affairs Ministry officials said the special treatment puts the national pension fund system at a disadvantage. In addition, no tax exemption is allowed if the pension fund management is entrusted to trust banks, they said. The ministry calculates there will be an increase of tax revenues of some 1 billion yen annually if the special tax holiday is abolished.
