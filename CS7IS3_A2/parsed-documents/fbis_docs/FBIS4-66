A PAC spokesman said: "The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has no control over the armed forces which remain in the control of the regime. This is a contradiction. We would have expected that control of the armed forces be given to the TEC". The organisation called for a special sitting of multiparty negotiators to reverse the TEC's decision and mandate an international peacekeeping force to normalise the situation in violence-torn areas.
