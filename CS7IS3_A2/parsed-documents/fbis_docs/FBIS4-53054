The delegation, led by Rosolino Orlando, included eight representatives from the Italian Banking Association (ABI). It met with the chamber of commerce and with top officials from the foreign, industry and agriculture ministries, as well as talking with World Bank and International Monetary Fund staff here. Great developments in Vietnam are being hampered, the Italians found, by lack of capital and some raw materials, and infrastructure, including electricity and transport. The Vietnamese authorities managed, however, to keep inflation down to seven percent in 1993, and the local currency, the dong, has remained remarkably stable with an influx of dollars after the lifting of the United States embargo against formerly-Communist Vietnam. Vietnamese industry is keen to enter joint ventures with partners who would benefit from very favourable conditions, the Italian delegation learnt, and the government is well on the way to resolving some financial problems which have beset foreign investment to date. Making Vietnam a particularly attractive proposition for Italian industry are a willing workforce and flexibility as regards new productive activities, said delegation sources who pointed out that Italian firms are already involved in strategic sectors such as energy, diesel engines, farm machinery, telecommunications, leatherwork and textiles in Vietnam. Italy doubled its exports to Vietnam in 1993, when they reached 98 billion lire (61.2 million dollars), while Vietnam's exports to Italy rose threefold to 45 billion lire (28.1 million dollars).
