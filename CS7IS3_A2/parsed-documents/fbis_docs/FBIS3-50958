During the 1980's, Rojas was a member of the Sandinist People's Army staff in Ocotal. He went by two names "The Compa Marcos" and "The Mexican." Also, he had a daughter with Luisa Amelia Sierra, an Ocotal resident who lived in the "Lacayo Farfan" neighborhood. Sierra, who was attending Managua's National Autonomous University of Nicaragua at the time, was killed in a traffic accident between Sebaco and "San Benito." After Sierra died, Marcos returned to Mexico, taking his daughter Araceli with him. Prior to leaving, he told his FSLN "comrades" that if they wanted to contact him, to call 757-4723 in Mexico City. Rojas used to hang around the church entrance in Ocotal where he would meet with certain FSLN sympathizers to teach them the "Workers to Power" FSLN song and other FSLN slogans that were in fashion back then. Some people who looked at the photograph of the "Zapatista" guerrilla published by LA PRENSA on Thursday, 6 January, estimate his age to be 40 years old, which is the same age as the Mexican Marcos Rojas. Rojas left Nicaragua in 1985, six years after the triumph of the revolution. Before he left Ocotal he said: "I am leaving, but I am taking all of Sandinist Nicaragua in my heart. But like the revolutionary that I am, I am leaving because I am needed in my homeland (Mexico)." It was difficult for LA PRENSA to gather all the information on Rojas. His photograph was obtained from a file handled by FSLN members. These were the steps taken to establish the identity of the mysterious "Marcos," chief of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN). Is this only a coincidence? Two different people with the same name, or is Marcos Rojas the man who heads the guerrilla movement of the so-called Zapatistas?
