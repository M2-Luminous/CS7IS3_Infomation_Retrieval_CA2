From 27 to 28 December, accompanied by leading comrades from the Tianjin municipal CPC Committee and Tianjin municipal government, Li Tieying and his party inspected the Puji River Course Grain Depot, Number One Flour Plant, North Station Grain and Edible Oil Store, a trade fair market; and heard briefings on grain work from the personnel of relevant departments in Tianjin. They also held a meeting with Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin municipal CPC Committee, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Lichang, and other comrades. Li Tieying touched on the issue of recent price increases for grain and edible oil in some regions. He said that the recent fluctuation in the price of grain has provided food for thought. The fluctuation occurred on the heels of several consecutive years of harvests, at a time when localities reported ample grain reserves. This has something to do with the structural problem, the attitude toward grain work, circulation of hearsay in society, people's psychology, and the inability to adapt to the demands of a market economy. The fluctuation has taught us a lesson. Of course, we will sum up the lesson of the market fluctuation. We will not revert to the old system of issuing ration cards and grain coupons; we will instead seek a way out through reform. We should know that now is the best time to establish a new grain system. There are three reasons: First, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee delineated a grand blueprint for the socialist market economy system, second, there is a relatively relaxed external environment, and we have an ample stock of grain, third, the recent market fluctuation has provided us with a real chance to study a grain system. Li Tieying said that the grain price affects the stability of the entire market, public mood, and social stability. Therefore, all levels of government should attach high importance to the grain market and grain work and do a good job of the macrocontrol of grain in a timely manner. It is quite normal that the lifting of the control on grain prices will lead to some price fluctuations as well as to the readjustment of the production and marketing of grain because of changes in the supply and demand for grain. However, grain prices must not be allowed to rise excessively, and driving up prices is not allowed. To protect the interests of farmers, grain departments should buy up grain from farmers when the price tumbles on the grain market. To bring about a fall in the price, to protect the interests of consumers, and to reassure the mood of the general public, grain departments should intervene and sell off grain when the grain price rises excessively. Li Tieying stressed that the liberalization of the grain price does not mean that a new grain system has already been established. He said it is necessary to seize the opportunity of having grain in storage and step up studying and formulating a complete and enduring grain system for China which will benefit farmers and consumers. He said that such a grain system should include the following: a grain production structure, a grain procurement and marketing structure, a grain price structure, a grain import-export structure, a macrocontrol and safeguard system, and a grain industry system which takes into account China's reality and meets the demands of a socialist market economy. Li Tieying particularly stressed the need to establish and improve a grain reserve system and a regulation fund system, pointing out that only with abundant storage for grain and an abundant storage fund can we expect to flexibly and freely regulate and control the market and establish a grain system that will promote production, guarantee supply, make the market thrive, stabilize prices, and reassure the public. Li Tieying gave high credit to Tianjin's timely adoption of forceful measures to stabilize the grain market. He called on localities to act according to the State Council's unified arrangement and to immediately increase the grain supply so as to help stabilize commodity prices, enable the masses to have a peaceful and joyous new year and Spring Festival, and create a favorable social and economic environment for the smooth introduction of various reform measures next year. Also accompanying Li Tieying during the inspection were Wan Baorui, vice agricultural minister; Ma Kai and Wang Shiyuan, vice ministers of the State Economic Restructuring Commission; and comrades from relevant departments including those from the Ministry of Internal Trade, the State Planning Commission, and the Ministry of Finance.
