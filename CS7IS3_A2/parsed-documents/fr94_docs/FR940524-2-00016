Take notice that on May 16, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;547&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to relocate the Kansas Gas & Electric Derby town border and to abandon in place approximately 2.25 miles of 4-inch and 6-inch lateral pipeline located in Sedgwick County, Kansas, under WNG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;479&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. WNG proposes to relocate the Derby town border to the site of the existing high pressure regulator setting and to abandon in place approximately 2.25 miles of lateral pipeline. The projected volume of delivery is not expected to exceed the total volume currently being delivered. The estimated cost of construction is approximately $42,212, which will be paid from funds on hand and the reclaim cost is estimated to be $2,946. WNG states that this change is not prohibited by an existing tariff and it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries specified without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
