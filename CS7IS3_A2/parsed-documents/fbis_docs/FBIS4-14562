However, during this time nothing bad was done, apart from the imposition of customs duties. This was stated today by former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov. Fedorov does not intend to join the opposition to the government and will act in support of the submitted draft budget, he stated at press conference. Asked about his attitude to the idea of Kazakhstani President Nazarbayev about the creation of a Euro-Asian Union with a single currency, Fedorov said that he supports that kind of proposal if the integration will be of the Western Europe type where a supranational currency, the ECU, is current together with national currencies.
