The president said at a news conference today that the current mutual relations between both countries and prospects for future cooperation were adequately described in the draft treaty. Answering a question of whether the property would be returned to the Polish public organizations which were active in the occupied Vilnius region in 1920-39, President Algirdas Brazauskas pointed out that this was not envisaged by the Lithuanian constitution. According to the president, similar questions were raised by Jewish organizations in Israel. However, the two conditions envisaged for the reimbursement of private or state property say that persons claiming back their property must be citizens of Lithuania and reside permanently in Lithuania. If it is proved that these conditions are fulfilled then their property will be returned, regardless of their nationality, the president said.
