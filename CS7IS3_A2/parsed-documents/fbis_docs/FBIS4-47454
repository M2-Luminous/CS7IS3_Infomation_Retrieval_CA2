N. Talalayenko, N. A. Kharin, Department of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology of the Gorkiy Donetsk Medical Institute, Donetsk; UDC 615.214.32.015.4.07] [Abstract] Derivatives of 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (ipsapirone and campirone) injected intraperitoneally or into the dorsalis nucleus raphe and dorsalis hippocampus of rats revealed dose-dependent anxiolytic action in avoidance procedure and conflict situations. Microinjections administered locally into the nucleus raphe and hippocampus revealed the role of the serotoninergic mechanisms of these brain formations in the studied anxiety conditions of varied aversive genesis. Injections of ipsapirone and campirone into the nucleus raphe elicited anxiolytic effect in various types of tests. Chemical stimulation of the hippocampus elicited an anxiolytic effect in several (ipsapirone) or isolated (campirone) tests. Dissociation of anxiolytic effects in tests of differing aversive genesis, due to the introduction of 5-OT and its agonists into the nucleus raphe and hippocampus, may indicate the ambiguous neurochemical effect of these substances, and the presence of a non-serotoninergic component in the mechanism of anti-anxiolytic action of derivatives of 1-(2-pyramidinyl)-piperazine.
