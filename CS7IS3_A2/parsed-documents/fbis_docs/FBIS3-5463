A ranking government official said Tuesday the request would be put to Russia at the coming bilateral meeting on the loans slated for late this month in Seoul. Russia has not made any clear commitment on assuming responsibility for loans to the former Soviet Union totaling 1.47 billion U.S. dollars and overdue interest of 80 million dollars, he added. This will be an important item on the agenda at the upcoming government-to-government meeting with Russia, he said. In April last year, Russia agreed with the former Soviet Union's group of creditor nations to reschedule the servicing of the group's loans as the successor to the Soviet Union. But Russia has not signed any such agreement with South Korea about the latter's loans to the former Soviet Union. Under an agreement reached by the group of seven advanced nations in November 1992, Russia will repay 61.34 percent of the loans the former Soviet Union secured from the west and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) the remainder. Russia would take responsibility for repaying all of the loans only if the other CIS member nations were unable to shoulder their share. The official said the agreement is the only document that Russia has signed in regard to repayment of South Korean loans to the former Soviet Union, though it vaguely provides for this responsibility. The government will also request that Moscow repay the loans in the form of industrial materials, land leased in the Far East of Siberia for construction of an industrial estate for South Korean firms, or the rights for South Korean fishermen to fish in the sea of Okhotsk -- instead of in the form of arms -- if it wants repayment in kind. Russia has insisted on a written guarantee covering repayment of the loans to the former Soviet Union if South Korea agrees to reshedule the debt servicing in the same manner as that Moscow agreed with the Soviet Union's creditor nations.
