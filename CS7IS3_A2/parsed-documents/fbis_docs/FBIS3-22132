The chemicals concerned are Aldrin, Dieldrin, DDT, HCH (mixed isomers), Fluoroacetamide, and Dinoseb and its salts. The new controls take the form of a requirement to abide by decisions made by importing countries about the chemicals in the light of information about risks associated with their use. This reflects international concern about the use of dangerous chemicals, mainly pesticides, in developing countries, which may not always have the necessary expertise or resources to use them safely. The requirement, known as the "Prior Informed Consent" (PIC) procedure, allows importing countries to decide whether to accept or refuse the chemicals, or apply conditions to their import. The controls have been introduced by means of an amendment to an EC Regulation (No. 2455/92). As EC Regulations enter directly into law in EC member countries, no UK domestic legislation is required to implement them or amendments to them. EC Regulation 2455/92 implements United Nations guidelines recognised by over 120 countries on the export/import of dangerous chemicals. Notes To Editors 1. EC Regulation 2455/92 came into effect on 29 November 1992. It has three main requirements: -- an export notification scheme, already in force; in the UK exporters must notify HSE [Department of Health and Safety] of exports of any of 24 chemicals or groups of chemicals 30 days in advance of the first shipment to a non-EC country; -- the Prior Informed Consent scheme; this has just been activated since the six chemicals mentioned above are the first to be added to an Annex to the Regulation and become subject to the PIC requirement; -- all chemical exports are to be packaged and labelled correctly as if they were being sent to another EC member country. 2. The Regulation applies to certain industrial chemicals and pesticides but not to shipments intended for research or analytical purposes, or when they are in the form of waste.
