(d) Minimum specific training required when relevant to a person's function includes knowledge of the following elements: (1) Requirements of the other subparts of this part; (2) Requirements of part 191 of this chapter_Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipelines: Annual Reports; Incident Reports, and Safety-Related Condition Reports; (3) Requirements of part 199 of this chapter_Drug Testing; (4) Recognition of abnormal and emergency conditions: (i) Ability to recognize abnormal operating conditions which may indicate a dangerous situation or a condition exceeding operating design limitations, such as a pressure above the maximum allowable operating pressure but not exceeding the limitations of §192.201, and to recognize other conditions such as those in §§192.605 (c) and (f). (ii) Ability to recognize emergency conditions such as an operating pressure exceeding the limitations of §192.201 and to recognize emergency conditions such as those in §§192.605 and 192.615. (iii) Training for paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (d)(4)(ii) of this section shall, where feasible, utilize simulated pipeline conditions. (5) Reaction to abnormal and emergency conditions: (i) Ability to react appropriately to an abnormal operating condition or to a condition exceeding design limitations in a manner that restores the normal operating condition or prevents the development of an emergency condition. (ii) Ability to react appropriately to an emergency condition to control or mitigate the potential for personal injury, death, property damage, and environmental damage. (iii) Training for paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section shall, where feasible, utilize simulated pipeline conditions. (6) Requirements for notifying and responding to notifications from one-call systems where the operator is a participating member; (7) Repairs of pipelines using appropriate precautions, such as isolation, purging, and venting; (8) Proper operation and maintenance of available combustible gas detecting equipment and locating instruments for underground pipelines. (9) Firefighting procedures and proper use of available equipment, such as fire suits, breathing apparatus, water hoses, and chemical fire extinguishers (by utilizing, where feasible, simulated pipeline emergency conditions). §192.813 Testing. (a) Except as provided for supervisory persons in this paragraph, to be qualified under this subpart, personnel must have demonstrated successful performance on a test of the general training elements in §192.811(c) and relevant specific training elements in §192.811(d). Testing may be performed through one or any combination of written, hands-on, or oral methods appropriate for the function tested. Supervisory persons are required to be similarly qualified or, under §192.805(c), are permitted to be qualified administratively. (b) Testing is not required for the refresher training under §192.815. §192.815 Refresher training. (a) To remain qualified under this subpart personnel, within 24 months of the date of the certification statement required under §192.819(b), must receive refresher training. Refresher training is a review of the requirements for general training and the appropriate requirements for specific training under §192.811. (b) Refresher training is required within 24-month intervals thereafter. §192.817 Competency reviews. At intervals not exceeding 7 months, but at least twice each calendar year, an operator shall review the performance of any personnel involved in an incident (reportable or nonreportable events under §191.5 of this chapter) that resulted in an explosion, fire, unintentional release of gas, personal injury or death, property damage to the operator or others, damage to the environment or that is a violation of the operator's procedures under §192.605. Among other such events are abnormal operating conditions or emergency conditions set out in §§192.811 (d)(4) and (d)(5). Within 2 months after a competency review, the operator shall: (a) Evaluate the effectiveness of qualification training, testing, and refresher training required by this subpart; and (b) Identify and implement appropriate revisions, if any, in the qualification program to improve the competency of operator personnel in order to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents. §192.819 Recordkeeping. (a) For personnel qualified to perform covered functions, the operator shall prepare and maintain written or computerized records and dates of: (1) The general and specific training elements of §192.811 which the person has satisfactorily completed; (2) The results of the testing required by §192.813 indicating the person has demonstrated successful performance; and
