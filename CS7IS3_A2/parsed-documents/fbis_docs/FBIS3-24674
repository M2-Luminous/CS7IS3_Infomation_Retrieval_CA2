Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-23FEB94-BOSNIA Bosnia-Herzegovina: Mladic's Political Clout May Be Fading Bosnian Serb hardliner and army commander-in-chief Ratko Mladic appears to be taking a less active role in Bosnian Serb politics, suggesting that his influence on the political decisions of the Serbian leadership is declining. The Belgrade daily Politika, taking note of his failure to appear in public "for some time," claimed that "well-informed" sources in Bosnia-Herzegovina "were even saying that Mladic had resigned." Politika reported that Mladic, when asked about that claim, "laughed" it off and said that he "was busy with obligations at the front." Suggesting that he may have been eased out of the leadership circle that makes political decisions, he claimed not to "want to be very much present in public" because there are other "individuals who possess more authority" who should be "in the public eye (Politika, 19 February). Further suggesting that Mladic has involved himself in directing military operations in the field rather than participating in political decisionmaking in the Bosnian Serb "capital" of Pale, recent reports have put Mladic at the fronts near Bihac in the northwest and Olovo in central Bosnia (Paris TF-1 TV, 13 February; Danas, 15 February). In contrast to his active role in opposing acceptance of the Vance-Owen peace proposal in May 1993, Mladic had relatively little to say to the media in the face of the NATO ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo and has not been observed to comment on recent calls for the reopening of Tuzla airport. According to Tanjug, on 15 February Mladic first announced his refusal to allow the withdrawal of his army's artillery from the NATO and UN-mandated exclusion zone around Sarajevo. However, the next day he declared that his forces would at least "allow UN observers to be deployed at certain positions" to monitor Serbian artillery (Tanjug, 16 February). Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin had earlier claimed that Mladic's privately expressed support for the plan had been the key factor in securing its implementation (Izvestiya, 19 February), although Mladic refrained from giving the withdrawal plan his public support until 23 February (Pale radio, 23 February). In the interim, Bosnian Serb army chief of staff General Manojlo Milovanovic served as the spokesman for the military's views (Belgrade radio, 21 February). (AUTHOR: NASH.
