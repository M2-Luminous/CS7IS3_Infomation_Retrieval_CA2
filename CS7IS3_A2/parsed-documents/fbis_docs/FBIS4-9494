He described everything else as halfhearted, obscure, and vague. The country needs a government that has the will to push the reform through, the speaker of parliament stressed. He pointed out that the present problems are connected with the policies of the majority, to which he himself does not belong, so his conscience is clear. Aleksandur Yordanov revealed his conviction that it is now the turn of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] to make a move. He said that the BSP should either commit itself more firmly to the Lyuben Berov cabinet or it should withdraw its support, pointing out that the BSP is waging a losing battle in either case.
