FBIS4-54103 "dreas101_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 South Korea Russia, DPRK Reach Agreement on Logging Camps Russia, DPRK Reach Agreement on Logging Camps SK2505104194 Seoul YONHAP in English 1028 GMT 25 May 94 SK2505104194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Moscow, May 25 (YONHAP) -- Russia and North Korea have initialed a new logging agreement featuring the stepped-up protection of human rights of North Korean loggers in Siberia, Russia's ITAR-TASS reported in a dispatch from Pyongyang on Wednesday. The report said the agreement was inked after ten days' negotiations in Pyongyang. The two countries had negotiations several times in the past to work out a new agreement but in vain due to differences over loggers' human rights issues. The new agreement will be formally signed very shortly, enabling more than 10,000 North Korean loggers to continue to work at Siberian logging yards at least in the next five years, it said. The new agreement provides that North Korea should abide by Russian laws with respect to the operation of logging yards in Siberia and should recognize loggers' right to strike as a means of resolving labor disputes. The existing agreement bans any strike by North Korean loggers. This is the first time North Korea has ever given their workers the right to strike either at home or abroad. The agreement also calls for improved treatment of loggers as it stipulates that loggers' working conditions like wages and working hours are to be set by North Korea as in the past, but they should not be unfavorably compared with those provided under Russia's labor standard regulations. During negotiations for the new agreement, the two sides did not touch on the activities of secret North Korean security agents against their loggers in the Russian territory, the report said.
