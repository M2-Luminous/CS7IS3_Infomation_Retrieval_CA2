Norman Chanoskiy [name as published], president of the Japan subsidiary of a U.S. semiconductor maker, LSI Logic (located in Minato Ward, Tokyo), is very confident about this. The ASIC business inherently requires a certain extent of "design in," or participation in product development from the design stage. LSI Logic expects to increase income by more than 20 percent in 1994 alone. The business expansion of this company, mainly in ASIC, is a barometer of the openness of the Japanese semiconductor market. Sega Procured 26 Percent Foreign Semiconductors According to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, the number of "design-in" projects by foreign semiconductor makers and Japanese users increased from around 500 in 1986 to more than 3,300 in 1993. "As far as U.S. companies are concerned, there are no ill feelings with regard to market access." Behind the confidence expressed in such a statement by the Association of Foreign Semiconductor Users (chairman, Hidehiko Yoshida) is its positive record in expanding market access. Yet, the United States came up with a new controversial issue at the regular Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks in March. It designated automobiles, telecommunications, and electronic games as the three priority areas for expanding purchase of foreign semiconductors. The section on semiconductors in the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) "Foreign Trade Barriers Report" [National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers] again raised this issue. These three sectors, accused of "inadequate efforts in purchasing foreign semiconductors," are quite at a loss as to "why they are singled out." At the end of 1993, Sega Enterprises, a major manufacturer of electronic games, had actually procured 26 percent foreign semiconductors. This represents a significant increase of more than 16 percentage points compared with 1992. The lion's share of Sega's semiconductor procurement consists of mask ROM's (read-only memory). In 1993, foreign share in its mask ROM purchase was 25 percent, but this is expected to increase to 50 percent in 1994. Furthermore, Sega buys almost all of the CPU's (central processing units) used in its 16-bit electronic game systems, its top product line, from Motorola. Sega and Motorola formally started doing business in 1991. Eikichi Utsugi, deputy chief of the First Purchasing Department of the Materials Division, recalls that, "In the beginning, we set a very tough price level. Motorola made admirable efforts to meet our demands." Sega was given a "Good User" award by Motorola in 1992. A Sega home electronic game system, "Genesis" is displayed at Motorola's plant in Austin, Texas. This is a symbol of the "honeymoon" between the two companies. On the other hand, Sega also makes strict demands on European and U.S. semiconductor makers. The 1 megabit (1 mega = 1 million) DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) used in Sega's 16-bit game systems has 16 input/output ports. At present, only Toshiba is able to supply this product. Utsugi points out, "If they want us to buy more, they should be able to make products we need." The Whole Picture Remains Unclear An even wider gap exists between the views of Japan and the United States regarding semiconductor procurement for automobiles and telecommunications. The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) expresses quite straightforwardly its discontent with the fact that "the major Japanese carmakers' procurement rate of foreign semiconductors is less than 10 percent." However, Mitsubishi Motors managing director Shigeru Nakagawa refutes this claim, saying, "We believe the foreign share exceeded 20 percent three years ago." There is a glaring gap between the two figures. Texas Instruments Japan expects Toyota Motors and Honda Motors to use quite a number of its digital data processing IC's [integrated circuit] in their new models to be introduced around 1995. Motorola Japan has a team of marketing personnel devoted exclusively to the Toyota Group in Nagoya. It has been actively engaged in IC "design-in" for a few years. Both sides are moving steadily in their efforts. However, automobile makers mostly procure their semiconductors through parts makers. Since the whole picture of the Toyota Group remains unclear, it is difficult to refute U.S. charges effectively. Lack of Concrete Counterarguments In telecommunications, while SIA officials complain that "foreign semiconductor makers' participation in IC design-in for large equipment is still inadequate," the international procurement office of NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation] claims that "NTT is not a party to the semiconductor agreement." NTT says that it announces specifications for equipment it intends to purchase, and the suppliers are determined by bidding. It has no say in the semiconductors used in this equipment, since they are left to the discretion of the suppliers. What makes the position of the automobile makers and NTT difficult is the fact that unlike Sega, they do not have actual data to refute U.S. charges. Of course, they can insist that "the issue of semiconductor procurement concerns the parts and equipment suppliers." However, if they want to convince the United States of the openness of the market, they may have to involve the suppliers in a major effort to compute the procurement rate of foreign semiconductors and to evaluate the progress in design-in. These two industries are now faced with the tough decision of whether to fight the battle in an arena prepared by the United States. At present, after the 20-percent share of foreign semiconductors has been achieved, the United States is now focusing on opening up specific sectors. Automobiles and NTT are both considered sectors where the Japanese Government's demand will easily be met, and where it is easy to apply pressure to expand imports. U.S. companies, which learned how to pry open a closed market during the 1980's, are indeed hitting Japan's most vulnerable parts quite deftly. Business leaders in the semiconductor industry are truly distressed about the fact that "after we have been able to achieve certain results in the market as a whole, they now come up with new disputes."
