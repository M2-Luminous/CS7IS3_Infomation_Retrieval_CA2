Only time will tell whether this event will turn out to be a Christmas gift to the country, but for now this is what Yuriy Baturin told IZVESTIYA's correspondent about the circumstances surrounding his appointment to the new position. President Yeltsin telephoned Baturin in his Kremlin office 5 January and said, according to Baturin, literally the following: "I have come to the conclusion that it would be right for the president to have an assistant for national security. I would like you to be this assistant." Doctor of Juridical Sciences Yuriy Baturin was offered his former position in the president's administration in April 1993 and had almost two months to think it over and accept, with his formal appointment coming on 2 June 1993. But the tone in which the president's new request was couched ruled out any delays and Baturin agreed immediately. Being no doubt in possession of much more extensive information than he can reveal today, Baturin realized at that moment the precise nature of the danger threatening the president, the state, and Russia, the diverse interconnections, and the reason why a certain role in preventing this danger was being assigned by Boris Yeltsin precisely to him. When describing Yuriy Baturin it is evidently necessary to dwell primarily not on his businesslike qualities, no matter how high they might be, but on his personal qualities. Being in many regards an "outsider" in the president's administration and a highly obstinate person who only superficially accepts the apparatus rules in operation there, Yuriy Baturin has nonetheless succeeded in integrating within the presidential apparatus, primarily due to the fact that he lacks personal political ambitions (his ambitions lie in some different sphere). He has the rare ability to abandon his personal motivation outside the offices he has occupied and, thanks to this, many people both in Yeltsin's apparatus and in Gorbachev's apparatus earlier on have found him to be an obstacle that is difficult to surmount, rather than a rival in the struggle for power and influence. Baturin asked just one question during his 5 January telephone conversation with Yeltsin: Would he be able to carry on performing his duties as assistant to the president for legal affairs? The president replied that the nature and volume of his new duties would hardly allow him to physically cope with that, although there are no objections at all in principle to Baturin continuing to assist the president also in the sphere of his legal policy. A new assistant will evidently be appointed to replace him, someone from among a number of qualified jurists whom Baturin himself would be able to nominate, although the final choice will rest with the president. During his conversation with IZVESTIYA's correspondent, Yuriy Baturin refused to offer an exhaustive definition (not even a list of general functions) of the extremely broad term "national security," claiming that it would be more appropriate to do so not in a newspaper interview but in the concept of national security which ought to be elaborated on a priority basis with his participation, but the principles and details thereof have not yet been coordinated with the president. His appointment to the new position came as a complete surprise to Baturin and to everyone else, as did the earlier edict disbanding the Ministry of Security, which the former assistant to the president for legal affairs saw only after it had been signed. But, since the end of December, on Yeltsin's instructions, and in his former capacity, he has been taking part in elaborating the Statute of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] jointly with the former leadership of the Ministry of Security, reported to the president on this matter, and the latter was evidently pleased with it. His practical experience of work with security organs is evidently limited to this. Already exercising his new powers as assistant to the president for national security (incidentally, he is the only one of the president's assistants whose range of duties is enshrined in an official description of his office), during the Christmas holidays Yuriy Baturin met with FCS Head Nikolay Golushko and his first deputy Sergey Stepashin, and had a separate meeting with Colonel General Nikolayev, chief of the Federal Border Service. Baturin will evidently have meetings in the very near future with the leadership of the Army, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the Foreign Intelligence Service, and other structures which are conventionally described as "power structures." The separation of powers with the Security Council, which will continue to function under the president, is being clarified. According to Baturin, his appointment has not resulted in any changes regarding the future of leaders of the Presidential Protection Directorate, which has recently expanded its activity beyond the limits of strictly ensuring his personal protection right up to the setting up of its own analysis subunits. Answering a question about the way his new activity fits in with his former beliefs, Baturin replied that he does not intend to "convert" and adapt his well-known and firmly held legal beliefs to some new tune. Especially since the law offers the basic system of security for citizens and the state alike. But the special services, whose activities will henceforth be in his charge, by their very nature operate in conditions of extreme necessity -- so who but a legal expert is best placed to define the criteria of such necessity and the limitations for any retreat from overall law and order permissible under extreme necessity, if it were to arise at all? Yuriy Baturin evidently attaches priority importance in the sphere of national security to the creation of powerful analytical subunits which should, from this specific point of view, evaluate the objectives of the Russian state's national policy, including economic, legal, foreign, domestic, and regional state policy, as well as the means used to attain these objectives. Security primarily means the security of citizens, the president is perceived as the main guarantor of this security bearing total responsibility for it by virtue of his office, and state security is conceived in the key of the concept of a rule-of-law state, in other words a state which attaches paramount importance to the interests of its citizens and not of its functionaries.
