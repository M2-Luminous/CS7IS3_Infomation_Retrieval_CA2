The Israeli side has thwarted the attempts to contain or bypass them. Not a single day passes without Israeli measures that aim to remind the Palestinian side of the limitations of its role and of its responsibility toward what Israel regards as its security interest. It would be an extreme simplification to suppose that all the problems could be solved in closed rooms without this resulting in measures in Gaza and Jericho that would affect the Palestinian citizen and limit his freedom and his ability to pursue his ambitions toward his national objectives. I do not think that anyone in our country or our citizens abroad considers the Cairo agreement to be a fulfillment of their national objectives or their liberation from the yoke of occupation. The occupation laws remain, and changing or annulling them depends on the Israeli side's approval. The streets of Gaza and Jericho are open for the armed settlers as well as for the Israeli army. None of the clauses of the "Gaza-Jericho First" agreement contain any reference to the possibility of developing it outside the context of the concepts of the Israeli Labor Party's program, specifically to the concepts of the Jordan River as Israel's security border, of withdrawal from the populated areas, and of keeping the settlements, or the majority of them. Therefore, it would be naive to suppose that the antioccupation activities will stop because the Cairo agreement has been signed or because the Palestinian police have started to patrol the streets of Jericho and the Strip. While acknowledging that no one wants internal fighting or the fabrication of problems with the Palestinian police, we should not forget the presence of the Israeli side and the duties imposed by the Cairo agreement on the Palestinian side toward the antioccupation activities. These might, unintentionally, lead to friction and tension. We started to feel some of its aspects in the past few days, such as the firing on the Jewish synagogue in Jericho, the arrest of armed agents in the area, and the Palestinian side's compulsion to hand them over to the Israeli police after showing Israeli identity cards. Similar incidents took place in Gaza, such as the killing of two persons accused of being Israeli agents. We hope that these incidents will remain very limited and that they will be dealt with patiently and wisely. But the nature of the exceptional situation in which the Cairo agreement has placed us makes it a situation fraught with unhappy and possibly grave expectations. Hence, matters should not be left to chance. The literal implementation of the Cairo agreement in an area where armed men from the Israeli army and settlers move alongside the Palestinian police and other Palestinian parties will increase the dangers of friction. Throwing just one stone might create a major problem. Such problems could also arise in cases where a Palestinian citizen commits a security violation outside the Palestinian police's jurisdiction, in which case the latter would be required to arrest and hand him over to the Israeli police. Should such cases happen -- and we hope they will not -- they will then be a source of tension, more doubts, and unease. The important thing is that this should not develop into friction between Palestinian citizens and that the differences should remain political and expressed democratically and in a civilized manner. This necessitates the presence of a Palestinian body that includes supporters and opponents or members acceptable to these two sides. It should comprise independent Palestinian figures with political and social weight who are respected by all. The body would constitute "a panel of jurors" that will rule on differences between the national forces and prevent these differences from developing into some sort of fighting that will only benefit the enemies of our people. It is a great mistake to suppose that administrative tools alone are enough to resolve all possible serious problems. The presence of a "panel of jurors" will not harm the Palestinian authority, especially as it has already accepted a Palestinian-Israeli civilian committee for cooperation and coordination that monitors the activities of its departments and the extent of their adherence to the agreement. Since this is the case, why should there not be "a panel of jurors" from outside the Palestinian authority that can monitor the extent of this authority's adherence to the conditions of national unity and the Palestine National Council's resolutions, for the sole purpose of preventing differences from assuming grave dimensions that will not be in anyone's interest?
