At 09:00 Moscow time (06:00 GMT), about 25,000 people started the celebration Marching along Moscow's central Tverskaya Street from Triumfalnaya (Triumph) Square to rally on Manezh Square near the Kremlin. The parade accompanied by two orchestras was organized by the Federation of Labor Unions. Addressing the rally, Mikhail Nagaitsev, chairman of the Moscow Federation of Labor Unions, urged the government to introduce a legislative bill making the withholding of salaries and wages a crime, to index salaries to inflation rate and adopt a state employment program, as well as intensify the work of law-enforcement bodies in their fight against crime and corruption. "We are in favor of (the civic) accord and civic peace, but not at the expense of the working people, of depriving the common people of their rights," he said. One hour later, another parade, sponsored by the Russian Communist Party and other political parties, marched practically along the same route. It also held a meeting on Tverskaya Square, with nearly the same number of demonstrators. At 10:00 Moscow time (07:00 GMT), about 20,000 demonstrators rallied on October Square holding anti-government banners and slogans. The demonstration was called by the Liberal-Patriotic Party Renewal along with the Russian Communist Workers' Party (RCWP), and the All-Russia Communist Party of Bolsheviks. The RCWP leader Viktor Anpilov appealed over loudspeaker for a nationwide political strike scheduled for early October. He stressed the need to rebuild socialism in Russia. After their first meeting, the demonstrators, which were joined by Russian Communist Party leader Anatoliy Zyuganov and former Soviet speaker Anatoliy Lukyanov, marched toward University Square at 11:45 Moscow time (8:45 GMT) for an additional meeting there. The current labor day coincides with the easter Sunday in Russia, and also with the one-year anniversary of a bloody conflict between demonstrators and police in Moscow. Over 150 people were injured in the clash.
