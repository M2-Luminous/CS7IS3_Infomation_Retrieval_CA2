Kim made the remarks to South Korean correspondents stationed here at Diaoyutai Guest House, where he stayed in Beijing, before winding up his five-day visit to China. He said, "I have a firm belief that we can defeat North Korea without any fighting and confidence that we can maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula." He said he had told President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders the details of his government's position on North Korea. "I confirmed to the Chinese leaders that South Korea has never had any intention to absorb the North or isloate it. Rather, I told them we have a strong will to support the North Korean position in international society and help it." "We should take the posture," he emphasized, "of playing an important role as a member of the international community. And the world is not in a position to make a decision without consulting South Korea." Kim told the correspondents that South Korea must cooperate with major countries around the Korean peninsula including the United States, Japan, China and Russia in order to maintain peace and stability. Foreign Minister Han will visit Russia early next month after visiting the United States and Japan to discuss security on the Korean peninsula, President Kim said. While explaining his talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Kim said that Beijing places great weight not only on the North Korean nuclear problem but also on peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia. Kim said he had the impression that Jiang believed responsible talks between the top leaders of South and North Korea are important for the resolution of all problems. Kim thus hinted that China will play a strong role in efforts to realize an inter-Korean summit. With regard to the Chinese president's visit to Korea, Kim said he believed Jiang will come, possibly in the second half of this year. Commenting on economic cooperation in the Northeast Asian region, Kim said he thinks that South Korean-Chinese economic links will proceed rapidly. "I was able to confirm that China has as strong a desire for economic cooperation as we have," Kim said. Kim is to arrive in Seoul later in the day.
