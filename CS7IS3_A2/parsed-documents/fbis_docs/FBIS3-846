Despite obstacles of all kinds put in the way of the party during the election campaign, it has been officially recognized as a buffer group in the new National Assembly. Conscious of its uniqueness and placing itself resolutely above the fray, the UTD intends to strive as hard as possible to help achieve national reconciliation and economic recovery which are today the major priorities of the Togolese society.
