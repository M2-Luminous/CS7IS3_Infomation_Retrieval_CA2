FBIS4-37716 "drnes121_l_94002" FBIS-NES-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Warns of War in 3-7 Years Warns of War in 3-7 Years TA2306051394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 0400 GMT 23 Jun 94 TA2306051394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that if Israel does not make peace with Syria, a war could break out in three to seven years. Rabin reaffirmed that a referendum would be held to decide any serious territorial concessions on the Golan, but, Rabin added, peace without concessions is impossible. The prime minister was addressing the annual conference of the Qeren Hayesod, the United Israel Appeal, in Jerusalem. [Begin Rabin recording] Those who tell you that we can achieve peace just for peace, peace without all Golan Heights, lie to you. If they could, why they didn't succeed to achieve 1 per mill of the area of the Sinai? How can they mitigate that for peace with Egypt you have to return till the last square inch and to say that vis-a-vis Syria, we can achieve peace just for peace? Total nonsense, total nonsense! Whoever would like to say that he is for all the Golan Heights, he has to prepare for war three, five years, or seven years from now or ten years from now. We tried to achieve compromise. We have not yet succeeded. I hope that the visit of King Husayn in the United States will bring about the resumption of the talks -- not in Washington, here, in the area. I don't need any more the Madrid peace conference but as a background. I need now bilateral talks with every Arab partner. [end recording] [Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 23 June on page 1 carries a similar report on Rabin's address by Batsheva Tsur and news agencies. The report quotes Rabin as saying that "Iraq tried to develop nuclear weapons. Iran is trying to do this. Against whom, if not against Israel?" ["Rabin said, `There is consensus in Israel about keeping Gush 'Etzyon, Ma'ale Adumim and the Jordan Valley under Israeli control for security and not political reasons,' and added that Jerusalem must remain united forever as Israel's capital." [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 23 June carries a report by Esti Perez about an impromptu news conference held by Rabin at the end of his address. In a recorded passage, Rabin says: "I hope very much that what was agreed in the trilateral U.S.- Israel-Jordan meeting in Washington on economic issues and in the bilateral contacts will be pursued in July in our region, which would be much simpler than traveling to Washington." [Referring to a meeting with King Husayn, Rabin says: "The reported possibility of a public meeting exists. I think that in addition to such a meeting, it is very important to make progress in the negotiations on the components that will ultimately enable the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan." [Perez adds that the prime minister disclosed that he is scheduled to meet with Palestinian elements next Monday to discuss what he described as outstanding issues. In a recorded passage, Rabin says: "Many issues were left pending. For example, the international passages are not yet operating in accordance with the agreement and the question of the safe passages and civilian issues remain unresolved."]
