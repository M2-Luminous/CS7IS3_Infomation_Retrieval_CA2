FR940928-1-00046 FR940928-1-00013 By this notice, the Department is defining colored fluorescent and colored incandescent lamps because section 321(a)(30)(B)(iii) and section 321(a)(30)(C)(ii) of the Act contain exemptions for these lamps without defining them. After a meeting with lamp manufacturers and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Department believes that a colored lamp can be defined by using a suitable minimum value of the Color Rendering Index (CRI) or a correlated color temperature. The National Institute of Standards and Technology personnel have researched CRI values and correlated color temperatures for many different colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps. The National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends and the Department agrees that either CRI or color temperature will sufficiently define colored lamps. The Department is proposing that a CRI value less than 30 and a lamp color correlated temperature either below 2,500 ○K for red and yellow colors or above 7,000 ○K for blue and green colors will allow an exemption for bona-fide colored fluorescent lamps while requiring all of the ``white'' lamps to meet the standards. Likewise, colored incandescent lamps must have CRI values below 50 and a lamp color correlated temperature either below 2,500 ○K for red and yellow colors or above 7,000 ○K for blue and green colors to be exempt from standards. The Department further proposes that these lamps be designed, designated and marketed specifically as colored lamps. DOE requests comments on the two proposals for definitions of colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps. The Department also invites manufacturer's to send data on CRI measurements and color correlated temperatures for colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps. The Department believes that the measurements required to determine if a lamp is colored by the above definition are minimal. The CRI is a required measurement for fluorescent lamps and manufacturers would only have to make a CRI measurement for lightly tinted incandescent lamps such as ``jeweler's blue.'' The color temperature is derived from spectroradiometric measurements correlated to a blackbody and the spectroradiometric data for most lamps already exists so manufacturers use a chart to determine the correlated color temperature. Note that the ``jeweler's blue'' lamp may require a heavier tint to pass the proposed incandescent CRI cutoff so the Department is advising the manufacturers to evaluate the CRI of any lightly tinted incandescent lamps. However, the Department believes that if the CRI for incandescent lamps is raised, that could allow a manufacturer to circumvent the standards with lightly tinted lamps. Today's proposed rule also contains a definition of an exempt rough or vibration service incandescent reflector lamp. Section 321(a)(30)(C)(ii) of the Act contains an exemption for ``rough or vibration service applications'' of incandescent reflector lamps without defining this term. After several meetings with lamp manufacturers and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Department has determined that there is no industry-wide accepted agreement on a definition for a rough or vibration service incandescent reflector lamp. Also, it appears that there are very few incandescent reflector lamps which are marketed solely for rough or vibration service applications. From a study, ``Findings on Incandescent Reflector Lamps,'' conducted by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, DOE has determined that sales data for long-life or vibration service applications are not collected separately and that approximately 20 percent of the present incandescent reflector lamp market is comprised of lamps marketed for those purposes. The Department was unable to separate the long-life reflector lamp market and the vibration service reflector lamp market. However, most lamps designated as ``Long-life'' rather than ``Vibration Service'' have a C&hyph;9 filament with 4-supports. Additionally, three large lamp manufacturers use a C&hyph;17 filament with 12 supports to characterize their rough service incandescent reflector lamp. The Department believes that lamps labeled and marketed for rough or vibration service should either meet a design standard (a C&hyph;17 or C&hyph;22 filament) or a performance standard (pass a vibration test). Only such lamps would qualify for a rough or vibration service exemption from the standards. Since reflector lamps with C&hyph;9 filaments are marketed for long life and since there is no industry consensus for the C&hyph;9 filament as a vibration design, the Department is proposing to define a rough or vibration service application lamp as an incandescent lamp designated and marketed specifically for rough or vibration service. Additionally, this lamp must have either 6 support wires with a C&hyph;17 or C&hyph;22 filament configuration or the lamp must meet a vibration test. The 6 support wires were proposed by one of the manufacturers and the Department believes that they will provide enough additional vibration resistance while maintaining better lamp efficacy than the 12 support wires normally used in a rough or vibration service lamp. The proposed vibration test is a modified Naval test specification 2 for ruggedness of large tungsten filament lamps and consists of a vibration frequency test going from 5 to 33 Hz in 1 Hz increments and a 2 hour vibration endurance test at 33 Hz. The Department requests comments on this proposal. 2 Correspondence to the Office of Codes and Standards from Osram Sylvania, Report # E&hyph;3727, Proposed Naval Test Specification for Ruggedness of Large Tungsten Filament Lamps (Shipboard Use), December 3, 1970.
