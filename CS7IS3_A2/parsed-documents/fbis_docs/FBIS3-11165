What follows is a conversation between CLARIN and CILFA [Argentine Pharmaceutical Laboratories Industrial Center] Director Pablo Challu, former secretary of commerce in the Carlos Menem administration. [CLARIN] In view of the latest U.S. pressures, will CILFA continue to oppose the patents law, or will it advocate a negotiated solution? [Challu] The climate for a patents law has changed dramatically, because at the end of 1993 Argentina, the United States, and other countries signed the GATT agreement which includes a chapter dedicated to pharmaceutical patents. Argentina will honor and fulfill that international agreement, as it should, and will have a patents law by the end of 1994. [CLARIN] We no longer have any conflict, then. [Challu] It is not that simple. We (CILFA) ask countries that have signed the agreement -- and among them the United States and its laboratories -- to respect the agreement. [CLARIN] You want Argentine laboratories' acquired rights recognized? [Challu] The agreement recognizes the exclusive rights of the laboratory that develops a drug. We accept this. The agreement also establishes a series of exceptions and the possibility of granting licenses. This provision will guarantee, through the appropriate legislation, the existence of sufficient competition in the market. The agreement also establishes a transition of 11 years for developing countries before the full implementation of the measure. This is natural, because developing countries were granted a period of transition of between 30 to 40 years to end their agricultural subsidies. [CLARIN] Which is the main hurdle blocking a solution to this conflict? [Challu] The problem is that we accept the GATT agreement, with all its consequences, but foreign laboratories do not understand it that way. That is the problem. There is haste, and we suffer pressures. Why do they refuse to wait until the end of the year, and want a law now? Because they have the possibility of threatening us with unilateral economic sanctions. At the end of the year, when all congresses in the world approve a similar law, the possibility of imposing economic sanctions will end. [CLARIN] Is one of the sanctions the refusal to let Argentina join NAFTA? [Challu] We understand it to be an unacceptable argument. It would be reasonable to expect concessions in exchange for something else within NAFTA. But it would be absurd to accept what they are requesting without offering anything in exchange. [CLARIN] Will you continue to work on the issue at Government House and in Congress? Six months ago you met with the president. [Challu] They heard our arguments carefully. But now things have changed, because we signed the GATT agreement. This is why we are today telling the United States and foreign laboratories, which are always telling us to continue on the legal path, that today the legal path is to respect GATT. [CLARIN] Is it necessary to introduce changes into the draft bill now in Congress in order to accommodate the GATT principles? [Challu] We must introduce a series of changes in the bill to include the transition period and the flexibility to grant licenses. [CLARIN] What will happen if Congress approves a law that meets all U.S. requirements? [Challu] Consumers will foot the bill. Medicine prices will increase between 250 and 300 percent, not in the long term but immediately, as happened in Italy when a patents law was approved. Besides, the bill will affect the balance of payments, because we will have to pay some $500 million annually to the United States over patents, instead of the $30 million we currently pay. Besides, at this time we have a balance of trade deficit of $3 billion with the United States.
