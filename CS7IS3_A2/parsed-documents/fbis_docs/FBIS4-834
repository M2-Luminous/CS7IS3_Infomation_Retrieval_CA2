A police spokesman, Colonel Dave Bruce, said that an injured black man had stopped a police patrol in Hillbrow last night and had taken them to the ANC's regional offices at Lancet Hall from where he said he had escaped earlier. There the police had been confronted by a man armed with a handgun. The man was wounded and arrested. Inside the building, four males, the youngest of whom was 14 years old, were found in a barred holding cell. All of them showed signs of severe assault. Col. Bruce said ANC officials had claimed that the five had been detained at the ANC offices for suspected car theft, and that they were to have been handed over to the police. The police are investigating charges of abduction and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
