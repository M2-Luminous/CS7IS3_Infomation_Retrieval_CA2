The living and dead participants in the unsuccessful launch were pronounced guilty. Today, almost 15 years later, we can look at the situation differently... On 18 March 1980, on launch pad No. 4 of the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, during the preparations for the launch of a Meteor launch vehicle, an explosion took place. Fifty-one people died, and several dozen were injured. The launch vehicle and the spacecraft and some of the ground equipment were destroyed. The launch structure and the launch pad required major repairs. Immediately after the accident was reported, a State Commission was set up, headed by the deputy chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, L. V. Smirnov. In the span of two months, the commission came up with several versions of the possible causes of what took place and set up several experiments to check them. But the objectiveness of the commission's conclusion couldn't help but be influenced by the large measure of potential responsibility that the various officials would have for such a grave occurrence or by the departmental interests and service ties of the experts. The results of the commission's work were laid out in several dozen volumes. The lead volume contained the commission's report, in which the cause of the accident was pronounced to be the improper, unsanctioned actions of the servicing crew (specifically, of Pfc Velikoredchanin) in stopping a leak of liquid oxygen with an irregular method. Pronounced indirectly at fault for the occurrence were the leaders of the servicing crew, who were responsible for the correctness of the designs adopted, the adherence to the necessary discipline in conducting the operations, and the technical training of the personnel. The investigations came to an end, the orders were issued, those remaining had to go on living and working. But besides the sense of unfairness that attached to the punishments, there was alarm at the fact that the true causes of the accident had not been fully unearthed and that they would happen again, no matter how carefully a program of measures to avert them was drawn up. On 23 July 1981, an emergency situation occurred again, during the preparations for launch of a Soyuz launcher on pad No. 1 of the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Upon the completion of the fueling with hydrogen peroxide, the crew reported serious heatup of the filter housing in the ground pipeline, which indicated that the component was breaking down inside. It managed to stop further progress of the process, which could become explosive at any moment, by immediately draining the peroxide from the pipeline. When the filter was examined, it was found that solder had melted, which could have happened only at temperatures of several hundred degrees. In light of the fact that concentrated hydrogen peroxide tends to explode at temperatures above 90 degrees, one gets an idea of all the danger that arose with the situation, danger that not only the experience of the leaders and the level of training of the crew helped to counter, but also a good amount of luck. Studies of the filter showed that the soldering by the manufacturing plant had been done not with pure tin, which is neutral to hydrogen peroxide, but with a tin-lead solder, which became a catalyst for the breakdown. After that, it was established that the use of that very solder had been ordered in the design documentation. As it turned out, when the documentation was corrected, not long before the accident in 1980, the type of solder was "simply" mixed up in the KB General Machine Building (the head developer of the launch system). This became clear to specialists: the unusual catalyst had been found, the chain of evidence of the correctness of the "lower" version was completed, and the groundlessness of the "upper" version became even more apparent. The intentions of the critics of the official conclusion were very firm. But to prove with documentation that the rocket in the accident had been assembled with a filter that was substandard is impossible today. The most pointed accusations were made in the clay of collective irresponsibility. All that, based on the presumption of innocence, did not make it possible to regard the cause of the accident as proven in a judicially strict manner, no matter how obvious it was to specialists. One way or other, further investigation ceased. The decision adopted by the command was diplomatic: the penalties imposed were lifted, but not taken off the record, and those punished were not acquitted of all charges, but were pronounced to be "now free of the earlier noted shortcomings." So what can we give today as the final assessment of the causes and effects of the tragedy of 18 March 1980? What we now know is fully sufficient for the absolute and final acquittal of the living and the dead who 14 years ago were accused in haste and unfairly. Their fate is largely typical, however paradoxical and hard that may sound. During the postwar years at the testing grounds and cosmodromes of Kapustin Yar, Baykonur, and Plesetsk, interdepartmental commissions investigated several hundred unforeseen occurrences without loss of life, and in only a handful conclusions was the cause pronounced to be error on the part of the servicing crews. In those instances accompanied by loss of life, however, it was the servicing crew -- those who died, as a rule -- that was, with few exceptions, pronounced guilty. The temptation to use the dead, who couldn't respond, as the chief offenders was too great. The effect of such an approach was reflected in the results of the investigations of many other accidents, and the "convenient" decisions not only soiled the memory of the dead, but also maimed the living. Restoring the truth is necessary, and perhaps it should be done quickly, while those who took part in the events are still alive and before all the materials classified "Keep Indefinitely" have been destroyed.
