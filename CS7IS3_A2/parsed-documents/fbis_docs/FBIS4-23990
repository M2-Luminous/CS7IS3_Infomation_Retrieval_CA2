The head of state, General Sani Abacha, is presiding over the meeting. State House correspondent Oji Ogbonaya Oji was at the opening session: [Begin recording] [Oji] In his remarks, Gen. Abacha said that the meeting was a followup to the recently concluded nationwide tour by the chief of general staff to brief community and opinion leaders on a wide range of issues of national importance. The arrangement, the head of state explained, was borne out of his administration's regard for consultation and dialogue as an instrument for the crisis resolution: [Abacha] We invite you as our fathers to join the patriotic effort, to resist the tempting design of those who seek to bring us back to those uncertain times. No amount of incitement should provoke Nigerians to pitch us up against each other again. If the experience of our 30-month old war is not enough to deter us, the devastation of society in Liberia, Somalia, Rwanda, and Yugoslavia should restrain our action in the pursuance of whatever causes. [Oji] Gen. Abacha described the constitutional conference as central to the administration's program of disengagement from politics. He said that the administration has encountered and (?promoted) all sorts of criticism but welcomed the ideas of all those who have criticized objectively. The head of state, however, warned that some self-seeking individuals had embarked on dangerous and desperate adventures without any regard to the consequences of their action: [Abacha] The Constitution calls for [words indistinct] to help serve the cause of democracy with a clear [words indistinct]. A true democrat is someone who abides by the rules of civilized behavior, the rules which call for dialogue and consensus. Our desire to follow this cautious resolve should not be mistaken for weakness. The evidence is there for everyone to see that the current spate of senseless bravado [word indistinct] unbridled attack and smear campaign in the entire history of the nation. Democracy is built on the rule of law and [word indistinct] sociopolitical order. It should be made abundantly clear that the use of organized violence and aimless confrontation as choice for achieving democracy as become outmoded. Diplomacy and dialogue have taken their place. [Oji] Gen. Abacha stated that the use of organized violence and confrontation to achieve democracy was counterproductive. He said his administration cannot be blackmailed out of office and urged all Nigerians to give the transition program a chance to succeed. The meeting is being attended by prominent traditional rulers from various parts of the country including the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki; the Alafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidu Adeyemi; the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Opala Okagbue; the Shehu of Bornu, Alhaji Mustapha El-Kanemi; the Olu of Oyo, Abase Jalo II; and Eze Akanu Ibiam from Abia State.
