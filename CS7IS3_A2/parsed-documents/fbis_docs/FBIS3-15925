Russian Federation President's Expert on Economic Reform Prospects"] [Text] The ordinary person in the street did not need experts to tell him that Russia is more intent on spending on itself at the moment than on investing. But when Aleksandr Lifshits, head of the Russian Federation president's group of experts, says that he fears to look into a future where the actual use of depreciation deductions, which are essential to compensate for wear and tear, will be 10 percent as against 90 percent for consumption, you begin to look at the situation in a rather different way. In simple terms, what we are saying is that we can say goodbye to industrial development, to high-technology production, and to reproduction in general unless, in the very near future (according to Lifshits), the government proposes measures to beat the crisis. The Russian Federation president's expert believes that one effective method in this case might be a slight relaxation of the procedure of regulation on the part of the state. What he said was literally as follows: "We are exchanging the absence of money for the presence of economic freedom." That is, the enterprising must be given the opportunity to fight for their own survival to maximum effect. At least, we must not get in their way. In the meantime, while producing little, we are wearing out clothes that we did not make, we are finishing off a machine tool pool that dates back to the five-year plans, and we are in no hurry to work for the future, concentrating, as we are, entirely on the present. Will we be able to curb the rate of price increases in these circumstances? Aleksandr Lifshits pointed out that the government's August program guidelines for the rate of price increases by December 1994 were set at 3-5. But, according to the expert's estimates, these indicators may leap to 10-12. As a result many of the processes that are destroying our economy would become simply irreversible. According to Lifshits, unless the government goes for fundamental measures the State Duma is bound to decide to do so. He was not optimistic about the fate of the state budget -- the figures laid down in it may not hold out for more than three or four months. And then further adjustment will be needed.
