In a statement, Luis Jalandoni, NDF vice chairman for international affairs, said the obstructions include the issuance of Executive Order No. (EO) 125 which sets the Philippine Constitution as the framework for the peace talks, the alleged coddling by the government of persons who broke away from the leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines, the continued detention of political prisoners, and lately, the government's inaction on the plight of 10,000 victims of human rights violations seeking monetary claims on the Marcos estate. Jalandoni also criticized President Ramos' "lack of sincerity in seeking serious peace talks" when the latter declared the impending collapse of the New People's Army during the graduation rites of the Philippine Military Academy. "His predecessors, Mr. Marcos and Mrs. Aquino, had made similar pronouncements. Now Mr. Ramos indulges in the same wishful thinking. The revolutionary movement is strong and fighting for the just cause of the people throughout the country," the NDF official said. The organization blamed the government for the delay in the talks, saying, "It is the unilateral decisions of the Ramos regime in contravention of the Joint Declaration signed in The Hague on 1 September 1992 that have caused the delay in the talks between the NDF and the GRP Government of the Republic of the Philippines." The joint declaration said the two sides would not set any condition for the talks. The NDF considers the issuance of EO 125 as a condition set by the Philippine Government. "The NDF stands by its commitment to seek a just, enduring, and liberating peace. But it will never agree to the GRP Constitution as the framework of the talks and it remains firm in calling for the removal of the obstructions placed by the Ramos regime," Jalandoni said.
