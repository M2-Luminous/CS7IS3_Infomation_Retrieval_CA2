The debate, sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA) and the Media Committee for Presidential Debates, is moderated by Fernando Berguido and features the following presidential candidates: Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD); Eduardo Vallarino Arjona of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC); Ruben Dario Carles of the Change '94 Alliance; Samuel Lewis Galindo of the Solidarity Party (PS); Jose Salvador Munoz Correa of the Panamenist Doctrinaire Party (PPD); and Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement (MPE). Following a brief statement by ILDEA President Rodrigo Eisenmann, moderator Berguido explains the rules of the debate and reads a short biography on each of the six candidates present. The debate gets under way with PRD Candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares discussing his public expenditures program: "Clearly, any attempt to try to refer to the 1970's and objectively compare the decade to the 1990's would be dubious. During the 1970's, we had an international financial liquidity situation because of an oversupply of crude oil revenues. In turn, this situation prompted the financial institutions as well as banks to implement easy credit policies. This gave us the opportunity to carry out public investments and, at the same time, to create more employment. In addition, not only did public investments increase, but the state's payroll also increased. "Obviously, the conditions of the 1970's are not the same as those we are experiencing in 1994. Therefore, it would be impossible to repeat that experience, and, even if we wanted to -- which certainly is not the case -- we would not be able to because the sources of financing simply are not as accessible as in the past. ``What we have to do in 1994 is domestically create a competitive climate that will encourage private firms to invest and create the jobs all Panamanians need. In this respect, we have proposed a parallel public investment program that can be financed jointly with the private sector and will result in direct employment. For example, we have already outlined plans for construction projects, such as highway construction -- particularly along the Panama-Colon highway -- as well as other specific public investments projects. These activities are urgently needed to ensure national development and also to create new jobs.'' The debate continues with PDC candidate Eduardo Vallarino contending that the country's infrastructure is in such a poor state because of the restrictive spending programs of the past 25 years, and particularly of the past five years when the Endara administration decided to curtail capital improvement expenditures. Vallarino says that although he agrees there are budget constraints because of external debt pressures, he also believes there are other options available to overcome this situation. With respect to road work, other Latin American countries' experiences have demonstrated that highways can be built through privatization efforts, which include transferring highway management rights to the private sector. In commenting on the current state of the Social Security Fund (CSS), Change '94 candidate Ruben Dario Carles says he believes that the CSS must be restructured if the institution is going to survive. PPD candidate Jose Salvador Munoz blames the nation's unemployment problems on the ever-increasing external debt pressure, which he says curtails investments; a United States-led invasion that practically destroyed the country; and policy issues that were never addressed by the previous administration. He disagrees with the proposal that the country's employment needs should be left entirely to the private sector because the state is the only sector that can create employment in the near term. Meanwhile, PS candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo believes the current administration has been quite insensitive to fulfilling the lower income groups' most basic needs and that the government has been more interested in repaying the foreign debt than with improving the living conditions of the lower income groups. Nevertheless, he agrees that the nation should not forfeit on its foreign debt obligations. In commenting on Panama's role in a world in which globalization is the dominant trend, MPE candidate Ruben Blades says: "First of all, I believe it is necessary for us to pinpoint concrete objectives and strategies. As long as we fail to do this, I believe that any decision related to our joining agreements such as GATT or NAFTA cannot be taken seriously. We must first determine what Panama's role is going to be once the country has joined these treaties. Specifically, I believe that joining GATT is going to have a negative impact on the country if we do not first consult all sectors involved and if we do not determine what the advantages to the country are going to be. As a nation, we stand to lose certain comparative advantages once services are standardized. "In this respect we should look at the banking sector. We still do not know exactly what we are getting into. It is not only a matter of turning Panama into a market for other products, but we must protect our products." Blades continues by saying Panama must know "what we are getting into" before agreeing to join GATT or NAFTA. He adds: "We are recommending that Panama first determine which sectors can be developed as export industries before joining any treaty that would lead to the globalization of the economy." With respect to CSS services, PRD candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares believes CSS members should be given the option to decide which social security program they wish to join. The debate continues with PDC candidate Eduardo Vallarino expressing his dissatisfaction with the "inefficiency" in which public funds are being spent, because most are being funneled into simply maintaining the bureaucracy. In response to the question of whether Panama should become a member of NAFTA, candidate Ruben Carles says: "We must first consider our position with regard to GATT before we decide whether or not to join NAFTA. Nevertheless, we still have to settle certain issues with GATT. How can GATT attempt to liberalize trade while imposing trade restrictions on the bananas produced in Panama and the rest of Central America? Our question is this: How can you gentlemen of GATT talk of liberalizing trade while imposing restrictions on poor banana-producing countries?" Carles goes on to question GATT's desire to sell its industrial products in Panama while placing import limits on the region's agricultural products, and he adds that his government would protect Panamanian workers, especially those who produce foodstuffs such as meat, corn, rice, beans, onions, tomatoes, and milk. Candidate Jose Salvador Munoz is asked to explain his views on development and the roles the state and private sector should play in this development. Munoz says Panama's economy must undergo a shake-up. He says: "The Panamanian state must, out of necessity, make an initial investment in infrastructure -- namely schools, highways, and hospitals -- to generate the confidence, jobs, and money that are needed to make the economy function once again. Once this is done, the private sector can address the rest of the problems." When asked to outline his tax, spending, and investment policies, candidate Lewis Galindo says the government is short of funds and that the tax collection system must be improved. Nevertheless, he says he does not favor an increase in taxes or the creation of new taxes. Instead, he would perfect the tax collection system. Galindo says: "The private sector and the state must seek mechanisms with which to create a climate favorable to investments, which will create better health services, jobs, housing, and education for the Panamanian people." Candidate Ruben Blades is asked to comment on Panama's high unemployment rate despite its economic growth and to outline the specific steps he would take to provide permanent employment. He says: "Panama has had an unemployment problem for many decades, many years. It is the result of not having conducted provincial-level studies to establish the natural and human resources available in each province. Once these provincial inventories -- which I advocate -- are conducted, we will truly understand our country's potential and we will know which areas to develop." Blades goes on to explain that unemployment comes in various stages -- short-term, midterm, and long-term. He agrees with Munoz that the government must invest in the nation's infrastructure, and he adds that a job market should be created for women. Candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares follows by discussing the solutions he would offer Panama Canal employees laid off when the U.S. bases in Panama close. Perez says the military bases are not an economic issue but a military one. He says that the bases were once needed in Panama and elsewhere, but they are now being closed because they are no longer necessary. "Numerous former military installations that were going to be closed will be reverted to Panama, the Torrijos-Carter treaties notwithstanding. Of course the treaties mandate their closure because they are no longer needed by the United States, which established them here in the first place. I believe the Panamanian people as a group must now face the challenge of turning those sites into sources of national wealth through investments and industry to generate skilled manpower for well-paid permanent jobs and especially to produce industrial and manufactured goods that can be exported." Candidate Eduardo Vallarino is then asked what he would do to retain approximately 20 percent of the Panama Canal Commission's employees, most of whom hold key positions and who will retire on 31 December 1999 under the U.S. federal retirement system. Vallarino says the answer is simple because the people in question are Panamanians who will retire early, but who will have the knowledge and experience their country needs. "I see no reason why the Panamanian Government, through the Panama Canal Authority, cannot extend their contracts." Returning to Carles, moderator Berguido asks what solutions his government would set forth to prevent the continued deforestation of the Panama Canal Zone. Carles responds: "The Panamanian people must understand that environmental protection is a priority. I have already announced in various parts of the country that my government platform includes a reforestation program that will be duly financed." Carles gives assurances that the reforestation sector will not be left without resources to conduct its work. He says: "Reforestation is necessary to conserve our waterways, all human life, farming, cattlebreeding, and canal operations. Without water there can be no Canal." Jose Munoz is asked what steps his government would adopt to take greater advantage of the Canal. Munoz replies by saying that current Canal policy must undergo a shake-up, just as the economy must be shaken up. "Gentlemen," he says, "the Panama Canal is ours, but unfortunately we have not trained any employees for administrative positions. I believe that nearly 7,000 Panamanians are employed by the Canal Commission, but the administrative positions are only filled by North Americans and third-country nationals. This must change." Candidate Lewis Galindo is asked to express his views concerning the Canal's efficiency, cost effectiveness, and transit rates in light of the competition that exists worldwide in the field of transportation. Lewis Galindo says that almost 90 percent of the Canal workforce is Panamanian, adding that when Panamanians take over all of the administrative positions, efficiency will increase because they will be working for their country. "The Canal will make the transition from being the political institution that it is for the United States to an entirely commercial undertaking for Panama," Lewis said. Candidate Ruben Blades is quick to point out that the reversion of the Panama Canal is a very serious problem. He says the Endara government, as well as previous governments, should have started the transition process "as soon as the ink on the treaties dried." Blades explains that since 1978, Panama has failed to do the things it should have. "On the other hand," he adds, "the United States, through Law 90-76, greatly distorted the initial purpose of the treaties. This law was presented by Messrs. John Murphy and Robert Bowman, two Republican congressmen, because the signing of a treaty does not authorize its execution; a law is required. The two gentlemen disagreed with the treaty negotiations and they presented the law, which has completely hindered the transition." My government, Blades adds, "will stand up to the United States. We will deal with Law 90-76, which is hindering the return of our Canal." Candidate Perez Balladares is then asked a question on how to overcome the problems of a sluggish government bureaucracy and red tape. He says that the efficiency of state bureaucracy depends on the person at the helm. "I believe our efficiency can be enhanced by some form of protection; a law that makes government employees feel that their work is acknowledged, that ensures they will be well paid and that they will not be pawns in the country's political ups and downs." Regarding foreign investment, Perez Balladares says that an office will be established within the Presidency to handle government contracts. This office, he says, also will deal with local investors who want to procure government contracts. Candidate Eduardo Vallarino is asked if his government is contemplating the construction of a Panama-Chiriqui highway, and, if so, how it would be financed. Vallarino says a transisthmian highway in western Chiriqui would be much better because Panama is an interoceanic country. His government, he explained, would take advantage of this geographic fact. Vallarino also endorses a Colon-Penonome highway, which would give all of the central provinces direct access to European and U.S. markets. As for the financing of these highways, he says this can be resolved by granting concessions to private companies to manage the highways. Vallarino blames Panama's unemployment on "a lack of investments prompted by poor economic policies, not only by the previous PRD government but by the current government, which has not invested sufficiently." Candidate Ruben Carles is asked to respond to the authorities' neglect of Panama's historical sites and to explain his plans to deal with this situation. Carles answers by discussing the efforts of former Mayor Mayin Correa, who he hopes will return to City Hall, and Panama's potential for tourism. Carles says: "I have already spoken with some of the leading tourism firms, perhaps the top cruise lines, so that as soon as I am in a position to negotiate with them they can make specific proposals for intensive tourism development in Panama, on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts." Carles goes on to explain that many shipping companies are willing to operate in Panama if the government can guarantee security, efficiency, and public services. When asked how a PPD government would educate people to help them deal with a global economy, candidate Jose Salvador Munoz says his party will revolutionize education in Panama, which has been "neglected for an entire generation." The moderator then asks Samuel Lewis Galindo about his plans to have the private sector invest in low-cost housing. The candidate answers by saying the 1972 laws which placed ceilings on rent must be revised and that existing housing must be improved, particularly in very poor neighborhoods. To improve the effectiveness of the Public Force and the Technical Judicial Police, Ruben Blades says his party will give priority to public security because improved security is an essential requirement for investment. To do this, however, the root of the problem -- "that is to say, the lack of opportunity, overcrowding, and a criminal subculture" -- must be attacked. The situation will not be resolved by building larger prisons, he says. The police must be given adequate equipment, training, and leadership, and their salaries must be raised. In discussing the legislature, candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares says: "We will explore the possibility of eliminating the position of substitute legislators, as has been done in other countries, because the position inflates the number of Assembly members and creates too much political pressure." He also says democracy entails many expenses, such as the salaries of lawmakers. He pledges to introduce legislation to eliminate substitute legislator positions and the privilege whereby legislators are permitted to import luxury cars tax free. Discussing the demarcation of Indian regions, candidate Eduardo Vallarino says he has visited the Indians in the interior and that he agrees completely with the demarcation of these areas because Indians deserve the government's support. Candidate Ruben Dario Carles says he will eliminate the inefficiency prevailing in the Department of Metropolitan Sanitation by assigning greater responsibility to municipalities in garbage disposal. He adds that privatization of this service could provide a better solution on a long-term basis. Asked about his government's plans to resolve the problem of sewage being dumped into the sea and rivers, Munoz says "a drastic solution" is required, adding that the problem is not limited to sewage in Panama City but includes other population centers as well. Regarding environmental pollution and the next generation's right to clean air, candidate Lewis Galindo says his administration would emphasize environmental education. He also says the number of cars must be controlled and other measures must be taken. The moderator then asks Ruben Blades about the problem of deforestation. Blades answers that it is necessary to teach the people who cut down trees that they are doing great harm to the nation. He adds that the problem is closely associated with the slash-and-burn method used by peasants in Panama. In the closing round of the debate, the candidates are given an opportunity to comment on the other candidates' remarks or give a final message. Perez Balladares speaks first, summarizing the positions he outlined earlier in the debate. He ends by saying he has no doubts that Panama will turn concern for the future into new opportunities for the Panamanian people. Vallarino gives his final message next, saying he has observed that the Panamanian people are tired of traditional politicians and the same old promises. He says he is no traditional politician and that he will work hard to enable more Panamanians to have jobs. He finally invites people to vote for the best candidate in the 8 May elections. In his final statement, Carles begins by saying this debate is not a debate in the true sense of the word. He adds that his party has outlined specific proposals designed to restore credibility to the state's management of finances. He concludes by saying: "I will continue to act honestly, responsibly, and firmly, as I have done all my life, apart from government and interventionist schemes that have failed, that have plunged the country into indebtedness, that have increased joblessness and corruption, and that have led the country into chaos. I will stimulate private initiative to create jobs. The Pamananian people's standard of living will be improved through more jobs and better public services. This country, particularly the young people, are entitled to a brighter future. This can be done with willingness, capability, experience, energy, and the determination to do things right. This is what my government will offer." Jose Salvador Munoz gives his closing message next: "Tonight I have spoken about a shake-up; this is not a drastic or an arbitrary measure. What we are trying to do is eliminate unemployment, corruption, lack of security, and other monsters that are always plotting against the Panamanian nation. I ask for your vote so that you can help me kill these monsters and create a shake-up to achieve a better country." Candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo ends by saying: "I do not see myself as a politician and I have not been a professional politician. I have worked in private enterprise for 45 years, developing and creating business enterprises, as well as creating jobs for thousands of Panamanians. I want to offer this experience to the Panamanian state because a change is necessary." The last to speak is Ruben Blades, who explains he comes from a family that never lost hope in the future and that he has worked very hard to make a living. Blades adds, "Hopefully, we are trying to create a common ground by way of the Papa Egoro Movement. There are some who tell me that we do not have much experience in politics. I tell them we do have experience, but only as victims of the process." Blades then says: "We are truly offering the opportunity to justify our right, as a nation, to place our hope in the field of politics." He concludes by saying, "I am a politician out of self-defense. I hope that on 8 May you will not forget us."
