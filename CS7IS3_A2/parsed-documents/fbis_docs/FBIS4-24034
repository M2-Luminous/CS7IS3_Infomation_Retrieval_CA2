[passage omitted] In addition to the RPF, numerous countries, notably those in the Great Lakes region, have also made public their opposition to French military intervention in Rwanda. We have spoken, for example, of the reaction of Tanzanian Prime Minister John Malecela, who condemned the French intervention in Rwanda, because the OAU and United Nations are dealing genuinely with the Rwandan issue. [passage omitted] The situation is similar in Zaire. The opposition there condemned French military intervention in Rwanda, and asked the Zairean Government not to back the French, notably by giving them a military base. Another neighboring country is Uganda: President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who is on a visit to the United States, has stated that French military intervention in Rwanda will be a disaster, as it is opposed by the RPF. It is worth recalling at this juncture that the RPF has made this clear, by warning the international community and those countries who ally themselves with France. This French intervention risks going beyond Rwanda's borders, and might even set the whole region ablaze. [passage omitted]
