FR941122-2-00125 FR941122-2-00092 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 94&hyph;103; Notice 1] American Transportation Corporation; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance American Transportation Corporation (AmTran) of Conway, Arkansas, has determined that some of its vehicles fail to comply with 49 CFR 571.120, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 120, ``Tire Selection and Rims for Vehicles Other Than Passenger Cars,'' and has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' AmTran has also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits of the application. Paragraph S5.3 of FMVSS No. 120 states that each vehicle must have a label affixed which includes the size designation of the tires and the size designation of the rims. AmTran produced approximately 38,000 buses and school buses from 1987 through 1994 which do not meet the labeling requirements stated in the standard. The vehicles lack the rim diameter designation on the label. The label does include the rim width and complete tire size. AmTran supports its application with the following: American Transportation (AmTran) requests that an exemption be granted based on the grounds that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it related to motor vehicle safety. The rim width is listed on the certification label; however, the rim diameter is not listed. The complete tire size, including the diameter (which is identical to the rim diameter), is listed on each label. Therefore, [AmTran] believes that sufficient information is available for the user to match tire and rim sizes appropriately. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of AmTran, described above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted. All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date, will also be filed and will be considered to the extent possible. When the application is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the Federal Register pursuant to the authority indicated below. Comment closing date: December 22, 1994. Authority: 49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and NHTSA Order 800&hyph;2. Issued on: November 16, 1994. Barry Felrice, Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
