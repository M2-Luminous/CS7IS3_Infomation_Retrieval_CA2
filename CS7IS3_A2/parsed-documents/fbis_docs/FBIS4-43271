After his meeting with Gustave Feissel today, President Denktas commented on the statement by Abou in connection with the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Denktas said that it is unacceptable that Abou, an observer, should be a party to the issue or that he should try to mislead the EU. Denktas said that the latest statement by Abou shows how justified the Turkish Cypriots were in refusing to meet with him. Denktas said: Influenced by the Greek Cypriots, Abou is becoming a party to the issue and trying to influence the EU in favor of the Greek Cypriots. This is a regrettable development. In fact, it was a mistake to appoint this person. Denktas concluded by saying that Abou was appointed probably as a reinforcement to the Greek-Cypriot side.
