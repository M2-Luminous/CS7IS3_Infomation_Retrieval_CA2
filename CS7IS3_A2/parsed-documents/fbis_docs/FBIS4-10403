[Begin Zedillo recording] We also have to work for the productive recovery of the countryside; this is very urgent. For many years, Mexico's farmlands have been either at a standstill or have been growing at a very gradual rate. [end recording] The PRI candidate promised to break the vicious circle that has kept 18 million of the nation's 23 million peasants in poverty. To do this, he promised a very vigorous social policy. [Begin Zedillo recording] My pledge is to eliminate all of those obstacles that have limited agriculture's productive potential. We must specifically attack the severe bureaucratic problem that still afflicts Mexican farming. If there is a single victim of centralism in Mexico, it is the Mexican peasant. [end recording] Peasant leaders who spoke with the PRI candidate were Alfonso Garzon Santibanez from the Independent Peasants Central Organization, Aquiles Cordoba from the Peasant Torch [Antorcha Campesina], Humberto Serrano from the Mexican Agrarian Council, Hugo Andres Arauco of the National Peasant Confederation, Jose Luis Gonzalez of the General Union of Workers and Peasants of the Mexican State, and Guadalupe Martinez Cruz of the National Council of Tenant Farmer and Peasant Associations [Consejo Nacional de Sociedades y Uniones Campesinas de Colonos]. All of them voiced support for the PRI presidential candidate.
