SAP Public Relations head Maj-Gen Leon Mellet said in a statement on Tuesday it was of the utmost importance that as many competent former SAP members as possible be reinstated. "Every available member will be required for duty over the next few months," he said. Gen Mellet urged interested former SAP members to approach their nearest manpower acquisition office for further information. He said the appeal was not aimed at members who had retired at pensionable age, those who had taken early retirement or had retired for medical reasons.
