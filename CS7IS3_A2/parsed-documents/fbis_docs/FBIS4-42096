We Want Solidarity'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] [Text] Florence. The elections for the European Parliament [EP] seem to coincide with a difficult phase in relations between Italy and the European Union [EU]. A phase marked by the concerns that the new majority and the new government have brought about not only in the EU but also in the single member states. We discussed this with vice president of the Parliament in Brussels, Roberto Barzanti, a candidate representing the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in the European elections. [Cassigoli] Do you not feel that Italy is drifting away from Europe? [Barzanti] This is quite a widespread conviction. We have a government that appears to relaunch the idea of developing a hyper-free trade and whose relations with Europe are thought of as a contract, in market terms only. Instead I think we should confirm our desire to build a democratic, united, and solid Europe. In this sense the 1996 deadline that provides for the revision of the Maastricht Treaty is important. The Parliament that will be elected will, in fact, have the great constitutional task of creating a real policy of unity in which the interests and needs of Italy must have a positive outlet. [Cassigoli] Competition only at an economic level is not sufficient then? [Barzanti] Today a country like Italy can obtain results only if Europe is founded on the basis of solidarity, which implies distributing resources on the basis of territorial imbalances. A Europe that is not founded on wars of interest or on opposing areas, but that can rediscover a vocation that is authentically federal and united in full respect of autonomies and differences. [Cassigoli] Do you not feel that public opinion is demonstrating indifference toward elections that seem to count more because of their internal power relations? [Barzanti] This is true. Also because of an incorrect interpretation of the law on proportional representation that should be reflected with a Parliament in which all the tendencies of a composite European political panorama are represented. If these elections and this law are used as a simple tool for revenge or for numbers as an appendix to the national political elections, this depreciates European competition. I am thinking of Berlusconi, for example, who is a candidate in five constituencies when, as prime minister, he will not be able to sit at the European Parliament because this will not be compatible. Evidently a person who is used to having three television networks and some interests in three pay-TV networks in addition to supervising three public nationwide networks, felt the need to present himself in five constituencies. [Cassigoli] What relationship could Italian federalism have, as it is viewed in a national context, with the idea of European federalism? [Barzanti] Let us reaffirm the objective of constructing a federal Europe, even if the inclusion of Norway, Sweden, Austria, and Finland will probably occur without serious guarantees of institutional reform, democratization, and transparency. There is a risk, therefore, of laying claim to a federal Europe that is looking for an increasingly larger economic space, but without an efficient government. We cannot accept this drift. For Europe, federalism is a means of balancing the autonomy of the single member states and joint policies. From the Italian point of view federalism has been carried out in an unfruitful manner. Italy can stay in Europe if it remains a nation, even though its various autonomous regions must have their own relations with the European Community. [Cassigoli] [European Commission President] Delors' white paper talks of employment. What relationship is there between the Italian problem and the promise made by Berlusconi to create 1 million new jobs? [Barzanti] With the proposal launched in Delors' so-called White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment Europe and Italy can achieve important goals. This will certainly not occur if entrusted to simplistically thaumaturgic concepts or to old free trade visions, but requires a policy that I would define as being of the Keynes type. The white paper therefore does not seem to be in harmony with the affirmations made by Foreign Minister Martino or the economic ministers in this government. Of course, the 15 million new jobs forecast in Europe between now and the year 2000 can be obtained by playing around with deductions and with an increased market flexibility, but also by focusing a great deal on training, professional profiles, innovation, new strategic sectors, the information society, which are still to come in Italy. [Cassigoli] Can you give an example? [Barzanti] Of course. The white paper forecasts 4 million new jobs in the audiovisual field. If we consider the fact that a cable system does not even exist here, and that the technological level of our system is among the most backward in Europe, we can see how far away we are from this prospect. [Cassigoli] What will the trends be in scientific research, an essential field for relations with Europe? [Barzanti] They are worrying. The EU, and Commissioner Ruberti himself, have greatly expanded research resources. In the Fourth European Framework Program, scientific research will be allocated an overall budget for 1994-98 amounting to ECU12 billion (the figure was only ECU2 billion under the third program) equivalent to 22 trillion lire. However, the situation is serious because little is being spent on scientific research (2 percent of GNP) and because the countries spend too much singularly. The objective is to reach 3 percent of GNP and to spend at least 5 percent of this on joint research. [Cassigoli] Europe is also shocked because a businessman with enormous interests in the information sector has become a prime minister without any rules. [Barzanti] It is one of the elements that is creating the most anxiety. It is unthinkable for Hersant or Bertelsmann, the head of the largest European communications group, or others to be ministers or prime ministers in France or Germany. It is a South American-type anomaly or perhaps even worse. To have more weight in Europe, the person representing the country must be capable of speaking without any suspicion that he is defending his personal interests.
