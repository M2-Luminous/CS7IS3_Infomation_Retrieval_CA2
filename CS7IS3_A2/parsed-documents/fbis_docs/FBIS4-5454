FBIS4-5454 "dreas070_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Thailand Government To Increase Purchases of Iranian Oil Government To Increase Purchases of Iranian Oil BK1204045494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 12 Apr 94 p 15 BK1204045494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] The Thai Government has promise to honour an agreement to buy Iranian crude oil, despite problems, and will bow to a demand for an increase in the supply volume. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak pledged this yesterday while insisting that attempts will be made to persuade Teheran to reduce the crude price said to be 50-60 US cents more than the world market price for the same crude. His statement is aimed at quelling doubts that Thailand would breach terms of the Thai-Iran countertrade deal involving Thai rice and Iranian crude. Dr Suphachai said it would be unfair for Thailand to dishonour the oil deal as Iran has already fulfilled its commitment by buying Thai rice. He stressed the importance of Iran as a major export market, especially at the time of market difficulties. Teheran has already bought 412,343 tons of Thai rice as part of the agreement in return for the sale of Iranian crude to Thailand at the volume of 20,000 barrels a day (b/d). Suggestions were made by some Cabinet members that Thailand should yield to Teheran's demand to increase the purchase volume of Iranian oil from the National Iranian Oil Corp (NIOC) to 15,000 b/d against 5,000 b/d the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) was prepared to recelve. Aside from high price, PTT, the national oil firm, has been reluctant to buy the Iranian crude which possesses undesirable high sulphur and metallic content as well as a low yield of oil products. That results in higher refining costs and many refiners are not keen to accept the oil for refining. Oil refiners are also critical of Iran's ability to commit the delivery at an agreed tlme. The PTT has said that two local oil refineries--operated by Thaioil and Bangchak Petroleum--have the capabilities to process the problematic crude with an extra cost of 78 million baht, based on the 15,000 b/d volume. Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon wi]l fly to Iran on April 18 to attempt to get a lower price for the Iranian crude at the level to at least cover the extra refining cost. Mr Uthai has suggested that the sum be drawn from national coffers to compensate the PTT. The minister supports his claims of the need to maintain Iran as a market for Thai rice. The volume of rice Teheran bought from Thailand represents 10-202000060100f total Thai rice exports.
