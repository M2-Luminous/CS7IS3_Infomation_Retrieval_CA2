[Yi Pyong-tae] Yes, I did. Please interpret my actions as an expression of my "passion." I just did it to describe my intentions with precision and sincerity. There was no other purpose. [passage omitted] [Reporter] What merits do you think you have that won you the appointment as defense minister? [Yi] I do not know exactly. What I can tell you is that even after I was discharged from active duty, I continued to study national defense issues with the will and passion for reform, regarding it as my professional field. After I was placed on the reserve list, I realized that the military was not the whole world. While working as consul general in Honolulu and as director of the Office of Veterans Administration, I learned many things about world affairs. I think this was part of the merits for my appointment. [Reporter] By how many years was President Kim Yong-sam your senior at Kyongnam High School, and when did you meet President Kim Yong-sam? [Yi] President Kim was a graduate of the third class and I was a graduate of the 11th. So, I am eight years behind him. I first met him when I was chief of operation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1992. When President Kim, then chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party, was inspecting frontline areas, I accompanied him because the deputy chief of the Joint Staff was on leave. Since President Kim rode the bus together with National Defense Committee assemblymen, I thought it was a good opportunity to explain the defense budget. So I did it with a portable speaker. [Reporter] People say that after President Kim was elected, you acted as his "staff" person for military affairs. [Yi] No. I was not in the appropriate position to do so. I was in the middle of the Pacific Ocean as consul general in Hawaii while he was in Sangdodong, Seoul. [Reporter] What do you think about the position of defense minister? [Yi] Just as a proverb says that the one who looks down the chessboard has a wider view of the game than the actual players, I came to face many practical restrictions and to realize difficulties of working-level officials. [Reporter] Now that the investigation of the incident of shells imports fraud came to a temporary settlement and your report to Chongwadae [presidential office] has been completed, we think that you will now undertake your work at a full scale. [Yi] The mission of defense minister is, above all, to protect the nation and people from a "miserable" war. A total of 1 million troops from both sides are still in confrontation with each other with a 155-mile Armistice Line in between them. The fire power has now increased by 100 times from that of the Korean War. If a war breaks out, everything that all the people have achieved with all their energy during the past 40 years will collapse. Therefore, our Army should assume a stance to prevent war by all means. As you know, the people in the North are unpredictable. [Reporter] Some people say that since democratization was initiated, North Korea is not regarded as "the main enemy" in the troop training and information program in the military. Is this true? [Yi] This has indeed delicate aspects. To say that North Korea is the main enemy may be somewhat excessive. However, the military should direct its main efforts on "preventing North Korea's provocation." [Reporter] There are two different views: that North Korea is incapable of starting a war because of its economic difficulties and that it can start a war at any moment. This causes confusion among the people. What is your view? [Yi] I think such controversy might have been prompted by the eccentric political system in the North. North Korea's gross national product is only one-tenth of ours. Therefore, North Korea's military power should also be regarded as such. However, the practical situation is quite the opposite. For example, although I cannot reveal all, I can tell you that the number of sorties made by North Korean air force planes and the number and scale of military mobilizations and maneuvers during the past three years far exceed ours. This situation has not changed even today. We should think that this is possible only under North Korea's eccentric system. [Reporter] Do you think there is the possibility of a North Korean military provocation? [Yi] Yes. There certainly is. I wish I could show you related materials including aerial photographs to prove this. [Reporter] Have there been any indications of a military provocation from North Korea recently? [Yi] There has always been such a possibility in the past. However, since Kim Chong-il was nominated as supreme commander of the military last March, there has been even a greater possibility. Last October, the "order of tonsure" was handed out to the entire Army, and all soldiers had their hair cut. Tonsure means a certain "determination." [Reporter] What is your opinion of the North Korean nuclear issue and the Team Spirit exercise? [Yi] North Korea must completely return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and accept overall inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. We will be ready to suspend the Team Spirit exercise, although it has nothing to do with the North Korean nuclear issue, so that the North-South dialogue can make progress. However, I would like to clearly say that if North Korea does not comply with them, we would have nothing to concede. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Will there be any large-scale personnel reshuffle within the military? [Yi] No. There will be no such reshuffle. Only when stability is attained within their organization, can the soldiers be devoted to defense. Otherwise, they will turn their eyes, leveled at the North, to Seoul. [Reporter] We understand that you are member of Hanahoe [private circle of military academy graduates]. When did you become a member? [Yi] That is an old story. Let us not talk about this. I always did my best in any given situation during the past 33 years of military service. I will do so in the future, too. [passage omitted] [Reporter] There is a rumor that you, Minister Yi, advised all high-ranking officers in the military who are Hanahoe members to voluntarily resign from active duty. [Yi] The will for decision within the military should not be hovered. If one thinks it is difficult to contribute to the military any more, one should courageously resign from it. [Reporter] Some people stress that young and capable officers, who became Hanahoe members without having volunteered to join the organization, should not be placed in a position of disadvantage. [Yi] That is very sensitive issue. I intend to work out appropriate measures. [passage omitted]
