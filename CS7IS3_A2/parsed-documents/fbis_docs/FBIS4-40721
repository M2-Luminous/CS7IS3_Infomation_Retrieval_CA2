He told journalists on Saturday evening that many countries had resorted to similar or even tougher measures. As an example, he referred to the program proposed by Roosevelt, which allowed the U.S. to pull itself out of the Depression and fight crime. He noted, however, that if Yeltsin had submitted a draft law on amending and enlarging Russia's Criminal Code a day before the decree was passed, there would not have been any friction between the president and the State Duma. He said that although a decree implies immediate implementation, the Criminal Code might also be amended very quickly.
