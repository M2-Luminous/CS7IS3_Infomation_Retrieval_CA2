He said that the SNS was aware that the problem that has arisen was not a result of politicking but of the economic collapse of this young republic. SDL Chairman Peter Weiss reacted to Slota's offer to withdraw from the coalition with the following words: We are willing to negotiate with anyone, but today, after the president's speech, the situation is different from what it was yesterday. Asked whether the SDL was united, Weiss responded that four deputies had not signed the proposal to dismiss the prime minister because they insisted that the issue of early elections should be resolved first. He added that the current crisis in the country could not be resolved by passing a vote of no confidence in Vladimir Meciar without agreeing on a date for early elections.
