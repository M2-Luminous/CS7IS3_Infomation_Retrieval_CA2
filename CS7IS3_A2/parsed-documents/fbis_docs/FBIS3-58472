It seemingly reduces the public deficit, but that is not preventing the national debt from growing. The Parliament has just definitively adopted the five-year law aimed at bringing state finances under control. On the face of it, this commitment to austerity is squeezing the government into an unbearably tight corset: Each year it will have to reduce the budget deficit drastically with a view to bringing it down to 2.5 percent of GDP by 1997. However, there is good reason to wonder about the sincerity of the exercise, as the national debt is habitually increased by the addition of expenses that do not appear in the budget. In two years, from the end of 1992 to the end of 1994, the budget deficit will be reduced to 617 billion French francs [Fr]. However, the national debt has increased by Fr809, an extra one-third. The aim of the five-year law is to satisfy the convergence criteria laid down by the Maastricht Treaty. The candidates for the single currency, in 1997 at the earliest, must not record a national debt in excess of 3 percent of GDP. For France, whose budget deficit reached 4.5 percent of GDP in 1993, not counting the social security deficits and those of the local authorities, this is no easy undertaking. It boils down to reducing the national deficit by 0.5 percent of GDP each year for four years, starting in 1994. However, the state has irreducible expenses, starting with those incurred as a result of the national debt, on which heavy interest has to be paid each year. Not to mention the salaries of civil servants, the reduction of whose numbers would appear to be a more urgent priority than ever, but whose pay rises correspond to previously agreed contractual commitments. In short, any effort to cut spending can only be made in other areas: civil and military equipment and actions, the budget for which would have to be reduced by approximately 2 percent per annum in real terms. Would it be feasible to envision reducing employment subsidies to the same extent? However, the government has subjected itself to additional constraints which will increase its future expenditure even further. The budgeting of family allowances will cost Fr40 billion in 1997, and transfers to UNEDIC [National Union for Industrial and Commercial Employment] will reach a level of Fr10 billion per year. That makes a total of Fr50 billion, or 0.8 percent of GDP by 1997. Will the return to growth suffice to absorb this increase? Nicolas Sarkozy [budget minister] seemed slightly optimistic, affirming the other evening to the National Assembly: "The objective of this government is to use any room for maneuver that a more rapid return to sustained growth may entail, and a better mastery of public expenditure, to reduce the fiscal and social contributions." To be sure, the government has more than one trick up its sleeve. Last year, it transferred Fr45 billion to companies, under the pretext of compensating for the one-month VAT [value-added tax] gap, and by the same token recognized a residual debt of between Fr50 and Fr55 billion. That makes roughly Fr100 billion in all financed through borrowing, which did not figure under budgetary expenditure. No more so than the return-to-school allowance (Fr5.9 billion), an expense attributed directly to the national debt, which in turn already assumed the accumulated social security debt, to the extent of Fr110 billion, on 1 January 1994. It will be tempting to review such tricks of sleight of hand in the future, in order to meet the requirements of the five-year law without putting the brakes on real state expenditure. Abolishing, say, state subsidies to the social security system, while making it support the corresponding cash advances -- along the lines of the operation concerning the back-to-school allowance. Unless the finicky observers in the government Audit Office succeed in making themselves heard.
