There will be no beheading of the "mandarins" of the First Republic, nor of the leading men in the ministries and the main state-owned companies. This was the commitment made by the Forza Italia leader who returned to the battleground yesterday afternoon in an interview with [fourth TV channel news broadcast] TG4. Berlusconi stated: "I too have read about vendettas, and cleanups. They appear completely alien to me, and in any case are far from my mind and my way of thinking. I even think no one should have cause for concern." In short, a Berlusconi government would not apply the "spoil system," or across-the-board changes to the leaders of the administration as is traditionally applied by the American system. Berlusconi said: "As far as I am concerned, we have to roll up our sleeves and work together at rebuilding our country. There are so many problems to resolve that it is only by pulling together that we can hope to get through." Moreover, everyone who has written about clean ups and vendettas had better, in the words of the leader, "think twice." [passage omitted]
