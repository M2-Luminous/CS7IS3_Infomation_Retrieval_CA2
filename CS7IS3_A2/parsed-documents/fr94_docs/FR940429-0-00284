(c) If a final decision requires a lender, a lender that has a contract with a third-party servicer, or a third-party servicer to reimburse or make any payment to the Secretary, the Secretary may, without further notice or opportunity for a hearing, proceed to offset or arrange for another Federal agency to offset the amount due against any interest benefits, special allowance, or other payments due to the lender, the lender that has a contract with the third-party servicer, or the third-party servicer.
