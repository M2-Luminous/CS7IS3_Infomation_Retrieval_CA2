Officials are under orders to refuse entry to anyone of the 36 peopled named on the list, a copy of which was seen here. Mitterrand had accepted an invitation to attend the Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor (APCET) to be held from Tuesday to Friday, but later said she would not be coming, although no reason was given for the change of plan. Immigration officials at the Manila airport on Saturday expelled Irish Nobel peace prize winner Mairead Maguire, 50, and a companion. They arrived from Europe in defiance of the ban. A court on Friday issued an order banning the private conference, but leftist organizers vowed to defy the ruling and risk arrest. APCET spokesman Joel Saracho said Sunday that at least 12 foreign delegates are in Manila. The 12 include representatives from the United States, Australia and Canada, he said, but did not say when they entered the country. Immigration authorities at the Manila airport on Sunday decided to expel American university professor Susan Castillo, who was suspected to be one of the foreign delegates attending the conference. Castillo, 46, who teaches American literature at the University of Porto in Portugal and translates books on East Timor from Portuguese to English, was aboard a Lufthansa airlines flight from Frankfurt and said she was a tourist. Airport immigration chief Felino Quirante said Castillo was expected to be put back on the same plane back to Frankfurt late Sunday. The woman had earlier said she was only a tourist but later admitted during questioning she planned to attend the conference. Also on Sunday, University of the Philippines officials banned conference organizers from using the campus and its facilities for the meeting. The announcement was released through the presidential palace. Saracho said more than 60 other foreign delegates are expected before the conference starts on the campus of the state-run but autonomous University of the Philippines. Saracho said government agents may have overlooked the 12 others since they were not on the list. Officials said the list could be expanded anytime. The 12 are "prominent in the sense that they have been doing East Timor advocacy for a long time," Saracho told AFP. President Fidel Ramos, whose move to ban foreign participants has been widely criticized here, has said that all "non-Filipino" delegates, except journalists and exchange students, would be prevented from attending. Critics also noted that the judge who banned the conference is a former military officer whom the West Point-trained Ramos had appointed. The little known group which had asked the court to ban the meeting is being led by a Ramos ally. The East Timor conference has angered Indonesia, which accused Manila of allowing itself to be used by the delegates to subvert Jakarta's terrirotial integrity. It has asked Ramos to stop the seminar. East Timor is a former Portuguese colony which Indonesian troops occupied in 1975 and annexed the following year. International human rights groups have accused Jakarta of alleged rampant human rights abuses in the territory. Ramos has said he was powerless under a democratic constutition to ban the meeting, barred foreign participants after Jakarta threatened retaliatory measures such as stopping to host peace talks betweeen Manila and Moslem secessionist rebels in the south and cancelling investments. Political commentators meanwhile said that while the court ban has defused the diplomatic crisis between Manila and Jakarta, it was a "foreign policy disaster" for the Philippines. "The resolution of the conflict does not erase the fact that the crisis has left Philippine diplomacy in shambles," wrote Amando Doronila in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. He said it was Manila's "worst humiliation and degradation at the hands of another country since the Japanese occupation" during World War II. "Mr. Marcos is no longer around," said former senator Rene Saguisag, referring to ousted Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos' repressive 20-year rule.
