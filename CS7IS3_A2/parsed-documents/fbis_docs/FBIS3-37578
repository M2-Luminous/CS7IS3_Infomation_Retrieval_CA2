This was announced by the committee's Chairman, Konstantin Zatulin at the State Duma's session on Thursday [17 February]. Zatulin informed deputies on the closed parliamentary meeting on Russian-Georgian relations which had taken place on February 10. According to Zatulin, Georgian, Abkhazian and South Ossetian representatives were invited to the meeting. Zatulin refuted the allegations by media that this treaty was unilaterally beneficial for Russia. He stressed that the Russian military contingency in Georgia was, in fact, being reduced since the divisions earlier stationed there were to be withdrawn. Regiments are to be stationed on the military bases instead of the divisions. Zatulin announced that many telegrams and appeals were coming to the State Duma from North Caucasian people, saying that the treaty with Georgia was a threat to peace in the region. Zatulin emphasized that the committee led by him would back peacemaking efforts put by the Russian president and aimed at political settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Zatulin expressed his concern over the fact that the treaty could be implemented de facto before its ratification. Proceeding from this, he recommended that a law on international treaties which would mention which treaties were a subject to ratification by the parliament be urgently adopted.
