"I was released Tuesday around 8:00 a.m. (2400 GMT), but I am still under constant surveillance by the police," he said by phone from Shanghai. Bao had published a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, calling on him to apologize for Japan's wartime atrocities in China and pay reparations to survivors. Since last Friday -- the day Hosokawa arrived for a three-day visit to China -- Bao has been watched around the clock by the authorities and had his home telephone cut off. His detention coincided with Hosokawa's visit to Shanghai, which lasted several hours. Bao, 31, has fought for years for reparations from Japan, and has already been to prison several times for his campaign. China officially abandoned its demands for war reparations in 1972.
