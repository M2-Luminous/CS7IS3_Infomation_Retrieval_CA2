Did it meet your personal expectations? [Mukhametshin] Yes, both the people's deputies and republic voters, and especially economic managers, had been waiting for this session. Waiting with some anxiety, especially with respect to the main issue--the government program for getting the republic's economy out of the crisis. The government was unable to prepare such a program. But as the first step it offered "Priority Measures on Stabilization of the Republic of Tatarstan Economy." Later, these measures, after taking into account people's deputies' proposals and comments, ought to grow into a normal economic program. Of course, one month (and this is how long the Supreme Soviet gave the government at the previous session) is not enough to prepare such a program. They needed to analyze the state of the economy, appraise the potential of the republic itself and of implementing the economic aspects of the treaty and agreements with Russia, and look into real opportunities of attracting foreign investment. There were no sensations at the session, of the kind many had expected and predicted--such as the government's resignation. Nevertheless, the deputies did some serious work; in the near future all their proposals and suggestions will be summarized and submitted to the government for consideration in developing the big program. [Mikhaylin] So it will still be a program of anticrisis measures? [Mukhametshin] It was outlined quite well by the president in his speech; he said, in particular, that it will be a program of the Republic of Tatarstan's socioeconomic progress. It will be broader than merely an anticrisis program. The subject here is not only the stabilization of the republic's economy, but also its progress. [Mikhaylin] While it is under preparation, can the government be guided by the "Priority Measures...," which were adopted as the basis? [Mukhametshin] Yes; by adopting this document as a basis, we gave the government the "green light." And generally, as one deputy put it, we should support even the smallest steps on the part of the government toward economic stabilization. About 10 draft laws necessary for the implementation of these measures have been submitted to the Supreme Soviet now, along with draft presidential edicts, which should be put into action in the very near future. Then the government, on the basis of the "Priority Measures..." developed by it and approved by the parliament, will be able to work normally. [Mikhaylin] The "auxiliary" measures apparently also include granting additional powers to the president, do they not? [Mukhametshin] The president needs them precisely in order to speed up the adoption of anticrisis measures. The Supreme Soviet has certain procedures for adopting laws: discussion in commissions, adoption in the first draft, second draft, and so on. Such a painstaking process produces quality laws, but it does stretch out the process of their adoption. We do not have all the time now. Therefore, the president was given the right to issue laws aimed at stabilization of the republic economy. [Mikhaylin] Now let us go back to the beginning: What is the substance of the economic stabilization measures adopted by the parliament? [Mukhametshin] If you recall, at the previous Supreme Soviet session, during the discussion on the republic budget for the current year, the deputies raised the issue of the state of the republic economy and the need to take urgent measures to stabilize it. A corresponding decree was adopted, which set the work in this direction in motion. It boils down to a compromise between the need to radicalize the reforms and our proclaimed policy of "soft" entry into a market, protecting both goods producers and the consumers, that is, the population. Therefore, it is only natural that questions of social protection were considered simultaneously with the discussion of "Priority Measures...." Our situation has changed dramatically as compared to last year. Altogether, last year was not a typical one for us: The treaty with the Russian Federation was not yet signed, which means that we shared taxes to a considerably lesser extent; we sold oil at sufficiently high world prices, while this year they dropped; the level of oil production also has dropped. There are also a number of factors that enable us to speak of serious economic decline. Therefore, now, whether we want to or not, we will have to live "frugally," count every budget penny. It will also be necessary to reduce the government, reduce the state vehicles pool.... [Mikhaylin] Apparently this "frugality" will also affect some social programs? [Mukhametshin] It is clear that no new social programs will be implemented in the near future. But neither will those programs we had approved when closing the budget be completely folded. Moreover, during the recent visit of the Russian president, an agreement was reached that some programs will be elevated to the status of federal programs and will be paid for from the Russian budget. [Mikhaylin] At the previous session of the parliament, and even earlier, there was much talk about worsening relations between it and the government. Have your positions been brought closer at this session or, on the contrary, has the schism deepened even more? [Mukhametshin] Well, I would not put it this way. There is always some criticism inherent in relations between the parliament and the government. After all, the Supreme Soviet is a body elected by the people, and it simply is its responsibility to oversee and criticize the government for some or other shortcomings. It is another matter that by vesting certain powers in socioeconomic issues with the president, we, I think, diminish the role and the place of the government itself. This can happen in two instances: when the government is not doing its work properly, or if the task is to shift the burden of responsibility for dealing with these tasks onto the president.... [Mikhaylin] What stage of its life is Tatarstan entering now? If in the past it was a "soft" entry into a market and defining relations with Russia, what strategic goal does the republic leadership set for itself now? [Mukhametshin] Recently, before signing the treaty with Russia, we devoted too much attention to politics--fighting for sovereignty, additional powers, defining the status, and so on. We spent more than two years on this. The time has come when we have to pay the closest attention to our own economy. This is where the deputy corps will focus, and the government, too, I think. The time has come to search for a model of economic reforms in Tatarstan, kicking the market mechanism into full gear. We have to stop talking about getting the reforms going and actually do it. The substance of reforms, in my opinion, should boil down to getting enterprises of all forms of ownership--both private and the remaining state sector--to work; in adjusting the tax system in such a way that would produce an increased tax flow into the budget but at the same time would not place an undue burden on goods producers. As a third defining measure of this new economic policy, we must adjust the flow of finances, so that money would not just make more money, but participate in economic revival, activating the formula "money--goods--money." The fourth measure should be redistribution of labor resources between sectors, between enterprises, and so on--in order to avoid a sharp increase in unemployment. The "soft" entry into a market has done its part. The reforms did not hit our citizens as badly as has happened in many other regions of Russia. Now, however, we have to quickly and firmly launch new economic mechanisms, because this is precisely a case in which delay is equivalent to death. [Mikhaylin] And the last question which we cannot fail to touch upon--the leaving in effect until 1 January 1995 of the law "On Extraordinary Measures of Combating Crime...." [Mukhametshin] Yes, this is indeed a serious question. Many deputies demanded its repeal, but most interestingly, did not offer anything instead. At the same time, we cannot leave the crime situation as is. There probably are some abuses on the part of the militia. But this law not only gives the militia rights--it places responsibilities on it. We constantly monitor the implementation of this law; we believe that it should not make a single innocent person suffer. Because otherwise a law written with the aim to help people will actually turn against them. We cannot allow this, just as we cannot allow the economic reforms that we are about to begin implementing to deal a blow to the well-being of our citizens.
