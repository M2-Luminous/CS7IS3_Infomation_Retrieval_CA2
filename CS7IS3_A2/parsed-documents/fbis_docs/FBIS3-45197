Take a look at the just-published Elite magazine, one of the handful of cultural products churned out since mid-1989 by some of the nation's best -- and most open-minded -- brains. Founders of, and contributors to the journal include such big names as former People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] editor Qin Chuan; former culture minister Wang Meng; avant-garde economists Yu Guangyuan and Wu Jinglian; liberal elders Li Rui and Xia Yan; and taboo-smashing writers Shao Yanxiang and Zhang Kangkang. The founders waged a fruitless battle for nearly a year to secure for Elite, which is intended as an unofficial, general interest journal, a publication licence and a shuhao (book or periodical number). The problem was partly solved when the magazine became a semi- dependent entity under the China Strategic and Management Research Society, a quasi-official unit in which Mr Qin's son is a senior staffer. Elite was granted a temporary shuhao. The censors indicated proper registration would only be considered after a few trial issues. The 3,000 copies of the inaugural issue, however, could not be circulated nationwide through the regular distribution network. Most ended up being handed out by the editors as gifts to fellow intellectuals. This is despite the inordinate precautions taken not to run foul of the remnant Maoists running the Propaganda Department and assorted units. The first page of Elite carries a giant photograph of Deng Xiaoping. In an inaugural message, Mr Qin cites the patriarch's name four times saying Elite "is willing to make propaganda for Deng Thought." And while a few of the articles in the first issue touched on hot issues such as privatisation and the assessment of Chairman Mao, none was deemed controversial or provocative. While, on the economic arena, the Chinese Communist Party seems to be liberalising on all fronts, in the cultural field it is very much a case of making a hundred flowers wilt. For fear of rocking the boat in the uncertain period before patriarch Deng Xiaoping's final departure from the scene, the Propaganda Department and its ideological police are taking no chances. Since mid-1993, the department has practically stopped giving permits for new newspapers, periodicals and publishing houses. Worst hit are bourgeois-liberal intellectuals who often are unable to have their works published--despite there having been no regulation barring them from appearing in print. For some strange reason, the Beijing Yanshan Publishing House recently held up the distribution of its series of books entitled Life after 60. What apparently went awry was that two volumes of the autobiographical pieces contain retrospectives penned by liberal authors Wang Ruoshui and Hu Jiwei, both former journalists with the People's Daily. The editor of the series, Zhou Airuo, the son of Marxist scholar Zhou Yang, has reportedly parted ways with the publisher. Late last year, the authorities also put pressure on an American foundation to withdraw financial support from a team led by Beijing University legal scholar Gong Xiangrui. Professor Gong has been trying to put out a series of monographs on the constitutional history of Asian countries, including China. For a brief period last summer intellectuals in Beijing were pinning their hopes on the "new blood" from Shanghai that President Jiang Zemin had transferred to Beijing. These Shanghai faction affiliates include the vice-chief editor of People's Daily, Zhou Ruijin, the vice-chief of propaganda, Gong Xinhan, and the vice- chief of the Theoretical Bureau of the Propaganda Department, Li Junru. Mr Zhou, a former editor with Shanghai's Liberation Daily, helped draft the series of articles of radical reform that appeared in early 1991 under the pen-name of Huang Puping, a shorthand for "Deng Xiaoping speaking out at Huangpu River (in Shanghai)". Since his migration to Beijing however, Mr Zhou's more liberal colleagues have complained about his timidity. One story doing the rounds of the party mouthpiece said Mr Zhou consulted the Propaganda Department on whether to include the name of the editor of a volume that was featured in the Daily's book news column. The tome in question, Changing Our Brains -- which is based on a 1992 slogan attributed to Mr Deng is edited by liberal elder Yu Guangyuan. The transfer of Mr Gong and Mr Li to the Propaganda Department was at first interpreted as an attempt to neutralise the influence of veteran Maoists such as the executive vicechief of Propaganda, Xu Weicheng. Both Shanghai faction stalwarts however, have adopted the lowest of profiles. Mr Li has reportedly not even begun a regular work shift at the department. Mr Xu, who is supposed to have retired last year, is very much in charge. He, together with the relatively conservative head of the department, Ding Guangen, is expected to call a national conference on propaganda later this month to impose an even harsher straitjacket on media and cultural units. Since late 1993, Mr Ding, who used to play bridge with patriarch Deng, has ordered the People's Daily to fax him the proofs of its major editorial pages every night. And Mr Xu and his like-minded commissars have lately begun a virtual purge of the Hong Kong contents of the electronic media. In a talk to staff of the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, Mr Xu, once a protege of Madame Jiang Qing, indicated state television and radio stations should largely weed out songs and videos by or featuring Hong Kong and Taiwan artists. When asked what they should play instead, the ideologue said: "The 100 patriotic movies or their theme songs," which are being featured on television and broadcasts. Mr Xu was referring to the 100 mostly old films the Propaganda Department had selected for their "patriotic and socialist" orientation. While disparaging Hong Kong cultural products for their "bourgeois-liberal propensities", the propaganda machinery has also run a campaign of innuendo on how Hong Kong and Taiwan singers and movie stars have allegedly evaded taxes. Under the guise of reviving patriotic education and remembering Chairman Mao, the Propaganda Department has reinstated a large number of products of the Cultural Revolution, including "model revolutionary" operas and songs favoured by the Gang of Four.
