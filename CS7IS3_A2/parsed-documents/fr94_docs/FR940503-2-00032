FR940503-2-00032 FR940503-2-00028 Based on an evaluation of the use of either commercial or chartered vessels, the proposed ports of entry and alternative modes of transporting the spent nuclear fuel (truck or train) from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site, DOE has concluded that no significant impact would result from receipt of the spent fuel at any of the five proposed ports and overland transport by rail or truck from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site. Therefore, based on the analysis in the Environmental Assessment and after careful consideration of all comments from Federal, State and local officials, members of the public and from the international community, DOE has determined that the acceptance of up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements from eight foreign research reactors in Europe for storage at the Savannah River Site does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act. Accordingly, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required and the DOE is issuing this Finding of No Significant Impact. However, upon further consideration, and in an effort to balance the domestic and international interests at stake, DOE has decided to implement the proposed action as follows. The spent fuel will be shipped either by commercial or chartered vessel from Europe to the Army's Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina to the maximum extent practicable (rather than allowing the shipper to select from among any one of the five proposed ports as described in the Environmental Assessment), and transported overland by rail (rather than truck). Should DOE determine that another port or mode of transport (from among those considered as the proposed action) is necessary, DOE will provide direct notice of the change to State and local government officials of the affected States and will notify the public through local media and other means, as appropriate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the 1950's, as part of the ``Atoms for Peace'' program, the United States began providing assistance in the peaceful application of nuclear technologies to countries that agreed to forego the development of nuclear weapons. This assistance included the provision of highly enriched uranium for use in research reactors around the world. After irradiation in the reactor, the used (spent) fuel was transported to the United States, where it was reprocessed to extract the uranium still remaining in the spent fuel. In this way, the United States maintained control of the highly enriched uranium, which otherwise could be used to make nuclear weapons. To reduce the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation, the United States began a program in 1978 aimed at minimizing and eventually eliminating the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian reactor programs worldwide. This effort (the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program) was directed at replacing the highly enriched uranium used in research reactors with low enriched uranium, a material that is not directly usable in nuclear weapons. Research reactors are of particular interest because the major civilian use of highly enriched uranium is as fuel in research reactors. If research reactors worldwide were to convert to low enriched uranium fuels, highly enriched uranium essentially would be eliminated from use in civil commerce. For research reactors converting to low enriched uranium fuel, acceptance of spent fuel by the United States was viewed as essential to offset the substantial expenses and reduction in reactor efficiency and capability resulting from conversion. The United States accepted highly enriched uranium spent fuel for several decades, until the program was allowed to expire in 1988. DOE decided in mid-1993 to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on a new proposed policy to accept, over a 10&hyph;15 year period, up to 15,000 spent fuel elements containing uranium enriched in the United States. The goal of the proposed long-term policy would be to recover highly enriched uranium exported from the United States, while giving foreign research reactor operators sufficient time to develop their own long-term solutions for storage and disposal of spent fuel. Although the Environmental Impact Statement is under preparation, DOE does not expect to complete the analysis and make a decision on whether to implement the policy until mid to late 1995.
