Renata Havranova, editor of PRACE daily, reports from Bratislava: [Havranova] (Mario Martins), head of the delegation of Council of Europe experts, noted that since his first visit last April, considerable progress on the part of the Slovak bodies has been noted in tackling territorial administrative division. Council of Europe experts are of the opinion that the proposed integration of state administration on a horizontal level could improve not only its efficiency, but also the coordination of branch activities and, above all, relations among citizens. Slovakia should speed up the process of decentralization so that appropriate laws can be put into practice prior to local elections. Experts consider as too liberal the principle of voluntarism in the cooperation of self-administration bodies when setting up offices. The Slovak Republic should safeguard the standard level of state administration by laws. The experts pointed out that the problem of national minorities cannnot be solved by artificial division of the state into regions. They consider the geographical spread of minorities as one of the many factors of the reform. Representatives of the Council of Europe recommended permanent dialogue, above all, with the Hungarian minority. The problems of this minority, in their view, could become a question of human rights.
