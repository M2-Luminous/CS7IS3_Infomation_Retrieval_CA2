I would also like to announce that the number of mutual tourist visits between the two countries has exceeded 1 million in recent years. Moreover, the existing problems and new developments in the Balkans as well as in the Caucasus and the Middle East make it imperative for Turkey and Romania, two important countries of the region, to hold more frequent contacts at every level. The restructuring of Europe also makes these contacts necessary.

The president added that the possible contributions by Turkey and Romania to peace, stability, and cooperation in the region will also be reviewed.
