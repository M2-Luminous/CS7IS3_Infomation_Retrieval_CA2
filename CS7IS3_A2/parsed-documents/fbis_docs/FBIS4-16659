Gorbachev also admitted that he knew he could be ousted like Khrushchev. Khrushchev was toppled in 1964 after his reformist plans caused a major opposition from hard-line communist party nomenklatura. "We remembered the experience of Khrushchev, but we underestimated the reactionary forces of the past", Gorbachev said addressing a conference devoted to the 100th birth anniversary of Khrushchev which opened in the Gorbachev Foundation on Monday. He added that yet in 1987, two years after perestroyka began, "the people who started the transformations realised that the fate of Khrushchev was in store for them". Gorbachev had to step down after his communist elite staged a coup against him in August 1991 which resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union. The former Soviet leader stressed that Khrushchev had a great influence on all the Soviet reformers. He compared his perestroyka to Khrushchev's "thaw" and said that the latter failed because the new policy was implemented by old methods. "Problems of immense historic importance cannot be solved by Bolshevik methods", Gorbachev said.
