MB5 Massachusetts shoreline 70 ○00 ’ W. There is a band outside the Mid-coast closure area that encompasses Jeffreys Ledge and is described relative to the Mid- coast area as east on 42 ○30 N. from the shore to 70 ○00 W., north along 70 ○00 W. to 43 ○00 N., on 43 ○00 N. to 69 ○00 W., then north on 69 ○00 W. to the shore. According to the sea sampling data base, harbor porpoise bycatch in this band has been relatively high during the last 3 years. Concerns focus on whether a displacement of more fishing effort into this region might account for a kill rate as high as or potentially higher than in previous years. Under provisions of this final rule, the band will remain open, but the Council recommended mandatory observer coverage for vessels fishing in the area if funds are available. D. Open Areas: Areas shown on Figure 4 to part 651, but not enclosed by the boundary lines described above, would not be subject to closure at this time. The Council program calls for a 20-percent reduction in the Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise bycatch in year 1 of implementation of Amendment 5. To ensure continued efforts to reduce the bycatch, Amendment 5 states that a Harbor Porpoise Review Team (HPRT), appointed by the Council, will evaluate the effectiveness of the Council's mitigation measures annually by September 15 of each year and, if necessary, recommend changes to ensure that the bycatch reduction goals are met. Future management measures will be designed to achieve a 60-percent reduction in the bycatch of harbor porpoise from current levels over a 3-year period. Based on a bycatch of 1,300 animals (a figure that constitutes a rough average of the bycatch estimates over the last 2 years), the bycatch in years 1, 2, and 3 would be reduced to 1,040, 780, and 520 animals, respectively. Such a reduction schedule might surpass the goal of reducing the harbor porpoise bycatch to a level not to exceed 2 percent of the estimates of population abundance and bycatch (39,500 and approximately 1,300, respectively). The use of the lower bound of the 95-percent confidence interval for the abundance estimate, 39,500, adds a level of conservatism that in part addresses the problem of the confidence intervals surrounding the bycatch estimates. As previously discussed, the entire 2 percent bycatch cannot be allocated solely to the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fleet. A specific target for year 4 will be established by the HPRT after consideration of previous targets not met in any given year or because of possible increased bycatch reductions required by the 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. For example, if the 20 percent target is missed in any of the first three years, the fourth year allows the flexibility to add that portion of the target reductions not achieved in any of the first three years to be deferred until the next year or until year four of the program. The year-4 target, however, cannot exceed 20 percent of the total reduction required over the entire 4-year period. Comments and Responses The Council held the first of two meetings required under the Amendment 5 framework adjustment process on February 17, 1994. Two public hearings were subsequently held on March 9, 1994, in Portsmouth, NH, and on March 10, 1994, in Ellsworth, ME. The Council approved the closures for the Northeast and Mid-coast areas at the second Council meeting held on March 17, 1994. On April 6, 1994, the Council adopted boundaries and a 30-day closure period for the Massachusetts Bay area. In addition to the meetings held within the formal framework period, the public was notified of all Marine Mammal Committee meetings held between September 1993 and March 1994, for the purpose of developing the time and area closure plan. For scoping purposes, the issue also was included in the Amendment 5 public hearing document and was reviewed at a series of coastwide meetings held in the spring of 1993. Comments on the Council's proposal were received from Maine Congressional Rep. Olympia J. Snowe and the following organizations: Cape Ann Gillnetter's Association, Beverly, MA; Coonamessett Farm, Falmouth, MA; International Wildlife Coalition, East Falmouth, MA; Maine Gillnetters Association, Stonington, ME; Massachusetts Netters Association, Marshfield, MA; and the New Hampshire Commercial Fishermen's Association, Rye, NH. Comment: Numbers of fishermen had serious concerns about the quality of the data used to determine time and area closures. Response: Measures contained in Framework Adjustment # 4 are based on the best scientific information available. NMFS has conducted two population surveys of harbor porpoise abundance in the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy region. Additionally, bycatch estimates have been calculated from observed gillnet trips, based on sea sampling data collected since 1989. Since June 1991, observers have made trips on roughly 9 percent of the Gulf of Maine gillnet trips. All available information on the biology, seasonal distribution, abundance and bycatch was reviewed at two international workshops convened by the NEFSC in Woods Hole, MA in May 1992 and February 1994.
