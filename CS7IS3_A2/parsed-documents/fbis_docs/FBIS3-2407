The province has set up the Beijing Yunnan Economic and Trade Promotion Corporation Limited in Beijing to help develop Yunnan's export-oriented economy and to establish trade ties with countries like the Commonwealth of Independent States. Over the past decade, the province has achieved significant progress in economic development. Its gross domestic product increased from 6.9 billion yuan ($793 million) in 1979 to 64.8 billion yuan ($7.4 billion) last year. The annual revenue jumped from 1.1 billion yuan ( $126 million) to 20 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) during the same period. Moreover, the province invested more than 10 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in a number of infrastructure projects involving communications, energy, telecommunications and water conservation. Yunnan's foreign trade was valued at $840 million including 2.8 billion yuan ($321 million) of border trade deals in 1993. Located on the Southwest border of China, the province is rich in natural resources. It is well aware of its potential to become an export-orientated economy. Last year, the province produced 874,000 tons of tobacco, 5.3 cases of cigarettes 92,000 tons of rubber, 63,000 tons of tea, 750,000 tons of tropical fruit,270,000 tons of nonferrous metals and 5 million tons of phosphate ores. There's been a boost in exports to Southwest and South Asia, Europe, Australia and the United States. And the province also aims to concentrate on opening up markets in North, Northeast and Northwest China. Yunnan plans to adjust its industrial structure to develop perfume, pharmaceutical, building material and wood processing industries. Yunnan, which has a population of more than 38 million, has an abundance of biological, mineral and energy resources. Sharing a long land border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar and linked to Thailand and Cambodia by the same river, the province is China's gateway to Southeast Asia. With its neighbours keen to foster trade links, Yunnan is in a good position to take an active part in cross border trade. The government has recently worked out a plan to speed up the pace of development in the western part of the country in the 1990s. To implement the plan, five of China's southwestern regions, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi and Tibet, are working together to enhance economic co-operation and open up to the outside world. Sponsored by the five provinces and Chengdu and Chongqing cities, the Kunming Export Commodity Fair held last August proved to be a success. During the Third Plenary Session of the Party's 14th Congress and according to Deng Xiaoping's speech during his trip to South China in 1992, emphasis was placed on speeding up economic development. In line with this spirit, Yunnan will work hard to open its door even further to the outside world. It will import more advanced technology, human resources, materials and equipment that the province needs. At the same time, Yunnan hopes to export more of its products. The Beijing Yunnan Economic and Trade Promotion Corporation will establish more trade channels in North and Northeast China as well as in foreign countries. The corporation will act as agents for the province and promote the sales of various commodities and purchase raw materials, technology and equipment. It will also deal with real estate and investments; provide information, consultancy, transportation and advertising services; absorb foreign investment, finance domestic funds and further develop resources in the province.
