The clashes, which involved the use of teargas, automatic pistols, and machine guns, resulted in many casualties, so far undisclosed, among the fighters and their families. The fighting lasted more than three hours, according to witnesses. Republican Guards and police trainees undergoing training live in two camps in Bamako separated by a common wall. Sources say that a Republican Guard, Boubou Sylla, who wanted to take a shortcut through the training center, was allegedly molested by some student policemen leading to violent reprisals by the Republican Guards, who live with their families in their camp. However, women and children living on the premises were said to have been evacuated in time by paratroopers, who came from their quarters 5 km away to separate the fighting groups.
