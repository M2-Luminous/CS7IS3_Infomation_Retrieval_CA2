The difference will remain effective even after ordinary deposit rates are liberalized, which could possibly start in June. But the ministries will further scrutinize some exceptional cases such as when rates of ordinary bank deposits become sharply lower than market rates, the officials said. The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry have been seeking to set the rate on its ordinary deposits in accordance with market rates but the Finance Ministry was insisting on leaving the difference, while narrowing the gap.
