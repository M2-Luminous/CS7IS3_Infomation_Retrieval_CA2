This item is a classic example of an incompetent discussion of important problems. If it had appeared on 1 April, it could have been perceived as a clever joke. In order to demonstrate the professional level of this item's author, let's analyze just a few of the "pearls" with which it is filled to the brim. Thus, for example, the author makes a catastrophic prediction concerning the Black Sea--"the world's bluest"--by subtracting from the 2800 tonnes of oil which could get into the water 2600 tonnes, from which the sea could--so to speak--cleanse itself. If Mr. Listopad had the slighest notion of how to deal with this problem, he would know that in such calculations 2800 and 2600 tonnes are really the same thing. And there are specialists who assert that the Black Sea could handle much more than this. Another piece of nonsense in this article is the following: "Those persons who were clever enough to catch such oil-saturated fish, cook them, and eat them are now lying in cancer-treatment facilities." The exact opposite of this information is correct. Nowadays many persons ill with cancer are being successfully treated with gasoline (by the way, in olden times--before petroleum became a fuel, it was utilized for treating various diseases). Here's another "pearl": "Burning oil gives off a cloud of ammonia, which could turn Odessa into a real graveyard within a few hours." I do not know what kind of education Mr. Listopad has, but in a high-school chemistry class he would deserve a grade no higher than a "Two." It would be interesting to know whether Mr. Listopad accumulated this nonsense on his own or whether such "information" was, perhaps," imparted to him at the Ecological Academy, the president of which is the academician-economist, Mr. Dorohuntsov--a person well-known to us by way of the parliament. Incidentally, the principal specialists in ecology (including that of the above-mentioned terminal) who are working for him are also economists who have been generously awarded the title of academician. We are remined willy-nilly of Krylov's well-known fable about "piemakers" and "shoemakers." The fact that Mr. Listopad's article appeared after the decision to build the Odessa Oil Terminal was adopted leads me personally to conclude that this is a conscious piece of disinformation, directed at undermining the terminal, and thus safeguarding and preserving Russia's monopoly on supplying oil to Ukraine. Ukrainians, Russians, and members of national minorities--to which the article's author also belongs--feel in their own stomachs what this monopoly has brought about. The reason why the inhabitants of Ukraine, which produces more food per capita than Russia, have had to eat worse than the inhabitants of Russia (particularly those in Moscow) during the last two years is to be explained by this very monopoly. The fact is that we do indeed buy oil in Russia at a price which--in dollars--amounts to 80 percent of the world price. But as a result of the fact that the exchange rate of the ruble to the karbovanets--something which is also dictated by Russia--exceeds the real price several times over, we in practice are paying for this oil at triple the world price. The following paradoxical situation has evolved: Our state obtains prices which are too low for its agricultural products and then uses this money to buy oil in Russia; it then refines it at Ukrainian refineries. As a consequence of this activity, we are obtaining not a profit, but rather a decline of our agriculture and an increase of our debt to Russia (by the way, such a situation was already begun by L. Kuchma, who now dreams of becoming president and returning Ukraine to the embrace of its "elder brother"). We should remind ourselves that Russia is alreading demanding that--in exchange for our debts--we give it our oil refineries, trunk pipelines, and the reserves of our underground storage facilities. In practical terms, this means that Mr. Chernomyrdin would be in charge of issuing heat to our apartments and houses. Then we will be shown where crabs spend the winter. In concluding the topic of oil terminal safety we should remark that France--which is roughly similar to our country--takes in approximately 80 million tonnes of oil, whereas the United States takes in as much as 300 million tonnes (transporting it in tankers from as far away as the Middle East!). And there are no serious problems there except for an occasional accident. And nobody rejects the idea of oil terminals. Therefore, if our terminal is built under the direction of a firm which has worldwide experience, the "world's bluest sea" will--perhaps--remain virtually unchanged (incidentally its greatest pollutant nowadays is Odessa's fecal matter--something which Odessa's people's deputies know about). Now about the need for such a terminal. This oil terminal must be built as quickly as possible not only because Russia is selling us oil at triple the price prevailing on the world market, but also because it is sending us very bitter, high-viscosity, high-tar, and high-sulfur types of oil (based on the principle of "It's no skin off my nose"). This has reached the point where the Kremenchug Refinery produces diesel fuel having a sulfur content of 1 percent instead of 0.2 percent (as a result of which the amount of acid rain has increased by a factor of 5). Recently, in connection with the poor quality of crude oil, we have not even been able to make lubricating oils (products in extremely short supply, and without which we cannot sow our crops nor even drive to work). Moreover, as to importing such lubricating oils from Russia, that is impossible because--despite the enforced cutback in production at Russian refineries due to the lack of sales, selling these oils to Ukraine is prohibited (Moscow has issued no quotas). In summing up, we specialists must issue the following warning: Unless we have an alternative facility for delivering energy sources by next winter, we will freeze like the Armenians, or we will finally lose our independence. It is also likely that--no matter what happens--we will have to get by on 300 grams of bread, using ration cards as they are now doing in Georgia. This past winter (just as during the time of the Chernobyl catastrophe) we were saved and protected by the Sophia Mother of God. But we must not abuse Her patience. In my next article I will talk about what a negative and unpatriotic role the State Committee on Oil and Gas has played in solving our energy problems.
