FR941019-2-00078 FR941019-2-00051 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NCI is seeking a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company which, after obtaining a license in accordance with the requirements of the regulations governing the transfer of Government-developed agents (37 CFR part 404), can purify a recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein for which patents are pending or have been issued and to utilize this purified recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein as an immunogen to generate a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies. The immunoreactive CR&hyph;1 protein has been detected by immunoperoxidase staining using a rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal CR&hyph;1 antibody in a majority of human colon cancers, breast cancers, gastric cancers and pancreatic cancers. Little or no staining was detected in surrounding, noninvolved colon, breast or gastric epithelial cells. In addition, a majority of premalignant colonic adenomas, breast ductal carcinomas in situ and gastric intestinal metaplasia express immunoreactive CR&hyph;1. A recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein has been generated using a yeast expression vector in Pichia pastoris and a partially purified protein obtained. This protein as well as synthetic, refolded peptides that correspond to the EGF-like domain in CR&hyph;1 are mitogenic for human breast cancer cells yet fail to bind to the EGF receptor or other type I receptor tyrosine kinases. Expression of CR&hyph;1 antisense mRNA using a recombinant, replication defective retroviral expression vector in colon cancer cells that expresses CR&hyph;1 inhibits the growth of these cells in vivo in nude mice. In order to utilize the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials of CR&hyph;1, it will be necessary to purify a significant amount of the recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein to more fully define its biological properties and to identify the receptor through which it functions. In addition, mouse monoclonal antibodies against the purified CR&hyph;1 recombinant protein will expedite screening studies for CR&hyph;1 expression in other human premalignant lesions and cancers and should exhibit more specificity and sensitivity for the detection of CR&hyph;1 in tissues by immunocytochemistry (ICC) or in tissue extracts or serum samples by ELISA. The role of the National Cancer Institute, the Division of Cancer Biology, Diagnosis and Centers includes: 1. NCI will provide expression vectors that encode CR&hyph;1 and can be used to produce CR&hyph;1 in E. coli. 2. NCI will provide expression vectors that encode CR&hyph;1 in yeast Pichia pastoris containing several milligrams of recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein. 3. NCI will provide a rabbit polyclonal anti-CR&hyph;1 antibody for monitoring CR&hyph;1 recovery during the purification from the yeast conditioned medium. 4. NCI will assay the purified recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein for bioactivity. 5. NCI will screen anti-CR&hyph;1 monoclonal antibodies for reactivity by Western blot analysis against native CR&hyph;1 protein from CR&hyph;1 positive human embryonal carcinoma or colon carcinoma cells.
