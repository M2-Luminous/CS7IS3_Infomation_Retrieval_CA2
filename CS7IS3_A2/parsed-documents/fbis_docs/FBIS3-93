"The PDG calls on the government to restore order, guarantee the security of persons and property, and throw full light on the recent riots so that all the authors are made to answer before the law for their acts," stated the party's deputy secretary general and spokesman, Rene N'demezo Obiang at a news conference. According to him, "apart from soldiers and strangers, victims of the recent violence were essentially PDG activists and supporters." The official casualty report on the four days' clashes between groups of demonstrators and security forces in several residential districts in Libreville and Oyem, the opposition stronghold in the north of the country, lists nine dead, including two soldiers; six seriously wounded; five persons kidnapped and later released; about 50 burned vehicles, and over a hundred shops and street stalls ransacked. One of the victims is Jean Kamga-Komo, a local PDG official in Libreville. "The PDG wants the authors of the cowardly murder of our comrade to be identified and punished in accordance with the law," Mr. N'Demezo stressed. The government has accused opposition parties, especially Father Paul Mba Abessole's National Lumberjacks Rally of "politically recuperating" and capitalizing on the general strike launched by the Gabonese Free Trade Unions Confederation to call for salary increases following the devaluation. Defense Minister Martin-Fedele Magnaga said "certain opposition party leaders recruit, train, and arm militias" and have "overrun the capital with people that loot and go on the rampage." Questioned on possible self-defense measures by supporters in the event of renewed disturbances, the PDG spokesman stressed that his party did not want "a kind of Lebanization of the country with "independent armed troops who take the law into their own hands." The party's main position is to ask government to enforce law and order, he further stated, "but we cannot continue to leave our supporters to be sacrificed as victims...and if government does not do anything about the situation, we will have no other choice but to create private militias as in Lebanon. But we do not want it to come to that," the spokesman said.
