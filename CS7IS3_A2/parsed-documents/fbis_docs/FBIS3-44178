In a suit filed in a federal high court here Monday here, Fawehinmi asked the court to declare that the make-up of the council violates the "federal character" provision of the 1979 constitution. The main element is that four states that are home to the Ibo ethnic group in eastern Nigeria--Abia, Anambra, Enugu and Imo states--have only one representative on the 11-member PRC. Chief of Naval Staff Rear Admiral Allison Madueke, is the only member of Ibo origin. Six other members are from the north, three from the west and one from a south-western minority group. Fawehinmi said that minority groups who populate Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers states, whence comes most of the crude oil that contributes more than 90 percent of the nation's annual revenue, are unrepresented. The council's composition, he argued, is against the spirit of "federal character" and inimical to national unity. Under the "federal character" policy contained in the 1979 constitution, each of Nigeria's 30 states should be given equal consideration when making appointments into national bodies, organisations or agencies in order to promote national unity and command national loyalty. According to Fawehinmi, renowned for devoting more than 20 years of his professional career to fighting for the rights of the poor and the underprivileged, the non-inclusion of any representative of the three minority states from the east in the PRC violates the 1979 constitution. The constitution was reinstated by decree 107, promulgated shortly after General Sani Abacha took power last November, replacing a short-lived unelected civilian regime that had been installed in August by the outgoing junta of Genera Ibrahim Babangida. By going to the court to challenge the PRC's composition, Fawehinmi has added legal weight to complaints of "marginalisation" made against the government early this month by a group of Ibos. In a one-page advertisement in DAILY TIMES newspaper of last January 12, a group calling itself "Concerned Igbos" (or Ibos), alleged that since the end of the Nigerian civil ("Biafra") war in January 1970, the Ibos have been "persecuted, condemned and sacrificed". An estimated one million people, including women and children, died in the war which lasted for 30 months. An attempt by the east to secede from the rest of the country triggered off the bloody war. The group also alleged that the Ibos have been denied prominent ministerial positions and posts in the federal public service, rarely appointed to head federal agencies or given either ambassadorial positions or "effective command of body of troops". They specifically cited the fact that there is only one of their own number in the PRC, despite the fact that the Ibos represent one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria. Apart from the Ibos, several minority groups, particularly the Ogonis in south-eastern Rivers State, have recently heightened agitation for justice and fair distribution of the nation's revenue. In the heat of a nation's political crisis after Babangida annulled the outcome of a civilian presidential election last June, six of the seven states in the eastern part of Nigeria threatened to secede over what they called the injustice meted to them by the federal government in the sharing out of the nation's resources and political offices.
