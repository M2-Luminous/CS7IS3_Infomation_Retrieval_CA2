He voiced profound sorrow and regret over the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, stressing the need to agree on measures that guarantee Palestinian security in the occupied territories. The Egyptian diplomatic establishment, with its well-known expertise and Arab and international influence, has succeeded in using the hideous crime perpetrated by Jewish extremists inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque to exert great pressure on Israel in the negotiations and has exploited the international condemnation of the act by demanding stronger powers for Palestinian autonomy. Egypt did not limit itself to denunciations but used the crime to promote the desired strategic solution. Over the past few days President Mubarak contacted the leaders of many countries influential in the peace operation to convince them of the danger threatening the peace, which is illustrated by settlers with expansionist delusions in the Palestinian territories who perpetrate crimes against the Palestinians. These crimes are reaching new heights that adversely affect regional peace efforts and provoke popular Arab and Islamic wrath against Israel, as happened after the appalling Hebron incident. An Arab and international consensus exists that the Palestinians need urgent international protection. Mubarak found responsive ears and international willingness to examine the issue of providing protection for the Palestinians inside the occupied territories, including the prompt adoption of actual measures for this purpose because no political power is worth anything without actual power to defend it. When President Mubarak tells the Arab press that it is important to resume the peace negotiations and protect the Palestinians, he is actually stating that the most important reason to accept the peace agreement is to end the hardships of the Palestinians inside the occupied territories, as they are subject to military repression and face injustices at the hands of settlers. An immediate return to the negotiating table is necessary to prevent the extremist settlers from benefiting by their crime, which aimed to undermine the peace process. It is necessary to be reasonable and determine where Palestinian interests lie: in suspending the negotiations or returning to them. Hence Egypt is pursuing its political and diplomatic efforts to save the negotiations from the predicament in which the al-Ibrahimi Mosque crime has put them. We know that Egyptian efforts have gone hand in hand with the peace process from the beginning and have constantly been the lifesaver that rescued the hopes for peace and took them forward to a more advanced stage.
