"The demand for petroleum, which is now the main source of energy, will continue to grow as the incomes of the people rise. Therefore, although Indonesia is still a petroleum exporting country, with the present growth in consumption it will be a petroleum importing country in the future." The chief state said this Saturday [5 March] as he inaugurated the PERTAMINA [National Oil and Natural Gas Company]-Atlantic Richfield Bali North, Incorporated, [ARBNI] natural gas production and transport facilities in the Pagerungan Islands and the PERTAMINA-Atlantic Richfield Indonesia, Incorporated, [ARII] natural gas production and transport facilities at Sidoardjo in East Java. Therefore, according to the president, efforts to conserve and diversify energy sources must be made consistently and continuously. In this connection, the use of natural gas, the reserves of which are quite large, is very important. The chief of state said that the use of natural gas as a raw material in making fertilizer has stimulated development in the agriculture sector. Through the success of agricultural development, millions of farmers have increased their earnings, and the growth of domestic industry has been stimulated. "Natural gas has now become an important export commodity. No small amount of foreign exchange has been earned from natural gas exports," the chief of state said. Indonesian natural gas enters a new era with the inauguration of these two projects in the natural gas sector. The Indonesian people will use natural gas on a large scale for domestic needs. Natural gas flowing through the PERTAMINA-ARII production and transport facilities off the northwest coast of Java will be used to fuel the steam-electric power plants at Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok. With the construction of Pagerungan PERTAMINA-ARBNI natural gas production and transport facilities, all the fuel requirements of the gas-fueled steam power plant at Gresik will be met. Gas from that project will also be used by the State Gas Company to meet the needs of homes and small industry in and around Surabaya and as a raw material for the petrochemical industry. Indonesia is now experiencing a great increase in electric power demand because of the progress of industrial development. If that demand for power cannot be met, the industrialization process will be hindered. The chief of state said that because of the importance of natural gas to future development, the government will keep encouraging exploration activity. Although natural gas reserves are now quite large, the search for new reserves needs to continue into order to meet long-term demand. "There is a good possibility of this, because geologically Indonesia possesses very great natural gas resources. I am confident that, with the support of advances in science and technology, there is still a great possibility of finding new oil and gas in Indonesia," the chief of state said. It is hoped that the success achieved by ARII and ARBNI under production-sharing contracts will create optimism among other contractors working in Indonesia that there is a big chance of finding new oil and gas in the country. The chief of state said that in the development of oil and natural gas efforts, the government has listened to complaints about oil and natural gas exploration in Indonesia. A positive dialogue needs to be developed between PERTAMINA and its partners with regard to the various methods that can enhance their mutual benefit. In this connection, on 31 December 1993 the Indonesian Government issued a new incentive package that is more conducive to exploration and production activity. Background At the beginning of 1992, PERTAMINA and ARCO Indonesia contracted with PLN [State Electricity Public Corporation] to supply 260 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for 11 years beginning in 1994. The natural gas will be used as fuel for the gas-fueled steam power plants at Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok, which are long-term projects scheduled for phased implementation. The first phase, implemented on 1 September 1993, was conducted as a "fast track" by the direct appointment of an implementing contractor. The second, third, and fourth phases are to supply 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Bima and Northwest Corner Fields and develop existing natural gas reserves as an effort to maintain natural gas supplies until 2004. Initial capital for phase one until production will be more than $300 million. For development through phase six, the total cost is estimated to be $824 million. This investment will be used to expand 5 platforms to 29 platforms, 135 kilometers of pipeline to 423 kilometers, and 11 production wells to 89. Benefits Many benefits of the presence of ARCO at Pagerungan were reported to President Suharto, but the president did not accept the reports at face value. In a dialogue with members of the Pagerungan community who gathered at Permisan Village, Jabon, Sidoarjo, the president asked them directly about the benefits of the presence of ARCO in its involvement with natural gas. Haji Djaelani, leader of the "Abu Hurairah" Islamic Boarding School at Pagerungan frankly answered the president by saying that the presence of the project is very beneficial to residents of Pagerungan. "Damaged, unusable school buildings, both secular and Islamic, have now taken on a new look," he said. Similarly, a fisherman from Wadjo, who had long lived there, expressed his many thanks for the project. Also, a teacher from there has experienced the facilities: ARCO has built a new school, and he obtained a new house near the school. A cooperative managed by teachers has been developed, too. A Pagerungan PKK [Family Welfare Development] manager asked for communications facilities to facilitate his work of visiting isolated groups on some of the islands. "I request communications facilities to facilitate my work," he said expectantly. The president later asked ARCO to take part in considering the request. A young man then followed by speaking of the potential of existing neighborhood youth associations. The president asked the young man to take part in finding alternatives for fishermen who cannot go to sea in the off-season so that their energies can be put to use. He said that Pagerungan fishermen cannot work during the westerly monsoon. "Find a good alternative--using other skills, naturally--so that fisherman can continue to work during the westerly monsoon." The regent of Sumenep also accompanied members of the community in the dialogue with the president.
