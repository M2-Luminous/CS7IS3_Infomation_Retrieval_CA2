It points out that in recent times, "the state of affairs in civil aviation has sharply worsened," while the leadership of Russia's Air Transport Department is taking no effective measures to bring the sector out of a deep crisis. More, department director Vladimir Zamotin and his immediate entourage, the appeal says, hamper in every way the work of airlines that have switched to new forms of economic development. At the same time, "the safety of flights in the sector is at a low level whereas the quality of services to passengers has sharply fallen." All this, the authors of the appeal think, results from the fact that "the sector is being controlled by an amateur, a former party apparatchik who had worked for a considerable length of time in the Ukraine Communist Party Central Committee and the CPSU Central Committee." In this connection, participants in the conference passed a demand to the Russian president and prime minister to relieve Vladimir Zamotin of the position he fills, and recommended that Anatoliy Kochur, president of Russia's Association of Air Crews, be appointed director of the Air Transport Department in his place. As was intimated at the headquarters of the Association of Air Crews, the conference had also passed an appeal to work collectives of Russia's civil aviation for support of the demand for Zamotin's resignation. At the moment statements supporting this demand have come not only from civil aviation air crews and aviation technical services of airline members of the Association of Air Crews, but also from the Association of Air Crews of the Armed Forces and the Federation of Air Traffic Controllers of Russia, where they believe that the present department director should be fired if only "for actions aimed against free trade unions, as well as for red tape."
