The voters can still be swayed. These findings have had a particular impact on Rudolf Scharping in the intervening weeks between our first poll (on which we reported in the 11 March 1994 issue of DIE ZEIT) and this second "Election-ZEIT" poll. Scharping, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), is still ahead of Helmut Kohl when it comes to the response to the hypothetical question of which candidate people would vote for "if a direct election for chancellor could be held." But Scharping slipped from 42 to 39 percent while Kohl climbed from 28 to 33 percent. The total shift of 8 percentage points is larger than Scharping's remaining 6-percent lead. Our poll, conducted during the week of 14 March to 22 March, also reflects the somewhat unprofessional way in which Scharping presented his proposal for a tax hike. Is his drop in the poll merely indicative of a momentary reaction or a loss of some significance? Detailed analysis of the figures shows that both Scharping and Kohl made gains only among the voters of eastern Germany. Scharping gained 11 percentage points and Kohl gained 3 percent. The percentage of those who failed to decide on either candidate dropped from 33 percent to 18 percent in eastern Germany, which is 4 percentage points less than in western Germany. We are thus experiencing the very beginnings of distinct polarization, albeit with apparently paradoxical consequences, i.e. the more the voters drop their reticence and decide on one camp or another, the smaller the differences between the individual candidates and the political parties become. The number of those who remain unconvinced by any party declined from 31 percent to 26 percent and the number of those who responded "I don't know" dropped from 9 percent to 7 percent. At the same time the gap between the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the SPD shrunk from 9 percentage points to 6 percentage points. The respondents who opted for the CDU/CSU was up from 18 percent to 23 percent while those opting for the SPD only climbed from 27 percent to 29 percent. At a generally low level the differences even out, i.e. 29 percent for the SPD, 23 percent for the CDU/CSU and 26 percent expressing no party preference. The campaign thus focuses on the one-third of the electorate who opted for none of the political parties or whose response was "I don't know." What are the main campaign themes? While it is by no means surprising that 65 percent of the voters view unemployment as the most serious problem, it is surprising how clearly this issue outranks all others in importance. Even the "internal security" issue which virtually everyone had assumed could be exploited along populist lines ranked behind the environment, i.e. seven percent as against 10 percent. Oddly enough, the "internal unity" problem came in at just about 5 percent. Even among east Germans only 13 percent of the sample considered the issue important enough. Could it be that joblessness is the one issue which really unites us Germans? The question elicits well-known contradictory responses, e.g. I am pretty well off but the situation is pretty bad. Of those polled 23 percent believe that unemployment will decline over the next one or two years, and 45 percent think it will increase even more, but east Germans, interestingly enough, are a little less pessimistic than west Germans. Nonetheless, 45 percent and 37 percent respectively believe that their jobs are secure or even very secure. On the other hand, 15 percent of the jobholding voters think their jobs are "fairly" or "very" insecure--and that represents a substantial potential for crisis. All in all, however, the voters are much farther ahead politically than the parties and organizations think they are. A large and in some cases overwhelming majority of the voters would be prepared to make sacrifices, if unemployment could be brought under control. Seventy-two percent would agree to wage cuts; 86 percent would even work on Saturdays; 68 percent would work fewer hours for less pay. Low-income voters would be prepared to work more while higher earners would agree to less income. Maybe this underestimation of the voters is part of the reason why they do not think the political parties generally are particularly well equipped to bring about a solution to economic problems. 31 percent of the respondents expressed "no party preference" and as many as 10 percent said "I don't know." Against this somber background, with neither party holding a real lead any longer, the 28 percent in favor of the CDU/CSU and the 26 percent favoring the SPD do not look impressive. What is truly sensational and downright alarming for the Free Democrats is that a mere 1 percent of the voters feel that this supposedly traditional "economics party" has what it takes to deal with the economy--which is equal to the percentage obtained by the Greens, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), or the Republicans. As part of a study commissioned by DIE ZEIT, Infratest Burke Berlin took a poll of 1,001 eligible voters. The respondents were selected at random. The poll was conducted between 14 and 22 March 1994.
