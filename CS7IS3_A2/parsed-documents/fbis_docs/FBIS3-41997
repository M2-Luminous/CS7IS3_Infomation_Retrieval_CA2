The deputy minister for petrochemical affairs in the Petroleum Ministry, who is also the director general of the National Petrochemical Company [NPC], announced yesterday: The units of the Arak Petrochemical Complex have begun full production. In an exclusive interview with the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran, he provided more details: [Begin recording] Unidentified correspondent: Can you give us details regarding the latest petrochemical units that have recently become operational at the Arak Petrochemical Complex? Deputy minister: I can give the glad tidings to our dear compatriots that the Islamic country of Iran is now the primary producer of raw materials for the plastics industry in Arak. We now produce various plastic substances while formerly this industry was dependent on foreign imports. Fortunately, today we produce 350,000 tons of such materials in Arak, which fulfills most of the needs of our 1,500-2,000 indigenous factories engaged in the plastics industry. In the near future we will eliminate all the remaining shortages with the production at the Bandar-e Imam Petrochemical Complex. These products entered the market about two months ago. Today, fortunately, the first phase of the Arak Petrochemical Complex, which includes six industrial units, has become completely operational and will cater to the needs of numerous domestic factories. It may be worth mentioning here that plastic materials are byproducts of petrochemicals, which have extensive value-added uses and consumption in the areas of foodstuffs, clothing, housing, hygiene, and health. You will see the large variety of such products in these fields as they replace natural materials such as minerals, iron ore, other metals, and cotton. I personally wish to stress that since we have been successful in producing these goods from crude oil, the entire country should endeavor to boost its use of these products in the country and to reduce their use of natural products, especially since synthetics are cheaper to use and produce. We intend to replace natural products with plastics. The production of petrochemicals in Arak marks a quantum leap and a change of the climate in the petrochemicals industry in Iran, praise be to God. In the near future we will be quite (?self-sufficient) in this area. Correspondent: Thank you. Deputy minister: You are welcome. [end recording]
