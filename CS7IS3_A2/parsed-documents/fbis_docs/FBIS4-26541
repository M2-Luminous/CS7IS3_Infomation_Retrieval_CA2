Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave an important speech. Zhang Lichang, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and municipal mayor, presided over the meeting. Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, Nie Bichu, chairman of the municipal people's congress standing committee, and Liu Jinfeng, chairman of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the meeting. In his speech, Gao Dezhan pointed out: The main implications of this activity of concentrating a certain period of time on going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct investigation and study and to do practical things are: Conducting investigation is aimed at sizing up the situation and conducting study is aimed at pondering practical methods. With practical methods in hand, we should also implement them and do practical things. We must see the actual results to judge whether we have really implemented them or not. This move is aimed at developing the current excellent situation and better promoting the work of the second half of this year. Generally speaking, in going to the grass-roots units, we have three major objectives: First, we must further promote the change of work style of leading cadres and the change of functions of leading organs. During this activity of going deep to the grass-roots units, leading cadres at all levels must conduct investigation and study and ponder practical methods. All leading organs should change functions and do practical things. Second, we should further develop our municipality's excellent situation and maintain a good trend in all fields of work. In line with the overall plan of the enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, we should promote this work during the middle stage, size up the situation through conducting meticulous investigation and study, know how the matter stands, list out the difficult points, find out the problems, and put forward countermeasures and measures in the light of the problems and weak aspects. Third, we should further maintain close ties with the masses and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. Through this activity, we should further improve the mass feelings, pool the strength of the masses, further arouse the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in participating in reform, promoting development, and safeguarding stability, and form a vivid situation in the whole municipality in which the higher and the lower levels work with one heart and one mind and make concerted efforts to carry out reform and construction. Gao Dezhan stressed: the general tasks and demands of this activity of conducting investigation and study and doing practical things are to size up the situation, ponder practical methods, and do practical things on the basis of summing up the work of the first half of this year and making work arrangements for the second half of the year, grasp the work of the second half of this year more firmly, rapidly, and successfully, comprehensively fulfill the aforementioned three objectives, and successfully accomplish the following four tasks. 1) We should conscientiously sum up the work of the first half of this year. In addition to summing up the achievements and experiences in a down-to-earth manner, we should also honestly find out problems and where we are lagging behind. It is also necessary to place the emphasis in sizing up the real situation and fining out where we are lagging behind. In this aspect, we should attend to the major issues. First, we should maintain close connection with the overall work situation of the entire party and country, with an emphasis in finding out where we are lagging behind in deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability, and in ending deficits, increasing profits, and raising efficiency. Second, on the basis of finding out where we are lagging behind in the system of assuming responsibility for fulfilling a certain work objectives, we should conscientiously investigate and examine the situation of implementing this system among leading cadres. Third, we should find out where we are lagging behind in the major work of our own departments, localities, and units. In this aspect, we should not only find out where we are lagging behind in work but also in ideology. 2) We should make proper work arrangements for the second half of the year. On the basis of summing up the work, we should specify countermeasures and measures for successfully carrying out the work of the second half of this year and formulate practical methods that comply with the reality and are workable, and can solve problems. It is necessary to avoid giving vague and general directions while formulating measures and making work arrangements. As far as the work of whole municipality is concerned, the various tasks defined in this year's work targets responsibility system must be fulfilled or overfulfilled, the unfulfilled ones left over by the first half of the year must be accomplished, the weak aspects must be strengthened, and all fields of work set for this year must be done better compared with last year; during the second half of this year, strenuous efforts must be exerted to deepen reform, particularly enterprise reform, tackle reform problems, and accomplish this year's reform tasks and objectives; energy should be concentrated on ending enterprise deficits, increasing profits, and raising efficiency during the second half of the year, and more financial revenues should be collected, more profits should be created by enterprises, and the urban and rural masses should earn more. Difficult enterprises, in particular, should strive to rapidly take a turn for the better and enable staff and workers to have a higher income. Furthermore, we should realistically attend to spiritual civilization, comprehensive improvement of public security, and party building. 3) We should concentrate efforts on summing up and popularizing a number of typical examples. To grasp the typical examples, it is necessary to sum up a number of good examples during this activity of going to the grass-roots units and achieve big breakthroughs in using typical experiences to promote work in the entire area and to solve difficulties in work. 4) We should help the grass-roots units solve problems and do practical things for enterprises in a down-to-earth manner. During this activity, we should go not only to units which have done a good job in their work but also to units with great difficulties and many problems in an effort to attain the goal of doing practical things and helping grass-roots units solve problems in the course of conducting investigation and study. It is necessary to realistically change functions, exert real efforts to do practical things for enterprises and grass-roots units, honestly do some practical things for enterprises, and create good external conditions for them. The number of problems solved should be regarded as a standard for testing the results of this activity. Gao Dezhan demanded: To organize this large-scale activity, we have to concentrate a period of time, assume heavy tasks, and set high standards because it involves the work of many sectors. Party committees and governments at all levels must attach prime importance to it, realistically strengthen leadership, organize work carefully, clearly define tasks, attend to priorities, and guarantee that this activity will be smoothly carried out and actual results will be achieved. 1) We should carry out all sorts of organizational work in places where it is needed. Leading cadres at all levels, particularly the first two top leaders, should take the lead in going to the grass-roots units, earnestly practice what they advocate, and take the lead in setting examples. We must set the time. Cadres going to the grass-roots units must guarantee that they will devote more than 15 days to conducting investigation and study at the grass-roots level and do practical things for them. The entire activity must be carried out in a well-organized and planned manner, and by no means should it be let alone. 2) We should highlight priorities. It is necessary to proceed from our own reality, attend to the major contradictions, grasp the priorities and key units, strive to effectively solve a number of difficult problems that affect or restrict the development in various fields, enable a number of key units to achieve fairly big progress in their work, and make some backward units or units with many problems have a turn for the better and change the outlook. 3) We should realistically change the work style. We must not just travel from one office to another. We should go to plants, rural areas, shops, schools, and the grass-roots units. We must be good at using our brains, realistically size up the actual situation, ponder practical methods, and attain the aim of seeking actual results. We must be clean and self-disciplined and be thrifty and simple in work style, use simple means of transportation and have fewer people in our company, and become one with the masses, and must not give trouble or add burdens to the grass-roots units. Still less should we be allowed to seek special privilege or practice unhealthy trends. 4) We should pay attention to actual results. In addition to realistically sizing up the real situation, pondering practical methods, doing practical things, solving a number of problems, and expediting the work, all levels should do a good job in summing up their work done during the first half of this year and make work arrangements for the second half of the year. Each and every leading cadre should genuinely go to the grass roots to get firsthand information and personally write his investigation report. Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin gave a speech at the commencement of the fourth theoretical discussion class for principal leading cadres of the provincial and ministerial levels in which he gave important views on the issue of unceasingly deepening the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the whole party. This speech is of great guiding significance in successfully carrying out this municipality-wide activity of conducting investigation and study and doing practical things. The process of going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct investigation and study is not only a process of applying scientific theories to solving practical issues but also a process of bringing practical issues to the class in the course of deeply studying this theory. This activity of going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct investigation and study and to do practical things for them is a major move of summing up and popularizing the work in line with the general tasks of the whole party and country; a major move of promoting the change of work style of cadres and the change of functions of organs and maintaining close ties with the masses; and a major move of deeply studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics in line with reality. During this process, we should consciously combine the activity of conducting investigation and study and doing practical things with the study of theory, use this theory to guide practice, solve practical problems, and enable the ideological and theoretical levels and the ability of solving practical problems of cadres at all levels to enter a new height. Zhang Lichang called for efforts to rapidly relay the guidelines of this meeting to leading bodies at all levels and cadres of all party and government organs, unify thinking, enhance understanding, proceed from the reality of one's own department, locality, and unit, organize the work carefully, and make overall planning and proper arrangements; strengthen leadership, set strict demands, clearly define the tasks for cadres going down to the grass-roots units, and avoid formalism. It is necessary to solve problems and to expedite the work in the course of conducting investigation and study, and strive to achieve actual results. Also attending this meeting were members of the standing committee of the municipal party committee, vice chairmen of the municipal people's congress standing committee, vice mayors, vice chairmen of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and principal responsible comrades of various departments, committees, offices, districts, counties, bureaus, and mass organizations, a total of 700 people.
