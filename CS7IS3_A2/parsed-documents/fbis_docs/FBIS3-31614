Here's Andrzej Siezieniewski from Moscow. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Siezieniewski] Zhirinovskiy will take part in the first congress of the National Front. His will probably stay several days. Asked about the agenda of the visit, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said: [Zhirinovskiy with superimposed Polish translation] Janusz Bryczkowski promised to prepare the whole program. There will be meetings with social organizations, representatives of business and journalists. We will want to pay a visit to some places of national remembrance. [Siezieniewski] Asked if he is not afraid, that his remarks, for instance about the corridor from Germany to East Prussia across Poland, will not ensure a good reception among the Poles, Zhirinovskiy said: [Zhirinovskiy] I spoke about it as a possible course of events. If the leaderships of Russia and Poland do not take preventive actions in due time, then the West will try to move its border further. I was in Germany and I know that there are forces willing to regain Moravia, Silesia, or Prussia. I stress, however, that what I was saying was just an outline of a possible scenario for the development of events. We would like that Poland and Russia were linked by good relations, that we finally break with, to a certain extent, the hostility that existed between us. [end recording] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed the hope that his visit to Poland would serve the rapprochement of our both Slavonic nations.
