Saishite [6357 0013 3676] Electronics Ltd. of Shenzhen has pioneered domestic batch production of the cards, and authoritative sources say that this demonstrates China is now in the world's front ranks in the field of computer high-speed [100 Mbits/s] local area networks, or LANs. In the past, China has had to expend large amounts of foreign exchange for imports of fiber optic network cards. But in September 1993, the Shenzhen firm put out its first card, filling a domestic void. Now, the FDDI cards have been authenticated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, and have rapidly entered the domestic and foreign markets.
