Pilipchuk: "In a Checkmate Situation"] [Text] We have grounds to call this news from the Northern Fleet very unpleasant: They have decided to prepare the Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser "Kiev" to be cut up for scrap. Ship repairmen have not managed to breathe new life into this first-born of the series of aircraft-carrying ships that are capable of receiving vertical take-off and landing aircraft on board and which was delivered to the plant quay for repair several years ago. The press of the economic crises has disrupted these plans. Ships are built not for centuries but each of them has its own measured off time period. For example, American Iowa Class Battleships were destined to serve for approximately 50 years and many U.S. Navy aircraft carriers --for 30 years. The "Kiev's" fate was allotted a total of two decades and its younger brothers "Minsk" and "Novorossiysk" -- even less. They left for the ship cemetery long before the calculated time period, without experiencing the rejuvenating impact of capital repair and modernization that extend the lives of combat ships by many years. Having found colossal resources for the construction of an aircraft-carrying "squadron", the state found itself incapable of maintaining it. The state itself collapsed and the priority program for the development of surface combatants that are capable of unfurling the air "umbrella" of cover over the fleets forces at sea was buried under its fragments. Right now it is already clear that the Russian Navy faces decades of intense labor for its rebirth. And not only in the context of the construction of aircraft-carrying ships. Speaking about them, we must note the obvious paradox that is so characteristic for us: Russia -- a pioneer of the utilization of aircraft from the decks of ships -- does not have its own aircraft-carrying fleet. During the course of the latest polemics on this issue, which have died down for well-known reasons, the sensation frequently arose that currently some people in our country do not at all want to see Russia as a powerful maritime power that is not moving in the wake of the policy of the Western "flagships", but that is affecting the course and the progress of the entire world "armada". God be with them, with the clever writers, who want to convince us that, if we don't build one cruiser, we will be able to erect an entire housing microrayon. It is insulting only that they are being allowed to confuse unsophisticated people as if such simple "arithmetic" solutions exist in the economy. We would like to believe that common sense and a truly scientific approach to these problems reign and our Navy's service record, on which is listed over 300 years of irreproachable service to the Fatherland, will continue with honor and glory. But today, when military shipyards are nearly empty, it is important to preserve if only the naval cadres among which the state of naval aviators causes special alarm and for whom an airfield is the deck of a ship. And there are substantial grounds for alarm here. Soon two years will have passed since the time of the serious flying accident in the Northern Fleet Air Force shipborne antisubmarine warfare regiment. While accomplishing a flying mission, a Ka-27ps (search and rescue) helicopter crashed into the Barents Sea and sank. The tragedy took the lives of seven aviators. What is the need to return to the events of the winter before last, and events so tragic at that? The entire matter is in those conclusions which the official commission, that investigated the causes of the accident, came to at that time and the "independent panel of experts" that was conducted by the helicopter crewmen themselves -- the fellow servicemen of the dead comrades. Both the one and the other cited the prolonged gaps in flights from the decks of ships as one of the causes of the accident. It resulted in an error in flying technique, in shortcomings in air traffic control and, ultimately, in a great misfortune. New Regimental Commander Colonel Gennadiy Stepanov, who was appointed after this accident, while describing the situation that had developed in the unit in 1993, noted that not a single pilot, including he himself, a pilot-expert marksman, had a certification to land on a deck at that time. Yes and how can you obtain it or confirm it if some of his regimental colleagues had not taken off into the air a single time since the beginning of the year. The fuel that was allotted for flights was enough only for several officers who had just completed school "to take to the sky" and to permit seven instructor pilots to "fly a bit". In 1993, the combat training flying period actually went to restore flying technique in the airfield area and on a route over the sea. By the way, the regiment has been designated for joint basing with aircraft on Northern Fleet aircraft-carrying cruisers. We discussed the fate of the "Kiev" above but its counterpart "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov" has already been moored to the plant quay of the naval plant in Murmansk for several years. The ship repair facility of Russia's largest fleet -- the Northern Fleet -- is breathing asthmatically from the shortage of financial resources (even the government has been compelled to review the issues of financing the Northern Fleet) and from the loss of many suppliers who were left behind the new borders. Ships are leaving the combat formation and not are being "restored to health" at the plant quays which could still have acquired a second breath for many years. And along with them, the deck is leaving from under the feet of the carrier-based aviators, the "squaring" of which is being reduced with each written off ship. That is how it already occurred in the Pacific Fleet from the complement of which both aircraft-carrying cruisers -- the "Minsk" and "Novorossiysk" --, that were designed for VVP [vertical takeoff and landing] "Yak's", were withdrawn one after the other. I visited that fleet not too long ago as part of a group of admirals and officers of the Naval Main Staff headed by First Deputy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Igor Kasatonov. During the flight from Vladivostok to Sovgavan [Sovetskaya Gavan], a view of the dead skeleton of the "Novorossiysk" opened in one of the bays under the aircraft's wing. I had the opportunity to put to sea in this, at that time full of force, ship and my heart sank at the sight of the enormous "lifeless" ship. At one time, we discussed at great length the imperfections of the Yakovlev firm's vertical take-off and landing aircraft that are based on aircraft-carrying cruisers. But today we essentially have a new "vertical take-off aircraft" that largely exceeds its foreign equivalents but only one floating airfield has remained for them and that one is in repair. Like some kind of hostile arm, someone's evil genie is always throwing us decades back in the construction of a modern navy, attempting to leave our gigantic maritime borders, as we shamefully say right now, "transparent" and actually -- defenseless. If the Pacific Fleet's naval ground attack aviation has already been deprived of a deck, then shipborne antisubmarine warfare aviation is waiting its turn. The number of ships on which antisubmarine warfare and rescue helicopters can be based is steadily declining and they infrequently put to sea. In 1993, the number of times they put to sea was reduced practically by a factor of two in the fleet due to the shortage of POL [petroleum, oils and lubricants] (yes and those of low quality) and spare parts for repair. And many of them have been serving for nearly 20 years and need the renewal of existing technical resources. Incidentally, the fleet's air fleet is in the same condition where very many of them need repair or are subject to being written off. And therefore the situation with flying-tactical training remains extremely complicated. And here primarily the instructor staff takes off into the sky to maintain its skills. Surprisingly, in the process fleet aviators have managed to primarily accomplish the missions with which they have been tasked. For example, the antisubmarine warfare crews have detected an entire series of foreign submarines which are constantly roaming off our shores. Yes, people are literally working miracles. But for how long will they suffice? In 1993, more than 1,500 Pacific Fleet seamen, including hundreds of aviators, submitted requests to be released into the reserve and nearly half of them were approved. If this is the path for the reduction of our Armed Forces, then we are successfully following it... Mentally shifting from East to West, we see a similar picture in the Baltic Fleet that has also been exacerbated by the losses of part of the bases in the Baltic Region. Indeed, Baltic Fleet Air Force Commander Lieutenant-General Vasiliy Proskurnin is not inclined to dramatize the situation and along with his staff is doing everything so that ship-based helicopter crews maintain their skills as much as possible, even at the cost of their rehearsal at land-based airfields. Not everyone, and first of all the commander himself, understands that it is impossible to maintain an adequate level of training without a ship's deck. Already during the time of service in the Polar region, he nurtured the idea of equipping each fleet with floating pontoons, including towed pontoons, to rehearse helicopter crew take-offs and landings. This proposal appeared in the press in 1993. And a firm in St. Petersburg immediately announced that it was prepared to patent this idea which will not become expensive during its embodiment but the need for something like it is high today. When this theme ripened in my journalistic note pad, I visited the Russian Naval Aviation commander's directorate and met with Major-General Anatoliy Tikhomirov and Colonel Boris Ruchkin. They confirmed the entire complexity and urgency of the problems that have accumulated in naval aviation. Today Naval carrier-based ground attack and fighter aviation aviators have found themselves simply in a checkmate situation. Already several years ago training of carrier-based fighter-ground attack aviation pilots was occurring at the "NITKA" training complex in the Crimea in parallel with the construction of the heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov" and "Ulyanovsk" (the heavy nuclear aircraft-carrying cruiser that has been cut up for scrap at the slipways of Nikolayev Shipbuilding Plant and "Varyag" (the fate of this uncompleted heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser has still not been resolved). It is currently located on the territory of a neighboring sovereign state. This "NITKA" training complex permitted us to rehearse elements of a take-off from a ski jump and glide slope descents and landings while catching the aircraft tail hook on an arresting cable on a deck mock-up. The firm OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] imeni P.O. Sukhoy maintained a contract with the Ukrainian side for a certain period of time on the training of several pilots of the lead group for the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser "Kuznetsov". But Russia needs a more serious -- on the governmental level -- contract with Ukraine for the mass training of pilots. For the time being, the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser "Kuznetsov's" enormous take-off and landing deck is empty. During a two-month cruise, only one aircraft landed on the deck. It's clear that Russia must have its own training complex or center to train and retrain naval fighter-ground attack aviation pilots. The Navy's aviation command authorities went to the government with a petition to grant a location and resources for its construction in Russia. But it seems that right now they are busy with other things and it is hard to predict when the government's hands will reach the essentially urgent problems of naval aviation... Of course, carrier-based aviators have more problems than I am capable of including in these remarks. The shipbuilders, aircraft designers, and aircraft builders also have problems. The new understanding of the country's security that was set forth in the recently approved Russian Federation military doctrine places these problems among those of state importance. It is hard to imagine a priority direction of the structural development of the Russian Armed Forces, like the creation of mobile forces which the doctrine discusses, without the development of a modern navy and its most important components.
