A series of editorial reports describing the content of the first eight parts of the documentary was published in the Political & Social section of the 30 December China DAILY REPORT, pages 25-33. The ninth part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled: "Unique Perception of a Sentimental Poet," and focuses on Mao's literary attainments as a poet, revolutionary, and statesman. After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an unidentified narrator: "A Westerner said: A poet has conquered New China...." the documentary begins with video shots of a construction site in Mao's birthplace, Shaoshan, where 100 stone tablets are engraved with Mao's poems -- this project began in 1992 to commemorate his centennial. Video then shows interviews with French statesman Giscard d'Estaing, famed Japanese sinologist Nimoru Takeuchi, and leading Chinese writers who laud Mao as a poet-revolutionary who composed poems that rhymed with the rattling of guns on the battlefield. According to those interviewed, Mao's poems, which reflect the vicissitudes of Chinese and world history in the 20th century, were written mostly under adverse circumstances after he encountered setbacks during the Long March, and were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and romanticism, as well as boldness of vision. As the narrator reads and annotates passages of Mao's poems during four different periods of his life, namely, his youth, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the liberation war, and after the PRC's founding, video shows historical footage of events, and present-day places connected with Mao. The documentary devotes a lengthy portion to Mao's poem "Snow -- To the Tune of Qin Yuan Chun," citing people concerned who recount the twists and turns prior to publication of the poem in Chongqing in November 1945. The narrator recites "Snow," which describes the beauty of the land, deplores illustrious Chinese emperors lack of literary grace, and says: "For truly great men, look to this age alone," thus displaying Mao's bold aspirations. The narrator goes onto describe the poem: "The People's Liberation Army Captures Nanjing," written in April 1949, as a brilliant work which declared an end to the Chiang Kai- shek dynasty and epitomized the advent of a new era. With the end of the war, Mao's poetry entered a new era. In the fifties, he wrote poems inspired by milestones in China's socialist construction, such as the Chang Jiang Bridge in Wuhan, the elimination of snail fever in Jianxi, and the peasants' harvests. From the early sixties on, his creative endeavors reached a new peak. As the international and domestic climate changed, most of his poems were full of militant spirit. His poetry, which also featured snow and flowers, frequently combined realism with romanticism. In addition to writing poems, Mao also strived to improve his brush painting which he used to write his poems; he was an accomplished calligrapher. At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes with the narrator acclaiming Mao's poems as expressions of his personal charisma, as real pictures of China's revolution and construction, and as a monument of 20th century Chinese history.
