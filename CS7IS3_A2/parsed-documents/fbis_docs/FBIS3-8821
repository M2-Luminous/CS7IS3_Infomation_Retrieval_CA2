Three corridors have been chosen which, once open, will have the effect of partially lifting the Serb siege of Sarajevo. One will pass through the Serb-held industrial suburb of Vogosca to reach central Bosnia via the Moslem town of Visoko, 25 kilometres (15 miles) from here. The other two routes will link the Serb suburbs of Ilizda and Lukavica and the Bosnian suburbs of Butmir and Dobrinja, passing through the airport which is in the hands of the UN Protection Force. Once initialled, the agreement is due to take effect from Saturday, for civilian and commercial traffic. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] will have to be given 24-hour notice of transport of merchandise, which it will communicate to the two sides, and the entry and exit points will be under UN guard. In other areas, Bosnian Serb troops continued to defy a United Nations Security Council demand Monday to lift their nine-month siege of the northern Moslem enclave of Maglaj to allow access for humanitarian convoys. Aid has been unable to reach Maglaj by road since October. The besieged communities have since then been forced to rely on air drops. [passage omitted]
