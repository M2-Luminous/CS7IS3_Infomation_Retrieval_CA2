The weekly said the Japanese wives of those Korean men repatriated from Japan to North Korea in the late 1950s are officially estimated at 1,831 but their number would actually run to thousands. The report said it had obtained the information that some Japanese women in North Korea flashed an "SOS" to Japanese authorities, saying "we are about to be sent to an area near nuclear facilities." "If this is true, Pyongyang apparently intends to use the Japanese wives as a human shield against possible U.S. attack on nuclear facilities," a Japanese Defense Agency official was quoted by the weekly as saying. "This could also be a blackmail or retaliation against the Japanese Government moving to join international sanctions against North Korea over the nuclear question."
