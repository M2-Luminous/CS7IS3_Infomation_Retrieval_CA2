This is so because President Clinton is determined that his country should resume the role of the driving force of the world economy. To achieve this, Clinton must defend U.S. companies and create new jobs in industry and agriculture. Much of the president's effort has been geared to the approval of NAFTA; to the holding of the Asia-Pacific Conference in Seattle; to the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the GATT -- which will enable the United States to sell its agricultural surpluses for several years while restructuring the sector and being instrumental in improving competitiveness all over the world; to pressuring Japan, the PRC, the ROK, and other countries to improve the U.S. balance of trade position; and so on and so forth. The lifting on the embargo on trade with Vietnam is another chapter in this long string of events. The initiative is neither surprising nor does it stem from Clinton's past convictions about the Vietnam War, even though public opinion believes his action is undoubtedly tinged by memories and emotions of that cruel war -- without mentioning the "missing" U.S. soldiers whose whereabouts have never been disclosed by the Hanoi authorities. They have not repatriated the mortal remains of all the fallen to their homeland either. And yet, bilateral relations have eased off considerably. Back in April 1991, General John Vessey, an envoy of the then President George Bush, met with the Vietnamese foreign minister to notify him of the opening of an official U.S. office to investigate the fate of the U.S. soldiers reported as missing. They also discussed the possible resumption of diplomatic relations on condition Vietnam withdrew its troops from Cambodia, and that the South Vietnamese officers being held in "rehabilitation camps" be released and authorized to travel to the United States. It goes without saying that the United States also made it a condition that Vietnam should actively cooperate in the search of the missing. In exchange for that, rapprochement would continue (telecommunications, tourism) and restrictions imposed on Vietnamese diplomats before the United Nation in New York would be lifted. Following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia in mid December 1992 and Vietnamese cooperation over the missing, Washington authorized U.S. companies to "prepare themselves" in Vietnam because the raising of the embargo was considered imminent. Washington also gave the "green light" for international credits for Vietnam for the reconstruction of the country. Following a line of diplomatic continuity at the beginning of July 1993, President Clinton announced that the United States would no longer oppose the granting of loans for Hanoi by international organizations (the IMF and the World Bank). By that time, the economic reform in Vietnam had attracted significant foreign investments, mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and Europe. Finally, Washington sent three consular affairs experts to Hanoi in July 1993 to look after fellow citizens who travelled to Vietnam in ever-increasing numbers. By this time the Vietnamese had "found" the blue book where the names of all the U.S. prisoners of war were recorded and submitted the list to Gen. Vessey. This report agreed more with the documents obtained from Soviet archives than with the original list drafted by Hanoi. Parallel to the progress on the missing was the consideration that, from a very modest start, Vietnam's economy was growing in leaps and bounds. It grew by 7.5 percent in 1992, and in 1993 things looked even better (industrial production increased by 12.3 percent in nine months in 1993). Exports were expanding at an average 20 percent a year. Foreign investments for the period 1988 to August 1993 totalled $6.300 billion. This contrasts sharply with the constraints on U.S. companies that could only participate in business transactions with Vietnam through contracts with international organizations. Thus U.S. businessmen as well as the Senate enthusiastically hailed the lifting of the trade embargo. U.S. companies, ready and eager like racehorses at the starting gate, began activities without wasting a minute, as has been eloquently recorded by newspapers over the last few days. The logic of business prevailed over [former President Richard] Nixon-like ideologies which were furthered by those who want to continue struggling against the last pockets of "the empire of the evil" until it is totally routed, or at least until it is smothered. The reestablishment of full diplomatic relations will have to wait until the issue of the missing is totally cleared up. The United States created 62,000 new jobs in January, 26,000 of which are in the industrial sector. It thus keeps reducing its unemployment rate, which runs at approximately 6.4 percent. This is much lower than the average in the European Union (10.9 percent), but higher than that of Germany, which is currently 6 percent. This is the reason why Clinton continues his trade offensive -- to expand exports and reduce imports -- as the basis for the country's productive renewal. He is aware that in our modern world, nobody can indulge in the luxury of giving up one's domestic market or a highly remunerative job lest one should plunge into the maelstrom of decadence.
