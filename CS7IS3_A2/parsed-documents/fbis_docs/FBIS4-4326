FBIS4-4326 "dreas062_j_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 Indonesia * Labor Regulation Inconsistencies Reported * Labor Regulation Inconsistencies Reported 94SE0086A Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA in Indonesian 8 Feb 94 p 8 94SE0086A Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA Indonesian CSO [Text] The Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid Society (LBH) has demanded that the government rescind Minister of Manpower Regulation (Permenaker) Number Per-01/MEN/1994 which regulates labor unions at the company level, making reference to various contradictions between clauses in those regulations. Munir, head of the Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid Society, said that this year the Minister of Manpower (Menaker) has issued a set of labor regulations which were set forth in Minister of Manpower Regulation Number Kep. 15A/MEN/1994 dated 4 January 1994, concerning Guidelines for Resolving Labor Relations Disputes and Lay-offs at the Company Level, followed up at a later date by Permenaker Number 01/MEN/1994, which regulates labor unions at the company level. However, said Munir, several clauses in those two regulations are mutually contradictory. "These inconsistent regulations are very worrisome, especially when we find out that a ministerial board had made those regulations," Munir told the press here yesterday. Munir mentioned several contradictory clauses in those regulations; for example article 3 (b) of Kep. 15A/MEN/1994 states that complaints can be resolved either via a leader of a labor union registered with the Department of Manpower or via another labor organization. And article 4 (a) states that in order to reach mutual agreement discussions will be carried out with a labor union or an association of labor unions registered with the Department of Manpower or another labor organization. "This clause therefore guarantees the workers the right to set up a labor union other than the SPSI [All-Indonesia Labor Union], which is the organization registered with the Department of Manpower. However, Munir explained, the clause is contradicted by a regulation issued at a later date, i.e., Permenaker Number Per-01/MEN/1994. Article 1 (e) of Section I states that the Labor Union is the All-Indonesia Labor Union (SPSI). This is where the contradiction lies; one of the labor regulations states that a minister can decide that a company can have a labor union other than the SPSI, but another regulation states that only the SPSI can exist within a company," Munir asserted. Not to speak of a clause which, Munir said, is completely incomprehensible and has no force as a legal directive. The confusing proviso, set forth in article 22 of Permenaker Number 01/MEN/1994, reads as follows: a business may not forbid a company-level union from becoming a labor union. That is why the Labor Division of the Surabaya Legal Aid Society, in its letter addressed to the Minister of Manpower of the Republic of Indonesia, demanded the rescission of Permenaker Number 01/MEN/1994, because it considered it inconsistent with previously issued regulations. "We have expressed our deepest concern over this inconsistent policy, which debases the law," Munir asserted. This is especially so in relation to Law Number 28 of 1956 concerning the right to organize and to hold joint meetings, which ratified the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention Number 98 of 1949 and Labor Act Number 14 of 1969, which emphasized that in principle workers are free to organize themselves in any form of organization whatsoever, not just in an obligatory union such as the SPSI. It was stated in the letter, a copy of which was sent to President Suharto, that legal developments and improvements will be hampered if there continue to be inconsistent policies dealing with labor problems. "These contradictory regulations show that the Indonesian government is not building a healthy democratic climate which acknowledges in a fundamental way the rights of workers to organize, as ruled in the Constitution."
