The Muslims are probably counting on the time when they will again mix Serbs and Muslim, thus making Sarajevo theirs. But that will not be accepted. "I believe in the possibility of Sarajevo one day becoming a unified city, but it will not belong to the Muslims, but to the Srpska republic," claims Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the Srpska republic assembly, in an interview for SVET. "We will never agree to the deployment of German or Turkish troops, because they are still in the service of imperialism. The Russian soldiers here can be compared to the troops from other Islamic countries [as published], against whom we have nothing -- except for Turkey. If Turkey succeeds in pushing its proposal through the United Nations, we shall ask that Yugoslavia send its troops to Bosnia," says Krajisnik.
