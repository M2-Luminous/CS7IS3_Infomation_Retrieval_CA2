The suit was filed in November 1993 at the Federal Court in San Francisco, California, by the organization Encounter of the Popular Song [Encuentro del Canto Popular] in response to the government's refusal to grant visas to three members of the Cuban musical group Mezcla. According to Bill Martinez, a lawyer and director of the organization Latin Action [Accion Latina] that sponsors these annual song festivals in San Francisco, the judicial process could establish a favorable precedent that will keep President William Clinton's government from denying visas to Cuban artists and intellectuals. However, this will all depend on whether the judge today accepts as valid the viewpoint presented by the State Department that has asked for the annulment of the process. "Then, all will be finished," Jim Mayock, a member of Encounter of the Popular Song, said. "Anyway, we do not know how he (the judge) will react. We know that this will be difficult because President Clinton handles, at his discretion, the matter of visas for Cubans," Mayock added. The Mezcla group musicians had received the approval of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for their visas, but at the last minute, the State Department overruled the approval, basing its refusal on Presidential Resolution No. 5377. "This is an arbitrary and inconsistent way of acting... The State Department abusively interprets the resolution that was implemented in 1985 and which restricts the approval of visas for Cubans," Martinez said. The presidential resolution was signed during a period of one of the worst state of relations between Washington and Havana, when former President Ronald Reagan declared that all Cubans are government officials and as such were not eligible for visas to enter the United States. In March 1994, President Clinton's government denied visas to two Cuban ballet dancers who had been invited to the Oscar presentation in Hollywood. Cuban intellectuals and clergymen invited by Yale University, as well as Daniel Diaz Torres, a Cuban actor, were also denied visas to enter the United States recently.
