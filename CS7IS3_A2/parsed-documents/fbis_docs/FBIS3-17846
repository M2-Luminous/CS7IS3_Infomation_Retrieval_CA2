Based on the daily reports of the republic's Defense Ministry, we can say that the enemy offensives last week ended in failure. The tension first arose on our borders with Armenia and around Fizuli. But the enemy's hasty offensive did not achieve its objective. Fizuli and Alikhanly were the targets of this attack. The enemy was forced to retreat with losses. At least 20 Armenian soldiers were killed near our positions around Ashagi-Seyidakhmedly. The operations around Goradiz were also successful. Our artillery destroyed two enemy vehicles full of troops. But all these events have not deterred the ferocious enemy from pursuing its objective; only the zone of confrontation is changing. The enemy is concentrating its real force and military equipment on our northwestern borders. The settlements in Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy rayons have been coming under intensive shelling for the last three days. The occupation army's acts were not left unanswered. Despite shifts in the locus of its attacks, the enemy is unable to resist our army's counterattacks. As a result, Shirvanly and Garagashly in Agdamskiy Rayon were liberated. Many other cities are awaiting similar liberation and many cities still suffer the enemy's occupation. But every inch of these lands is waiting and relying on your effort and skill, O Azerbaijani soldier.
