That was an allegory Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa used in describing his view of diplomatic techniques used by European nations and the United States -- speaking at a lecture in Ofunato city on 21 May. He reiterated his long-held view, saying: "Even if you asked them to understand you better, that would be no use," and insisted Japan should assert itself more. He talked tough, declaring: "They [Japanese negotiators] would say there is no way out for Japan, and then step back 50 steps or even 100 steps when they could have taken only 10 steps back. They ought to know that negotiations are deals."
