He denied an allegation by a British newspaper that Japan may change its declared stance and develop a nuclear capability because of the rumored nuclear program of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Speaking at a press conference in Tokyo, the vice minister noted that Japan would maintain its 3-point non-nuclear principle of neither possessing nor producing nuclear weapons, and not allowing them on Japanese soil. He said that to do otherwise would only contribute to the instability of the international environment around Japan. The British "SUNDAY TIMES" reported that Japan had acquired all the parts needed to make a nuclear weapon, and may have built a bomb which requires only plutonium to be completed.
