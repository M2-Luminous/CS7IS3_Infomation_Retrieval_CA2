He said efforts had been made to arrange for a visit which, he believed, would enable the two parties to thrash out misunderstandings. Commenting on a report that the Cambodian Government was planning to lodge a protest with the UN Security Council about Thailand's support for the Khmer Rouge, Lieutenant General Anuson said it is entitled to do so. The Thai military has no worries because it has facts to explain, but it prefers to leave the matter to the Foreign Ministry to handle.
