FBIS4-2304 "drchi068_w_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Position on Civil Servants' Intentions Said Changed Position on Civil Servants' Intentions Said Changed HK0704112794 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 7 Apr 94 p 1 HK0704112794 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By So Lai-Fun in Beijing] [Text] China yesterday appeared to back away from its insistence that all Hong Kong civil servants indicate whether they will stay or leave the service after 1997. A top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, yesterday said that only those civil servants who were unwilling to serve beyond the changeover should inform the future government. However, Mr Lu did not say how or when such a declaration must be made. Mainland co-convenor of the political sub-group of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), Professor Xiao Weiyun, had said that all civil servants should make a statement before 1997 declaring whether they wanted to continue in the SAR [Special Administrative Region] government. The statement attracted immediate criticism in that it amounted to a form of political vetting. But Mr Lu told a delegation of teachers in Beijing that there was a "misunderstanding" over the PWC statement. Mr Lu indicated that the idea stemmed from a recent survey that traced the brain-drain in the civil service, according to Yeung Yiu- chung, president of the federation of education workers, after their meeting with Mr Lu. A City Polytechnic survey conducted between March and November last year found that 35 percent of civil servants were considering resigning because of the change of sovereignty, while 37 percent were pessimistic about their careers. It also disclosed that up to 77 percent were holders of a foreign passport -- a condition that would render them ineligible for top positions in the 19,000-strong team after 1997. Mr Yeung quoted Mr Lu as saying that if the survey results were to happen, the loss would damage the efficiency of the SAR government. The director said that informing a future boss of one's departure was normal practice. Mr Lu said he hoped that only a few civil servants would be leaving in the years to come. During the meeting, Mr Lu also touched on whether the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office would continue after the handover. He said he believed liaison between the mainland's provincial and district-level authorities and Hong Kong should be strengthened after 1997. But its political department might be dissolved or merged with other departments, since its main concern -- new airport affairs -- would be a matter for the SAR government.
