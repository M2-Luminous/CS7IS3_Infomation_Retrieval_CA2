The move was reminiscent of Labour's attempt seven years ago to set up a national front to contest the 1987 parliamentary elections. The result, however, was smaller in scale--a trilateral alliance grouping Labour, the Liberal Party of Mustafa Kamil Murad and the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, which was dubbed the Islamic Alliance at the time. Labour's rapprochement with the Nasserists--who are traditionally anti-Islamist--raised a few eye-brows because its alliance with the Brotherhood is very much alive. The Liberals walked out last year. Hilmi Murad, Labour's deputy chairman, denied that the decision to close ranks with the Nasserists signalled that they were "in" and the Brotherhood was "out." For his part, Dia'-al-Din Dawud said the Nasserist Party was prepared for cooperation with all, and not only Labour. Murad told Al-Ahram Weekly the move is "the start of forging cooperation with all opposition parties which may be ready to cooperate. By coordinating policies and exchanging views on public issues, the opposition will gain in strength and some type of front may be born." He said other opposition parties will be "contacted." Dia'-al-Din Dawud said the Nasserist Party has no "political animosities. Our hands are stretched out for cooperation with all, in any sphere where a meeting of viewpoints may be possible." He said the Nasserists' relationship with Labour was "not of a special nature." Offering his explanation of the developments that led to the coordination agreement, Dawud said that since the call for a national dialogue was issued by President Husni Mubarak, opposition parties have been holding coordination meetings. These meetings, he said, grouped not only the Nasserists and Labour but also the Wafd and the Progressive Unionist (al-Tajammu') parties and others. "Cooperation with all parties is continuing... The decision (to coordinate policies) with Labour is part of this framework and is part of meetings that are also taking place with others, and even more intensively with al-Tajammu'." Murad did not deny the apparent contradiction between the Nasserists and Labour's Islamist orientation. "Yes, there are contradictions between us and any other opposition party... It is only natural that our programmers should be different. But some sort of cooperation and coordination is necessary." Dawud, speaking in the same vein, said the leaders of all opposition parties had agreed to set up a coordination committee, but it has not been formed yet. "This goes to show that coordination will not be confined to Labour and the Nasserists. The principle has been approved in general." Murad, asked why the rapprochement began with the Nasserists, although other parties appeared to be closer in position to Labour, said the Labour-Nasserists agreement "came by chance." He said the meeting between the two parties was also to include the Wafd and the al-Tajammu' "but this did not happen, for emergency reasons." He expressed hope the rapprochement will be "the nucleus of a national front." Asked whether the rapprochement was meant to make up for dwindling popular support resulting from Labour-Brotherhood differences, Murad replied: "Who said that popular support is declining? The attendance at party rallies is overwhelming and our newspaper has a gret readership." He said Labour's close relations with the Brotherhood will continue. Dawud, answering a similar question, claimed the Nasserists have a stronger political presence than any other party, including the ruling National Democratic Party. "This is because we are the party which cares about the interests of the masses and which has been associated with policies that realised justice, equality and security for all the working factions of the people," he said. Like Murad, Dawud expressed hope that a national front would be born. "I do not believe that the formation of this front will be difficult. I think that we are being driven by developments in the direction of its formation."
