Speaking in Jayapura today, (Joseph Tandu), chief of the Information Service of the Indonesian Embassy in Port Moresby, said leaders of the new organization had recently invited former OPM members still living in the jungle to join the movement. The call to join the movement was made because OPM's earlier armed struggle and guerrilla warfare against the Indonesian authorities along the Irian Jaya-PNG border had proved to be unsuccessful. Using the new organization based in Port Moresby, OPM leaders are now trying to persuade former members who are still living in the jungle as well as those who have become PNG citizens to assist the Irian Jaya regional administration in carrying out development programs. However, (Joseph Tandu) admitted that the new organization has no clear objectives and the Indonesian Embassy in Port Moresby is uncertain as to what activities the new organization has done and will do in the future.
