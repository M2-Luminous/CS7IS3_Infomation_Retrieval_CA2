High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) through formal diplomatic channels on relocating North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian camps, a Foreign Ministry official said Saturday. Seoul's mission in Geneva explained about the human rights conditions at the Pyongyang-run logging camps and about those escapees reportedly seeking defection to South Korea to the U.N. body, requesting its support for their resettlement in the South, the official said. The government told the UNHCR that it was willing to accept all logging refugees wishing to live in the South as well as others in the future after discussions with the Russian Government. Out of an estimated 25,000 loggers, some 170 escapees are said to want to settle in the South. The government also instructed its embassy in Russia to protect North Korean loggers seeking help and to assist them in coming to the South after confirming their identification and choice of future residence together with the Russian Government and the UNHCR, the official said. The Ministry, meeting on the matter Friday, decided to support the loggers' resettlement according to the protection law for North Korean defectors if the number is low. But if too many wish to live in the South, the government will revise the law and reduce the available funding for them. A team comprising officials from the Economic Planning Board, the Labor Ministry, the Agency for National Security Planning, the Health and Social Affairs Ministry and the National Police Agency will be formed to assist the loggers.
