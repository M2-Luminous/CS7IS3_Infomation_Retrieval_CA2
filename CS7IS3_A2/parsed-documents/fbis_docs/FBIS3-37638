Jaakson admitted that the situation in Bosnia had deteriorated lately and pointed out the open support to the Serbian aggressors by some Russian political forces. Jaakson expressed the Estonian views on the issues. Estonia does not support the ending of humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of the UN forces nor the ending of the economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro before the signing of a peace treaty in Bosnia. Estonia also supports the countries demanding an end to the ban on arms sale to the Bosnian Muslims, who represent the lawful government of Bosnia, Jaakson declared.
