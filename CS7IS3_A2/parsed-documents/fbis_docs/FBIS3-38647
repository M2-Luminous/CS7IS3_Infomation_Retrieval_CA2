This carnage has provoked outrage everywhere and has already resulted in a response by NATO countries this afternoon. There were many contacts between capitals today, and it was decided to organize a NATO meeting as early as possible. France will call on its allies to serve an ultimatum on the belligerents in Bosnia, a three-point ultimatum. Let's listen to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: [Begin Juppe recording] First, the siege of Sarajevo must be lifted, this means that Serbian forces must pull back to a distance making the renewed shelling of the town materially impossible. Second, with a view to lifting this siege, heavy weapons held by Serbs and Bosnians within a range of 30 km around the town must be brought together and put under UN Protection Force control. This measure will be the first stage in setting up the UN administration over Sarajevo which is -- let me remind you -- a basic element of the European Union peace plan and which has been accepted in principle by all parties. Third, if these two conditions are not met within a short deadline to be set by the allies, all means, including air power, should be used to enforce them. [end recording] [Announcer] This statement was made less than half an hour ago at the Quai d'Orsay and was recorded by Philippe Lefebvre.
