Direct investment in South Africa has stagnated at around 2 billion German marks [DM] since 1989. Martin Kraemer, manager of the Africa Association, is content if German investors are able to keep their position at all. Well-established companies, such as Bayer, BMW, Hoechst, Mercedes, Siemens, or Volkswagen might manage a smooth transition to the time after the elections. Yet, as many as 300 German companies, that is about half of all German investors in Africa, are represented in South Africa, employing a total of 36,000 staff. According to the Africa Association, the fact that German exporters could maintain their business with the continent's most important trading partner "in spite of the reform process" is a success. While German exports stagnated at DM3.27 billion, German imports from South Africa declined by 18 percent, to DM1.95 billion, last year. After sanctions were lifted, South Africa increased its exports of gold, copper, manganese, and other ores to the Far East, East Europe, and the Middle East. The Federal Government, which will hold the European Union [EU] presidency in the second half of 1994, is skeptical about African National Congress politicians' attempts to join the Lome Agreement with the EU. The accession process is too lengthy, and the system for stabilizing raw materials prices would not cope very well with the membership of raw-materials supplier South Africa, Christian Democratic Party development expert Volkmar Koehler said at the African Economic Day in Hamburg. Also, membership of the threshold country would lower the amount of aid for the total 69 poor countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific area (ACP). Not only would all ACP and EU countries have to agree to membership, but it is also doubtful whether South Africa would meet the criteria of a developing country.
