Pierre has written Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras, commander in chief of the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH], demanding the state of siege and calling for the president of the Republic and Parliament to declare a state of siege to prepare for any possible provocation in Haiti. The current political sphere of influence continues to tear Haiti's social fabric and has led the country to a fatal deadlock, clearly threatening our national sovereignty with the military intervention of foreign powers known as Friends of Haiti. The OCLH can in no way remain indifferent and idle during crucial points in the nation's life and has decided to save and defend our national independence. The OCLH earnestly and firmly asks the FADH high command: 1) To order a state of alert at all military bases in the nine geographic departments and to put the Army on alert; 2) To call up all officers, noncommissioned officers, and retired soldiers [words indistinct].
