The winds have been unfavorable for them ever since the Right returned to power and Edouard Balladur became prime minister. The reversal in their fortunes, however, probably occurred one year earlier, in the regional and cantonal elections of March 1992. The regional election had been a psychological blow; the departmental election, a political blow. At a time when it is holding its ninth party congress--two months before the cantonal elections, four and one-half months before the European elections, and 15 months before the normal date of the presidential election--the party of the far right is seeing all the indicators of its popularity and credibility move from the black into the red, so to speak. The poll conducted by SOFRES [French Opinion Polling Company] for LE MONDE and RTL [Luxembourg Radio Television system] reveals a sharp decline in the attraction that the National Front exerts on public opinion. Support for Le Pen's ideas has dropped 13 points since the previous comparable poll--published in our columns in October 1991--which heralded what might be construed as an hour of glory for Le Penism following six months of the administration of Edith Cresson. Over a period of 27 months, that support has dropped from 32 percent--a record--to 19 percent, a rating that takes the Le Pen movement back to its level of October 1987 or September 1990. The decline in this support had already been recorded in a June 1993 poll taken by SOFRES for the provincial press[.sup]1[/] (Poll taken from 5 to 8 June 1993 of a sample consisting of 1,000 persons): this poll gave the movement a 23 percent rating. The three-year decline is continuing today and reflects--in the same proportions--the increasing repulsion felt toward Le Pen's theses. Partisan and Racist Of the voters on the right side of the spectrum, 29 percent said they were "in agreement" with Le Pen's ideas--a spectacular drop of 25 points from the figure obtained in the October 1991 poll. Among the voters on the left, the "disagreement"--which had reached its lowest point in 1991 (84 percent) and rose to 88 percent in the June 1993 poll--now stood at 91 percent. Within the electorate as a whole, Le Pen continues to record a very high level of disapproval for the positions he has taken on all of his favorite issues (see accompanying table). Among RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-French Union for Democracy] voters, however, he continues to enjoy strong support on three issues: immigration, the defense of traditional values, and law and order. On the other hand, these same conservative voters do not at all appreciate those of Le Pen's positions that concern them directly and--in fact--appreciate them much less than does the electorate as a whole. For example, his criticism of the two majority parties is disapproved by 75 percent of French voters as a whole and by 85 percent of the voters of the right, while his criticism of the Balladur administration is disapproved by 76 percent and 84 percent, respectively. An even more serious problem for the president of the National Front is the fact that his supporters are confused by the attitude he has adopted toward the government--an attitude that they feel reflects the absence of a policy line. Whereas 7 percent of them believe the party of the far right and its leader support the administration and 11 percent believe the opposite, 68 percent perceive neither support nor hostility (14 percent have no opinion). When invited to express their preference, one-third of the Le Pen voters say they would like to see their party support Balladur (compared to 14 percent of French voters as a whole) and 7 percent would rather have it oppose him (compared to 6 percent for all French voters), whereas 47 percent express indifference (compared to 65 percent for all French voters) and 14 percent have no opinion (compared to 15 percent for all French voters). Increased Presence in the Field Above all, these figures reflect the existence, among the public, of a certain lack of interest--perhaps temporary, perhaps definitive--in a party that had dreamed of elevating its status in French society, as had been promised by Bruno Megret, delegate general of the National Front, during the period between the controversy of the Islamic veils in October 1989 and the elections of March 1992. Paradoxically, although these figures reflect a decline in support and interest on the part of the public vis-a-vis the National Front, they are accompanied by an increased attitude of apprehension toward that party. Following a period during which opinions remained stable (October 1987 to June 1993), more French voters than ever (73 percent) now regard Le Pen and his movement as a threat to democracy. The Le Pen movement is seeing its influence undermined simultaneously by a lack of support on the part of some and by mistrust on the part of others. This is all the more disturbing for the leader of " French France" in that his party is perceived to be more partisan (85 percent compared to 78 percent in 1991); more distant from the people (60 percent compared to 49 percent); more racist (87 percent compared to 81 percent); and less capable of governing (86 percent compared to 76 percent). This general decline, however, is accompanied--in the field--by an increased presence of Le Pen cadres in anticipation of the cantonal elections of next March. Moreover, Le Pen can always tell himself that in October 1987--six months before the presidential election in which he obtained 14.39 percent of the votes--public support for his ideas was at the same level as today. [Box, p 8] Figures and Table of Organization The National Front claims to have 80,000 members. A total of 1,650 de jure delegates (members of the Political Bureau and of the Central Committee; members of regional councils; European deputies; and departmental secretaries) and officials elected by the departmental federations are scheduled to participate in the ninth party congress, to be held from 4 to 6 February. The Jurisdictions. The delegates to the party congress directly elect the president of the National Front. They also vote for the members of the 100-member Central Committee, and the president can personally appoint 20 additional delegates. The Central Committee then proceeds to elect the Political Bureau from a short list submitted by the president of the movement. The Leaders. Jean-Marie Le Pen has held the post of president of the National Front ever since the party was created in 1972, and is the sole candidate to succeed himself. He is surrounded by a vice president (Dominique Chaboche), a delegate general (Bruno Magret), and a secretary general (Carl Lang), all appointed by him. This executive bureau is scheduled to be "confirmed" in office. The political bureau, which by statute consists of 30 members, is to be "enlarged," probably to 35 members including Samuel Marechal, director of the National Front Youth organization. For his part, Roland Gaucher has not requested reappointment either to the Central Committee or to the Political Bureau. The Elected Officials. The National Front has 10 European deputies, who are members of the technical group of the European right-wing movements (14 seats). Although the party has no deputy or senator in the French Parliament, it won 239 seats in the 1992 regional elections--an increase of approximately 100 seats over the figure for the preceding election in 1986. Between the two elections the party lost more than one-quarter of its regional elected officials [as published]. It counts in its ranks three members of departmental councils (one in La Manche, one in Alpes-Maritimes, and one in Bouches-du-Rhone) and claims slightly fewer than 1,000 members of municipal councils. In a by-election, it lost the only city with a population of more than 10,000 that it governed: Saint-Gilles, in Gard Department. Table 1.
