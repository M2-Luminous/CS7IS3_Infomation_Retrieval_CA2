She has kindly accepted our request for a meeting. Lourdes, we have received many telephone calls since yesterday. I will summarize them so you can provide the answers. The people ask about possible programs for the elimination of public faucets; the outrageous prices charged for water supplied by water tank trucks in zones where there is no water -- people are really feeling the effects of this; and the possibility of repairing the cracks that have appeared at the Vento Canal. That is all for now. [Mijan] Well, referring to your first question, I must tell you we have a program for the elimination of public faucets. The program began many years ago with the creation of local aqueduct brigades in each of the people's councils. These local brigades began to work but their work is currently curtailed by the lack of resources. We expect to solve certain problems concerning the availability of materials for the aqueducts beginning the second semester of 1994 -- through a credit from France to the Institute of Hydraulic Resources. Some of our most critical problems involve the lack of galvanized pipes and copper pipes. I believe we are not in a much more critical situation thanks to the efforts exerted by the local aqueduct workers and the presidents of the people's councils, who strive to help us, as well as the industries, the aid, and all the other factors. We hope we will be able to have the minimum amount of materials in a short time to solve the most critical problems we have concerning public faucets on the streets. There is also a support program for the faucets installed in larger pipes. In fact, I can announce the Micons [Construction Ministry] will help us (?locate) some of the faucets installed in larger pipes. Specifically, the Micons delegation in Havana will help us solve the problem concerning faucets on the main pipe in Ariguanabo and the main pipe from El Gato acqueduct, which currently faces a critical situation. We are also preparing a program with the Institute for Hydraulic Resources and the Havana authorities to get some urgently needed resources. We expect this will be solved in a few days. Thus, we will recover the losses -- considerable losses -- currently experienced by the acqueduct. We believe this will improve the water supply to the city. [Gonzalez] What about the water tank trucks? [Mijan] The service rendered by the acqueduct's water tank trucks is free and anyone who violates this is liable to be fined and expelled from his post. The water tank trucks have a big sign which says free service and that is how it should be rendered. Many times they are not water tank trucks from the acqueduct and in other cases the people agree to pay a high price for the water -- yet they do not want to report the one who incurs in the violation. We urge the population to report the license plate, the driver's name, the information they can get; and we are willing to guarantee the people that we will strictly deal with whoever uses the people's needs to earn a profit. [Gonzalez] We believe you have been very considerate toward us but I would like an opportunity -- in a future meeting, in the near future -- to talk with someone from the sewer department to talk about a very unpleasant topic -- the (?holes) and drainage ditches we have all over the city. Is that possible? [Mijan] Of course. I think Engineer Carlos Menendez, our assistant director for sewers, would be willing to do that. We will instruct him to answer the questions you have from the people, from the program's listeners, on this topic, which is also an important topic and which affects the people very much. [Gonzalez] Very well. We believe you and we thank you very much for the time you have given us. We will talk about the Vento Canal on another occasion. It deserves a special time. We have not forgotten it. Well, that is all for today, my friends. We thank Lourdes Mijan for all the time she has granted us. She will return to the meeting from which we brought her out. We will return tomorrow.
