Jean-Bertrand Aristide, head of state legally elected during the 16 December 1990 elections, is not in Haiti. He is in Washington, the capital of another sovereign country. Yet, until now, he is acknowledged as president of the Republic of Haiti by all national and international authorities including the parliament, the Haitian Army, the churches, the private sector, the United Nations, the OAS, and so forth, says Sen. Parent. The question he has put to the Haitian Army, the parliament, the United Nations, the OAS, and the powers called Friends of Haiti is: Why is Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president of the Republic, not in Haiti today? Is he imprisoned in Washington as Toussaint Louverture was in Fort Joux [located in the Jura Mountains in France where Haitian General Toussaint Louverture died on 7 April 1803 after he had attempted to free Haiti from the French]? Only the United States can answer this question through the words of its President, Bill Clinton. At any rate, so far, the president of the Republic, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is not at the National Palace of Port-au-Prince, he adds. As for me, I say no, because this is an affront to all Haitians no matter whether they are rich or poor, black or mulatto, military or civilian. Is that what the so-called civilized people call the new world order? If so, is logic no longer the universal way to reason soundly, because I have a contrary opinion. Sen. Jean-Jacques Clark Parent further says: I therefore urge General Cedras to resign, as agreed in the Governors Island agreement; and I suggest that the Haitian Army, the institution intended to guarantee the safety of lives and property in the country, form within the next 72 hours a high-ranking civilian-military delegation charged with going to Washington in order to look for the president of the Republic, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and bring him [back] to the National Palace of Port-au-Prince so he can carry out his duties as president of the Republic under the security of the Haitian Armed Forces until his mandate expires so as to put an end to this unbearable situation gnawing at our country and it will be justice, concludes the statement of Jean-Jacques Clark Parent, senator of the Republic. Parent has sent this statement to Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Bill Clinton, the OAS, the United Nations, the governments of Haiti's four friendly countries, the U.S. Congress, the parliamentarians of the 45th legislature, the Army, all ambassadors accredited to Haiti, Pope John Paul II, the Haitian Episcopal Conference, the Association of Haitian Protestants, the members of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industries, the members of the judiciary, and the press.
