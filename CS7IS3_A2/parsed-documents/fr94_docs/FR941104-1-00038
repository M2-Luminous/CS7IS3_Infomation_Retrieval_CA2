FR941104-1-00038 FR941104-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 46 CFR Part 171 [CGD 94&hyph;010] RIN 2115&hyph;AE75 Standards for Damage Stability of New Domestic Passenger Vessels AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of public meeting; re-opening of comment period. SUMMARY: On August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40855), the Coast Guard proposed to amend the rules, on standards for damage stability, that it adopted on December 10, 1992. Amended rules are necessary to relieve certain vessels of an unforeseen regulatory burden. The proposed rules would relieve those vessels of that burden and yet minimize the potential for capsizing and other casualties caused by inadequate damage stability. To obtain further information from members of the regulated community and the general public, the Coast Guard will conduct a second public meeting and re-open the comment period on the amended rules. DATES: The meeting will be held December 1, 1994, from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Written material must be received not later than December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held in room 2415, Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street S.W., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. Written comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 Second Street S.W., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to room 3406 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Comments will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 3406, Coast Guard Headquarters, between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia L. Carrigan, Marine Technical and Hazardous Materials Division (G&hyph;MTH&hyph;3), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street S.W., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, telephone: (202) 267&hyph;2988, telefax: (202) 267&hyph;4816. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments The comment period for the amended rules is being extended to allow sufficient time for the public to review the report of the Department of Transportation Volpe Transportation Systems Center on the effect of the new damage stability rules on the domestic passenger vessel fleet. This detailed analysis of twenty-one domestic vessel designs was released in late September 1994, and a copy has been placed in this docket. Information on obtaining a copy of this report may be obtained by contacting the person listed above under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT . This notice extends the period for submission of comments on the proposed changes to 46 CFR 171.080(e) described in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40855). It is the Coast Guard's goal to implement regulations that will best address both the safety and the operational needs of all vessels. These standards were based on one developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for any passenger vessel allowed to carry 12 or more passengers on an international voyage (under a ``SOLAS Passenger Ship Certificate''). The Coast Guard again seeks advice from owners and operators of vessels and shipyards, and from naval architects, its own inspectors, classification societies' inspectors, consumers, crews of vessels, and others involved in the affected vessels' compliance with ยง171.080(e) as this proposed rule would amend it. Interested persons are invited and encouraged to participate by submitting written data views and arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice [CGD 94&hyph;010], identify the specific paragraph of the section to which each comment applies, and include supporting documents or sufficient detail to indicate the reason for each comment. The Coast Guard will acknowledge receipt of comments if a stamped, self-addressed post card or envelope is enclosed with the comments. Public Meeting Date The Coast Guard has determined that the opportunity to make further oral presentations will aid the rulemaking process and will hold a second public meeting from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on December 1, 1994, in room 2415 of Coast Guard Headquarters, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. With advance notice, and as time permits, members of the public may make oral presentations during the meeting. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should notify the person listed above under the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT no later than the day before the meeting. Written material may be submitted prior to, during, or after the meeting. Dated: October 27, 1994. J. C. Card, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27319 Filed 11&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;M
