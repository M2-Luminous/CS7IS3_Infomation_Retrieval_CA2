As we have meanwhile seen, not only that was a mirage. In Somalia, the United Nations has proven to be incompetent and has failed. The clan warfare does not give a damn about the blue helmets. In front of our door, in the former Yugoslavia, the Serbs show the United Nations to be a paper tiger and the European Union has even been ignored. The NATO ultimatum is the acid test there. The states in Central and East Europe are watching further developments with the utmost attention. Thus, it was high time that the Bundeswehr began its withdrawal from Belet Uen, which, for a long time, has stood in a very exposed position there. Each day in Somalia only endangers the soldiers' lives without bringing the country any closer to peace. Whoever thinks that there will now also be an end to the domestic debate on future peacemaking Bundeswehr operations has not understood anything at all. The Germans cannot simply take leave of the duties and rights they assumed prior to reunification. The German declaration of joining the United Nations did not speak of any reservations.
