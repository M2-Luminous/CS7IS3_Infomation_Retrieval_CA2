In an interview with journalists on Tuesday, Shumeyko said that the group has worked out a draft agenda which includes five points, namely: the electoral procedure and election of the chairman of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's new parliament, and his deputies, the approval of the list of committees of the upper house and their formation, the procedural regulations and life-support system. Shumeyko added that most disputes were caused by disagreement among the group members over what should be discussed first: the procedural regulations or the elections. Shumeyko pointed out that under the constitution there should be no joint sessions of the State Duma, the lower house of the Federal Assembly, and the Federation Council. However, Russian President Boris Yeltsin is likely to address both houses after which they will adjourn to seat separately. As for the candidate to the post of the chairman of the Federation Council, Shumeyko said "it is too early to speak about that, at least until electoral procedures are defined." He confirmed that the first session of the upper house will be held in the building of the former House of the Russian Press at Pushkinskaya Street 26. "By all standards this building suits perfectly for normal work of the upper house. The president's order should be fulfilled unswervingly," he said.
