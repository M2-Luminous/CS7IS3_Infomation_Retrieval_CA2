On 15 December they celebrated the success of their seven years of negotiations about new free trade rules, which was hardly considered still possible. Exactly four months later, next Friday [15 April], they want to sign the new 550-page treaty in Marrakesh, Morocco. However, it was just last Friday that the danger was averted that they would quarrel for days before the final celebration, as if the agreement of mid-December had not been achieved at all. In the hectic negotiations of the past days in Geneva, nothing less was the issue than a decision on political direction. At the beginning of next year, GATT, which is only an agreement, as its name implies, will turn into the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will have far more powers. The WTO will not only have more power, granted to it by the treaty, to implement the new free trade regulations. As Brussels Foreign Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan says, it will "probably also develop into the decisive forum of international discussion about all economic problems," some sort of international security council for international economic policy. The supporting pillars of international economic and trade relations include -- and this is something that the industrial West agrees on in principle -- human rights, environmental protection, and a minimum of decent work conditions. GATT Secretary General Peter Sutherland is currently having the text of the apolitical statement polished, which is solemnly to order the WTO to work out comprehensive economic policy rules of behavior. In the meantime, the United States and France are racing ahead in an unusual alliance. In Marrakesh they want to set down that the validity of the newly adopted free trade regulations depends on the preservation of future social and environmental standards. This enrages the GATT majority of the Third World, because they fear protectionism by the West against them, which might enter through the back door. The United States and the French want to be able to close off access to the markets for products that, for instance, have been produced by children or prisoners or are kept cheap through extremely low wages. They argue that there cannot be any free markets for dangerous waste or for products that have the ozone-killing chlorofluorocarbons as an ingredient, or for deals that eradicate species of fauna. The Third World does not fundamentally oppose such principles, but it wants to talk about it and not have it hang like the sword of Damocles over its exports from the outset. In the European Union the majority are willing to give the developing countries and, above all, the emerging industrialized countries in Asia every guarantee that the minimum regulation of environmental protection and decent working conditions, which are included in GATT, will not provide an excuse for protectionism. However, France and the United States are drawing a line of tolerance. The French have always believed that their ideas about fair foreign trade can be better implemented through a network of bilateral agreements than through the classical multilateral free trade rules of GATT, and the current Clinton Administration in Washington is most profoundly convinced of that. After all, the United States has its experiences with Japan, and the French can point to the single market. Basically, what is important for them is the command of reciprocity. Countries open their markets only for those that also do so, and they let competition between them have free reign only if they compete with relatively similar costs. On the single market reciprocity has been implemented virtually 100 percent. Thus, the member states of the European Union are in free competition with one another and, therefore, there is no resistance to the single market. GATT, however, is far from that. However, this will not last long. The WTO is to build a bridge between the followers of bilateral "managed trade" and those of worldwide free markets. It is to link the classical "free trade" with "fair trade." Therefore, it must be equipped with instruments, at least rudimentarily, which the United States and the European Union have; otherwise the two economic powers would not renounce the use of their own instruments. This is the philosophy behind the WTO's mechanisms for settling quarrels, to which every member state has to subordinate itself in the future, just as, in addition, to the Ministers' Conference, which meets every two years and can adopt decisions with a three-quarter majority. Thus, the WTO is modeled a little along the lines of the Council of Ministers in Brussels, and this is what France likes. The United States, on the other hand, would not have given up its "Super 301," if all the partner states in GATT were not committed to adjusting their laws to the Geneva regulations. The "Section 301" in U.S. trade law serves the purpose of threatening other countries with import quotas if they do not open their markets. As of 1995 the WTO will take over its task of enforcing reciprocity. At the moment the European Union can still ignore the Geneva free trade rules and enforce its banana market order, which is against the rules. As of next year, it will not be able to. When the Uruguay Round began in 1986, no one was thinking of the WTO. When has it ever been the case that international politics achieved more than it intended?
