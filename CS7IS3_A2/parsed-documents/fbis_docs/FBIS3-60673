Located in east China's Zhejiang Province, the plant has generated a total of 1.62 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since the beginning of this year. According to a plant executive, the plant is currently in trial operation, producing 7.2 million kilowatt-hours every day. The official said that the 300,000-kilowatt plant has generated a total of 2.14 billion kilowatt-hours since it opened two years ago. The plant has helped ease an energy shortage in east China, one of the country's fastest growing areas, he said. The central government has approved a plan for the plant's second phase of construction, which will include the installation of two 600,000-kw generating units, he said. A senior official at the Beijing-based China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) said that the government plans to build a group of new nuclear power plants around the Qinshan area. China currently has two nuclear power plants. The second reactor is located in Dayawan (Daya Bay), in southern Guangdong Province, and is about 50 kilometers northeast of Hong Kong. The Dayawan Plant's first generating set of 900,000 kws went into operation at the end of August this year.
