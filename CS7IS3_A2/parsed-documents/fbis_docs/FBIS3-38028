Although the "Alliance" has already been dubbed "Rutskoy's presidential party," the activist, who asked not to be identified by name "because of a gentlemen's agreement with comrades," said that Aleksandr Rutskoy is seen as leader "only prospectively," but generally "he is not going to matter." Over several months of efforts to create the "Alliance" the organizers did manage to keep their part of the bargain in the "gentlemen's agreement" and to ensure a certain secrecy of the project. Only one of the technical organizers -- former Supreme Soviet member Andrey Golovin -- spilled the beans, saying that its "founders" were virtually all the participants in what have of late become traditional "centrist `roundtables'" in the Gorbachev Fund -- among them Valeriy Zorkin, ex-chairman of the Constitutional Court; Aleksandr Tsipko, a Gorbachev Fund expert; and ex-deputy Oleg Rumyantsev, "who worked in the White House till the end." Organizers decline to name their other comrades-in-arms, pleading that "too important names" are involved. Andrey Golovin said that the "charter fund" of the new organization alone "is a matter of tens of millions of dollars." Valeriy Khomyakov, who resigned as Democratic Party of Russia executive committee chairman, voiced a guess that "Tsipko of the Gorbachev Fund is not present there for nothing." The abovementioned activist agreed to give a "general outline" of the organization's immediate plans: "We already have in place the structure and theoretical tenets, and we are going over to practical actions. I promise that everybody will hear about the `Alliance' in three to four weeks from now." "The decisive moment," according to him, has been slated for late March and early April. He vouched, however, that "there would no longer be blood, and whatever happens will follow the October 1964 scenario." Recall that there was a peaceful party coup during the 1964 party plenum in October when Nikita Khrushchev was ousted as a result of an internal conspiracy by his closest comrades in arms.
