At the news conference held in the republic of Srpska presidency and also attended by Nikola Koljevic, the vice president [of the republic of Srpska], and Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the [republic of Srpska] people's assembly, in response to today's massacre at the market in the center of Sarajevo, Gvero stated certain facts that cause suspicion that the entire massacre was staged. On the basis of film material recorded at the market, Gen. Gvero said it is obvious that there a lot of injuries to legs and lower parts of the body. It is incredible that market stools, and even bottles and eggs on sale, remained undamaged, as the film material confirms. Those, and some other facts, point to the possibility that this was a planted explosive device, Gvero said. Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik said that today's massacre was a "blow to the attempt to establish peace in this area." We heard the news during a meeting with the Muslim delegation at Sarajevo airport, where we discussed humanitarian issues and ways of restoring trust, within the framework of preparations for the next round of talks in Geneva. Krajisnik expressed condolences to the families of the victims in today's massacre and said that the Serb side would make sure that all circumstances behind this crime were examined and its culprits uncovered and punished. "We do not have one single reason for applying such terrible methods," said Nikola Koljevic. "We are doing everything in our power in order to resolve the crisis by political means, restore trust, and begin talks regarding all matters, from political to humanitarian, but it is obvious that some factors are not interested in peace," said Koljevic.
