"Wooden boxes" was tersely written on the declaration of goods that the driver presented. However, the German customs officers became suspicious and had a closer look at the 166 boxes. They contained carbines, guns, machine guns, semiautomatic guns, ammunition, and parts of weapons. The destination would have been a commercial firm in North Rhine-Westphalia. The freight was confiscated and criminal proceedings were instituted against the "receiver" and the truck driver.
