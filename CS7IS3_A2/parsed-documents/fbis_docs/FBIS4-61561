This, it is said, is for his link with the Russian special services, which caused unprecedented damage to U.S. security. We have managed to obtain some of A. Ames' statements from competent sources. Here they are -- at first hand, as the saying goes. In a statement in court Ames sharply criticized the government in connection with the fact the unprecedented pressure which it brought to bear on his wife, Rosario Ames, in fact pushing her to perjure herself. (It is known that the authorities tried to accuse her of complicity in espionage). Noting that he deeply regrets the grief he has caused his family, Ames said: "I managed for seven and one half of my 10 years' cooperation with the KGB and the Foreign Intelligence Service to conceal the fact successfully from my wife. When Rosario, as a result of a mistake I made, found out about my criminal activity, she demanded I break off relations with the Russians. I was able to put the necessary pressure on her, right up to blackmail, to defer that step." Explaining the reasons why he passed on to the KGB information about CIA agents and other intelligence departments, Ames noted: "First at the time I disagreed with the strengthening of the extreme right-wing forces in our political spectrum and with U.S. policy in the field of ensuring national security and in the international sphere. Second, I had reached the conclusion that espionage as it was practised by the CIA and some other U.S. departments has been and remains cheating in the interests of a group of careerist bureaucrats who are successfully misleading several generations of U.S. politicians and citizens regarding the need for and value of their work. There has not been and is not any justifiable need to have thousands of intelligence officers and tens of thousands of agents throughout the world, particularly in friendly countries. The information received by our vast network of agents at the cost of considerable human and moral efforts is mostly of no special importance and does not meet politicians' requirements. "Thanks to the efforts of the CIA and the FBI the leadership had a very good idea of the real state of affairs in the special services of the 'Soviet bloc' countries. Nonetheless, on the pretext of the need to conceal from the enemy the true scale of our agents' penetration of those states' special organs, for decades it instilled unbridled hysteria over the aggressiveness of their intelligence services." Does that mean that CIA supermen exist only in movie thrillers? After all, Ames alone instilled such fear that the entire "collective" of the formidable department was forced to take a lie detector test. You feel sorry for the boys....
