In a statement to the Yemeni news agency, the military source said the report was not only absolutely untrue, but it was further evidence of the bankruptcy of the media of the Sanaa gang and a reflection of its political and military bankruptcy. Indeed, its lies will fluctuate within a day or two. The source went on to say: We wish to confirm for the 20th time that the fighting is taking place in between the two parts of Yemen, hundreds of kilometers away from Aden. The foreign journalists, let alone the residents of Aden, can confirm that. The military source concluded its statement differentiates between artillery shelling and missiles. The military source also advised the foreign news media to be precise and seek information from reliable sources instead of from the information kitchen of the adventurous al-Ahmar family.
