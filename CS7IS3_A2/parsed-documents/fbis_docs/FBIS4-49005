During his stay here, Lu Ping will also meet with Hong Kong deputies to the people's congress, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] committee, representatives of grass-roots masses, and public figures from all walks of life. Since Chris Patten has upset the process of convergence with the Basic Law and is unilaterally enforcing his constitutional reform program, China now harbors no illusions about him. The Chinese side is instead working in a down-to-earth manner to achieve a stable transition and is widely soliciting opinions among the Hong Kong people. A stable transition would be impossible in the late transitional period without Hong Kong people's participation, their ideas and wisdom, and their joint efforts as the masters of the city. Only by closely relying on the Hong Kong people, listening to their appeals, and getting familiar with the actual operation of this city, will the Chinese side be able to formulate a complete transition program which conforms with the Basic Law and suits both the historical conditions and present reality of Hong Kong. Although Lu Ping's stay in Hong Kong would only be a very short one, it is believed that he will try his best to meet as many Hong Kong people as possible and to listen to as many valuable views as possible from the Hong Kong people. As for Chris Patten's expressed hope for a meeting with Lu Ping, because Lu's schedule will be tight this time, it is believed that this can be postponed to a later, more appropriate time. China is relying on the Hong Kong people as the force supporting the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and safeguarding the territory's prosperity and stability. No matter how Chris Patten is trying to undermine convergence in the constitutional system by playing the "international card" and attempting to drain Hong Kong of its economic resources, China has the confidence in and the ability to ensure a stable transition and the implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong, as long as it can enlist the Hong Kong people's support. Therefore, it is essential for the Chinese side to keep informed of local circumstances and public opinion in Hong Kong. Chris Patten said he would roll out the red carpet for Lu Ping and that he is willing to meet with Lu Ping. This is nothing but another "political show" of a perfidious politician. Chris Patten does not have the slightest sincerity about keeping his promise. He ignored the agreements reached between China and Britain; when China and Britain were about to conclude a first-stage agreement on the constitutional matter, he insistently "derailed" the process; and he has time and again breached faith, undermined cooperation, and spoiled the atmosphere for meeting. Even if Lu Ping were to meet with him for one or two hours during his stay here, what would be the use? Will Chris Patten assist China in ensuring a stable transition? No, he will not. Not long ago, the PWC expressed the hope of hearing the Hong Kong civil servants' opinions on a stable transition, and it was Chris Patten who deprived the civil servants of the opportunity to voice their opinions before the PWC. If we want to ensure the stable transfer of civil servants, then it is essential for us to hear their opinions. Chris Patten has not only tried to bar civil servants from voicing their opinions, but has also belittled the status of the PWC in every aspect through his henchmen mouthpieces. Now that Lu Ping, in the capacity of vice chairman and secretary general of the PWC, is coming to Hong Kong to solicit opinions, is Chris Patten going to change his attitude? If he does not change his attitude, then what is the use of a meeting? Let us take the implementation of the memorandum of understanding on the new airport project as an example. Up to now the issue has remained unsolved simply because Chris Patten has deliberately breached the commitment of not leaving a financial burden for the special administrative region [SAR] government and not letting the total amount of debt exceed 5 billion Hong Kong dollars. Furthermore, he has been trying to have his project approved on a piecemeal basis. As long as he does not change his stand, the obstacle to cooperation on the airport project issue will still be there. Negotiations between the two sides will produce a positive outcome only if he changes his stand. In citing the memorandum of understanding, this perfidious politician would only expose his hypocrisy and remind people of who has actually violated the agreement. There are many channels for consultation between the Chinese and British sides, including the joint liaison group, the expert groups, and contacts between the political adviser to the Hong Kong Government and the External Affairs Department of the XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong branch. Chris Patten quite simply is not using these channels of communication and instead is insisting on holding talks with Lu Ping, despite the latter's tight schedule in Hong Kong. This clearly implies that he is "playing a trick." In order to alleviate the pressure that he is facing in political circles at home, Chris Patten purposely granted an interview to the GUARDIAN in late April. He misinterpreted facts in an attempt to cheat the British electorate and mislead the public, saying that the Chinese side "has relaxed its stance" and some recent moves by the Chinese side have proven the correctness of his prediction. To prove his talent for telling lies, he is now brazenly putting on a show and insisting on meeting with his counterpart. If his little trick had worked, of course he would loudly boast that his confrontation of the Chinese side has done no harm to Sino-British relations, and that China is dancing according to his "lead." If his trick were to fail, he would say that he does not mind losing face. This is a common trick frequently played by charlatans. To deal with this kind of brazen ploy, the Chinese side of course needs to be somewhat serious. You want a meeting, well, there will be plenty of opportunities in the days to come. But, first of all, for your part, you must create a good atmosphere for a meeting, simply making empty talk through "megaphone diplomacy" does not work. As far as economic affairs and the people's livelihood are concerned, China will certainly take the Hong Kong people's interests into account. Evidence of this is the recent agreement on increasing land leases to keep down property prices. The consultations were conducted through the land committee, which is a good example of cooperation. Chris Patten, as the chief executive officer, should do a solid job and take measures to keep property prices down after land leases are increased. This is his duty. If he takes no action but is busy at home making visits with the aim of keeping abreast with the latest political developments in Britain and paving the way for his return to Westminster, then he will convince no one, even if he repeats ten thousand times his claim that he is working "for the Hong Kong people's interests." By asking to "discuss the property price issue with the Chinese side," the man seems to imply that the Chinese side must share the blame if the British side cannot solve the problem. Is this not too cunning a ploy?
