At a public plaza gathering, which occupied the five blocks west of the National University (UNA), the PUSC candidate said education is the instrument that permitted the country to achieve its current living standards. Rodriguez guaranteed his supporters, who waited for two and a half hours in the middle of a chilly January day, that preschool education will be implemented nationwide and primary education will be improved. In that sense he insisted that he will give students opportunities through student bonds and high school education scholarships. He vowed to strengthen this sector as well as education in arts and crafts schools. He stressed that his administration will totally fulfill the financial agreement for state superior education so that universities and businesses can jointly carry out investigations that will net revenues. In the area of coffee plantations, Rodriguez criticized the departure of former Finance Minister Fernando Naranjo, who is now a Liberal Party leader and who left his post because he refused to reduce the coffee tax. He underscored that the current administration, on the contrary, created the coffee fund for $665 million colones, which permitted 5,000 families in Heredia to face the international market price crisis. Most of the speakers who preceded him attacked opposition Liberal Party candidate Jose Maria Figueres and appealed to honest Liberal Party members to vote for the PUSC in the coming elections. Among the speakers who preceded Rodriguez was Gujillermo Chacon, candidate for province alderman; Sergio Salazar, deputy candidate; political leader Bernardo Benavides; former Security Minister Victor Emilio Herrera; former presidential candidate Juan Jose Trejos; Mabel Nieto, candidate for second vice president; and Abel Pacheco, candidate for first vice president. The rally was also attended by Deputy Danilo Chaverri, former President Mario Echandi, and Lorena Clare, the presidential hopeful's wife.
