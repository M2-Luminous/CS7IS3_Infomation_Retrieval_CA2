After the meeting Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel stated that the coalition agreed that the Anti-Crime Law should be adopted as quickly as possible. This law is to be discussed at its third hearing in the Bundestag this week. Among other things, the coalition politicians discussed drug policy after the ruling of the Constitutional Court that, even though the possession of small amounts of cannabis products, such as hashish and marijuana is not permitted, criminal prosecution of such cases should be left to the discretion of the public prosecutor's offices. In Krumsiek's view, this ruling by the judges in Karlsruhe also covers his plan to no longer make the possession of small amounts of heroin and cocaine liable to criminal prosecution. This has been opposed, above all, by Internal Affairs State Secretary Eduard Lintner (Christian Social Union), the Federal Government's drug expert.
