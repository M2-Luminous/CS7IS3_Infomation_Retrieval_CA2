Zhou expressed his confidence on behalf of the central bank at a press conference held by the ongoing session of the National People's Congress (NPC) here today. He said that, since China adopted a unified exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and major foreign currencies on January 1, the exchange rate has remained stable -- 8.7 yuan to the U.S. dollar -- and the country's foreign exchange reserve has seen a sharp increase. Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli disclosed yesterday that the country's foreign exchange reserve now stands at 27.2 billion U.S. dollars. On the possibility of foreign banks in China dealing in the local currency, Zhou said: "Conditions are not ripe yet." He gave three reasons for this. First, tax rates for Chinese banks and their foreign counterparts in China are different at present -- higher rates for the former would make competition unfair; second, China has yet to convert banks into purely commercial institutions, though their conversion is in the pipeline; and third, the country has yet to formulate laws governing banking activities. However, Zhou said, China is creating required conditions. He listed work being done in this direction. It includes the formulation late this year of a central bank law, a commercial bank law, a securities law, a bills law, an insurance law and a series of banking regulations. He said related experiments are being done in a few selected joint Sino-foreign banks to gain experience. On the central bank's role in the field of macro-controls, Zhou said it is adopting a "steady" policy, explaining that it "will neither squeeze nor loosen credit." "For this year," he said, "the increase of total money supply over last year will be controlled at between 23-24 percent." Last year, money supply went up 25 percent from the previous year. China's banking order has turned for the better since the second half of last year, after the introduction of tightened macro-controls. In the first two months, people's savings deposits increased by a big margin, and recovery of all the money released immediately before the Spring Festival is expected before the end of March, he said.
