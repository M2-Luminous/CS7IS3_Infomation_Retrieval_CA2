Regarding the rumor that the U.S. will lift its trade embargo on Vietnam, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: [Begin Ho The Lan recording] A REUTER correspondent asked: Does Vietnam expect the United States to lift the embargo in the near future? And does Vietnam want President Clinton to take action in line with the 27 January U.S. Senate vote in favor of lifting the embargo? Moreover, correspondents from the Australian ABC, ITAR-TASS, and KYODO asked about Vietnam's reaction to the CBS and CNN reports on 1 February that President Clinton has decided to lift the embargo against Vietnam and that an official announcement will be made on 4 February. In answer to these questions, I would like to repeat that in recent days there were many rumors about the United States planning to lift the embargo soon. I would like to say that I would welcome President Clinton's decision to lift the embargo on Vietnam because it is a decision that suits the actual situation and the aspirations of the two peoples and the world community, and it is a decision that is expected by world public opinion. I also received a telophone call from a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent asking whether lifting of the U.S. embargo would be good news to Vietnam and the United States. I answered that it would be good news, because it is not only good news for both Vietnam and the United States but for the entire world community, too. The same correspondent further asked if, following the lifting of the embargo, U.S. companies would be welcomed in Vietnam. I answered that Vietnam always welcomes U.S. companies and those from other countries to do business and invest in Vietnam on the basis of equality and mutual interests. [end recording] At the same news conference, correspondents from AFP, REUTER, and ITAR-TASS asked about Vietnam's reaction on the U.S. State Department report on human rights dated 1 February. The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that to ensure human rights in each nation is the authority and responsibility of that country. In Vietnam, although the country is facing numerous difficulties, the Vietnamese Government has made great efforts to satisfactorily ensure the Vietnamese citizens' rights in the economic, social, cultural, civil, and political domains. Based on our efforts, I may say that the 1 February U.S. State Department report on human rights was not objective enough. Correspondents from ITAR-TASS and the VIETNAM INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS journal asked for comments on the news report that China and Taiwan are cooperating in exploring areas around the Spratly Islands and that Taiwan has planned to build an airport, a seaport, and a lighthouse in area of these islands; our Foreign Ministry spokesperson said: The Spratly and Paracel Islands belong to Vietnam, and as a result, Taiwan's bilateral act has violated Vietnam's sovereignty and has further complicated the situation in the region.
