The visit, according to these sources, was more than just a mediation mission to resolve the Yemeni crisis which has reached a difficult stage. The sources, who met Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih last week, told AKHIR KHABAR that the Yemeni leadership asked al-Sharif Zayd to help it reorganize the Yemeni Armed Forces which appear to be gradually affected by the ongoing tribal and party conflict in Yemen. Al-Sharif Zayd will supervise the drafting of a plan to reorganize the Yemeni Armed Forces which are facing technical problems in terms of organization, training, general mobilization, and combat capabilities. Our sources added that al-Sharif Zayd was accompanied by a number of specialists who reviewed the plan with the Yemeni leadership. The sources added that the Yemeni president officially asked the Jordanian leadership to prepare such a plan. The Jordanian leadership held contacts with all parties to find common grounds that would defuse the crisis before it explodes. Last week, the two parties to the Yemeni dispute agreed to neutralize the Armed Forces and to avoid the provocations that would involve them in the conflict. Yemeni diplomatic sources in Amman told AKHIR KHABAR that the Yemeni leadership explained to mediators that it wants to remove the roots of division which threaten the Yemeni Army ranks following the emergence of signs of division. The sources added: The Yemeni leadership is unanimous on the need to carry out a comprehensive national military orientation plan and to busy the Armed Forces with military training to keep them away from tension points that would affect them as a result of the tribal conflict. The sources linked the recent Jordanian-Yemeni contacts with the new trends produced by military incidents and tension. The sources said: The Jordanian assistance in this regard will come within the framework of the vital and important role played by the Jordanian leadership which enjoys the confidence of all parties in the conflict.
