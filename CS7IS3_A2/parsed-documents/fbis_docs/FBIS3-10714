At a discreet ceremony held this afternoon in the Carondelet Palace, the seat of the Ecuadoran Government, Duran Ballen appointed and swore in Armando Espinel to replace Carlos Vera. The Information and Tourism Ministry post was created on 10 August 1992 when Duran Ballen's administration began. Its first minister was Pedro Zambrano, who died in 1992 in an airplane accident in Quito. Former Minister Carlos Vera was at the palace to turn over the post to Espinel, a renowned businessmen in national and international tourist circles. After 14 months at the head of the ministry, Vera resigned on 22 February due to public differences with Vice President Alberto Dahik. The differences came to light when Dahik said the government was studying a plebiscite to learn of the people's opinion about possible reforms to the Constitution. Vera expressed his disagreement and argued that the announcement of such a significant topic should be exclusively reserved for the president. At the transfer-of-command ceremony, Duran-Ballen denied rumors about the possible elimination of the Information and Tourism Ministry. The president announced that the ministry will be restructured and tourist development efforts will be promoted on an international level. He said that the Press Office of the Presidency will be in charge of information and attention to media representatives until a special office is created for that purpose. Espinel is an experienced businessman who has connections with the tourist sector in Ecuador and abroad. Among the relevant posts he has held is that of president of the Tourism Conference of Latin America.
