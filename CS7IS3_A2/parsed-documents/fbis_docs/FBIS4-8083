NATO aircraft have just attacked Serb positions again around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. This news has not been officially confirmed yet by the United Nations. Some hours ago, the UN special representative for Bosnia was warning that new air strikes were possible in case of threats against the safe havens. Yasushi Akashi was speaking in Paris. Shortly after the Atlantic Alliance apparently carried out a second air strike against the surrounding Serb positions, shelling the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. More details with Denis Hourdan: [Hourdan] It seems that NATO planes are carrying out new air strikes on Serb positions around Gorazde. For the time being UN official spokesmen in Sarajevo refuse to confirm the news given by a UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] civilian who was in General Rose's command post in Sarajevo. This UN official told us that new raids were under way after this morning's heavy shelling of Gorazde. Serbs first targetted Gorazde hospital, and then the residence of UN military observers. This latest move apparently prompted NATO's latest raid. NATO dispatched planes that identified targets. The United Nations refuses to confirm that the planes fired, but apparently new air strikes took place. [passage omitted]
