There was no word at press time whether the Peronist candidate planned to resign as well from her post as president of the PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] pensioners' health care service. Menendez, under fire since a bribery scandal involving PAMI erupted in late February, said in a letter to the local branch of the Justicialist Party that she had never been one to cling "either to candidacies or to personal political ambitions." She said she was stepping down to concentrate on setting "the actions under investigation." [passage omitted]
