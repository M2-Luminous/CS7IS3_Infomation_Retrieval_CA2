FBIS3-4884 "dreas041__a94015" FBIS-EAS-94-041-A Document Type:Daily Report 2 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Thorough Check of Hosokawa-Sagawa Ties Urged OW0203020894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0203020894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] To get to the bottom of the issue concerning Prime Minister Hosokawa's borrowing 100 million yen [Y] from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., the House of Representatives Budget Committee has recently decided that, in accordance with Article 104 of the Diet law, it will exercise the right of investigation in relation to government to call on such organs as the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office to submit documents retained from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. However, the government has indicated it will reject the call. In response, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has strongly reacted to the government's attitude. Regarding the government's attitude as "a serious infringement on the right of investigation and an act of overriding the Diet's authority," the LDP plans to persistently call on the government to turn in documents. At the same time, if the government rejects the call, the LDP plans to increase its call for summoning Mr. Masatoshi Fukayama, former official secretary of the prime minister, to appear in the Diet. Since the Diet adopted the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, which the government believes will contribute to boosting the domestic economy, the LDP intends to demand a thorough investigation of suspicion attached to the prime minister during the course of Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget bill. In addition, with regard to the issue concerning the father-in- law of the prime minister's suspected dealings in a large quantity of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone [NTT] Corp stocks, the LDP thinks that "one person who greatly profited from NTT stocks transactions might have been the prime minister himself." For that reason, the LDP plans to take up this issue and call for summoning an investment consultant allegedly involved in the transactions in addition to Mr. Fukayama, the prime minister's former secretary. On the issue of the prime minister's pecuniary relation with Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., attention has been focused on whether the prime minister really returned Y100 million to Sagawa Kyubin. In this connection, at the last extraordinary Diet session, the prime minister submitted to a board of directors of the Budget Committees of both the House of Representative and the House of Councillors six "related documents proving that the money was all returned." However, the LDP said that "it is hard to believe that the submitted documents are real documents," and called on the government to submit the originals, which the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office confiscated from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., in accordance with Article 104 of the Diet law which allows the Diet to "demand the government and public agencies submit reports or documents." Although the ruling parties first indicated it would reject the LDP's demand, an agreement was eventually reached via mediation of Yamaguchi, House of Representatives Budget Committee chairman (who belongs to the Social Democratic Party of Japan), between the ruling parties and the opposition camp at the House of Representatives Budget Committee session held on 22 February on exercising the right of investigation in relation to government. In response, however, the Justice Ministry has shown its intention not to accept the Budget Committee's demand on the grounds that "since the case involving Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. is under trial, submission of documents will impede further investigations." Justice Minister Mikazuki told a news conference held after a 25 February Cabinet meeting that "documents have been gathered in accordance with the Criminal Procedures Act, and submitting them may impede further investigations, affect trials, or disturb the privacy of people concerned," thus indicating a stand of rejecting the demand. Such a reaction of the Justice Ministry has invited the LDP's objection. The LDP stresses that "we cannot accept such a manner which infringes the Diet's right of investigation in relation to the government." The LDP views that "the ruling parties must have known that the government would reject the call, and with this in mind, they have agreed on exercising Article 104 of the Diet law." In this way, the LDP is increasingly dissatisfied with the ruling parties' manner. For that reason, within the LDP, there has emerged a hardline view saying that "at Diet sessions on the fiscal 1994 budget bill, the LDP should not cooperate in promoting deliberations on the bill until the Diet summoning of Mr. Fukayama is held" (according to a senior Diet Affairs Committee member).
