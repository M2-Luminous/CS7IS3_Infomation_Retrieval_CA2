This is why we chose to make it public as soon as we were able to fully authenticate it through the anonymous sources that conveyed it to us and the experts whom we consulted. Everyone agreed it was either a document written by the SL leader himself or a transcript of Abimael Guzman's [AG] report to the leadership meeting of this subversive group at the Callao Naval Base [the prison where they are being held]. In any case it was clearly our duty to make the document public, given the mantle of silence that the government has cast over negotiations in which the future of all Peruvians is at stake and about which nothing is reported probably in keeping with Fujimori's "do first, announce later" approach which has greatly harmed our democracy in the past few years. First, the document makes it clear that as far as AG is concerned the required peace agreement does not imply a demobilization and a surrendering of arms. AG sees the signing of the peace agreement as a kind of armed truce, a halt along a road which may last 10 or 15 years, after which -- "having strengthened its links with the masses" -- the SL would resume its bloodbath. Therefore, the agreement in question has nothing to do with the quest for peace in Peru the way most Peruvians see it. There is a reason for this: The fundamentalist leader -- and probably the other SL leaders that follow him -- believe that this armed gang has not been defeated either militarily or ideologically. This means the defeats the group has been experiencing since 1988 are mere setbacks in a long-term struggle. These setbacks are serious and have led the SL to lose some ground -- as AG himself admits by stating that the conditions essential for the "victory of the popular struggle" are no longer present -- but this cannot be looked upon as a defeat. Let us make it clear that AG scornfully relegates the change in what marxists call "favorable objective international conditions" to the sixth place ("it is a necessary element but not the main one," he adds), rating it well below the problems created for the SL following the arrest of its top deity and most of its leadership. In sum, displaying very little modesty, the lack of a "proletarian leadership" which "will take some time to resolve" (which tells us, by the way, that AG does not consider his life sentence as definitive) is blamed for the setback. At the same time, AG's disdain for the performance of SL's "hard" faction led by Feliciano [Oscar Ramirez Durand, top SL leader in Ayacucho] clearly indicate a split in the terrorist group and a lack of communication between the two factions. We unable to do so, but it should be established whether this lack of communication is circumstantial (some SL leaders are in prison while others are free) or deliberate. In the latter case we would be dealing with a splinter faction led by Feliciano which has decided to pay no heed to Guzman's directives. But AG views "Feliciano's faction" as recoverable, as can be deduced from one of AG's political conclusions which states that the "struggle between two factions" should seek unity, adding that "one must work to keep the scattering of forces to the bare minimum." The document adds, however, that "we should be prepared for the possibility that only a few of us will be left," and "those will be the most tested ones." Once again, it is implied that defeat is out of the question and that AG will play an active role and exercising leadership from inside prison (undoubtedly the government has created circumstances to make this possible). Finally, it should be noted that AG suggests "changing our language," adding that diplomatic talks are underway between the SL and the Armed Forces through the government. Aside from his strong disdain for Fujimori's administration (which he treats as a mere go-between), AG continues to hang on to his long-standing obsession that it all comes down to a clash between two military forces, disregarding everything about the civilian institutional order that gets caught in the middle. Paradoxically enough, this disregard for the institutions is what the SL has in common with Fujimori's administration. This is an initial evaluation of the document, which undoubtedly lends itself to further analysis. The important point right now is to unveil the dangerous tactics of Fujimori's administration implemented through the publication of AG's letters and their obvious manipulation for electoral reasons during the campaign for the referendum. Various circles share the opinion that Fujimori's administration is trying to bring about a peace agreement with the SL without realizing that it is playing into the hands of SL's top leader, who has been put back into circulation in a very obvious effort to prove that he is still at the helm of the subversive gang. In other words, President Fujimori is laboring under the pressure of his own promise that the SL will be defeated by 1995 and is beginning to feel that he is running out of time in his quest for this trump card which can get him reelected. AG knows this very well and he is trying to take the best possible advantage of the president's haste. The risks that this situation poses are obvious: A peace agreement is already being discussed although armed actions have not been suspended and nobody is talking about laying down arms, thus a truce that will last a few years is being misrepresented as real peace. Furthermore, all the latest documents of the SL address the need to "lay the foundation for the second congress" of the subversive gang. This obviously implies that the SL will continue to operate even if it has to do so under the until now abhorred guise of a political party. Should this be the case the "strengthening of the links with the masses" will simply mean preparing them for the future uprising. We believe the time has come for Fujimori's administration to explain to the country the status of its negotiations with the SL leadership. It is obvious that it is not necessary to disclose the details of these negotiations. The citizenry, however, must understand the goals of these talks because this SL document leaves the impression that -- perhaps involuntarily -- the government is helping the man who has caused more deaths, sorrow and destruction than anyone else in Peru, to achieve his sinister objectives.
