SUMMARY: In accordance with Section 1176 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, the Department of the Army is proposing to amend the regulations governing eligibility for interment in Arlington National Cemetery to include former prisoners of war (POWs).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of the Army is proposing changes to 32 CFR Part 553 in accordance with section 1176 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;160. That Section extended eligibility for interment in Arlington National Cemetery to any former prisoner of war who, while a prisoner of war, served honorably in the active military, naval, or air service and who dies on or after the date of enactment of the 1994 Authorization Act (November 30, 1993). This proposed rule governs eligibility for interment in Arlington National Cemetery, an Army national cemetery which is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army. Because the proposed rule pertains to a military function of the Department of the Army, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. It is hereby certified that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on small business or governments in the area. Lists of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 553 Cemeteries, National Cemeteries.
