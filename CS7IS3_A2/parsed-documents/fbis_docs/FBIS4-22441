This marks the beginning of the development of this high capacity and reliably protected network, which makes it possible to significantly expand information exchange. In order to give a more complete visual representation, the first, premiere, communications session was set up between two audiences which had gathered in these two cities. Greeting his colleague, Anatoliy Sobchak, Moscow Mayor Yuriy luzhkov noted that a current market is unthinkable without a well-regulated communications infrastructure, particularly since this is vitally important for both of the Russian megalopoli. There were no distortions in the "live picture" from Petersburg, and the mayors agreed that now it is fully possible to hold joint planning sessions of the two city administrations. The new digital network owes its existence to the cooperation of the Makomnet, Metracom and Raskom companies with our railroad and metro builders. Installers laid 688 kilometers of cable along the Oktyabrskiy Railroad line, without interrupting train traffic. "The new communications line will make it possible to increase safety and expand the possibility of automation," said First Deputy Minister of Railways Oleg Moshenko. "This is a good groundwork for building a high-speed Moscow-St. Petersburg line. Now we anticipate developing the network to Vladivostok and Novorossiysk. And for our rather overloaded metro trains, the expansion in the range of communications will make it possible to increase the rhythmic movement and effectiveness of information." The Moscow mayor's office has already allocated 24 billion rubles (R) for building a high-speed line, which has been conditionally named the Novonikolayevskiy line. Meanwhile, Petersburg builders have demonstrated the model of a new electric locomotive which will soon undergo route testing. The new route will make it possible to employ millions of people in the development of the adjoining territories. Understandably, the two capitals will have to act in close cooperation. This cooperation has already been quite successfully tested in developing this country's suburban electric railway. Thirty-two enterprises have been involved in this work, and the assembly of trains is in full swing at the plant in Torzhok.
