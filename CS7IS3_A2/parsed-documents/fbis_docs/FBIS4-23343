The audience filled the Premos Hall. Leader Jaap Marais's speech, in which he summed up the current situation in the country and showed the way ahead, was one of his most inspiring ever, and it put the stamp on this most historic moment in the history of the Afrikaner nation [volk]. It proved there was no dejection among the principle-bound right-wingers -- only determination and an eagerness to accept the struggle that lies ahead and to take the bull by the horns. Mr. Marais pointed out that the unitary idea being advocated in newspapers and speeches were hollow slogans without any real content. The whole idea of a lot of loose, totally different groupings of people of all races embraced in a declaration of human rights has only one aim, and that is to establish a new basis for American imperialism. The volk's unity must be broken down and the people must be involved in human rights as individuals -- that is the American plan being used to get at the Afrikaner nation and its political power. That is the contemporary form of American imperialism. We are not dealing simply with a black government, nor even a black communist government, but with an attempt to complete the British-American plan of the last century to eliminate the Afrikaner nation from the African political scenery. In 1948, the same politics suffered its greatest setback. Malan, Strydom, and especially Verwoerd opposed the British-American plan and foiled it for half a century. Now that Verwoerd has been murdered, they have again come to the top and they want to complete their efforts by transforming southern Africa into one big communist state. Back in 1976, Kissinger publicly said he wanted one black state in this part of the world. The negotiation process has been the lifeblood of the terrorists' victory. It was an all-embracing British-American imperialist success -- not the birth of a new nation, which was a nonsensical theme of the [inaugural] celebrations. A nation is not built by a constitution; neither does it get destroyed by one, as the plan seems to be. Nations are indestructible, Mr. Marais said. The state which the British and Americans have rigged up will for many years to come be a totally unstable political product. Should there arise serious differences of opinion in Parliament -- of that everyone can be sure of -- the ANC will simply fall back on a referendum and thereafter call another election. It will be a product of black Africa. Nowhere in Africa have the blacks built anything worthwhile -- nothing that has lasted. The bespectacled blacks in expensive clothes that one sees on television are the same people living elsewhere in Africa. It will not be different here than anywhere in Africa, Mr. Marais said. South Africa will only get from them an unstable state, characteristic of them. The enmity between Zulus and Xhosas is built in; it will eventually have to be resolved the African way. The threat to the future of the whites; the threat to Afrikaner nationhood is built in. The prospect of an attempt at a second, open communist revolution is built in. The Afrikaner sees all these things. He acknowledges the situation for what it is, but the Afrikaner will not let the matter rest there. He acknowledges it in a spirit of resistance, of stubbornness, just like the Boer generals in 1902, Mr. Marais said -- to lengthy applause.
