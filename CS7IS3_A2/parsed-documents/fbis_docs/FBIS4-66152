Talking in the plenum of the inaugural conference in Paris, the Romanian foreign affairs minister remarked that the conference has the historic task of preparing the future by erecting the democratic stability of the continent. Bucharest is convinced that this first foreign policy and collective security exercise performed by the European Union will contribute to the accomplishment of further prerequisites to perpetuate European integration by deepening and expanding it. The example set by those who laid the foundation of the European Community by reaching reconciliation encourages and stimulates the political will of the Central European countries in the sense of turning their good neighborliness into an irreversible framework of their mutual relations. Ethnic diversity, the head of Romanian diplomacy also said, is a natural circumstance of our continent. Romania shares the idea that ethnic minorities are part of the assets of the countries. The protection of ethnic minorities can be ensured in a better way if the persons belonging to those minorities offer their loyalty to the states. Referring to certain remarks made yesterday in the hall of the Paris conference, Mr. Melescanu added that the loyalty of persons belonging to ethnic minorities to the states they are citizens of is, per se, an ample source of stability. Romania also shares the almost unanimously accepted view of the participants in the conference in consecrating the intergovernmental character of this preventive diplomacy exercise, thus guaranteeing its viability and the success of the joint efforts. Consultations at national level with the legitimate representatives of ethnic minorities cannot be anything but beneficial for each of the governments and each of the ethnic minorities. Otherwise, putting such dialogues beyond the boundaries of law would not only violate international rights, but would also act as an obstacle hindering good neighborliness. Luckily, the Romanian foreign affairs minister emphasized, the unanimous decision of the states attending the conference to place the pact on the basis of the principles and norms consecrated by the pertinent documents of the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the Council of Europe, is able to prevent such strange and singular pretenses [sentence as heard]. Mr. Melescanu reasserted the firm will of the Romanian Government to contribute to the success of this initiative by continuing and finalizing the negotiations intended to conclude bilateral treaties with all neighboring countries, including Hungary. Romania also expresses its readiness to include in the stability pact the treaties already concluded by Romania with other states associated to the European Union as our country's specific contribution to the pact. Bucharest also offers to host a regional roundtable conference dedicated to ethnic minority issues, as well as a regional roundtable conference dedicated to issues related to the amelioration of the infrastructures in transportation and communications. After noting that the document of the current conference is the result of long and laborious negotiations, the Romanian minister of foreign affairs stated that the delegation of our country is ready to accept its text. The success of the initiative directly depends on the wisdom, moderation, and the respect of each country for the constructive spirit of the project that will begin today after the conclusion of the conference. The Romanians, stated Mr. Melescanu, believe that the time has come when the prejudices, cliches, and exaggeratedly emotional perceptions in the relations between neighboring countries that are united by a joint fate should be done away with.
