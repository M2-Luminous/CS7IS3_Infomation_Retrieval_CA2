[Begin Boban recording] I have decided to place the office of president of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna at the disposal of the assembly until further notice. My duties will be carried out by the presidential council which will appoint one of its members to represent the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. [end recording] Explaining his decision, Boban said that the most influential international players have been misled due to a lack of information and he believes that certain politicians, and not the will of the Croat nation, stand in the way of a multicultural, multiethnic, and unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina. This belief of the international public, which leads to growing pressure on the Republic of Croatia, is the reason why Boban had offered to resign. [Begin Boban recording] I am saying this at the beginning so that those who believe in other interpretations in the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not describe this as a result of [word indistinct]. [end recording] I will stay with you, Boban said at the end of his speech, in which he recalled that the will of the Croat nation in Bosnia- Herzegovina was defined two years ago in a referendum formulated in Livno, which approved Bosnia-Herzegovina, not as a unitary state but as one in which the Croat nation would have equal rights and the right to self-determination. We still support Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three republics, because we enabled it to survive by defending 35 percent of its territory. However, the Serbs and the Muslims do not want this Bosnia-Herzegovina anymore. Boban also mentioned the meetings of self-proclaimed Croat assemblies and he said that this assembly is the only legitimate representative of the Croats' will in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
