Elections to the new representative body took place in six out of nine three-mandate districts in the Bryansk region. There were 150 contenders for 27 seats in the oblast duma. The greatest activism was shown by voters in rural districts--it was thanks to them that 18 candidates got their mandates. Voters in the three districts in the oblast center did not turn out in the numbers needed to make up the required 25 percent that would make the elections valid, and have lost their representation in the duma. Of those elected, 50 percent are agrarians, and the rest are members of the executive branch from a rayon to oblast level. The statute on elections to the oblast duma envisages that one-third of the deputies will work full-time; however, so far not a single deputy of the current term has dared to leave his administrative or directive job and become a professional politician. Deputies will consider the question of temporary rules for the oblast duma, elect a chairman and his deputy, and form permanent committees.
