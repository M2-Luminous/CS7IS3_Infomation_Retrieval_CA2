FR941031-1-00042 FR941031-1-00011 (c) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (i) Federal Travel Regulation prescribed by the General Services Administration, for travel in the conterminous 48 United States. * * * * * (6) The maximum per diem rates referenced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section generally would not constitute a reasonable daily charge: (i) when no lodging costs are incurred; and/or (ii) on partial travel days (e.g., same day of departure and return). Appropriate downward adjustments from the maximum per diem rates would normally be required under these circumstances. While these adjustments need not be calculated pursuant to the Federal Travel Regulation, Joint Travel Regulations, or Standardized Regulations, they must result in a reasonable charge. (7) For contracts with State and nonprofit institutions which conduct federally sponsored research and related activities, costs incurred for lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses, are subject to the provisions of 970.5204&hyph;13(e)(35) NOTE and 970.5204&hyph;14(e)(33) NOTE. 21. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;13 is amended by revising paragraph (e)(35) of the clause to read as follows: 970.5204&hyph;13 Allowable costs and fixed-fee (Management and Operating contracts) * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (35) Contractor employee travel costs incurred for lodging, meals and incidental expenses which exceed on a daily basis the applicable maximum per diem rates in effect for Federal civilian employees at the time of travel. When the applicable maximum per diem rate is inadequate due to special or unusual situations, the contractor may pay employees for actual expenses in excess of such per diem rate limitations. To be allowable, however, such payments must be properly authorized by an officer or appropriate official of the contractor and shall not exceed the higher amounts that may be authorized for Federal civilian employees in a similar situation. Note: For contracts with State and nonprofit institutions which conduct federally sponsored research and related activities, use the following clause: Contractor employee travel costs incurred for lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses shall be considered reasonable and allowable, to the extent such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the institution in its regular operations pursuant to a disclosed or established institutional policy and the amounts claimed are otherwise reasonable and allocable. In the absence of an acceptable institutional policy regarding travel costs, the rates and amounts established under subchapter I of Chapter 57 of Title 5, United States Code, or by the General Services Administration, or the President (or his designee) pursuant to any provisions of such subchapter shall apply to the agreements (41 U.S.C. 420(b)). * * * * * 22. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;14 is amended by revising paragraph (e)(33) of the clause to read as follows: 970.5204&hyph;14 Allowable costs and fixed-fee (support contracts). * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (33) Contractor employee travel costs incurred for lodging, meals and incidental expenses which exceed on a daily basis the applicable maximum per diem rates in effect for Federal civilian employees at the time of travel.
