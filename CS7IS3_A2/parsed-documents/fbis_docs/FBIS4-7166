FBIS4-7166 "dreas082_m_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Thailand Chuan Claims Bomb Attack `Act of Subversion' Chuan Claims Bomb Attack `Act of Subversion' BK2704035794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 27 Apr 94 p 6 BK2704035794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday said he was sure last Saturday's bomb explosion at Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station was an act of subversion to destroy the Government but admitted he had no hard evidence pointing to any particular group. "Personally, I believe this might be the work of a subversive group out to sabotage the Government by terrorising the public, even though we do not have enough evidence to specify which group was responslble," he sald. Mr Chuan said he was waiting for a detailed report from the Police Department and needed a concise investigation result before he would comment on the incident. The Premier said there were several differing opinions among senior police involved in the case so it was important not to confuse and frighten the public with speculation or rumour. He said he had given strict orders to officials to be extremely careful in their investigations and preventive measures, especially now when there are rumours of bomb threats in the South as well as- in Bangkok. Meanwhile yesterday the Interior Ministry decided to improve its operation centre to counter subversive activities in the country. The decision was made at a closeddoor meeting of the National Civil Defence Committee chaired by Interior Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. The meeting agreed to provide the centre with more manpower and a bigger budget to boost its capacity in intelligence-gathering to prevent acts of sabotage, said centre chief Ari Wong-araya, who is also Permanent Secretary for Interior. Mr Ari said the meeting yesterday also decided to recruit the support of members of various organisations including village scouts to help serve as the "eyes and ears" of the Government to prevent acts of sabotage. He said the Government was understaffed and without the help of these volunteers to help report on possible sabotage attempts the effort could fail. Police Department chief Prathin Santipraphop insisted yesterday the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station bombing was an act of personal vengeance and not a politically-motivated act. He emphasised his theory was based on information obtained by investigators handling the case and was not a baseless assumption. "Other persons who are speaking from their own assumption should not offer comments as this will only add more to public confusion," Pol Gen Pratin said. Police Department deputy chief Vinit Charoensiri said yesterday, however, investigators probing the attack have three separate theories: a love conflict, a political conflict and terrorism by separatists.
