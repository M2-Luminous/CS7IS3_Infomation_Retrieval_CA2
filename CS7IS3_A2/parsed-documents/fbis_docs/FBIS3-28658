There have also been reports of several people being taken to hospital as a result of violence relating to the strike. The strike has been organized by the Vanuatu Council of Trade Unions in support of public servants who have been on strike for 10 weeks in a pay dispute with the government. The news agency, PACNEWS, says all government offices in the central capital, Port Vila, (Lugen Ville), and other government centers have closed. Hospital outpatient departments were closed except for emergencies and nearly all schools and fuel stations in Port Vila and other centers were closed. International flights in and out of Port Vila were disrupted with one flight being canceled. The domestic airline, Van Air, was also affected. The vice president of the Trade Unions Council, Barton Basiwe, said some government sympathizers had harassed strikers, including incidents involving sticks and stands on trucks.
