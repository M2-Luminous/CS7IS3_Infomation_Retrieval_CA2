FR940919-2-00128 FR940919-2-00055 [Docket No. AB&hyph;8 (Sub-No. 29X)] The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company_Discontinuance of Trackage Rights Exemption_in Dickinson, Morris, Lyon, Osage, Franklin, Miami and Johnson Counties, KS, and Jackson County, MO The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company (DRGW) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuance of Trackage Rights to discontinue its trackage rights over 173.25 miles of rail line owned by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) 1 between milepost 278.39 at or near Kansas City, MO and milepost 451.64 at or near Herington, KS, in Dickinson, Morris, Lyon, Osage, Franklin, Miami and Johnson Counties, KS, and Jackson County, MO (The Line). 2 1 The trackage rights were granted in an agreement between MP and DRGW in 1982. 2 Under 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The applicant, in its verified notice, indicated a proposed consummation date of October 18, 1994. Because the verified notice was not filed until August 30, 1994, consummation should not have been proposed to take place prior to October 19, 1994. Applicant's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after October 19, 1994. DRGW's discontinuance of trackage rights will allow MP, owner of the The Line, to consummate abandonment of the portion of The Line pursuant to its filing in Docket No. AB&hyph;3 (Sub-No. 111X), Missouri Pac. R. Co._Aban._Osage & Morris Count., KS , 9 I.C.C.2d 1228 (1993). MP has also sought to abandon another portion of The Line in Missouri Pacific Railroad Company_Abandonment_in Miami, Franklin and Osage Counties, KS, Docket No. AB&hyph;3 (Sub-No. 115X), (ICC served Aug. 11, 1994), instituting an investigation under the modified procedure. DRGW has certified with respect to the trackage rights involved here that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line can be rerouted; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 3 3 No environmental or historical documentation is required here under 49 CFR 1105.6(b)(3). As a condition to this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the discontinuance shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on October 19, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay must be filed by September 29, 1994. Petitions to reopen must be filed by October 11, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 4 4 Because this is a discontinuance proceeding only, the routine provisions for trail use/rail banking or public use conditions provided for in abandonment proceedings are not appropriate here. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Gary A. Laakso, General Attorney, Southern Pacific Lines, Southern Pacific Building, One Market Plaza, room 846, San Francisco, CA 94105. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . Decided: September 12, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23214 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
