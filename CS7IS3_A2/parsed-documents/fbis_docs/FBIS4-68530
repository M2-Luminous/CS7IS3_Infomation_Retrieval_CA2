In the 1920s this is what they called the members of the "exploitative classes" who had been deprived of the right to vote. At that time they numbered hundreds of thousands. Today the scales are not the same: The "sequential constitutional reform" has limited the rights of only around 150 people. These people of different genders and ages are united by a common "social status": All of them were people's deputies of the Russian Federation of the 1990-1995 convocation. Their labor books now bear the following inscription: "Dismissed from work on a permanent basis in accordance with RF Presidential Edict No 1400 without eligibility for the social guarantees specified in RF Presidential Edict No 1435." This inscription, which was composed by experienced personnel from Old Square (members of the presidential administration, not the CPSU Central Committee), was required after several hundred people lost their jobs as a result of the forcible elimination of their place of employment--the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. That was when our solicitous president issued Edict No 1435--"for the purpose of providing people's deputies with state guarantees of social protection." The highest social guarantees were offered to the deputies: They could not be arrested without the president's consent; they would receive financial benefits in the amount of their annual salary (i.e., 3 million rubles all at once); they would have job placement and pension privileges; they could keep the living quarters they were assigned in connection with their office and could even privatize them; they could vacation in "official" resorts until 30 June 1995; and so on and so forth. Aleksandr Pochinok, then the chairman of the RF Supreme Soviet's planning and budget commission, quickly calculated that the edict would cost the state budget 25 billion rubles (not counting adjustments for subsequent inflation and cost-of-living raises). Incidentally, the amount depended as much on the deputies as on the president. The fact is that Yeltsin was planning to offer this security not to all of the people's representatives, but only to those who acknowledged his Edict No 1400. In other words, the chief of state decided to reward--at the treasury's expense--his supporters and possible turncoats. The applicants were many in number, and a commission, headed by former Procurator and Deputy Aleksey Surkov, was set up as part of the presidential administration. This commission was authorized to "separate the sheep from the goats" and dispense the "social guarantees." It went to work with such zeal that even completely loyal democrats had difficulty passing its screening process. It stayed in session for a whole five months, verifying the allegiance of former comrades in the corps of deputies and making detailed reports to the Kremlin personnel division: recommending the specific entry for the labor book of each, either allowing or disallowing the social guarantees. But this was long ago. Much has happened since then: The parliamentary elections were held, the country acquired a new Basic Law, a political amnesty was declared, and the president asked everyone to join the crusade for national reconciliation. It appeared that Surkov's commission was obsolete and that its reports could be deposited in the trash can of history. But no, the commission survived all of the discord and still has not been dissolved. On 9 March the presidential administration issued Directive No 415 under Sergey Filatov's signature, summing up the results of the activities of the government screeners. A list of 151 people who were not eligible for the "guarantees" was attached to the directive. The contents of this document were to be brought to the attention of local representatives of the president and agencies of the executive branch of government. The names on Filatov's list include those of 15 deputies of the present State Duma, including one speaker, one faction leader, one head of a Duma committee, and four members of the Federation Council. For these lucky few, all of the "deprivations" are in the past. It is true that they did not receive their severance benefits, but they did avoid the "career restrictions" and can even collect a regular pension. Things are more difficult for those who were unable to renew their deputy mandates or at least find a place on the parliamentary staff. Several former deputies (they asked the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent not to mention them by name) took the risk of going back home, filling out a new application for a residence permit, and trying to find a job. They learned right away that the orders of the top Russian leadership have a more direct effect than the constitutional declarations of human rights. Local officials who looked through their labor books and checked their own papers suddenly became impervious and refused to help the ex-deputies find jobs. Now the miserable wretches have to come to the capital periodically to seek forgiveness. Filatov recently implied that the president might be charitable and that the notorious directive might be rescinded in connection with the impending civic accord, but this unexpected outpouring of clemency will not solve anything: These people will still have the ineradicable entry in their labor books and no severance benefits. The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent asked many attorneys for a legal assessment, rather than a political one, of the present situation. This turned out to be an extremely complex matter. Boris Zolotukhin, now one of the leaders of the "Russia's Choice" faction in the Duma and formerly the lawyer of the civil rights advocates and a people's deputy of the Russian Federation, said that the legitimacy of the "blacklists" was difficult to assess because the legality of the "social guarantees" themselves is quite dubious (although this did not keep Zolotukhin and his associates from making use of all of these "guarantees"). Independent attorneys confirmed that Presidential Edict No 1435, Surkov's commission, and the proscribing lists are all links of the same chain and are beyond the legal fringe, but today no court has the power to overturn "Yeltsin's discriminatory legislation." After the president abolished the constitution and a whole branch of government, he set up his own patterns of legal relations with members of parliament, so he cannot be expected to correct the situation. During the conversations about the disfranchised, experienced attorneys spoke in strictly ethical terms: "They lost the 'social guarantees' because they could not be bought. Why then should they now receive these '30 pieces of silver'?" The inscription in the labor book is a different matter. The notation "dismissed from work in accordance with Edict..." (the rest is unimportant) is, according to attorneys, "a definite violation of the labor rights of citizens." Labor legislation does not recognize a "presidential edict" as grounds for dismissal. This notation "discredits the worker" without giving him any chance for appeal, because no one knows exactly which official dismissed him. This is an obvious infringement of civil rights. It may be obvious, but no one is trying to defend the violated rights of the disfranchised at this time. Members of the staff of Human Rights Commissioner Sergey Kovalev told the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent that they have not looked into the matter and would not know where to begin. The Duma has remained silent. Speaker Ivan Rybkin, whose own name is on the "blacklist," has dismissed the matter with the broadest generalizations. The disfranchised have no faith in the independence of the judiciary. During their years as deputies, they learned the ins and outs of Russian governmental power, and that is why they are now relying on the good graces of their leader, and not on the supremacy of the law.
