Below is an interview with him. [Starkov] Viktor Fedorovich, I want to start our conversation with a possibly unexpected question. How do you feel about art? [Yerin] There probably has not been a single great writer who has not tried his hand at the mystery genre. There are also very interesting works by our contemporaries. Take Astafyev's "The Sad Detective." I keep telling my personnel department: Before you hire a candidate to work for the militia, give him this book to read, because it describes quite objectively the dirty, thankless side of the militia's everyday work. And at the same time the book shows a man who is sincerely devoted to his profession, who does not spare himself in the goal of protecting the people. At the time, "The Sad Detective" made a very deep impression on me. Unfortunately, as soon as we filled the screens with criminal elements' "heroics," this tremendously affected our youth. [Starkov] You do not believe in the theory that, seeing a crime on the screen, a person undergoes a sort of self-cleansing? [Yerin] I do not believe this. Western statistics show that scenes of violence, scenes of the "romantic" side of the criminal underworld, stimulate a rise in crime. There are known cases of crimes committed precisely according to the scenario of the film shown. Any phenomenon may be presented in a different way. You can show the disgusting side of crime, or you may package it like candy: See, these are also heroics of sorts. When I was just starting my career I had encounters with old-school criminals. At the time the process of "crime bosses" establishing themselves was underway. They also had their own criminal "romantics." And it was this "romantic side" that they used to recruit a certain stratum of youth into their ranks. [Starkov] Clinton delivered his State of the Union address a few days ago. Before it he polled 50 senators and state governors regarding the most serious problem facing the country. All 50 said: crime. Is this a universal problem? Have we entered some different stage of civilization? [Yerin] Crime is indeed on the rise all over the world; a sort of criminal boom is underway. The Israeli minister of police, power engineering, and infrastructure visited me recently. He did not even want to talk about his problems after he heard me speak of ours. What is Israel, with its 5-5.5 million population and 19,000 policemen? And Russia, with 150 million people and 3 million crimes a year? [Starkov] I was in Seattle at the Goodwill Games. I spent a whole day riding around the city with police. The police car itself was like a monster, stuffed full of equipment. The computer display continuously flashed messages of new incidents. It turned out that in addition to uniformed police they also have undercover police. And in addition to undercover police also mounted police. And in addition to mounted police also patrols on bicycles. That is, the entire city is covered by a net of police investigation. Of course, we currently cannot afford this either physically or financially. Are we making any progress, however? [Yerin] We are. For two years the internal affairs organs have led a semi-pauper existence. Our highest achievement is that in these conditions we have preserved the system of organs at all, not allowing it to disintegrate. [Starkov] What is the average pay in the militia these days? [Yerin] About 200,000-250,000 [rubles]. For the second year now we are also providing a food allowance, that is, once a month an employee is issued a certain parcel of foodstuffs or the monetary equivalent. I also get it once in a while: It consists a can of fish, cereal, and so on. [Starkov] But the situation in Moscow is better in this respect, is it not? [Yerin] On the contrary, it is quite often better in the provinces. Over there, people more often ask for this allowance to be issued in cash equivalent, especially those who live in rural areas. In the countryside, even if they themselves do not, their relatives do some farming, have a cow, and will always send some milk and meat their way. [Starkov] How many people does the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] have on payroll these days? [Yerin] The personnel of purely militia units now numbers 570,000 across the entire Russia. Of course, in terms of the militia-to-population ratio we are behind the West. Our ratio is now 3,000-4,000 population per precinct militia officer, and they constitute the bulk of the force. [Starkov] Do you often get woken up in the middle of the night? [Yerin] When I worked as a criminal investigations division chief, it happened much more often. Back then I was counting the nights I was not woken up. [Starkov] How do you make the decision on whether to contact the president regarding a specific incident or not? [Yerin] The criteria are the gravity of the incident and the number of victims. For instance, hostages are taken and the lives of a group of children are in danger. Or it is a major traffic accident with tens of people dead; or a rail disaster. Even if I am woken up in the middle of the night, I will find a way to report to the president immediately because I know that there is no other way. In addition, there is a system of weekly reports. It has been set up by the president himself. [Starkov] Which day of the week do you report to him? [Yerin] Enforcement ministers report on Mondays. My domain is the sociopolitical situation: rallies, mass manifestations that have taken place over the week, their dynamics, comparisons, to what extent law and order was maintained in the course of their conduct, their social thrust and the pretext for holding them. [Starkov] I heard that when a minister goes in to report, he decides for himself whether to alarm the president or not. [Yerin] The president and I had an agreement from the very beginning that I would give him honest information. I think this is also in the president's interests. I know, of course, how to manipulate statistics; how to influence the president; how to make it so that crime rate in our country will begin to "drop"--only on paper, though. But this will be a lie, self-deception. I report very unpleasant things to the president, including things that do not look good for me personally. I believe that we have to take the blows of fate as they come, and be honest. [Starkov] Do you exercise? [Yerin] No. All my life I have not been able force myself to exercise. But I get a workout on the tennis court. I will try to play some even today. [Starkov] Readers will not understand if I fail to ask you about the events of 3-4 October. How do you assess your actions at the time? [Yerin] My conscience is clear, because I did everything I was supposed to do as the minister of internal affairs. That we have been able to deal with this problem with minimal human and political losses is to a certain extent not my achievement as minister as it is of the system itself. I do not want to hurt journalists' feelings, because they were writing in the heat of the moment. But paradoxical things resulted from it. For instance, there was a report that "an MVD unit went over to the White House side, and what kind of unit does the minister have that has betrayed the president?" I, on the other hand, wanted to commend the commander of this unit. His company found itself under fire from the White House; he saw that one soldier was wounded, another killed. A commander at any level has to think about minimizing losses. He was able to move the unit into a covered area, and ensured the safety of his personnel. I had a clear picture of it within 10 minutes--it was reported to me through the chain. [Starkov] Were you actually there? [Yerin] I visited the militia chains regularly, went there both at night and during the day. Or, for instance, journalists asked me: "Why did you stand by and watch the commandos ride to Ostankino and not stop them, not open fire on them?" Just imagine for a moment what this would involve--to start shooting at a bus on Mir Prospect. And a bus with innocent people in it at that. Of course, I understand perfectly well all the damage that resulted from the tanks shelling the White House. But talk to specialists. Using this method of bombardment produced minimum casualties and demoralized two-thirds of the people in the White House while at the same time not inflicting any wounds or contusions--they simply could not stand it and went to the ground floor for shelter. [Starkov] I remember the time when people who went to work for the militia were mostly uneducated. [Yerin] Yes. The people who taught me had four years of grade school. They were detectives by intuition. [Starkov] Do you remember your first assignment in the militia? [Yerin] I remember the first case I solved. It was in Kazan. There was an October cinema there--it no longer exists, it has been razed. In the yard of the cinema was a public outhouse made of wood boards; a woman was raped there. She ran to the theater and told them what had happened. We combed the area of the city and caught the bastard by description. [Starkov] A new amnesty is being readied. How many convicts will be released? [Yerin] A very insignificant number. Less than 10 percent. We now have about 500,000 people being kept in correctional institutions, and about 300,000 in preliminary investigation facilities. The amnesty draft includes mostly elderly people whom it is simply inhumane to keep in detention (people over 60, disabled people, World War II participants), juveniles, and people who committed a crime for the first time--either through carelessness or those who do not represent undue social threat. Those who have committed grave offenses will not be amnestied. [Starkov] We get letters in which convicts tell of the horrible conditions in which they are kept. [Yerin] I do not like it either that we keep people in conditions more fit for cattle. Literally a few days ago a government decree was signed containing concrete figures in terms of how much the government can allocate today for repairs and construction of new prisons. We are now building several preliminary investigation facilities to a design that has been approved by an international expert commission. It is a very original system--a "daisy": First the main block is built, and then you can add wings to it--one, two, or even five, depending on the need. [Starkov] We have seen prisons in American films: bars upon bars; prisoners sit there like animals in a zoo. Is this the system you consider modern? [Yerin] I do not see anything wrong with having both bars and strong locks. When we get richer, I will gladly order the installation of the most modern electronic locks that can only be opened by a magnetic card. And I will be very glad when we get to the level of Denmark, where we were asked to wait five minutes before entering the corridor because the prisoners were finishing their lunch and were not to be disturbed. They have two locks on each cell. I asked why. It turned out that one lock is secured by a warden after bedtime, and the other one is for the prisoner: He can lock it from the inside if he does not want to be disturbed. The Danes told me about a Russian who had committed a crime there, and wrote to his mother that he had been detained by the police and was doing time in prison. She should not worry, the letter said, because this was not prison but a very good hotel; he was well fed, and had very nice living conditions. [Starkov] You shovel human dirt. To do this one must probably have special psychological traits? [Yerin] Of course. Do you think it is a great pleasure to be present at an autopsy when the forensic pathologist is dissecting a corpse? He tells you: "Look, there is a smell of alcohol from the stomach. Look, he ate beet salad and a tomato an hour before he was killed." This is our work. What keeps us going is the enthusiasm of a detective following the scent of a trail. I will remember this case for the rest of my life. We were dealing with an aggravated murder and rape case. We arrested a suspect--a huge, aggressive bull of a guy. He turned out to be impotent. We could not get his sperm for analysis. We brought in the medics and finally squeezed this "product" out of him. The blood type was identical. The murder case was apparently solved. A month passed. Late one evening the department chief stops by my office and says: "I have a nagging feeling about it. I do not think it is him. Let's let him go." We let him go, and a month later we found the real murderer. Do you know how much effort you have to make not to harden, professionally and as a human being, in this stream of daily calls to murder scenes? We had to handle 29,000 murders last year! At the beginning of the conversation we touched on the topic of how important it is for literary and cultural figures, for artists not to forget about the people of our profession--we need an escape valve more than anyone else. I constantly work on myself, keep telling myself: "Remember, the absolute majority of people live a normal human life; they are honest and decent people; the criminals are a small minority." Otherwise, I would have to suspect everyone. And the nerves you need for this work. For instance, a militia officer receives information that a person is in illegal possession of a weapon (perhaps committing robberies and muggings with it). The officer detains this person, risking his life in the process since he does not know whether he will be shot at or not. A criminal proceeding is initiated. Then the court decides: two years of suspended sentence. The man leaves the courtroom, walks over to this militia officer, and says: "I will buy a submachine gun tomorrow, and then we will talk." This is not just a Russian problem. [Starkov] But in other countries, the police are feared. [Yerin] And why? The point is the level of the general legal culture of the population. A respectful attitude towards the police has been instilled over decades. In America, for instance, there are two "sacred cows"--journalists and police officers. Nobody wants to tangle with journalists because the journalistic brotherhood will come out on top in the end anyway. And nobody wants to tangle with a policeman. If God forbid a policeman is killed or wounded, tens of criminals will get shot while this crime is being investigated. And everybody knows that the police will go on a rampage, shooting right and left. Frequently it is better for the criminals themselves to hand over the perpetrator in order to stop the police terror. The police are respected and feared. [Starkov] Why would you not ask for the help of the military to fight crime? [Yerin] I have always been against the military participating in the maintenance of law and order. The president, too, said to me several times: "Look, why do you resist it?" And I keep replying that we should not do this, it is wrong. First, bringing the military out into the streets is always politically damaging for us. Second, each should do his own job, and bear his own share of responsibility. You say we do not have enough militia? Let us beef up the force. Tell me, what can I ask of a 19-year-old kid-soldier who has only been taught how to shoot a submachine gun? He does not know how to work with the public, how to work with individual citizens. I remember myself in that young age. Senior Sergeant Kuznetsov was explaining to me how to walk like a militiaman. I have always moved fast, but he kept telling me that a militiaman should walk slowly, with a measured step, looking left and right, evaluating the situation. You see a group of youngsters--walk over, start a semi-lighthearted conversation. With younger ones, be more gentle; with older kids--a degree of sternness. This sergeant was a psychologist. I would like to see at least 90 percent of MVD personnel be like that Sergeant Kuznetsov. As a minister and a member of the government, I believe that my priority task is to use all possible means to instill a more respectful attitude toward our system, to raise its status. And I have enough powers vested in me, enough of everything to do my job.
