Section 80.42 is amended by revising definitions ``EXHVOCS1'' through ``REFVOCS2'' in paragraph (a) introductory text; by adding a concluding sentence to paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(3)(ii), and adding paragraph (b)(4); and by revising the table in paragraph (c)(1) to read as follows: §80.42 Simple emissions model.

EXHVOCS2=Exhaust nonmethane, nonethane VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile, for VOC control region 2 during the summer period. EXHVOCW=Exhaust nonmethane, nonethane VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile, during the winter period. EVPVOCS1=Evaporative nonmethane, nonethane VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile, for VOC control region 1 during the summer period. EVPVOCS2=Evaporative nonmethane, nonethane VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile, for VOC control region 2 during the summer period.
