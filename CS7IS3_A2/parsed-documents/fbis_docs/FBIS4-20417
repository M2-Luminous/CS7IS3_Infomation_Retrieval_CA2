In general, it started from handling check discounts and later expanded its businesses to inter-bank loans and buying and selling of foreign exchange. The securities market emerged at a later date. Recently the satellite telecommunications network for the financial circles has been established. Right now, a total of 138 ground stations have been built. Each day, transactions exceeding 1.1 billion yuan in total have been handled by the network. A preliminary operational system for the financial market is composed of "two stock exchanges and one network" (The Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the nationwide information network for stock price quotations) and the money market, the securities market and the foreign exchange regulation market. I. Money Market On the basis of different business scopes and various forms of financial assets, China's money market may be divided into the market of inter-bank loans, the market of short-term financing to various enterprises and the market of transferable certificates of deposit of large denomination. Right now, the market of inter-bank short-term loans is fairly active. The main task of the market of inter-bank loans is to help banking institutions obtain short-term loans from each other to mainly make up the insufficient reserve funds for the deposits and the differences in check clearing and to meet the needs for fund circulation of a temporary nature. Since the reform of credit control in 1984, markets of different forms and scales have been set up in various localities throughout the country for inter-bank loans, preliminarily forming an inter-regional and inter-departmental financing network with the major cities as its bases. Meanwhile 120 money markets have been set up in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xian and Wuhan to handle national and regional inter-bank short-term loans. In recent years, the amount of inter-bank short-term loans was about 300 billion yuan each year. The market of short-term fund-raising bonds was officially open to the public in March 1989 after experiments were carried out in this connection at the end of 1987. Banks and other financial institutions often sell such bonds on a commission basis for the various bond-issuing enterprises. A few of them have exclusive rights to sell certain bonds. At the end of 1992, the total value of such bonds had reached 17 billion yuan. According to the regulation, short-term fund-raising bonds issued by various enterprises are transferable right after they are floated. However, only a small amount of them are actually being transferred. The issuance of transferable fixed-term certificates of deposits is limited to various specialized and multipurpose banks. Prospective buyers of the certificates are usually individuals and enterprises and institutions in urban and rural areas. Such certificates should be purchased with people's own money or the enterprises' or institutions' own funds. They are transferable on the market as soon as they are issued. II. Securities Market Since China issued its treasury bonds in 1981, the securities market has rapidly grown with the continuous development of the economic system and particularly at a time when the enterprise system is changing from an unitary economic system to a share-holding one and the financial system is changing its practice of making up its deficits by taking out overdraft or borrowing from the banks to one of directly raising funds from the society. The current situation shows: (1) There are many kinds of securities on the market. Right now, there are more than ten types of bonds including the treasury bonds, financial bonds, bonds for the state major construction projects, state construction bonds, special-purpose bonds, value-protected bonds, enterprise bonds and stocks. (2) The market of securities has begun to take shape. The total value of securities floated by the state totalled 50 billion yuan in 1988, more than doubling the value of securities issued in 1987. The total value of securities floated by the state totalled 115 billion yuan in 1991, once again doubling the value of securities issued in 1988. The total value of bonds and stocks of various kinds in China was close to 400 billion yuan Renminbi in 1992. In 1993, the state planned to issue bonds and stocks at a value equivalent to approximately half of the amount of annual savings of all the rural and urban residents in the country. (3) Securities are being issued in different forms. Some of the financial institutions do sales promotion themselves to sell the bonds they have issued, while some enterprises entrust other financial institutions to sell their bonds. Other enterprises adopted the method of free subscription while promoting the sale of bonds with administrative measures. The practice of apportioning people to buy state bonds has been abolished. (4) The issuance of securities has been made a regular system. The issuance of bonds and stocks has been carefully screened and approved each year and a tranche policy adopted to control the issuance of such bonds and stocks. The situation of the stock trading market is as follows: (1) Right now, there are more than 1,200 securities trading departments in the country. There are markets for the transfer of securities in over 100 cities and secondary markets for selling and buying state treasury bonds in more than 60 cities. (2) The amount of trading on the securities market is sharply rising. The total amount of all types of securities on the market in 1990 was valued at 13.7 billion yuan, that in 1991 at 15 billion yuan and that in 1992 at 200 billion yuan, of which the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen play the most important role. In addition, the Nanfang Securities Company in Shenzhen works in concert with the Huaxia Securities Company in Beijing and the Guotai Securities Company in Shanghai. They stand like the three legs of a tripod, quickening the pace in forming a unified nationwide market for the selling and buying of securities. III. Foreign Exchange Regulation Market Right now, the foreign exchange regulation market is rapidly expanding. According to statistics, the volume of business on China's foreign exchange regulation market in 1987 totalled US$4.7 billion. This figure rose US$6.25 billion in 1988 and US$13.1 billion in 1990. It reached as high as US$25.1 billion in 1992, about half of the total amount of foreign exchange used to pay for China's imports in that year. This indicates that China has paid attention to using the market mechanism to regulate the supply and demand of foreign exchange.
