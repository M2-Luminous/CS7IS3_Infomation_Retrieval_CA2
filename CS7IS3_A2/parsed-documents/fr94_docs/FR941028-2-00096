Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. No new regulatory requirements are imposed, directly or indirectly, on such entities. The economic impact on small entities, if any, is not likely to be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Paperwork Reduction Analysis The Form M&hyph;2 as adopted here will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval under Section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). The burden to carriers for completion of the Form M&hyph;2 will be approximately 10 hours per year. Interested persons may file comments concerning the paperwork burden estimate to the OMB and ICC at: Office of Management & Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Desk Officer for ICC (Forms 3120&hyph;‚ê£), Washington, DC 20503.
