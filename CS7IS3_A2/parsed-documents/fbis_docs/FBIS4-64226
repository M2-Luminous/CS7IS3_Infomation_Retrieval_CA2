He is concerned that the United States "wants to force trade concessions by means of one-sided sanctions," Rexrodt said in Munich on Friday [29 April] at the annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Germany. The multilateral trading system is the "indispensable umbrella, also for regional associations." Rexrodt was optimistic that economic relations between Europe and the United States will be further expanded in 1994. He said he is thinking of multilateral agreements in the fields of steel, civil aviation, and financial services. Also, a multilateral agreement on restricting subsidies to the shipbuilding industry should be concluded in the near future. Rexrodt thinks that eastern Germany could be particularly important in the expansion of German-U.S. trade relations. This mainly has to do with East European markets being "right on our doorstep." According to Rexrodt, there are over 1,400 U.S. companies represented in Germany at the moment, 275 of them in the new laender. They have created or preserved 50,000 jobs there and invested more than 8 billion German marks.
