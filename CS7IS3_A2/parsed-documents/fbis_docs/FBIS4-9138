Currently Romania has seven battalions of paratroopers that will be the nucleus of the future Rapid Deployment Force, which is a NATO military structure. Within the next 20 months Romania will have to reorganize and enlarge those forces so that finally they will consist of three rapid deployment brigades each made up of three battalions of paratroopers and one battalion of special operation forces, namely mountain infantry, marines, and reconnaissance. Each brigade will also have its own logistics support battalion, said the aforementioned sources. Those forces have to be able to intervene within 12 hours anywhere in Europe. In NATO's assessment a considerable part of the Romanian Army's current equipment cannot be used in the future. That is why they suggested that it should be modernized. Thus, as a conclusion of the talks, NATO pledged to offer credits to Romania to buy transportation means (trucks), complete the general overhauling of the Navy's equipment, and improve its antiaircraft weapons. General Joulwan suggested to the Romanian party that its military communications system should be fully redone, because similarly to the radar watch network, during the 1989 December events it did not prove to be reliable. During the aforementioned talks they also approached the experience accumulated from the modernization of the Slovak Army communications, which was done with the assistance of German experts, the modernization programs designed to update the antiaircraft defenses of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and the necessity of establishing a "joint air space." Another issue they discussed referred to the access of NATO to Romanian military facilities -- more precisely, to the Navy harbor at Mangalia, the Constanta port, the [Air Force] airport near Kogalniceanu [Constanta County], the firing range near Sibiu, and the air-to-air and airplane practice field near Midia [Constanta County]. During the meeting the Romanian party was briefed by the NATO general about the fact that the current level of the Russian conventional forces exceeds, by 2,100 armored personnel carriers, 400 tanks, and 620 artillery pieces, the level established by the arms reduction treaty, and that the majority of those forces are concentrated in the rayon of Kaliningrad, as a threat to the Baltic states.
