The National Guard has also made representations to the United Nations. The aim of the Turks is to create a climate of tension following the deadlock in the proximity talks because of Rauf Denktas' intransigence. According to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] information from military sources, the Turks have taken special measures of readiness in the Nicosia area and at points that they consider of vital importance, such as arms and ammunition warehouses and radar installations. The military personnel at guardposts along the confrontation line have been doubled. Senior officers of the occupation army carry out continuous patrols along the entire length of the Attila [Turkish troops] line. Within the framework of measures adopted by the National Guard, strict orders have been given to the national guardsmen along the confrontation line to be particularly careful.
