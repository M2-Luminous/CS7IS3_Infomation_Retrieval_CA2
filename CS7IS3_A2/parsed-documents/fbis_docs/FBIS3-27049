Current Provincial Economic Situation Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council, the provincial party committee and government have led the people throughout the province to conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party congress since the beginning of this year and, aiming at the general objective of building an economically strong province, have seized the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, accelerate development, and comprehensively implement the "outlines of Hebei's economic development," thus achieving notable results in economic construction, reform, opening up, and other undertakings. Following last year's rapid development, the economy has continued developing rapidly, and the general situation has been good. This year's gross domestic product is expected to exceed 140 billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent, which is one of the largest annual increases registered since reform and opening up started. A fairly good harvest has been won in agricultural production despite catastrophic disasters, with grain output expected at 47.6 billion jin, up 8.9 percent from the preceding year. In industrial production, we have achieved simultaneous increase in growth rate and efficiency and attained the target of increasing the increased value of industry, profits and taxes, and the value of fixed assets and raising Hebei's ranking in the country in the overall index of industrial economic efficiency. The annual entire industrial output value is expected to exceed 200 billion yuan, up 25 percent from the preceding year. Rapid growth has continued in fixed asset investment, with the annual social investment in fixed assets expected at 45 billion yuan, up 34 percent. Township enterprises have registered substantial growth in both production and efficiency. Their annual output value is expected at 170 billion yuan, up 70 percent. The endeavor of opening to the outside world has made a new headway. The number of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises newly registered this year is expected at 1,700, and the registered foreign capital $2.26 billion, up 75.9 and 77.2 percent, respectively. The annual volume of exports may reach $1.95 billion, up 9.6 percent. Revenues have grown steadily, with the annual amount expected to rise by 35.9 percent to reach 13.5 billion yuan, thus a basic balance between revenues and expenditures can be achieved. The monetary situation has notably improved, and the shortage of funds has been initially eased. The economic structural reform has entered a new stage, and achievements in transforming the enterprise operating mechanism have been won for the present stage. Judging from the general situation, the province has scored great achievements in economic construction, reform, and opening up in 1993. Compared with other provinces, however, Hebei's ranking in the country has not changed, and its gap from advanced provinces has widened. A specific analysis of the province's economic operation showed that we have the following problems and gaps. 1) Agricultural development has been sluggish, peasants' income has not increased, and cotton production has declined by a large margin. 2) Structural adjustment has proceeded slowly, our products are of a low standing and have a small share in the market, and the small proportion of finely processed products with high additional value has yet to be notably changed. The state sector of the economy still accounts for a small proportion. 3) The extent of reform is not large enough, and the endeavor of opening up has proceeded slowly. In opening to the outside world, we still fail to develop foreign capital utilization, foreign trade, and foreign economic relations simultaneously. 4) The steps to achieve scientific and technological progress are small, and only a small number of scientific and technological achievements has been transformed. 2. The Guiding Ideology and Major Objective of 1994 Economic Work. The year 1994 is a year for continuously maintaining a rapid economic increase on the basis of achieving a rapid economic development in our province for two successive years, a major year for accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, and a crucial year for successfully fulfilling the Eighth Five-Year Plan and for doubling the GNP ahead of schedule in the whole province's national economy. In accordance with the guidelines of the national economic work conference and our province's actual situation, the guiding ideology of next year's economic work is to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guidance, conscientiously implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, and accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic structure in line with the overall idea of strengthening reform, expanding reform, accelerating development, raising efficiency, and promoting a sustained, speedy, and sound national economy in the whole province. In line with the aforementioned guiding ideology, the major objectives of next year's economic development are: The GNP should increase more than 11 percent over this year, of which, the increased value of primary industry should increase 4 percent, and that of the secondary and tertiary industries more than 14 percent. In line with the demand of the objective of building an economically strong province, we should strive to fulfill this objective in a better manner in the course of implementation and doing practical work in an effort to accelerate the pace of accelerating the building of an economically strong province. At present, we are facing a hard-won good opportunity for reform and opening up. First, next year the state will issue a series of major reform measures to instill vitality into national economic development. Second, through strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control, the short supply of essential production factors, such as funds, should be alleviated. Third, during the next few years, the production capacity of major products and the supporting capacity of infrastructure facilities should be enhanced to a further extent. Fourth, areas around the Bohai Bay should become new hot spots for foreign investment. Fifth, further emancipating minds, seizing opportunity, and accelerating development should become the common understanding of the broad masses of cadres at the higher and lower levels across the province. Meanwhile, we should also recognize that many problems and difficulties will exist in next year's economic development, and the "bottleneck" restrictions, such as the shortage of power, transport facilities, and water resources, will remain serious, funds will remain tight, and industrial raw materials, cotton, in particular, will be in short supply. Judging from the overall situation, comparing the favorable factors with the unfavorable factors, the former have accounted for a major part. 3. We Should Persist in Advancing This Work in an All-Around Manner and Making Breakthroughts in Major Points in an Effort to Accelerate the Pace of Reform in the Whole Province. Many reform measures will be issued next year, however, the central aspect is enterprise reform and promotion of the modern enterprise system. 1) We should continue to deeply implement the "enterprise law," "regulation," and the "implementation method," and completely implement all rights and responsibilities of enterprises in places where needed. 2) We should continue to improve all sorts of operational forms, and actively popularize the experiences in changing mechanism and promoting development of different enterprises, including Handan Iron and Steel Company, Tangshan Haomen Group, and Yinggeleilan Company of Xuanhua Iron and Steel Company. 3) We should carefully grasp the experimental work of establishing the modern enterprise system. In addition to conscientiously organizing experiments in some state designated units, the provincial authorities will also conduct such experiments in 100 enterprises. 4) We should actively promote reform of the property rights system, and improve property rights relations. Next year we should transform and reorganize 300 enterprises with the experiment of shareholding system, and strive to make the figure reach 400. 5) We should actively promote some property management forms, such as state-owned people-run or public-owned people-run forms, rental operation, operation on a commission basis, auction or transfer of property, in some small state-owned enterprises or money-losing medium-sized enterprises. 6) We should continue to decontrol the development of non-state economic sector and cultivate the new economic growing point. According to the unified arrangements of the central authorities, we should firmly make good preparations for coordinating the implementation of reform measures in an effort to ensure the smooth implementation of the central reform measures. On the reform of the financial and tax system. The State Council decided that from 1 January next year, all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with provincial status in state planning should carry out the tax distribution system. According to the basic principles as defined by the central authorities and on the basis of the distribution pattern as defined in the current financial system, the province should also gradually merge the financial management system with the tax assignment system on the basis of a rational division of power with the city and prefectural authorities. On the reform of the financial system. We should firmly attend to this work which is conducive to Hebei's economic development. First, we should strive to increase the setup of various financial organs and widen the channels for collecting and circulating capital. Second, we should try every possible means to organize savings deposits and stabilize the resources of credits. Third, we should intensify enterprise management and enhance the returns on use of capital and enterprises' ability in repaying loans. Simultaneously, the departments concerned should strengthen the selection of projects and enhance the work of making reports on the selected projects in an effort to make increasingly more projects be listed in the state plan and to gain the support by the policy-lending banks. On the reform of the investment and capital circulation system. We should firmly arrange, by classifying the categories and in the order of importance, the basic investment projects, competitive investment projects, and public welfare investment projects. As for the basic projects, that should be invested jointly by the governments and enterprises, we should strive to gain the support by the state development banks. As for the competitive projects, we should enable enterprises to actively establish contacts with banks to gain the support by the financial departments. As for the public welfare projects that should be invested by the governments, we should have the funds covered in the plans and the budgets. It is necessary to strengthen the provincial construction and investment company's functions for making investment and circulating capital, to strengthen the provincial international credit and investment company's functions for circulating capital at home and abroad, and to bring their functions for collecting funds for construction undertakings. On the reform of the foreign trade system. The reform of the foreign trade system is conducive to expanding the scale of export. At the time of quickening the reform of the managerial mechanisms of foreign trade enterprises, we should firmly grasp this favorable opportunity, adopt effective measures, positively organize the supply of goods, and expand the foreign exchange earning capability. Facing the 1994 situation with more new reform measures, heavy tasks, and great difficulties, the party committees and governments at various levels, all departments, and all trades and professions should concentrate more attention on reform and promote economic development and social progress with reform. We should appropriately handle the relationship between reform, development, and social stability. We should positively, steadily, and orderly guide reform and lose no opportunities to make breakthroughs in key areas. 4. We Should Unswervingly Carry Out the Strategy of Developing the Export-Oriented Economy and Further Quicken the Pace of Opening to Both Domestic and Foreign Areas. Although our province made rather bigger strides for opening to the outside world in the past two years, we still far lag behind the coastal provinces. Therefore, we must enhance the sense of urgency, the sense of crisis, and the sense of responsibility; have greater determination, bigger daring, and more vitality; and lose no opportunities to firmly grasp the opening of the province to the outside world. First, we should further emancipate our mind to understand anew Hebei's work of opening to the outside world. Without great emancipation of the mind, there will be no great opening to the outside world, nor great development in the economy of the entire province. An analysis of the current mind-set of the cadres at all levels in the province shows that they are "superficial, complacent, sluggish, and lazy." Being superficial means that they have merely a superficial understanding of opening to the outside world and implementing the strategy of "promoting the entire economy through the export-oriented economy," regarding that opening to the outside world means introducing some funds from abroad, establishing some joint ventures, and exporting more and thus is the work of foreign economic relations and trade departments. Being complacent means that they are complacent with small progress and small wealth, feel satisfied with the current conditions, and lack the spirit of making progress and the courage and insight of achieving great improvement, great breakthrough, and great development. Being sluggish means that they are slow and insensitive in understanding things and taking actions, thus missing the opportunity, widening the gap, and stopping development due to their wait-and-see attitude. Being lazy means that they lack the spirit of doing practical work and pioneering new work and have not totally overcome their practice of giving empty talk and doing superficial work. To quicken the pace of opening to the outside world, we should first surmount these four ideological obstacles. Second, we should implement the strategy of promoting the entire economy through the export-oriented economy to bring about a rapid economic development. Aiming at the general objective of rejuvenating Hebei's economy and building an economically strong province, and while speeding up the opening up and development of the coastal areas of Bohai Sea, which are on the forefront of opening up, we should make active efforts to create favorable conditions for implementing the strategy of promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the entire economy through the great development of the export-oriented economy. Third, we should simultaneously pay attention to and accelerate the development of foreign trade, foreign capital utilization, and foreign economic relations. Guided by the world market, led by foreign trade, and focusing on foreign capital utilization, we should persistently pay attention to foreign trade, foreign capital utilization, and foreign economic relations simultaneously. In exports, we should implement the strategy of winning through good quality and diversifying the market; take the road of industrialization, conglomeration, and internationalization; embrace the concept of large-scale foreign trade; pool the efforts of foreign trade companies, integrated industrial and foreign trade companies, three types of foreign-funded enterprises, and enterprises with the autonomy in export and export to expand export and improve economic efficiency; and strive to reach the national average in foreign trade growth. Foreign capital should be used simultaneously in large, medium-sized, and small projects, in primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, in cities, prefectures, and counties, and in the various sectors of the economy; and foreign capital should also come from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots and Overseas Chinese. Foreign capital should be used in more areas and, in particular, key aspects. We should strive to expand the scale of foreign capital utilization and upgrade its level. We should achieve a significant breakthrough in foreign economic and technological cooperation next year. Fourth, we should continue exerting great efforts to achieve success in developing the coastal cities and counties of Bohai Sea and the cities and counties around Beijing and Tianjin. The focus of next year is to comprehensively implement the strategy of promoting the entire economy through the export-oriented economy in these cities and counties, expedite their opening up, facilitate their lateral cooperation at home by introducing investment from abroad, bring in more investment from abroad by developing lateral cooperation at home, and turn these cities and counties into hot spots of investment Fifth, we should improve the methods for inviting investment to boost the enthusiasm of all cities and prefectures, departments, and enterprises. Cities and Prefectures, departments, trades, and enterprises should gradually become the major participators in the activities to invite investment from abroad. 5. In Order To Accelerate Economic Development, We Must Give Priority to Grasping Several Tasks. A. The rural areas should give consideration to the overall situation of becoming well-off, strive to increase the income of peasants and herdsmen, and give priority to grasping four tasks well: a. On the premise of guaranteeing a stable increase in grain production and a big upward trend in cotton production, we should actively optimize the agricultural structure with the market as our guidance. We should conscientiously implement the state policy on raising the grain and cotton purchasing prices next year, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in developing grain and cotton production. It is necessary to ensure that the annual total grain output will reach 230-235 kg or more. In next year' cotton production, we should work hard to bring about an upswing, increase the cotton growing acreage by a large margin, raise the per-unit area yield, and guarantee the total output. In the readjustment of agricultural structure, we should actively develop "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly-efficient" farming, and do a good job in organizing the implementation of the "seven- character project,"and the "double-thousand field project." b. We should realistically grasp well the building of a rural socialized service system. On the basis of developing competitive products and pillar industries, we should combine foreign trade with industry and agriculture and marketing with supply and production, build service system at all levels, and organize the efforts of thousands of households. We should give priority to supporting and developing serial services, including the processing, transport and marketing of farm and sideline products. c. We should actively promote the development of township enterprises. Next year township enterprises should regard accelerating development as the main melody, and strive to make their development rate attain or surpass the national average level. Particularly, counties and cities along "Bohai Bay, Beijing and Tianjin Municipality, and railways" should make their development rate and economic efficiency remarkably higher than the provincial average. It is necessary to actively promote the development of shareholding cooperative system, increase input in township enterprises through various channels, and establish a batch of large-scale enterprise groups that produce good products and high efficiency. d. We should carry out rural family planning work in a down-to-earth manner. It is necessary to realistically strengthen leadership over family planning work, resolutely implement the demands of making party and government top leaders grasp this work personally and assume full responsibility, and strictly implement the system of negating all achievements if one's family planning work is poor. Particularly, leaders of counties and cities where the family planning work is backward and problems are numerous should exert greater efforts to grasp this work and to rapidly end the passive situation. B. We should optimize the industrial structure, and deeply carry out the activity on "increasing the increased value of industrial enterprises, the profits and taxes of industrial eterprises exercising independent accounting, and local technological transformation investment, reducing the deficits of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, and making the comprehensive index of industrial economic efficiency rise by 1 percentage point." Next year the provincial industrial front should extensively and deeply carry out this activity with increasing production, ending deficits, and increasing efficiency as the main content. This means to increase the total increased value of industry by 14 to 17 prcent, of which, the increased value of the industrial enterprises at and above the township level exercising independent accounting should increase 12-15 percent; to increase the profits and taxes of industrial enterprises at and above the township level exercising independent accounting by 10 percent, and that of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises 10 percent; to increase technological transformation investment in local state-run enterprises by 25-35 percent; to reduce the deficits of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises by 15 percent; and to raise the comprehensive index of economic efficiency of industrial enterprises excercising independent accounting by one percentage point. We should persist in taking the market as a guidance, and exert strenuous efforts to readjust the structure. In heavy industry, we should realistically solve the issue of "highly-efficient heavy industry," and in light industry, we should continue to implement the strategy of developing brand-name products, and accelerate the pace of readjustment to develop high and new technology and brand- name products with large-scale efficiency and foreign markets. We should accelerate the pace of technological transformation of enterprises. Begining next year to before 1997, we should completely transform our province's budgetary industrial enterprises once in a planned manner and group by group. We should actively carry out "grafting" and transformation on the provincial industrial front through various forms. We should organize the enforcement of the "dragon-tiger" plan in the province as a whole. In line with the development of new products and the renewal of out-dated products, we should accelerate the enforcement of the plan of "establishing a large number of enterprises in six fields" in 1994. 1) The first group of enterprises are in charge of introducing outside advanced technologies and assimilating them so as to turn out new products. 2) The second group of enterprises are in charge of manufacturing and developing a large number of high-and-new tech products. 3) The third group of enterprises are in charge of popularizing the superior products turned out by a large number of pillar industries. 4) The fourth group of enterprises are in charge of increasing the output of products that can earn or save foreign exchanges. 5) The fifth group of enterprises are in charge of putting into production the products turned out by a large number of new emerging industries. 6) The sixth group of enterprises are in charge of eliminating a large number of out-dated products and renewing a large number of new products with flaws. We should rapidly whip on the province's industrial front an upsurge of learning from the influential enterprises, grasping powerful projects, creating products with strong competitive capability, and contending for being first grade. All enterprises should grasp the expansion of markets by regarding the expansion as an important task and foster an operation mechanism that can rapidly respond to the feedback of market information, exert flexible reaction, and is strong to meet changes. A good job should be done in realistically grasping the industrial production at present so as to ensure a good trend of maintaining a rapid growth in the first quarter of 1994. Efforts should be made to ensure the supplies of raw or auxiliary materials needed by production. In particular, we should adopt every possible way and means to obtain the supplies of cotton and ensure the sufficient production conditions of electric power and transportation means. A good job should be done in carrying out connection among various links cropping up in the productive process. We should ensure the rapid growth of production the first quarter of 1994 to gain initiative for the annual production next year. C. We should regard as an emphasis the work of accelerating the fostering of market systems and vigorously promote the development of tertiary industry. We should also regard market construction as a breakthrough for developing the tertiary industry. In building markets in 1994, we should uphold the principle of attaching simultaneous importance on both development and upgrading. The work emphasis should be placed on developing the markets of essential factors of various production. In particular, we must take a larger step in building the markets of finance, labor forces, talented personnel, technologies, information, and of trading enterprises' property rights. We should vigorously develop the intermediary organizations of markets and accelerate the development of self-discipline organizations of markets, including the offices of registration, accountants, auditors, and lawyers; as well as the institutions of notary and arbitration, chambers of commerce, and associations of various industries and trades. D. We should increase in a rational way the scale of investments made in fixed assets and reinforce the reserve strength in developing the economy. The key to whether we can win over the state investments lies on the characters of our projects. We must make full use of the province's strong points of infrastructures in energy resources, communications, the industries of important raw materials, and water conservancy works; as well as the strong points of more projects for basic industries; so as to enable more projects in the province to be oriented into the state overall construction plan. We should also optimize the investment structure to ensure the construction of key projects. Meanwhile, a good job should be done in continuously conducting the work prior to the construction of projects so as to ensure "the ceaseless formulation of projects and the ceaseless supply of investments". Among the projects that have been newly put into construction, we should emphatically do a good job in grasping the construction of Shenmu-Huanghua railway and Huanghua Harbor. We should actively create conditions for the two large projects of diverting south water to the north and of building the middle canal of diverting the Chang Jiang's water, which have strategic significance on the economy of Hebei Province and the country, so as to ensure the two transcentury projects to be started within the given date. Except for successfully grasping the aforementioned key projects that conform with the state industrial policies, the province as well as various cities and prefectures should continue to sieve their projects so that we can build a large number of projects that can exert good economic results; are greatly needed by markets; cost less investments; can be completely built in a short period; can withdraw funds rapidly; are with high additional value; and can exert high benefits. In readjusting the structure of investments in 1994, we should adequately increase the proportion made in urban housing construction. In line with the state arrangements, we should earnestly implement the new methods of conducting reform in the urban housing systems and popularize the housing experience gained by the higher educational institutions of our province. E. We should greatly develop science, technology, and education and realistically channel economic construction to the track of relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers. In developing science, technology, and education, we should focus on the following work. We should step up establishment and improvement of enterprises' scientific and technological development institutes to continuously improve their ability and level in high-tech development; and all the 741 large and medium-sized enterprises in the province should create favorable conditions for establishing scientific and technological development institutes, and all these institutes should develop the new products and new technology oriented to adjusting the structure and improving efficiency. We should encourage development of non-governmental scientific research institutes, non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises, the scientific and technological enterprises owned by the state but run by the people, and the three types of foreign-funded enterprises engaged mainly in scientific and technological development. We should achieve success in establishing a number of high- and new-tech industrial development zones and high- and new-tech industrial parks. We should cultivate and build a number of permanent technology markets, speed up transformation of scientific and technological achievements, and promote the close coordination of science and technology with the economy. We should persistently put education in a strategic position for development on a priority basis and exert great efforts to train the personnel in various specialties who meet the needs of the socialist market economy system. We should further accelerate reform of the educational system to continuously improve the quality of instruction. We should greatly intensify elementary education, greatly develop vocational, technical, and adult education, stabilize the enrollment of colleges and universities, and put more efforts into the strong and highly competitive projects to create achievements and first-rate personnel. 6. Conscientiously Strengthen Leadership Over Economic Work Hebei's reform, opening up, and economic construction will enter a stage of new development next year. We are faced with a new situation in which the planned economy is being changed into the market economy. To comply with this new situation, we should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study well Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and strive to master the new knowledge and new skills to manage the market economy. We should take the overall situation into consideration to ensure the smooth implementation of government orders. Comrades in charge of leadership work should keep the overall national and provincial situation in reform and development in view when considering the work of their own localities and departments and take the initiative in serving the overall situation. They should conduct intensive investigation and study and realistically change their work styles. Leading cadres at all levels should often go to the reality of life to conduct investigations and study, pay attention to studying new conditions, address new problems, and carry out the work of their own localities and departments in a creative manner. They should have the courage to try out the new moves whose worth they are certain and to blaze new trails. We should use typical examples as a guide and promote the entire work while achieving breakthroughs in key areas to accelerate Hebei's reform, opening up, and economic construction. We should attend to two tasks simultaneously and be competent in both. While attending to economic development, we must never slacken efforts in building the socialist material civilization and in improving socialist democracy and legal system. We should intensify efforts to improve public security comprehensively and strive to eliminate the various factors leading to instability in society. We should continue the in-depth anticorruption struggle, eliminate the various ugly phenomena, and ensure the smooth accomplishment of the tasks of reform and development.
