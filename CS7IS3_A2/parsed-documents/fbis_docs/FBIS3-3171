Xu Liangying, who last week initiated a petition to the authorities to free all political prisoners, said yesterday he was suffering from heart disease and he needed to go out to replenish his medical supplies. After American Secretary of State Warren Christopher departed yesterday the authorities in Shanghai freed two activists, Yang Zhou and Wang Fuchen. The two expressed worries they might be subjected to "police harassment" any time the authorities saw fit. Speaking in his Beijing apartment, Mr Xu, 74, an internationally known historian of science said there were still around 20 policemen in his compound. "They have started letting my friends come in to see me," Mr Xu said. "But this morning when my wife and I wanted to go out to take a walk, the police stopped us." Mr Xu said police gave him no indication when his house arrest would end. "I have had heart disease for some time, and I have taken extra doses of medicine the past few days," he said. The scholar said it was lucky that two staff from his unit, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, had brought along some medicine when they visited him yesterday. Mr Xu said Mr Christopher's visit had been a failure because it had only provoked the Chinese leadership into saying they would never accept the "Western" view of human rights. While he hoped it would get Most Favoured Nation status, Mr Xu said China had to make improvements in human rights to earn it. In Shanghai, Mr Yang and Mr Wang were set free hours before Mr Christopher left Beijing. "The U.S. should keep up the pressure ... I believe China should at least release more dissidents who are being locked up for political reasons such as Fu Shenqi and Zhang Xianliang," said Mr Wang. "I am not afraid of them (police), I can't lie and I cannot speak against my conscience," he added. According to Mr Wang, he was kept under constant surveillance during his detention. "I could not even go to the toilet (on my own)," he said. He was not treated badly, but said the detention was nonetheless illegal. Throughout his captivity, Mr Wang was never given any documents to explain why he was detained. "They only said I should know why," he said. "I am going to write to the National People's Congress to complain about my treatment. I am a law- abiding citizen. I haven't broken any law and they can't do this to me," Mr Wang said. According to Mr Yang, who was taken away every night for the past three days, his treatment at the police station was acceptable. He was allowed to read newspapers every morning and was even offered a packet of cigarettes every day. But the police also reminded him that he must "repent" or risk going to jail. "They told me that they could 'reform' even old men -- 70 or 80 years old -- and I would not be an exception," said Mr Yang. "But I told them I am 50 years old and I won't change."
