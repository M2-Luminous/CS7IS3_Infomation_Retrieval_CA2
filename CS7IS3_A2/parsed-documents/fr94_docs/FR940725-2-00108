SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;87&hyph;03; SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;87&hyph;21; SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;87&hyph;05] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Changes and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendments to Proposed Rule Changes Relating to Market Index Option Escrow Receipts July 19, 1994. I. Introduction Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'') and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'') 3 submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') proposed rule changes to permit, on a permanent basis, the use of cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified equity securities, or a combination thereof, as collateral for market index option escrow receipts (``MIOERs'') issued to cover short call positions in broad-based stock index options. 4 On May 12, 1994, May 25, 1994 and July 5, 1994, respectively, the CBOE, PSE and Phlx submitted to the Commission Amendment Nos. 1, 7 and 5 to the proposed rule changes in order to conform their proposals with recently approved amendments to the rules of the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC''). 5 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1990). 3 Hereinafter, the terms ``exchanges'' and ``self-regulatory organizations'' (``SROs'') refer to the CBOE, PSE and Phlx. 4 The Phlx also has proposed to allow the use of cash and cash equivalents as collateral for escrow receipts issued to cover short put positions in both broad-based stock index options and individual stock options. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33549 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5629 (February 7, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;89&hyph;04) (``OCC approval order''). Amendments Nos. 1&hyph;6 to the PSE filing and Amendments Nos. 1&hyph;4 to the Phlx filing requested extensions of the pilot program and previously were approved by the Commission. See infra, note 12. The proposed rule changes were noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 24253 (March 24, 1987), 52 FR 10433 (April 1, 1987) (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;87&hyph;03); 24708 (July 15, 1987), 52 FR 27604 (File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;87&hyph;21); and 24383 (April 23, 1987), 52 FR 15796 (April 30, 1987) (File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;87&hyph;05). No comments were received on the proposals. This order approves the proposed rule changes, including the most recent amendments on an accelerated basis. II. Background For various reasons, such as state and federal regulations, many institutions may write call options only on a covered basis in a cash account. 6 Many of these institutions, however, are legally restrained from having deposits of cash or securities at a brokerage firm. Accordingly, in lieu of such a deposit, a bank may issue to the broker an escrow receipt on behalf of their mutual customer, in order to meet the margin requirements for any short options the customer may have written. 7 6 In the context of a short call position, an options writer is covered if he owns the securities underlying the options he has written. 7 Pursuant to Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Federal Reserve Board''), in a cash account, an escrow agreement may be used in lieu of margin for a short call option position if a bank hold the underlying security for the customer writing the option. See 12 CFR 220.8(a)(4)(i) (1990). Because it is difficult to apply the traditional concept of ``cover'' to broad-based, cash-settled index options, 8 in 1984, the Commission approved SRO proposals to allow index options writers to enter into escrow agreements without requiring them to collateralize the agreements with all the securities underlying the index. 9 The original MIOER program permitted the use of escrow receipts for short call positions if, among other things, a bank or trust company held for the customer a ``basket'' of at least ten qualified equity securities. Due to inadequate recordkeeping procedures, settlement delay and financial disincentives, many market participants found this program to be impracticable and uneconomic, particularly in comparison to similar products traded on commodities exchanges. 10 8 Existing options on broad-based stock indexes overlie from 20 to over 2,000 securities. As a result, it can be impracticable for an index options writer to be ``covered'' by having appropriate positions in each component security. In addition, because index options are cash-settled, the securities underlying an index option are never delivered upon assignment. 9 See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 20619 (February 6, 1984), 49 FR 5221 (February 10, 1984) (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;83&hyph;31); and 21032 (June 8, 1984), 49 FR 24964 (June 18, 1984) (File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;84&hyph;07). At that time, the staff of the Federal Reserve Board indicated that it believed a MIOER could be used as cover in a cash account. See letter from Laura Homer, Securities Credit Officer, Federal Reserve Board, to Richard G. Ketchum, Associate Director, SEC, Division of Market Regulation, dated January 27, 1984. 10 In addition, OCC, at that time, did not accept escrow receipts for index options margin. For further discussion of the original MIOER program and the problems encountered thereunder, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22323 (August 13, 1985), 50 FR 33439 (August 19, 1985) (File Nos. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;84&hyph;33; SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;84&hyph;28; SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;84&hyph;35; SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;85&hyph;19; SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;85&hyph;18_ (``pilot approval order''). Accordingly, in 1985, the Commission approved, on a pilot basis, SRO proposals to change the type of property acceptable as an escrow deposit. 11 These pilot programs subsequently have been extended eight times, 12 in order to provide the exchanges and OCC with the opportunity to resolve certain matters concerning the format of the receipt and administration of the program. 11 See pilot approval order, supra note 10. The Commission simultaneously approved the use by the clearing member of an escrow receipt form, in lieu of margin payments to OCC.
