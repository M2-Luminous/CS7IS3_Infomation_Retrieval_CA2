Security Council on Thursday. In a press conference after his report to the Security Council, Blix said that North Korea is capable of producing plutonium needed to manufacture atomic bombs and that the Stalinist country may have more plutonium than it has admitted. As North Korea refused to allow IAEA experts to examine a radiochemical laboratory, one of seven declared nuclear facilities, the IAEA cannot verify the laboratory has not produced plutonium since February 1993 when it was last inspected. To determine whether the laboratory has produced plutonium, sampling and gamma-ray tests are necessary, he added. Blix said he does not know whether North Korea has the capability to produce nuclear weapons, but the IAEA has concluded that Pyongyang diverted plutonium from spent nuclear fuel on several occasions as a result of its inspections. This means the North Koreans have secured far more plutonium than they admitted in the gram unit.
