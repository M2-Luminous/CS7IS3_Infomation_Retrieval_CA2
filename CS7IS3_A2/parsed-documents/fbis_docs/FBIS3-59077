The prime minister is also tight-lipped about a possible presidential run. Although a Social Democratic Party (PSD) congress is planned for 1994, it may be postponed for the first quarter of 1995, adding to the uncertainty. If it takes place on schedule, the PSD will know whether its leadership will change, and the country will find out whether the era of "absolute majority" may have ended. -- President Mario Soares will continue to be influential in 1994, Pinto Leite contends, "preoccupied with how best to complicate the government's life and how to convince PS leader Antonio Guterres to conclude an alliance with the communists." In addition, he will "subtly feed the social conflict" to deny Cavaco Silva the success of a "social contract" that would be beneficial to the prime minister in the 1995 elections. An unknown at this time is whether an "enervated" and impatient Soares will provoke "unexpected situations," Pinto Leite concludes. -- Despite his gains in the municipal elections, PS leader Antonio Guterres did not achieve his dream of becoming the "key to the system." It would have allowed him to "sensibly" ask the president not to dissolve the Parliament and let the PSD become increasingly attrited. Guterres seems determined to eschew an alliance with the PCP for the 1995 legislative elections and expects that the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) will steal enough votes from the PSD on the right to put an end to the latter's absolute majority. -- In Pinto Leite's opinion, new Minister of Finance Eduardo Catroga will play a key role in 1994, as his realism and cautiousness, coupled with his use of "simple and direct" concepts, may lead to the hoped-for economic recovery. -- CDS leader Manuel Monteiro, who will probably run in the Euroelections to test his power, has so radicalized his discourse that he is now accused of extreme rightist views, Pinto Leite affirms. While this is untrue, it indicates that Monteiro has abandoned the moderation of his first months in office. He may perhaps be the recipient of more hopes from the left than from the right, Pinto Leite continues, because the PS will be unable to end the PSD's absolute preponderance without his help. If 1994 is favorable to Monteiro, Cavaco Silva ought to worry, he concludes.
