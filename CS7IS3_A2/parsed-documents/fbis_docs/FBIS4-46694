Ye. Anisimov, under the rubric "Anniversaries"; date and place not given] [Text] The Ukrainian Legal Foundation is 2 years old. Its appearance in a country of homeless judges, intimidated procurators, and exhausted lawyers is more remarkable than accidental. So many fervent reformers, legal rights activists, and democrats "burned out" in the heroic and ineffective struggle against the reigning nomenklatura! And finally, the understanding has ripened that without reforming the very system of legal relations in Ukraine, all attempts to build a free society are doomed to failure. This process is a fairly long one, since popular legal sophistication is extremely low and this situation suits the prevailing regime perfectly: legal nihilism is the bulwark of their power. And to prevent this from happening, a person continues to seek protection and patronage from illustrious dignitaries, stands at the front entrances to ministries with placards, and makes the rounds of editorial offices, and only at the last remembers the judge and the main defender of his civil and human rights, the lawyer. Turning the situation around and bringing Ukraine closer to the civilized democratic states by providing assistance in conducting reform in the country is the goal which the Ukrainian Legal Foundation [UPF], which was created in May 1992, has pursued. We asked its president, People's Deputy of Ukraine Sergey Holovatyy, to tell about the activity and prospects of the UPF. [Anisimov] Sergey Petrovich, two years of activity have shown that the UPF is not a phantom. It has acquired prestige and influence, its opinion is taken into consideration, and a great deal is being written about it. But first I would like to ask about the magic of words. Words such as "democracy," "human rights," and a "law-governed state." Only the lazy do not speak them today. And it seems that they have become a reality. [Holovatyy] That, as you remember, is an old and tested device of the nomenklatura. The Kravchuk's and Plyushch's and others use them very successfully. They devalued the meaning of these concepts very quickly by repeating them all the time but doing nothing. Slogans are for the sake of slogans. The creation of the UPF did in fact pursue the goal of moving from grating appeals to real concrete work. [Anisimov] Whose idea was it to create the Foundation? [Holovatyy] Its roots come from back in the time of the Union, in 1990. At that time a group of jurists (Nikazakov, Ayvazyan, Holovatyy, Muzychenko, Kisil, Shishkin, and others) was the initiator of the creation of the Association of Ukrainian Jurists. We understood very well that the state, and that means the bureaucratic apparat, was not interested in reforming itself. Bureaucrats understand that any reforms--in the economy (the market, private ownership), a multiparty system, jurists, the bar, or the court becoming independent--will inevitably lead to the loss of bureaucratic omnipotence and the loss of status. And although following that Ukraine became an independent state, the system remained as before: It was nurtured and lives under the laws of the Country of the Soviets. In such a society, a jurist was part of the mechanism for serving the nomenklatura's interests, and for that very reason could not be a supporter of reforms and democratization. And even now most of Ukraine's jurists do not realize what the independence of the legal profession is. They do not know how to be a jurist and not perform a servile function, to be a lackey. Do you recall many cases where jurists defended a citizen in his suit against the state? On the contrary, they defended the state from people. So the first thing that we wanted was to change the jurist's role and position in society, to eliminate the servile essence, and to achieve complete independence of his professional activity. The natural human right to life, freedom, and private ownership should be a law for him. But jurists work in different systems: Some go to court to defend a citizen's rights, while others (judges) apply the law created by the state. If the first are independent, the others should be as well. Judges should not be in the chain of corrupted power (judge, procurator, raysoviet chairman, rayon administration chairman, and so forth). We decided to break this chain and understood that a comprehensive program of reform of Ukraine's legal system was needed. [Anisimov] And the state ordered the Association of Ukrainian Jurists to develop such a program? [Holovatyy] Of course not. The Association had no money, but it had an intellectual charge. And in order to obtain money, a plan was needed. A plan for reforming Ukraine's legal system whose ultimate goal was to create a free society where human rights and freedoms, above all the sacred right of private ownership, were guaranteed. Such a plan was formulated together with foreign jurists. It interested George Soros and Karl Lopper's Zurich Foundation, which supported it materially. That is how the Ukrainian Legal Foundation emerged. [Anisimov] We have acquainted our readers with the child of the UPF, the Ukrainian Center for Human Rights, and covered the first all-Ukrainian human rights hearings conducted by it. Let us talk a little about other areas of the Foundation's activity. [Holovatyy] The creation of the Ukrainian Center for Human Rights is 1 of 10 programs of the Foundation. They are interrelated and no particular one of them can be considered the main one or another one--secondary. Let us take the program "Codification of Ukrainian Legislation." The program is supposed to assist the lawmaking process in Ukraine in order to change it and bring it closer to European standards. The basic codifying enactments, civil, criminal, administrative, and so forth, must constitute a system of legal enactments, be reconciled with one another, and be based on the Constitution. We conducted two international symposiums on the draft Constitution with involvement of Western experts, and many of our recommendations were taken into consideration by the working group. Conferences on the Civil and Criminal codes were also held. At the suggestion of the UPF conference held in Kharkov in December of last year, the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine created a national Codification Commission. Overall the effectiveness of this program is very high--many of the proposals are being adopted by the groups which are formulating legal enactments. The next program is related to a problem we already talked about. You must agree that no matter how democratic the codes are, they must be applied. And to do this a lawyer is needed, an independent lawyer who is in no way linked to the state. Associations of lawyers which are based on self-government and have their own codes of honor exist in all civilized countries. A lawyer can be expelled from the association for accepting bribes or other violations. This decision will not depend on whether he is a friend of the procurator or a functionary from the ministry of internal affairs. The creation of an independent professional organization of jurists as well as an independent judicial system in Ukraine are extremely important problems. Tell me, if a judge receives an apartment from the state (or functionaries), how can we speak of his independence? [Anisimov] But just who should offer this apartment to him? [Holovatyy] A judge must be able to buy it as a free citizen. And his material support must guarantee that for him. Of course this is difficult today, but after all we are speaking of a long-term program of reform of post-totalitarian society. It is very difficult to change this system in 5-10 years. Moreover, can we speak of the independence of the lawyer and judge when legal cadres in our country are still trained on the Soviet plan? Soviet jurists were trained in two specializations: Soviet development and legal scholar. The goal of instruction was to train jurists for repressive functions and to support the system. But we want a jurist to protect, as in any democratic society, higher values, life, and property, rather than the system. A person should call only on him in all situations. Especially now when we are moving toward the market. In the West a jurist is 90 percent involved with civil law and private law relations. And we must have such jurists trained under the standards of democratic countries, as the colleges of the Western universities do. So the next program envisioned the founding of the Center for Legal Studies. It was created on the base of the Kiev-Mogilyanskiy Academy University and will train highly qualified cadres of jurists for the country's scientific and educational institutions and will also be involved in basic and applied research in the area of the state and law. On its basis, VUZ instructors will be retrained and improve their skills, and it will develop textbooks and aids on questions of law, translate foreign literature on legal questions, and engage in publishing. An understanding has been reached with foreign partners that in the fall of this year, the first graduate students will go to study in the universities of England, France, and Belgium. The fifth UPF program envisions the creation of a Center for Universal Minimum Legal Education of the Public. People must abandon legal nihilism and find out how they should live in the new legal system. However this is impossible without law literature. But in Ukraine there are no publishing houses which produce legal information. In Soviet Ukraine there was Politizdat, which published laws in the Ukrainian language. In the 2 years of our independence, not a single law has been published in brochure form. The Ukrainian Legal Foundation published the first Law on the Election of Deputies of the Supreme Soviet in a half million copies. Coming soon, and in large runs too, are the laws on Election of the President of Ukraine and on Election to the Local Organs of Power. The publishing house Pravo founded by the UPF is handling these publications and in the future should become a powerful national publisher of law literature. The first issue of the scientific-practical journal UKRAINSKE PRAVO published by the UPF will come out soon as well. A separate program of ours envisions help in organizing and financing conferences and symposiums on timely legal issues conducted by state and other organizations. The last such conference on the principles of the Criminal Code was conducted by the Internal Affairs Academy. We allocated the money for it and invited experts and specialists. Stipends and on-site training for our legal specialists in foreign VUZes and colleges (from 2-3 weeks to 3 months) are an important program. A few days ago we selected, based on interviews, six people for on-site training at London University. And finally, there is a program to create a national law library in Ukraine. The library has already been set up on Kostelnaya Street and teachers, graduate students, and students of Kiev VUZes visit it. At present its collection consists of 4,000 books, the universities of Canada gave 500 books, and it subscribes to 6 foreign legal journals and has ties with foreign libraries. [Anisimov] And do state structures help your Foundation's activity? [Holovatyy] I already said that the state as a system of bureaucracy is not interested in reforming itself. But bureaucrats constitute 5 percent of the population, while society makes up 95 percent. Moreover, there comes a time when the bureaucrat becomes a pensioner and an ordinary citizen and enters into those legal relations where he needs to go to court and protect his rights as a person and a citizen. He will not always be able to utilize the "telephone right" and contacts. And then he too begins to think that the system should apparently be changed. We do not receive any help at all from the state. We seek money and find it abroad. Even our requests for space for a publishing house and library were ignored. They distribute space to anyone you like, but not to us. But come what may, it seems to me that the Ukrainian Legal Foundation has taken its first steps quite confidently. And no matter what, I am certain that independent Ukraine will become a law-governed state, since there is simply no other way.
