FR941107-2-00135 FR941107-2-00079 Availability of Branch Technical Position on When to Remediate Inadvertent Contamination of the Terrestrial Environment The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is announcing the availability of a Branch Technical Position on ``When To Remediate Inadvertent Contamination of the Terrestrial Environment.'' Copies of this document may be obtained free of charge upon written request to Janette Copeland, Low-Level Waste and Decommissioning Projects Branch, Division of Waste Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, MS T&hyph;7F27, Washington, DC 20555. Further information can be obtained from Jack D. Parrott, Hydrogeologist, Low-Level Waste and Decommissioning Projects Branch, Division of Waste Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, MS T&hyph;7F27, Washington, DC 20555. Telephone 301/415&hyph;6700. Internet JDP1@NRC.GOV. The purposes of this Branch Technical Position (BTP) are: (a) to provide licensees with the NRC staff's expectations for operational good practices and remediation methods and procedures following inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment by radioactive materials; (b) to inform licensees of the nature of an NRC response to an inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment; and, (c) to help insure consistency in NRC responses to instances of inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment. This guidance is also intended to address the timing of remediation (immediate or delayed) of inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment. This BTP does not supplant NRC's emergency (contingency) planning. The need for this BTP stems from the Division of Waste Management staff's concern with instances of inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment at NRC licensed facilities, and the delay that sometimes occurs in remediating this contamination. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 31st day of October 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. John H. Austin, Chief, Low-Level Waste and Decommissioning Projects Branch, Division of Waste Management, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
