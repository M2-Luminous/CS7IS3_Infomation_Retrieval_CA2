He opened here on Wednesday the second international conference on chemical disarmament, ``Moskon' 94,'' with a presentation on problems of elimination of chemical warfare agents. Kuntsevich said Russia now possesses the world's biggest stock of toxic agents. According to official data, it has accumulated on its territory over 40,000 tons of products by the military chemical complex, which is enough to poison every living being on the globe. The issue of recycling chemical warfare agents is out of the scope of Russia's interests. Participants in the conference noted that introduction of imperfect technologies might create hotbeds of ecological tension not only on the cites of war gases elimination but also in other regions. Experience gained in this sphere by other countries, in particular by the United States, cannot be copied in Russia. Developments by Russian researchers are opposed by foreign experts just out of considerations of competition. Some Western theoreticians and industrialists insist that lewisite be incinerated, while Russian specialists suggest extracting highly-pure arsenic out of this hazard chemical agent. Russian supplies of this valuable material used in making solar energy plants designed to replace atomic stations in the next century will somewhat squeeze Western arsenic producers on the world market. Thus, purely scientific problems raised by participants in the forum are acquiring a very different meaning. Professor Vladlen Malyshev, adviser to the head of the Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons under the Russian president, told TASS that ``Moskon' 94'' had drawn chemical researchers from many countries. In coordination with their colleagues from the Russian Academy of Sciences and producers, they are seeking ways of safest destruction of Russia's huge stock-piles of toxic agents. In doing this, the adviser said, we should first of all take into account humane ecological problems and national interests. ``At the same time, researchers and specialists of the military chemical complex understand quite well that ratification by Russia of the convention on chemical disarmament will stabilize the situation across the world, but this truth should also become an axiom for politicians, lawmakers and the public at large,'' Malyshev stressed.
