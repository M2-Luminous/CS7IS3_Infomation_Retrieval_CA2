Speaking before the National Defense Committee of the National Assembly, Kim said the NSP will also carry out a five-year intelligence-gathering plan to cope with "the era of information." "We will consistently try to improve our ability to collect and analyze intelligence information while diversifying channels for exchanges of information as soon as possible," Kim told lawmakers. With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Kim said, "there is a long way to go before transparency of their nuclear program is objectively guaranteed." "The agency will strengthen a 24-hour early warning system against North Korean provocation in view of the adventurous and provocative character inherent in the North Korean regime," Kim said. At the same time, the agency will boost cooperation in exchanging information with international organizations and friendly nations, Kim said.
