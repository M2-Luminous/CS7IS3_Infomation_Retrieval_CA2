He stressed that the Arab boycott of Israel will continue and will not end until its goal of making the occupation disappear is reached. Concerning the Yemeni war, he said the Arab League's position is illustrated by its call for a cease-fire and resuming dialogue. In an interview with AL-SAFIR in Damascus, 'Imran commented on U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent Middle East tour by saying: "Every effort made by the parties capable of putting pressure on Israel is welcome. However the role of sponsor, or intermediary, requires basic specific qualifications that might prove very important in attaining the desired objective. The primary qualification is impartiality. If we examine this point, we will notice a fatal flaw. Israel almost totally and continuously lives on absolute U.S. backing. In this connection I wish to express regret over the recent U.S. arms deals for Israel which seem to suggest that the coming climate will be one of war, not peace." 'Imran continued: "The seriousness of this issue lies in the fact that Israel interprets such arms deals as encouragement for its intransigence, rejection, prevarication, and procrastination. This is how Israel interprets the U.S. Administration's unjust and unfair attitude to Syria and several other Arab countries which the U.S. State Department puts on the list of countries that support terrorism. This is a questionable, political list." The Arab assistant secretary general continued: "This contravenes the logic of neutrality and balance in relations that a mediator must possess. At any rate we would like this mediator's role to continue but would like the U.S. sponsor to reconsider its attitude." On the Arab boycott of Israel, 'Imran said: "We do not boycott Israel for the fun of it. At the same time we do not want to surrender or abandon Arab rights. This explains our statement that ending the boycott hinges on ending its causes. These causes are the occupation and Israel's defiance of the international community through its continued aggression. When the cause disappears, the consequence will end. Furthermore, the boycott is not something we invented. We have merely copied about five percent of the boycotts carried out by the United States worldwide with and without justification. We hope that the boycott will end along with its causes when a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace is attained and UN resolutions are implemented. On Qatar and Oman's hosting of two Israeli delegations, 'Imran said: "We did not arrange these visits. What we stick by is that all Arab countries, including Qatar and Oman, during official meetings should affirm their adherence to peace that leads to withdrawal and ends aggression. They also should not have any dealings with Israel under any circumstances, as long as it is an aggressor and occupier and does not adhere to the stipulations of international law. These are important points and I believe that no normalization of relations should take place by any country that adheres to our central cause, be that from the point of view of patriotism, religion, or heritage. By this, I mean the Arab and Islamic countries. All occupied territories must be regained, including Jerusalem, before normalizing relations with Israel." 'Imran said: "All of Israel's desperate attempts to set up bridges between it and some Islamic countries must fail. I can safely say that such bridges are weak and will certainly collapse. Israel is fooling itself if it believes that it will realize any gains in this direction. In fact, such a method will reveal to what extent Israel will indirectly feel that it is an aggressor and that it has no pride when grovelling for relations with any of these countries." On the role the Arab League is playing to stop the Yemeni war, 'Imran said that the Arab League's initiative did not fail, but was not complete. "The Arab stand was clear. It demanded a cease-fire and called for dialogue to preserve the unity of the Yemeni people." He added that it was not easy to reach Sanaa. "We overcame all the difficulties of our objective. There also, our mission was not easy. The Arab League Secretariat's delegation exerted its utmost efforts through a series of meetings it held with the Yemeni leaders. These meetings were crowned by a meeting with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The delegation presented the League's stand, which included a message from the secretary general to Salih and provided additional explanations of the Arab stand, as unanimously expressed by the Arab countries during the extraordinary Arab League session." The Arab League assistant secretary general said that our mission's first stop was successful, despite the atmosphere of fighting which is not constructive. "I cannot make an evaluation as to whether or not the mission failed at our second stop, because so far, we have not received a satisfactory or final answer to the Arab initiative presented by the Arab League's delegation. We were hoping to get a commitment to a final cease-fire; however, we realize that situations under such circumstances cannot be resolved with the ease that we would like. These difficulties require greater efforts, which is what the secretary general is currently doing, through his daily contacts with the Arab leaders to establish a speedy mechanism for implementing the Arab League Council's resolution issued during its extraordinary session." 'Imran said: "The Arab initiative has not ended at all. We hope that the end of the initiative will be when its goals, which I pointed out earlier, are realized: Immediately halting the fighting, working on restoring dialogue, and preserving the unity of Yemen.
