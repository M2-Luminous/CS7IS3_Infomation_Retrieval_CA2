Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says this reflects the worldwide caution against Japan, which has surfaced as a new nuclear war force in Northeast Asia. What the Japanese reactionaries intend is to stockpile large quantities of weapon-grade nuclear materials and mass produce and possess nuclear weapons any time, the analyst says, and continues: Japan's nuclear armament has reached a danger line today. It plans to possess plutonium enough to make 6,200 nuclear bombs in 2010. It is now fully prepared to manufacture nuclear weapons. Japan has more than 150 companies and 3,300 factories engaging themselves in nuclear activities. It set up a nuclear-launching system long ago, and recently developed even a long-range missile, a means of delivery of nuclear weapons. Japan's scheme of nuclear armament is all the more grave and dangerous because it has opened the way of overseas dispatch of troops. Its accelerated nuclear armament is a grave threat to peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia. We must never be Japan's nuclear victim. We will cope with Japan's dangerous nuclear armament with heightened vigilance. The promotion of the nuclear armament of Japan, our neighbour, in a dangerous stage renders the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula meaningless. To denuclearize Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula is vital to the building of a nuclear-free world. The world, not to speak of Asia, must pay due attention to Japan's nuclear armament and launch an international campaign to check it.
