FR941102-0-00083 FR941102-0-00022 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018 AC97 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Emergency Reclassification of the Snake River Spring/Summer Chinook Salmon and the Snake River Fall Chinook Salmon From Threatened to Endangered Status AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Emergency rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service is reclassifying the Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) and the Snake River fall chinook salmon from threatened to endangered status under the emergency provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act). This reflects a determination by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which has jurisdiction for these species, that the species warrant emergency reclassification based on a projected decline in adult Snake River chinook salmon abundance. This determination by NMFS was published in the August 18, 1994, Federal Register . EFFECTIVE DATE: This emergency rule is effective from August 18, 1994, to May 26, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Jamie Rappaport Clark, Chief, Division of Endangered Species, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Mail Stop 452, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/358-2171). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and in accordance with Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970, the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, is responsible for the Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon. Under section 4(a)(2) of the Act, NMFS must decide whether a species under its jurisdiction should be classified as endangered or threatened. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is responsible for the actual addition, deletion and amendment of the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in 50 CFR 17.11(h) (List). NMFS published its determination of threatened status for the Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon and the Snake River fall chinook salmon on April 22, 1992 (57 FR 14653). Accordingly, the Service added the species to the List on September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49880). On August 18, 1994, NMFS published an emergency interim rule in the Federal Register (59 FR 42529) reclassifying the Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon and the Snake River fall chinook salmon from threatened to endangered status based on new data that indicates that critically low salmon returns are expected for 1994. Accordingly, the Service is amending the List, pursuant to the emergency provisions of section 4(b)(7) of the Act, to reflect the revised status. During the 240 days this emergency rule is in effect, NMFS will initiate and complete a rulemaking (with a public comment period) to extend the reclassification of Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon to endangered status under the Act until such time as reclassification or delisting is warranted. This action of the Service to amend the List in accordance with the determination by NMFS is nondiscretionary. Therefore, in view of the public comment period that will be provided by NMFS on the proposed reclassification, the Service finds that good cause exists to omit the notice and public comment procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and to make this action effective on August 18, 1994, the date of publication of NMFS' emergency interim rule, waiving the 30-day effective date provision of 5 U.S.C. 553(d). National Environmental Policy Act The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
