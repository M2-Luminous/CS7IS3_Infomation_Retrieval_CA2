FBIS4-47612 "cr00000026094001" 6 May 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-060--JAPAN JAPAN: A NEW APPROACH TO DEVELOPING A 1-TERABIT MEMORY CHIP JAPAN: A NEW APPROACH TO DEVELOPING A 1-TERABIT MEMORY CHIP Two Japanese companies have collaborated to move beyond the silicon age by developing a new electronic element with greater potential memory capacity than the conventional semiconductor chip. The companies, Suntory Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. have succeeded in the creation of an artificial protein with a diode property, which can be applied to the development of semiconductor chips, potentially increasing their capacity to 1-terabit of memory. This capacity is far beyond the existing integration limit for silicon semiconductor chips (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 Apr 94, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94).

Source: NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN, 24 Mar 94. The artificial protein created by genetic recombination, has the same basic functions as an electronic element. According to Japanese press reports, this is the world's first successful creation of a protein that functions as a diode, allowing an electric current to go through it, and as a switch that controls the current flow. Next, a molecular element must be developed to integrate the artificial proteins. This would pave the way for development of a 1-terabit memory chip, which would exceed the 1- gigabit integration limit of a silicon semiconductor (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 Apr 94, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94). The artificial protein was developed by bonding a natural protein, heat-resistant "cytochrome c552," to flavin, a kind of vitamin that is able to receive and emit electrons. Electrons are exchanged between flavin and heme (hemu), a part of cytochrome c552 that receives and emits electrons. The method by which electrons are received and emitted between flavin and heme is equivalent to electron exchange between a p-type semiconductor that receives electrons and an n-type semiconductor layer that emits electrons. This electron exchange makes it possible to control the flow of the electric current. The companies confirmed that the artificial protein properties are not affected even at a temperature of 100 degrees C. Genetic engineering was applied in the process of replacing an amino acid that comprised cytochrome c552 with a special molecule and bonding it to flavin (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94). This development has potential for various applications. The width of the new protein molecule is approximately one hundredth of the circuit line width of a 64-megabit memory chip, which is approximately 0.35-0.45 micron. If artificial protein molecules are integrated, a high density semiconductor element can be developed. If photoelectric transfer characteristics that convert light energy into electric energy and other functions that can detect temperature, pressure, and ions are added to proteins, this development can be applied to solar cells and image sensors of a camera. Since integration of proteins is still considered technologically difficult, commercialization of the technology by its application to sensors is expected before development of a semiconductor (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94). The two companies that developed the protein, Suntory Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. teamed their expertise in different fields, biotechnology and electronic technology respectively. They started research cooperation three years ago. The basic research institute of Suntory (Teruo Amachi, Director) has conducted research on proteins that have heme structure and searched for opportunities to apply the research results to new fields outside its specialties, which include the production of liquor, food, and pharmaceuticals. The central research institute of Mitsubishi Electric (Tamotsu Nomaguchi, Director) has conducted research on making a molecular device with biomaterials since 1984. In the future, the two companies plan to develop a biochip simulating information processing mechanism of organisms by combining molecules that have various functions (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 APR 94, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 24 Mar 94).
