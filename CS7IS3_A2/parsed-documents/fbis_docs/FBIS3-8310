Certain activists of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion crossed these limits. Already, on several occasions petitions were initiated and signed by officers of he Bulgarian Army, something that contradicts the Disciplinary Regulations of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, Article 104, Chapter 5, and the following paragraphs, according to which petitions, proposals, and complains can only have a personal character. Those actions contradict the basic postulates regarding relations between the Ministry of Defense and the Rakovski Officer Legion, according to which mutual activity must be based on the steady observance of the Constitution, the country's laws, the military charters, and the principle of one-man-command. Those who seek an increase in the military budget through petitions and publishing opinions at this very difficult period for the country, speculate with the common interest of the military personnel, and push the Army toward destabilization and politicization. In their striving to protect their own interests the organizers and initiators of the petition are prepared to trigger a confrontation between the Army and society. As a minister of defense, I have only one choice in anything related to the military budget: To accommodate the Army within the budget adopted by the National Assembly through painful but prudent decisions. With its actions, the leadership of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion inflicted a blow on the authority of the Legion, which as established in order to increase the status and prestige of the officers, rally the officer corps, and assert the Bulgarian Army's values and traditions. There can be no instigation in the Bulgarian Army, and such a situation will not be tolerated. Those who think that the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria could be directed through petitions from the bottom to the top are deceiving themselves.
