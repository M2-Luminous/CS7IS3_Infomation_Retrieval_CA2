According to local officials, exports of livestock made up a half of the province's total exports of farm produce last year, and local farmers earned 60 percent of the added income of the whole year from the breeding industry. In 1978 the output value of the province's breeding industry only accounted for 15 percent of its total agricultural output. But last year the output value of the sector climbed to 20.614 billion yuan, accounting for 36.6 percent of the province's total agricultural output value. The officials attributed the rapid development of the breeding industry to the country's reform, the wide application of agro-technology, enhanced circulation and local geographical advantages. To promote an overall development of rural industry, the province this year plans to continue to treat the breeding industry as an important measure for developing high-efficiency agriculture and increasing the income of farmers, with the purpose of making local farmers become prosperous quickly. Besides setting concrete targets for the number of pigs slaughtered, the total output of meat and the output of aquatic products, the province also aims to earn 24 billion yuan from the breeding industry in 1994, making it account for about 40 percent of the province's total agricultural output value.
