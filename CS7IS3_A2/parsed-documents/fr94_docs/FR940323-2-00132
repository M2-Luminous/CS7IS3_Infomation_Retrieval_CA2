FR940323-2-00132 FR940323-2-00103 The proposed changes do not involve any physical modifications to any equipment, structures, or components, nor do they involve any changes to any plant operating procedures. The only change is a one-time extension of the surveillance intervals for one power-operated valve in the boron injection system and two power-operated valves in the service water system. Thus, the proposed changes do not introduce any new failure modes, and they do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 4.1.2.2.c and 4.7.4.1.b do not involve any changes to any safety limits, setpoints, or design margins. Also the proposed changes do not affect any protective boundaries. Technical Specifications 4.1.2.2.c The subject value in the boron injection flowpath was exercised through a complete cycle on March 7, 1994. This surveillance did not satisfy literal compliance with Technical Specification 4.1.2.2.c, because it was not performed while the unit was shutdown. A one-time extension of the surveillance for the subject valve in the boron injection system does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Service water valves 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1A and 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1B are normally open and are designed to fail in the ``as is'' position. The valves do not perform any active safety function (are not considered in any operational procedure to mitigate the effects of an abnormal event), nor do they provide isolation between the two service water headers. Their primary function is to isolate the downstream portion of the header for maintenance activities. Since service water valves 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1A and 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1B possess no risk significance, the proposed one-time extension to the surveillance frequency for service water valves 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1A and 2&hyph;SW&hyph;3.1B does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P&hyph;223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By April 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
