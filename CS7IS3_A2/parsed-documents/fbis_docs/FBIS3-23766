UNSD is to me Ukraine's only organization for the protection of human rights which is utterly devoted to this cause. This is the only revolutionary force which engages in real politics. The results of our activity include participation in two wars, organization of scores of strikes and the establishment of the Ukrainian Patriarchate and a military trade union. Who supports you? We rely on officers' circles and free trade unions. What can you say about the relations between UNSD and Ukraine's official leadership? The Ministry of Justice refuses to register us, and about 15 of our men are currently being detained. But they can't do anything with us, times have changed and our strength has grown. The Ukrainian Ministry of the Interior can certainly muster more fighters than I, but when the minister gives an order he cannot be sure that it will be fulfilled, while I can count on the support of several thousand people who will die and kill without any pay. In what wars did UNSD participate? We took part officially on the Trans-Dniestrian side in Trans-Dniestria and on the Georgian side in Abkhazia and Mingrelia. We also received some practical experience in Azerbaijan and in the Balkans. Why were your men on the Azerbaijanian and not the Armenian side? We believe that Azerbaijan can become a friendly power to Ukraine, while Armenia is more in Moscow's sphere of influence. Have you come to Moscow for a specific purpose? My purpose is to search for allies, but I did not expect such a lack of the right people. As a matter of fact I was surprised during the October events how few defenders your Supreme Soviet had. Were it not for its foolish stand on the Crimean question, we alone could have sent more fighters than there were actually gathered at the White House. MN Note: Shortly before the October events the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation transferred one of the Crimea's biggest cities, Sevastopol, to Russian jurisdiction. You said once that the Crimea would be either Ukrainian or depopulated. What did you mean? The Crimea is very vulnerable geographically. Even if there were no UNSD, the rupture of ties with Ukraine would lead to a catastrophe, for transport would not be able to operate and the supply of drinking water and electricity would stop. There would be no need to kill anyone, for everybody would flee on their own. It is often said today that Ukraine's statehood will collapse. Do you agree? We obtained independence much too quickly and had no time to form a revolutionary elite. But the absolute majority of the population is interested in independence. An isolationist policy is impossible and undesirable, we are against a complete break with Russia, but Kiev must become a new strong geopolitical centre. The slogan of Slav unity remains basic to us, and we do not want Russia to become a battlefield between Jewish and Japanese capital. Is a collapse in store for Ukraine? This is hardly probable. What may happen will be rather like the Polish variant. Is that why you study the experience of Solidarity? The most valuable experience for us is that of Lenin and his comrades in 1917. Telegraph, telephone, the post and banks? This is only the beginning of the building of the state. This is what happened in Germany in 1933 and in France when General de Gaulle came to power. Who of the 20th-century politicians arouses your warmest feelings? For UNSD fighters they are first of all Mao Zedong and Benito Mussolini. MN File: UNSD emerged during the putsch of August 1991 as a force intended to resist the so-called State Emergency Committee which organized the putsch. At present this unregistered militarized organization has from 3 to 5,000 members. About 500 of them took part in local wars. UNSD is amalgamated in the Ukrainian National Assembly. It has nominated 120 candidates, mostly in Western Ukraine, for the forthcoming elections to the Ukraine's parliament.
