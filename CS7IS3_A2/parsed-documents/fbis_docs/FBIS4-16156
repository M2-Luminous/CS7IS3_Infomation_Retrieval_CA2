On the same day, the Crimean Security Service received a telegram from the leader of the Security Service of Ukraine, Yevhen Marchuk, in which the above decrees are qualified as running contrary to the constitutions and the laws of Ukraine and Crimea, which regulate the order of appointments to and dismissals from this post. At the same time, Ivan Kolomytsev was told to continue fulfilling the duties with which he was charged. At present, the personnel of the Security Service are carrying out planned operational-procedural activity on guaranteeing security and maintaining civil peace and accord in Crimea. The press group summarizes this by indicating that the situation brought about by Yuriy Meshkov's decrees is fraught with the threat to the inviolability of the principle of lawfulness in the formation and activities of the security service bodies and the implementation of constitutional powers by this service. The press group expresses the hope that the precedent, which occurred exceptionally on the principles of legality, law and order, and respect of the rights and freedoms of every citizen, will be solved.
