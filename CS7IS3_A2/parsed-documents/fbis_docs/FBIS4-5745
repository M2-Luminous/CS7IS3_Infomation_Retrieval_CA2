"All those who spoke unanimously agreed with a political report presented at the conference. They said: Over the past two years, particularly in 1993, Quang Nam-Danang Province continued to maintain its socioeconomic stability. Its socioeconomic situation, in certain areas, continued to develop. Its economic structure is shifting in a positive direction. The latent potential of various economic components is being generated. The province's gross social product increased from 1,000 billion dong in 1991 to nearly 1,120 billion dong in 1993 while its budget revenue rose from 190 billion dong in 1991 to over 500 billion in 1993. Its average industrial output value increased 8 percent per year. A number of economic sectors developed fairly well such as marine products, import-export, and tourism service." Thanks to the growth of foreign economic relations, the industrial sector of Quang Nam-Danang Province is improving. "The construction of many industrial projects has started such as the Hoa Khuong cement factory and a local branch of the Hoang Thach cement factory. Various new industrial zones, including the An Don-Nuoc Man processing zone, are taking shape in Dien Nam and Dien Ngoc Districts, and in the southern part of Hai Van Pass." Weaknesses discussed during the conference consisted of "Quang Nam-Danang having fallen behind economically when compared with other localities. Its economic development is slow because there still exist many backward areas, particularly those in the mountain region. Delegates from Que Son, Tien Phuoc, and Tra My Districts reported that 50 to 60 percent of their local populations are now still in a state of food shortage due to the absence of farmland irrigation projects and other grass roots facilities." The conference unanimously held that "the main reasons for this situation were a failure on the part of the provincial party standing committee and people's committee to meet new development requirements." All participating delegates shared Comrade Vo Chi Cong's views expressed at the conference that Quang Nam-Danang does not lack talent. The problem is how to gather all the wisdom of this talent. In the period ahead, the province needs to promptly shift its economy in the direction of industrialization; achieve an industrial output value increase of 45 percent by 1995; specialize its agricultural, forestry, and fishery production; create more exports; step up the program to do away with hunger and reduce poverty; increase the annual export value to $50 million; and reduce the agricultural workforce to 60 or 65 percent of the total population in order to save manpower for the processing industry. "The midterm party conference of the Quang Nam-Danang Province party organization called for an annual gross domestic product increase from 10 percent upward." The issues of party building and internal unity were also fervently debated. "Many delegates pointed out that party building and party management at various echelons have displayed many shortcomings. A number of party cadres and members have suffered a dereliction in quality. Their knowledge is not current and their sense of discipline is poor. Personal jealousy has led to prolonged disunity among a number of cadres. Many delegates held that far from being an ethical problem of party cadres and members, corruption has become a political problem that has caused a loss of confidence among the people. This has been exploited by the enemy and has, of course, adversely affected the party's popularity." The conference regarded this as a central issue to be settled immediately in order to ensure the unity of thoughts and actions in the entire party organization.
