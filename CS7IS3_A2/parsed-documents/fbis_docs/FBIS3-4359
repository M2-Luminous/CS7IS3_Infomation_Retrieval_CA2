A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council made this statement when asked about the revisions presumptuously agreed by the Hong Kong authorities on the draft immunity regulation on land in the new territories. The revisions have caused strong protests from original local residents. The spokesman pointed out that the concept of "original residents in the New Territories" and the lawful rights of original residents, which were written into the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, should not be removed. The Hong Kong authorities should take the protests of the residents into consideration and handle the issue properly through full consultation with the original local residents in accordance with the Basic Law, thus avoiding man-made social instability and separation, he said. The spokesman noted that the British authorities had announced in 1898 that all land in the New Territories belonged to the British royal house following its forced lease of the land through unequal treaties, depriving original residents of the New Territories of their land-owning rights. That announcement was persistently resisted by local residents. As a result, the later draft immunity regulations on land in the New Territories ruled that farmland owners need only hand in nominal rents. Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration rules that the rent on rural land leased by original residents in the New Territories "shall remain unchanged so long as the property is held by that person (one who was in 1898 a resident of an established village in Hong Kong) or by one of his lawful successors in the male line."
