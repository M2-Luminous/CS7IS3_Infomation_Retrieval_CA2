Chilean Defense Minister Patricio Rojas had announced in Santiago on Monday the purchase from Belgium of 20 Mirage fighters of French design as part of the modernization of the Chilean Air Force. Following a joint sales mission by the Sabca [Belgian Aeronautic Construction Company] aviation company and the Belgian Air Force, Chile has shown an interest in 20 Mirage fighter bombers modernized under the Mirship [Mirage System Improvement Program] program in order to replace its Hawker Hunters which are now obsolete, Mr. Delcroix indicated in a communique. Mr. Delcroix reports that a Chilean Air Force delegation will be coming to Belgium in order to inspect the equipment which is being produced at the Sabca factory in Gosselies. This meeting should result in a contract being signed before 1 July, Mr. Delcroix added. Military and industrial sources report that a Belgian delegation visited Chile at the end of February in order to negotiate the signing of a letter of intent on 28 February concerning 20 aircraft, 15 BA single-seaters and five BD twin-seaters. The Defense Ministry has refused to confirm the amount of the Chilean contract, estimated to be 85.5 million dollars (about 3 billion Belgian francs) including spares, maintenance, and personnel training. This is the first big sale of heavy military equipment rendered redundant by the restructuring of the Belgian Army as decided by the government last year, observers note.
