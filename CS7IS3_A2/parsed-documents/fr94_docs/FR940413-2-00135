Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The purpose of the proposed rule filing is to amend several of the Exchange's fee schedules in order to capitalize on the competitive niches that the Exchange currently enjoys and to improve the Exchange's competitive position. The proposal would (1) establish a $250.00 non-refundable listing application fee, which upon acceptance by the Exchange for listing would be applied toward the $750.00 listing fee; (2) provide a $1.50 per trade credit on all non-internalized market orders ranging in size from 100 up to 2,500 shares; (3) reduce the specialist post clearing and cashiering fee from $1375.00 to $500.00 per specialist book per month; (4) eliminate charges on pre-opening trades and trades in CTA securities ranked above 1000; and (5) establish a security routing fee of $500.00 per month per BEACON User ID with stocks being routed to that ID. For purpose of the market order credit, ``non-internalized'' shall mean all orders directed to the Exchange in stocks in which the routing firm has no affiliation with or financial interest in the specialist operation registered in those stocks. In addition, specialists will be charged a new fee of $.50 per trade for certain market orders. The specific new language is as follows: [deleted language]; new language LISTING FEES Listing Application Fee: $250.00 per original listing application.
