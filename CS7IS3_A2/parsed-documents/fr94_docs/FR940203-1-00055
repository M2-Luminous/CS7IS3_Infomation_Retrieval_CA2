In particular, the EPA has often granted requests for extensions of public comment periods in previous reviews; in order to meet the accelerated schedule for the O 3 NAAQS review, however, the EPA intends not to grant such extensions during this review. Accordingly, potential participants in the review should take note of the process outlined in this notice and be prepared to respond promptly when opportunities to comment are offered. Given the scientific and technical complexity of the issues likely to be involved in the O 3 review, the diversity of scientific opinion that has characterized previous reviews of the criteria and standards for O 3 , and the need to ensure that its ultimate decision is soundly based, the EPA cannot, of course, provide any absolute assurance that it will meet all of the interim milestone dates indicated in Table 1. Completion of the necessary steps in a timely manner is also predicated upon the availability of adequate resources during the review process. However, the Administrator has emphasized a high priority on meeting the accelerated schedule outlined in this notice. To that end, the review process is well under way. The EPA initiated action to update the air quality criteria for O 3 in August 1992 (57 FR 38832). It held two peer-review workshops on draft health effects chapters of a revised Criteria Document (58 FR 35454) in July 1993. Additional workshops on draft air quality and ecological effects chapters (58 FR 48063) were held in September 1993. Since then, the EPA has discussed the schedule and process outlined in this notice with the CASAC (58 FR 59034). The EPA is also conducting exposure and risk analyses. A subcommittee of the CASAC met on December 16, 1993 to review methodologies (58 FR 63345). A further subcommittee meeting on risk analysis is planned for spring 1994.
