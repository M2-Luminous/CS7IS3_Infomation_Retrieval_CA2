A day earlier, the Internal Affairs Administration of Kiev's Radyanskyy Rayon initiated a criminal case to investigate the acts of hooliganism committed by two unknown persons on 15 January 1994 in the building occupied by Rukh. In the capital, as well as in Lvov and Odessa Oblasts, operational investigation groups were created to study all the circumstances of the incident. The groups include officials of the Procurator's Office, Security Service, and the Militia. The search continues: In Kiev, tens of thousands of facilities, in particular, railroads, wooded areas, and water reservoirs, were examined. Similar work was conducted in Lvov, where the victim previously lived and worked. There, M.I. Boychyshyn's [internal] passport was found in a mail-box. The investigators' group appeals to those who have found the passport with a request to give their particulars to the militia. We also ask the person who telephoned Boychyshyn on 15 January 1994 at 19:40 [local time] to respond. The search is based upon several versions. In particular, in connection with his participation in the election campaign, financial relations with representatives of business circles, possible unlawful acts on the part of criminal groupings, and also assumptions made by Stanislav Husak from Minsk (such information was spread by RUKH-PRESS on 13 April) on the involvement of Russian special services in Boychyshyn's disappearance, in view of the fact that the latter intended to hold, in Kiev, an international conference on the Balto-Black Sea oil reservoir. We once again appeal to all those citizens, who can provide any information on the circumstances of Mykhaylo Illyarovych Boychyshyn's disappearance, with a request to turn to the nearest militia department.
