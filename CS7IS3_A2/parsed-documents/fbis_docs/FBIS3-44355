In an interview with this reporter, Lou Yu-huai, general manager of the Guangdong Provincial Service Center for Foreign Businessmen, said that many foreign businessmen believed they would benefit from now on in the payment of staffers' and workers' wages in the hinterland and in the verification of funds. Lou Yu-huai explained that foreign businessmen had to use their foreign currency to obtain renminbi at the official exchange rate in order to pay the wages of staffers and workers in the hinterland, and the taxation administration constantly checked their foreign exchange receipts. In general, it was impossible for foreign-funded enterprises to avoid such legal channels. However, with the unification of the exchange rates, foreign exchange can be freely bought and sold; the dollar, which was 5.7 yuan at the official exchange rate, now can yield more than 8 yuan, and thus the cut in wage costs is self-explanatory. Second, according to regulations, the value of foreign investment in fixed assets in China must be calculated in renminbi, so every $1 million invested yielded only 5.7 million yuan at the official rate before the unification of exchange rates, when the funds were verified according to foreign exchange receipts. Beginning with 1994, however, every $1 million will yield 8 million yuan, meaning that every $1 million will yield an additional 300 million yuan, which will be a great benefit to any foreign businessman. Third, foreign businessmen also will benefit from this practice in the calculation of costs, for they now are freed from doing several calculations in accounting. However, this new policy might have negative effects on foreign businessmen. For example, viewing the present situation, the change in procedures can be slow in meeting the requirement of wide-ranging implementation of unification of exchange rates, and there will be some gaps in service. Foreign businessmen may find it difficult to feel comfortable with the confusion arising from the change. In addition, foreign businessmen all along have been "flexible" in their accounts because of the two exchange rates in price-fixing. When declaring taxes and profits, more often than not, it was a case of "superficial deficit, with actual profit." However, with exchange rates unified, it will be impossible to take advantage of the price difference "loophole" any longer. As for the reaction of the man on the street to the new central policy, psychological fluctuations still can be detected out of his seeming indifference. It was believed that the exchange rate on the market long had been based on the black market; the new policy served only to legalize the black market exchange rate, and there was nothing strange in that. However, this policy obviously has demonstrated a 70 percent devaluation of the renminbi. People recently have vied to exchange all the renminbi in their hands for hard currencies so as to reduce the risk of devaluation.
