About 20 riot police armed with assault rifles were deployed outside his home in Ikeja, a residential neighborhood to the north of the capital, and were blocking anyone from entering or leaving the premises. Another 60 policemen and an armoured vehicle were stationed at the entrance to the road leading to the Moslem billionaire's residence, according to an AFP correspondent at the scene. The aide said he was put under arrest at 4:00 a.m. About 100 Abiola supporters had gathered not far from the police cordon, the correspondent said, but there was no sign of unrest. Police warned Abiola Friday that he would be arrested and charged with treason of he went ahead with a plan to set up a "government of national unity" on Sunday, anniversary of the June 12, 1993 presidential vote. Last year's presidential poll was declared free and fair by international observers but annulled by then junta leader General Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities. Babangida was succeeded by General Sunni Abacha, who seized power last November. Abacha meanwhile is to make a national address on radio early Sunday, his office said in Abuja. Earlier Saturday a statement by the National Democratic Coalition, which heads the opposition, said Abiola has decided to put off forming a parallel government for "a few days." The statement said his decision was in response to an urgent plea from the Anglican Archbishop of Nigeria and other opposition leaders hoping to reach a last-minute compromise with the military regime.
