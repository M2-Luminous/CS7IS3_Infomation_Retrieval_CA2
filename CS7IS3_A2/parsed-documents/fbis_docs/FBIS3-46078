He stressed: Our propaganda and ideological work calls for arming our people with scientific theories, guiding them with the correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring them with outstanding works so that new generations of socialist-minded people who are endowed with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a sound education, and a strong sense of discipline can be continuously trained and fostered to provide a powerful ideological guarantee and to play a supportive role in forming public opinion in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Jiang Zemin said: Propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the overall situation in our undertaking to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all levels must attach great importance to this task; they must strengthen their leadership and earnestly shoulder responsibility in this regard. The conference was held at the Great Hall of the People this morning. Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren Jianxin, and other comrades attended the meeting, which was presided over by Ding Guangen. Jiang Zemin's speech consisted of three parts: first, the importance of strengthening propaganda and ideological work in the new period; second, the fundamental principles and main tasks of propaganda and ideological work; and third, efforts to strengthen and improve the party's leadership over propaganda and ideological work. In his speech, Jiang Zemin said: This national conference on propaganda and ideological work, which is being held in the crucial period of building a socialist market economic structure and of the modernization drive in our country, is a meeting of overall importance. The main tasks of the meeting are: to implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as of the party's basic line; and to study and arrange ways and means to strengthen and improve propaganda and ideological work in accordance with the principle of "simultaneously and strictly carrying out two tasks without relaxing efforts to attain either of them." Jiang Zemin said: In the current year, the basic policy of the work of the whole party is: under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, to comprehensively implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress, as well as by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to accelerate the building of the socialist market economic system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; to safeguard political stability, and promote all- round social progress. The overall mission of the whole party is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability. All party comrades must understand this mission of overall importance, submit to and serve this mission, and do a good job in accomplishing the relevant tasks in all fields. Jiang Zemin pointed out: The propaganda and ideological front is of immense importance. The history of past decades has shown that be it in revolutionary wars or in socialist construction, great victories are inseparable from propaganda and ideological work. This is a basic experience of our party. Attaching great importance to giving full play to the powerful role of propaganda and ideological work represents a major tradition and a major superior feature of our party. He said: The departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work shoulder a vital mission. To sum this up, we may say that this mission is to correctly publicize the party's theory, line, principles, and policies; and to reflect vividly the great practice of the masses, to mobilize all positive factors, to turn all negative factors into positive factors, to unite all forces that can be united, and to fight to accomplish the magnificent goal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. He pointed out: The new situation has made greater demands on the propaganda and ideological front. The party's theory, line, principles, and policies need to be publicized more penetratingly and widely so that they can be understood and grasped by the masses. The series of new measures taken by the party and the government to push forward reform must be convincingly explained in simple terms to the masses. New experiences created by the masses must be summarized and popularized; outstanding figures and their lofty spirits emerging from all fronts must be eulogized and propagated. The masses' increasing demands for spiritual civilization must be satisfied through all efforts. The multitude of problems arising in practice must be seriously studied and solved; ideological conceptual problems pertaining to the readjustment of interests which crop up in the course of reform must be redressed and resolved; and the negative tendencies prevailing in social life must be overcome. Our efforts to push forward reform and opening to the outside world and the modernization drive require China to better understand the rest of the world and the rest of the world to better understand China. All these facts point to the importance of propaganda and ideological work. We can accomplish great things as long as we pay greater attention to various problems, and we must not overlook them in any way. We must intensify our efforts and must not slacken them one iota; we must keep on improving and upgrading, and we must never stand still. Jiang Zemin said: Comrades on the propaganda and ideological front have made vigorous efforts and done a tremendous amount of work. On the basis of investigation and research and after summarizing our experiences and the new practices, we have developed a basic idea about carrying out propaganda and ideological work in the new situation and have further clarified the basic guidelines and principles, as well as the primary tasks and work arrangements. Now that the general policy guiding propaganda and ideological work has been laid down, the key lies in implementation, in doing our work in a down-to-earth manner, and in continuing to summarize our practical experience and to advance in a pioneering spirit. Jiang Zemin pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental principle guiding all party work. The propaganda and ideological front must firmly adhere to this basic guideline and use it as the guide for all of its work. Only by doing so can we ensure a correct orientation in propaganda and ideological work and the successful accomplishment of all our tasks. All party comrades, especially leading comrades at all levels and those engaged in propaganda and ideological work, must earnestly study Comrade Xiaoping's works, further enhance their consciousness and determination in carrying out propaganda and ideological work, and strive to use what they have learned in practical work. He said: The propaganda and ideological front is an extended front shouldering arduous tasks. It must uphold the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, earnestly carry out its work in all fields by focusing on the central task of economic construction, and actively push forward the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization. At present and for some time to come, we must pay special attention to the work in four respects. First, the most important task of the propaganda and ideological front is to arm the minds of all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all levels must earnestly organize and guide party members and cadres to study this theory. While continuing to successfully hold seminars for principal leaders at the provincial and ministerial level, we will train within two to three years, by groups and in stages, all cadres with party membership at and above the county and regimental level. We must make full use of the press, radio, television, publications, and other media to publicize this theory thoroughly. We must bring into play in studying this theory the backbone role of the five research centers established by the Central Party School, the State Education Commission, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the People's Liberation Army National Defense University, and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Second, we must persist in implementing the party's basic line and in properly guiding public opinion. Persisting in properly guiding public opinion means creating a type of public opinion conducive to further reform and opening up and to the establishment of a socialist market economy and the development of social productive forces. It means creating a kind of public opinion that helps strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system; that encourages and inspires people to make arduous efforts and to blaze a new trail for the country's prosperity, people's well-being, and social progress; that helps people distinguish between right and wrong, uphold truth, good, and beauty, and resist falsehood, evil, and ugliness; that promotes national reunification and unity; and that helps to bring peace of mind to the people and social and political stability. Third, we must strengthen ideological work to bring up a new generation of well-educated and self-disciplined people with lofty ideals and moral integrity. We must strengthen ideological and ethical education centering on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; carry out education in the spirit of plain living and hard struggle, and the principle of building the country through thrift and diligence; and carry out education on professional and social ethics and on national conditions. We must do a good job of mass ideological work. Fourth, we must adhere to the course of serving the people and socialism, uphold the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend, foster the main theme, and bring about a boom in socialist literature and art. Upholding the principles of serving the people and socialism and letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend are basic requirements for producing spiritual works and an important guarantee for the prosperity of propaganda and cultural undertakings. Fostering the main theme and advocating diversification reflect in a concrete way the orientation of serving the people and socialism and the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Fostering the main theme means, under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of the party's basic line, vigorously advocating ideas and spirits conducive to fostering patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; conducive to reform, opening up, and socialist modernization; conducive to national unity, social progress, and the people's well-being; and conducive to seeking a happy life through honest labor. Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: In the course of carrying out propaganda and cultural work and promoting socialist spiritual civilization, it is necessary to give priority to social benefit [she hui xiao yi 4357 2585 2400 4135]. Under this basic precondition, we must integrate economic returns with social benefit. It is important that we build spiritual civilization and strengthen its management. In discussing strengthening and exercising effective party leadership over propaganda and ideological work, Jiang Zemin said: We must solemnly place the question of giving equal emphasis to two fronts and doing well in both before the whole party; we must place this question high on the agenda of party committees at all levels. We should make it clear that the responsibility for a region's or department's propaganda and ideological work and progress in promoting spiritual civilization lies primarily with its party committee. Party committees at all levels, and their principal officials in particular, must conduct in-depth research and investigation, sum up experience, and improve propaganda and ideological work. Jiang Zemin said: Building a contingent of cadres who are upright, well versed in policy, and professionally competent to implement propaganda and ideological work. The key to strengthening the building of this contingent of cadres lies in successfully building its leading body. Party committees at all levels should demonstrate concern for such a contingent in terms of politics, ideology, operations, and material benefits and do a good job in building such a contingent. We must conscientiously implement the policy of respecting knowledge and talent, bring into full play the intelligence and wisdom of the vast number of intellectuals on this front, and do our best to bring up in force experts in all fields who will make an impact at home or even internationally. As for those making outstanding contributions, we especially care for and treasure them. He said: We must treat comrades on this front with understanding and support. We should passionately help them sum up experience and encourage them to go down to the grass-roots levels, to go deep among the masses, and to go into the realities of life so that they can draw nourishment from the creative and history-making activities of the masses to replenish and improve themselves. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: There is a large collection of men of talent on the propaganda and ideological front. The vast number of comrades on the propaganda and ideological front are loyal to the cause of the party and the people. The Central Committee trusts them and the party and people have high expectations of them. It is hoped that all of us will, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, work vigorously to make the country prosperous, keep forging ahead with all our energy, and make every effort to raise propaganda and ideological work to new heights. Present at the conference were responsible comrades and propaganda department directors of party committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, and responsible comrades in charge of propaganda and ideological work from the various central departments and committees. Also present at the conference were comrades attending the working conference of the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television; the State Council Information Office, the State Press and Publications Administration, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and RENMIN RIBAO, the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, and other departments and units.
