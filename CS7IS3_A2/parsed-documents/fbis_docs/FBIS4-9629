At about the same time, at the trade-political around-the-clock meetings related to reshuffling the cabinet, it was confirmed that a third deputy prime minister in charge of monitoring the so-called power ministries is being conceived. Thus it became clear that the demands of the forces that support the government have two main directions -- the first is directly related to the ministerial posts in industry and trade, the other -- to the army and certain aspects of our foreign policy. The logic of the changes in the government really is strange. It puts the stress on the economic bloc and the power ministries, while at the same time the claims of the main political forces -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD], and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] -- show beyond any doubt that it is the government's social policy that is the most vulnerable sphere. This government and this social minister -- Evgeni Matinchev -- did practically everything to stop the social dialogue with the trade unions and make it meaningless. In addition, the budget wages of 600,000 people were indefinitely frozen. The consumer-goods prices reached incredible heights. Matinchev and [Finance Minister] Stoyan Aleksandrov refuse to do anything under the convenient cover of market economy. By this, I mean market economy as they understand it. The experts remind us all the time that speculations have nothing in common with the market. However, it appears that this is not a sufficient argument to request the resignation of the first deputy prime minister, acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. The so-called political consultations related to basically reshuffling the cabinet are actually not the expression of some striving to work out a new formula through which the country will really be ruled by a strong executive power. The basic goal of those consultations is to redistribute the ministerial posts so that they will correspond to the newly announced claims of the political forces that support the government. The BSP, DPS, and NSD are trying to hide all this behind certain tragicomic differences as to what Professor Berov will present at the National Assembly on 27 April -- first the program and the then the cabinet's structure, or the two things together.
