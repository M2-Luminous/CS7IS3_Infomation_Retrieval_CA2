The brother Presidential Council chairman attended part of their eminence the 'ulema's meeting in al-Janad. He delivered a speech in which he said: I am pleased to attend this meeting, which encompasses a group of their eminence the 'ulema, in response to the invitation you extended to me and to brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid to meet on this great day, which is dear to our hearts and in which the Muslim world celebrates a glorious Muslim occasion [Prophet Muhammad's night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem], in this historic mosque that was built by a virtuous follower of the prophet, Mu'adh Bin-Jabal. This was the first mosque to be built in Yemen and on this pure soil. He added: How I wished that brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid was here in order to work together to preserve the great achievement of unity that reunited the Yemeni family after its estrangement and ended from our people's nightmare of division. We come here to protect our homeland against threats and challenges, and spare our people from the seditions hatched by those who do not wish them good, security, and stability. Our responsibility toward God and our people dictates that we should rise above trivial matters, selfish interests, and give priority to the supreme national interest. The Presidential Council chairman added: Because of the crisis, our people have for several months now been putting up with many problems and difficulties, which inflicted serious harm on them and caused major cracks in the ranks of the Yemeni family. They also had an impact on the national economy and spread fears and concern among all of our people--the old, women, men, and children. He added: Unity was achieved on 22 May 1990 through peaceful, democratic dialogue and respect for opinions and opposing opinions. We must abide by this principle, and not any other alternative, in order to spare our country any dangerous slips. You, the Yemeni 'ulema are meeting here after you have come from various parts of Yemen in order to fulfill a national and religious duty to unify ranks and stands, champion national unity, protect Yemeni unity, and spare our country all risks. The Presidential Council chairman added: You have a responsibility to say what is right and to stand against evil and those who fabricate seditions, ignite them, and benefit from their continuation; and against those who advocate division, secession, and breaking the national ranks. This is your national and religious duty, which you have to fulfill to please God and your conscience and people. The brother president said: Unity is a great action and a religious duty. It deserves that we sacrifice all that is dear and beloved to us to protect and nurture it. Unity was achieved to stay and to become further entrenched in the heart and conscience of every Yemeni. It will not be relinquished no matter the cost. The president said that he has agreed to all the points and demands that the brothers in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] put forth, as well as to the initiatives submitted during the various gatherings to safeguard unity and to spare the homeland any perils or challenges that endanger the march of its unity and its democratic course. The brother president said: We made concessions for the sake of Yemen and for the sake of the present and future of Yemeni generations, which depends on the entrenchment of unity that is protected by democracy. This is why we came here to unite our stands and resort to dialogue, reason, and logic and to search for effective means that will safeguard our national unity. National duty dictates that all of us must safeguard the great achievement, not to fall prey to our whims and private interests, and to reach understanding and not fight one another. We should also deprive those who sow sedition in our society of any opportunity for the shedding of Yemeni blood. We seek peace and stability for our homeland and tranquility for our society. The president referred to the practices that harm the homeland's unity and its democratic course, which certain irresponsible writers and newspapers carry out. The president said: On the personal level, we suffered greatly from these misdeeds, which violate all laws, norms, and ethics. We put up with them for the sake of unity and to entrench the democratic march in our country. However, some regrettably understand democracy to be slander and harm against others. They practice democracy in a flawed manner. The brother president emphasized that democracy represents responsible behavior and constructive criticism to carry out reforms and reach better things. The brother president pointed out the impact the crisis has had on the daily life of our people and the difficulties and great tribulation it had brought about. He reaffirmed the need to expeditiously emerge from this difficult situation in a responsible manner so that all will devote their efforts to constructive and useful work. He appealed to their eminence, the 'ulema to guide the sons of the people to the path of right and good and to what will enhance national unity and safeguard the homeland's unity, and to always be advocates of right and soldiers of justice and right, fearing no one but God. The meeting was attended by brother Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, member of the Presidential council; Field Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal; Qadi Muhammad Isma'il' al-Hajji, chief of the Higher Court and head of the Yemeni 'Ulema Society; and other officials.
