ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that comprise the deep-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary because the second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut apportioned to the deep-water species fishery in the GOA has been caught. EFFECTIVE DATES: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), April 22, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Senior Inseason Manager, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. An emergency interim rule (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) apportioned the Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit for trawl gear into bycatch allowances and seasonal apportionments thereof among fishery categories. In accordance with ยง672.20(f)(3)(iii), the deep-water species fishery, which is defined at ยง672.20(f)(3)(ii)(B), was apportioned 300 mt of Pacific halibut PSC for the second season, the period March 31, 1994, through June 30, 1994. The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating in the trawl deep-water species fishery in the GOA have caught the second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut apportioned to that fishery. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for each species and species group that comprise the deep-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA. The species and species groups that comprise the deep-water species fishery are: All rockfish of the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus, Greenland turbot, Dover sole, Rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, and sablefish. This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., April 22, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., June 30, 1994. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20.
