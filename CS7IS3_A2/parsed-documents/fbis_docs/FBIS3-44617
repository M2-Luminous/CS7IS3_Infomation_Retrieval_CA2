In his speech, Jiang Chunyun fully affirmed the numerous and fruitful achievements scored by all levels of people's congresses in ensuring and promoting the province's reform and opening up as well as modernization. Jiang Chunyun said: At present, China's socialist modernization has entered a new development stage and it is now at a critical moment. All party members, cadres, and masses, all party and government leading cadres at various levels in particular, must further enhance their understanding of the important position and role of the people's congress work under the new situation from the high plane of stabilizing the state, vitalizing the nation, developing undertakings, and promoting social progress. Also, they must exploit, in an even more conscious and positive manner, the important role of people's congresses at all levels in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: At present and during the foreseeable future, we should focus the people's congress work on drawing up local regulations, economic regulations in particular, and on drawing up as quickly as possible a number of local rules and regulations that are suitable for the demands of developing the socialist market economy in order to form within five years the initial form for a basic framework of the legal system that will ensure the orderly operation of the socialist market economy. We should further strengthen the supervisory function of people's congresses to ensure the materialization of the general goals and general tasks of the party. At present, we should give prominence to the supervision of law enforcement to ensure the effective implementation of the Constitution and laws. At present, the supervision of law enforcement should be focused on solving the problems of refusing to abide by existing laws, enforcing laws in a relaxed manner, refusing to deal with law breakers, using powers to replace laws and suppress laws, and taking bribes in violation of laws. We should actually give play to the role of people's congresses in opposing corruption and improving administrative honesty. Practice shows that one of the reasons for the emergence of some unhealthy trends and corrupt phenomena among party and government organs lies in the imperfect legal system and the lack of necessary supervision. The powers not subject to supervision will certainly lead to corruption. Focusing on using the legal system to eliminate corruption and improving administrative honesty, all levels of people's congresses and their standing committees should rapidly draw up and prefect the rules and regulations related to improving administrative honesty and should use rules and regulations to standardize and restrict the behavior of party and government organs and workers. We should give full play to the role of people's congresses and actually strengthen the building of people's congresses. We should also use a new idea, a new attitude, a new style of work, and new behavior to create first-class people's congress work and to meet the demands of new situations and new tasks. Li Zhen, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee, presided over the conference. Attending the conference were Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and vice governor of the province; Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Lu Maozeng, chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Tan Fude, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission; responsible comrades of the provincial people's congress standing committee, the provincial higher people's court, and the provincial people's procuratorate; responsible comrades of various city and prefectural party committees; responsible comrades of various city people's congress standing committees; chairmen and secretaries general of various prefectural people's congress work committees; and responsible comrades of the pertinent departments directly under the provincial authorities.
