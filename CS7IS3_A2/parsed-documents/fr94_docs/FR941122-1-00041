FR941122-1-00041 FR941122-1-00009 B. Amendment: New Source Requirements for Inorganic HAP Emissions from Coating Operations The EPA has received information that at least one facility is controlling inorganic HAP emissions from coating operations to a greater degree than that required in the proposed rule. This facility is using high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in addition to the filtration methods required in the proposed rule. Consequently, the EPA is proposing that §63.745 require new primer and topcoat application operations to use HEPA filters in addition to the requirements specified in the rule proposed on June 6, 1994. Finally, the EPA is proposing that these sources keep records of documentation supplied by the filter manufacturer that the filter being used meets the HEPA filter requirements specified in the definition in §63.742 being proposed by this notice. C. Amendment: Inclusion of Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operations for Use With Type I Chemical Milling Etchants As proposed on June 6, 1994, the rule would apply only to those chemical milling maskant application operations in which Type II chemical milling etchants are subsequently used. This was based on information the EPA received showing that no facilities had implemented controls (either low VOC product substitutions or control devices) on chemical milling maskant application operations for use with Type I chemical milling etchants. Since proposal, the EPA has received comment that there is at least one chemical milling maskant application operation for use with Type I chemical milling etchants (which are not currently covered in the proposed rule) with reduced organic HAP and VOC content levels. The information supplied to the EPA, however, did not detail the applicability of this chemical milling maskant to all Type I etchant operations. The MACT floor for chemical milling maskant application operations, as determined by the average of the best performing 12 percent of sources for which the EPA had emission information, included the use of control devices (e.g., carbon adsorbers) as well as low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling maskants. As mentioned above, the applicability of the low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling maskant for which the EPA received comment is unknown. However, the use of the same control device technology as used for Type II chemical milling operations is applicable to Type I chemical milling operations. Consequently, the EPA is proposing to eliminate the exemption in §63.747 for chemical milling maskants used with Type I etchants and require them to meet the same requirements as chemical milling maskants for use with Type II etchants. This will allow the use of any low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling maskant that meets the 160 grams per liter (1.3 pounds per gallon) organic HAP and VOC content limits or the use of control devices as specified in the proposed rule. D. Amendment: Requirement for the Capture of All Emissions by Control Devices The proposed rule required that whenever a control device is used to meet the emission limitations specified, the owner or operator must meet two provisions in order to demonstrate compliance. The first is that the overall control efficiency, taking into account capture and control efficiency, must be at least 81 percent. The second provision, as specified in §§63.745(c)(1), 63.747(d)(1), 63.749(d)(4)(ii)(A), and 63.749(g)(3)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule, requires that all of the emissions from the respective operations be captured and controlled by the control device. In addition, the latter two paragraphs specify that all emissions must be controlled other than ``incidental emissions that may escape the capture system.'' The EPA has reviewed these provisions based on comments that have been received concerning their enforceability. Based on this review, the EPA has concluded that the provision specifying an overall control efficiency is adequate to ensure application of MACT. The additional language only added confusion to the proposed rule without any added environmental benefit. The EPA, therefore, is deleting from the proposed rule the four paragraphs referenced above concerning the capture of all emissions from coating operations. E. Amendment: Reduced Recordkeeping Requirements for Low Organic HAP and VOC Content Primer The EPA has received information that a low organic HAP and VOC content (approximately 250 grams VOC per liter (2.1 pounds per gallon) less water and exempt solvents) military waterborne primer has been qualified according to military specification MIL&hyph;P&hyph;85582A, Type I, Class II. While this primer may not represent demonstrated technology for all types of uses, the EPA wishes to encourage the use of low organic HAP and VOC content coatings. Consequently, the EPA is proposing to amend the recordkeeping requirements of §63.752 of the proposed rule to require that only annual purchasing records be maintained on the use of any primer that contains a maximum of 250 grams organic HAP per liter (2.1 pounds per gallon) less water as applied and 250 grams VOC per liter (2.1 pounds per gallon) less water and exempt solvents as applied. This significantly reduces the recordkeeping from the monthly records required for coatings with higher organic HAP and VOC contents. F. Request for Comments: Depainting Requirements for Private, Corporate, and Small Commuter Aircraft The EPA has received comments that the proposed standards for depainting do not represent demonstrated technology for private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft. Specifically, the commenters stated that depainting of these aircraft cannot be accomplished through the use of non-HAP chemical strippers or media blasting methods. One commenter also stated that the physical characteristics of the coatings typically used on the exterior of private and corporate aircraft cannot be removed by the non-HAP chemical strippers currently on the market. Another comment concerned the use of a control device, such as carbon absorbers followed by a catalytic incinerator, to reduce emissions from depainting operations where HAP-containing chemical strippers are used as an alternative means of compliance.
