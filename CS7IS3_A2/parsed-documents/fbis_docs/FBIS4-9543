The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) cannot condone the creation of another Moslem ghetto in eastern Bosnia like Srebrenica," UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said. "That is unacceptable, and that is the issue we should be looking carefully at." He said the enclave's civilian population of about 50,000 is going to need "a permanent life support system" as the Serbs appear bent on making the region unlivable for the Moslems. He said one example of the Serb resolve was their destruction of the town's water processing plant during three-weeks of shelling that only stopped after NATO threatened airstrikes. Several relief officials here speaking on condition of anonymity said plans were "actively" underway for the possible evacuation of 20,000 people from the enclave. Meanwhile, Kessler said that UN efforts to provide assistance to the town residents have been hampered by Serb delaying tactics. Eric Chaperon, the UN Protection Force spokesman, said that the the Serbs on Tuesday prevented a UN convoy carrying building material from reaching the town. Kessler said the convoy should reach Gorazde Thursday adding that "the delays imposed by the Serbs are a violation of freedom of movement." He said that in order to survive, the enclave's residents would need "at least one convoy a day" and that refugees must be allowed to return to their homes.
