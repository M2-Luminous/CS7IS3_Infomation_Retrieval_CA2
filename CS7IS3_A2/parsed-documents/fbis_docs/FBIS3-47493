The meeting, which opened Monday in Mannerplaw, the DAB's headquarters at the border between Burma and Thailand, comes as joint pressure from China and Thailand has already resulted in part of the opposition negotiating a separate ceasefire with the junta in Rangoon. "We are scared of a border closure by Thailand, which would mean no more medical supplies for us," Em Marta told AFP. Marta is in charge of the foreign affairs department of the National Karen Union (KNU), the oldest and most powerful insurgent group fighting the Rangoon junta and whose positions lie right on the border with Thailand. According to Marta, the probability of the border's closing is something "we very much worry about and is the main reason" that the KNU has asked the DAB for a mandate to negotiate with the junta on behalf of all the opposition's various factions. [passage omitted] Marta said the "the SLORC doesn't matter so much, but with Thailand, it is another story. We feel the pressure is coming [words indistinct]. He was referring to recent measures by the Thai Government to limit and control the Burmese opposition operating in Thailand. The Burmese armed forces in December attacked positions held by Karens, killing five and injuring three, and suffering 20 dead and 30 injured in their own ranks, according to a Karen spokesman. [passage omitted] A founding principle of the movement was the refusal to negotiate as separate factions with the junta. "We need a mandate, or at least the support of the DAB, to negotiate," Marta said, adding that the first priority would be to obtain a ceasefire. "We feel that Burma needs peace," Marta said. "At this point, there are no more preconditions." The DAB had sought the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and opposition leader, who has been under house arrest since 1989, but this may no longer be a term, he said. He cautioned, however, "if there is no political concession (by the SLORC), such a ceasefire would only be temporary." [passage omitted]
