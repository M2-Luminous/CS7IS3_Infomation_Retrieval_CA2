This, at a time when the Palestinian people, inside and outside, are unanimous on suspending those talks until international protection is provided to them against the massacres to which they are being subjected by the settlers and the Israeli Army and for which the Israeli Government is totally responsible, and until the settlements are dismantled and the settlers are disarmed. Al-Najjab stressed that 'Arafat's acceptance of this invitation turns the Executive Committee meeting into a mere formality and a cover for a decision which he made alone and for which only he is responsible. Al-Najjab called on his colleagues in the Executive Committee to listen to the people's voice and adhere to their calls for protection and liberation from the settlers' belligerence. Al-Najjab pointed out that the U.S. position in the Security Council seeks to foil any serious resolution by the Council to condemn the crime, provide international protection, and implement its resolutions relating to the settlements, which it considers to be illegal and must be removed. Thus, it is clear that the aim of President Clinton's invitation is in harmony with the U.S. position in the Security Council and seeks to deflect the international campaign of condemnation against the Israeli Government. This position must be exposed instead of giving it credibility by quickly agreeing to go to Washington. The Israeli Government has declared its rejection of the Palestinian demands regarding international protection and disarming of the settlers. This proves that the expressions of condemnation uttered by Israeli officials are just words of consolation, whereas what is required is the adoption of practical measures that prevent the recurrence of such crimes. This increases our doubt about the Israeli Government's intentions to adhere to serious negotiations that really seek to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy and end the Israeli occupation. All this requires the Palestinian leadership to undertake a comprehensive reassessment rather than hastily agree to the resumption of the talks and to shifting them to Washington, while no shift has been made either in Israel's or Washington's position despite the gravity of all that has happened.
