This marks an important step in the country's advance towards a market economy. Reform of the foreign exchange system, announced by the People's Bank of China, is to unfold in the following aspects: To buy and sell foreign currencies through banks, with a standardized and unified inter-bank foreign exchange market established, while gradually phasing out the swap markets which are currently in operation; To cancel the exchange retainment and delivery systems practiced by Chinese enterprises, as well as the mandatory allocation of foreign exchanges. The state will no longer issue foreign exchange certificates (FEC) and ban the circulation of foreign currencies in the domestic market at the same time. From now on, the state will regulate the foreign exchange market mainly through economic and legal measures, to achieve the balance of international current account. The Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party decided to speed up the financial reform which is deemed to be one of the important parts of the economic reform. However, the success of the financial reform hinges on the on- going reform of the foreign exchange system. The dual-rate foreign exchange system, or the co-existence of the official rate and a swap market rate, have many drawbacks which have hindered the development of China's foreign trade and foreign investment. The original dual-rate system was difficult to manage and supervise. Moreover, it bred corruption. The reform will exert positive influence on many aspects, especially on China's further opening to the outside world. It will help attract more foreign investment, enhance efficiency in the use of foreign funds, and facilitate the flow of capital. By the end of 1992, a total of 100 billion U.S. dollars had flowed into China, equivalent to over 800 billion Chinese yuan. The figure was far more than the total amount of stocks and bonds the country issued for the same period, which stood at over 500 billion yuan. The reform will also make foreign exchange more available to Chinese enterprises. With necessary documentation, they will be able to buy hard currencies from the banks at any time. It is also beneficial to foreign investors, as they can register their capital and remit their profits at the same exchange rate. The reform of the foreign exchange system is beneficial to the resumption of China's status as a signatory of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China should, among others, abide by the GATT regulations on exchange rates, for the country's re-entry into the international trade system. The unification of the exchange rates has paved the way for China's goal of making the Renminbi a freely convertible currency and eventually keep it in line with the international markets. However, economists here said that there remained a lot of things to do to replace the old system with a new one which is still embryonic. The authorities will resort to economic and legal measures to realize their macro-economic regulations on foreign currencies and international current accounts and avoid fluctuations of exchange rates to ensure the continuous, speedy and healthy development of the country's economy.
