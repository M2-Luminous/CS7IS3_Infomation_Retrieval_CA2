The new proposal demands that Japan increase Motorola-formula mobile and car phones by about 240,000 in a year in service areas between Tokyo and Nagoya. Japan considers the proposal a demand for setting a numerical target, thus it is opposed to it. Because of this, negotiations between Japan and the United States over opening Japan's cellular phone market may become rough at the final stage. Nevertheless, because the proposal is not an official one put forward by the U.S. Trade Representative Office, Tokyo thinks that "we will eventually be able to persuade the United States to withdraw the proposal."
