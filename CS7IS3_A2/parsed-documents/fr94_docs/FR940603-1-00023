FR940603-1-00023 FR940603-1-00007 Under the moratorium, a vessel owner would continue to apply to the IPHC for a halibut vessel license, and to NMFS for a groundfish vessel permit. Since the State does not have authority to impose a moratorium on vessels, NMFS also would require a crab harvesting, processing, or support vessel participating in the crab fisheries in the Federal waters of the BSAI to obtain a Federal vessel permit. The State would continue to require a State vessel permit to participate in crab fisheries in State waters, and the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the BSAI would continue to defer much of the management of the fishery to the State. An owner of a support vessel that intends to participate in the moratorium fisheries from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1997, would have to apply for and receive a permit, but would not be subject to the moratorium eligibility requirements. Permits and licenses issued under the moratorium would remain harvesting privileges and the Secretary would have the authority to amend or revoke the moratorium and any harvesting privileges thereunder, if required for conservation of the resources. Eligibility Requirements As previously discussed, a vessel would be eligible to receive a permit or license if it has moratorium qualification and if its LOA does not exceed the applicable length restrictions. NMFS is proposing to implement the Council's length increase restrictions, or the 20 percent rule, by requiring the LOA of a vessel to be no greater than 1.2 times the ``original qualifying length'' of the qualifying vessel. This calculation results in a ``maximum LOA'' that the vessel may not exceed during the moratorium. The original qualifying length would be the registered length of a qualifying vessel that appears on the most recently submitted application prior to June 24, 1992, for U.S. Coast Guard Certificate of Documentation, or State documentation if the vessel is not required to have U.S. Coast Guard Documentation. For vessels with an original qualifying length of less than or equal to 104 ft (31.7 m), the maximum LOA would be 1.2 times the original qualifying length. For vessels with an original qualifying length greater than 104 ft (31.7 m) but less than or equal to 125 ft (38.1 m), the maximum LOA would be 125 ft (38.1 m). For vessels with an original qualifying length greater than 125 ft (38.1 m), the maximum LOA would be the original qualifying length. Vessels that satisfy both moratorium conditions would be ``eligible vessels.'' Vessel Reconstruction Vessel reconstruction means an adjustment in the LOA of a qualifying vessel. NMFS proposes that the maximum LOA for a qualifying vessel that is 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or less could be adjusted through reconstruction and the vessel would remain an eligible vessel under the following three conditions. First, if vessel reconstruction were completed on or before June 24, 1992, the LOA of the reconstructed vessel would become the new original qualifying length of the vessel. The new original qualifying length then would be used to calculate maximum LOA as described above under ``Eligibility Requirements.'' Second, if vessel reconstruction were started before June 24, 1992, but not finished by that date, the LOA of the reconstructed vessel would become the new maximum LOA for the vessel. No further increase in LOA would be permitted during the moratorium. Third, if vessel reconstruction were started on or after June 24, 1992, the maximum LOA would not be adjusted during the moratorium, and any increases in LOA as a result of reconstruction would have to be less than or equal to the maximum LOA for the vessel. Vessel reconstruction would begin and end with the start and completion of the physical modification of the vessel. The determination of any adjustment in maximum LOA for reconstructed vessels would have to be approved by NMFS and be based on documentation supplied to NMFS that verifies the beginning and ending dates of vessel reconstruction. NMFS proposes that acceptable documentation of the beginning and ending dates of reconstruction would be limited to a notarized affidavit signed by the vessel owner and the owner/manager of the shipyard that specifies the beginning and ending dates of the reconstruction. NMFS particularly requests comments from the public on this proposed method for documenting the beginning and ending dates of vessel reconstruction. Transfer of Moratorium Qualification Moratorium qualification would be transferable from a vessel to another vessel or person, or from a person to another person or vessel. Any transfer of moratorium qualification by a vessel would make that vessel ineligible. For the purposes of implementing the moratorium, vessel replacement would be considered a transferral of moratorium qualification. Additionally, to establish transfer of moratorium qualification by legal agreement, NMFS proposes that a written contract must exist that documents the transfer and includes certain information as proposed in ยง676.3(b)(1)(i).
