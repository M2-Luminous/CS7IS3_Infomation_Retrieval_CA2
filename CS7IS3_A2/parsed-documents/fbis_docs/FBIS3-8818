Radovan Karadzic said, the progovernment newspaper TA NEA reports, that he would soon visit Athens and suggest to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou that solutions to the war in Bosnia should be regarded as the EU's priority task. Karadzic will demand of Papandreou that Greece, in its capacity as EU president, should press for restarting the Geneva peace negotiations. As TA NEA stresses, the president of the Srpska republic expressed disappointment with the fact that the United States has taken a lead in resolving the crisis in Bosnia by bypassing the United Nations. Radovan Karadzic said he would like to see a solution for Bosnia taking place within Greece's EU Presidency mandate. Asked by Greek reporters about his views on the West's continuing habit of stubbornly bringing pressure to bear on the Serbs and threating them with military action, Karadzic said the Serbs would no longer accept any ultimatums. In Karadzic's words, the recent NATO ultimatum was knocking on an open door as it was a well-known fact that three days before that the Serbs had agreed to demilitarization with the UN secretary general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi. The Greek reporters asked Karadzic about his opinion of the crisis between Athens and Skopje. The president of the Srpska republic regards Athens' policy towards Skopje as correct. He stressed that The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] has a future only if it joins the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in some form of confederation -- something that would ensure the preservation of its integrity.
