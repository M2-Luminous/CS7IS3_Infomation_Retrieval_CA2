At journalists' request he answered several questions, in particular, those dealing with the urgent tasks facing the new parliament of Ukraine and the future of the Commonwealth of Independent States. [Begin Plyushch recording] Urgent steps should be taken to form a government which will take upon itself full executive power and get down to what we call the stabilization of our socioeconomic situation. The urgent task, therefore, is to elect the head of the government, to determine that he will be head of the executive power -- I am in favor of a prime minister being head of the executive power -- and charge him with forming his team within the shortest possible period of time and getting down to fulfilling his duties. If this is done in parliament, the next issue will be to introduce amendments into the law on the president, and determine what kind of president Ukraine will need in future. After that it will be necessary to pass the law on the plenary powers of local bodies of power, in other words, the law delimiting powers between the central executive power bodies and local bodies; work toward that end is already being done by the standing commissions of the current parliament. That is to say, the next step should be to solve the issue of local regional self-management and self-government. People in all oblasts have already understood that there must be no dyarchy, and they want and dream that the coming election in June will allow the formation of representative executive bodies and make territories controllable and manageable. The CIS is necessary. From the very first day, Ukraine has been within the CIS and today remains within the CIS. The CIS will work as a Commonwealth of Independent States only when all states want it to. For Ukraine alone to wish this would be far from enough. If we had examples to show, as it probably seems to some, that Ukraine has no full confidence in this Commonwealth and hence the results in Ukraine [as heard], why are there no results in those states which do have full confidence? Take Kazakhstan and Russia, for example. They have so much faith in each other that they consider themselves to be in the closest possible [word indistinct]; however, the results are the same. This is why I favor the idea that [pauses] ... For example, you remember that when we considered this issue in parliament I read out a letter, an appeal to the Ukrainian parliament, from [Yuriy] Shafranik, Russian minister of fuel and energy. There has been little change since then. Specific steps are being taken on the part of Ukraine, and you know that our Ukrainian Construction Ministry has concluded agreements according to which about 50,000 Ukrainian builders will work in Russia, primarily at the Yamal and Surgut deposits. Our builders have gone further; they will work not only at those deposits but have already reached Krasnodar and Stavropol regions. And they already have advantageous options. Generally speaking, when they say that the construction complex is ruined [pauses] ... In reply to a question, the construction minister told me that 16,000 people have left their concerns over the past two years, but 500,000 are ready to fulfill any programs. That is to say, money is needed. I believe the CIS is necessary as a commonwealth. We should not lose the market under any circumstances. As for the question of integration, it must be brought to a higher level, a cut above. In the construction complex this is normal. There are other (?industries) as well. Otherwise, people in Surgut, Yamal and other northern regions of Russia would be concerned, because they have no work there already. And if they have no work there, they will come back to Ukraine. And where can you immediately find work here? You know that in such localities, like Zhovtnevyy and others, 40, 50, or even 60 percent of the population are Ukrainians. Therefore, for a whole number of reasons the CIS is necessary, and I know that in the near future there will be another meeting at chief of state level, and our president, Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk], is going there with a whole package of proposals concerning the further integration of our national economy complex with the other countries. [end recording] [Announcer] You have been listening to an interview by Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, which he granted at his polling station. In reply to requests by journalists, he answered several questions, in particular, those concerning the urgent steps of the new parliament of Ukraine and the future of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
