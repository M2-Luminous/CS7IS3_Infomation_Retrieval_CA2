Li, who arrived here Monday [2 May] for a goodwill official visit at the invitation of the Finnish Government, said that China and Finland, with a traditional friendship, have been enjoying sound relations despite the changing international situation. He praised the Sino-Finnish relationship as a model of friendly cooperation between nations with different social systems. The CPPCC chairman attributed the successful Sino-Finnish relations to mutual respect, frequent exchanges, cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit, and consultations aimed at seeking common ground while reserving differences. Li said the two countries have tremendous potential for mutual cooperation because China is a developing country adopting a policy of reform and opening to the outside world while Finland is a developed industrial nation. He hoped that relations between the two countries will be enhanced to a new level on the current basis. Prime Minister Aho, who has visited China recently, was glad to meet with Li again and described his recent trip to China as a great success. Aho was satisfied with the development of relations between the two countries, saying that Finland and China have succeeded in developing their friendly cooperation in all fields since they forged diplomatic ties. Especially in recent years, he said, economic, trade and scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries has been boosted greatly. Through a repeated exchange of visits, he said, both countries have also found a lot of common ground and reached understanding on many issues. Helsinki is the first leg of Li's five-European-nation tour which will also take him to Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Belgium. This is the first time for China's CPPCC chairman to visit these countries.
