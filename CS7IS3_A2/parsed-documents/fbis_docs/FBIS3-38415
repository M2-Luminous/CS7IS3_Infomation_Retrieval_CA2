In a statement the spokesman said it was important to put the record straight. Our political editor Donal Kelly: [Kelly] Mr. Molyneaux made his claim in an interview in THE SCOTSMAN newspaper. He said that in talks with the British prime minister he had vetoed Dublin's proposals for a British-Irish convention which would have had power over a new northern assembly. However, the government spokesman said that at no stage in the drafting of the declaration had such a body been proposed. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, or convention, had always been intended as a consultative body, he said, and apart from the name change it was in all essentials what had been originally put forward. The spokesman also said that the first draft of the declaration contained eight paragraphs, not 30 as claimed by Mr. Molyneaux. At the behest of the taoiseach [prime minister] three or four additional ones in the final document recognized Unionists' fears and concerns. He added that there appeared to be some confusion with the draft of the leaked Irish paper, which had never been submitted to the British Government, and which had been intended for the entirely separate talks process.
