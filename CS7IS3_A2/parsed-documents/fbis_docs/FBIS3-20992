On 17 December, the CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research] announced that researchers at two of its Grenoble laboratories had obtained mercury cuprates that are partially superconductive at temperatures ranging from 190 Kelvin [K] (-63 degrees Celsius [C]) to 280 K (+7 degrees C), thus beating the 250 K (-23 degrees C) record announced less than 24 hours before by a team of the Higher School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry of the City of Paris (ESPCI) headed by Michel Lagues--which record, according to the researchers themselves, remains to be verified. Although these results were obtained by different methods and with different compounds, nevertheless they prove the existence, long in doubt, of superconductivity at a very high "critical temperature" (below which a material will conduct electric current without opposing any resistance to it). Less than three months ago[.sup]1[/], the record was only 157 K, at a pressure of 235 kilobars (about 235,000 atmospheres), whereas the new results were achieved under normal pressure. The Grenoble researchers, at the Research Center on Very Low Temperatures (Jean-Louis Tholence, Benedict Souletie, Olivier Laborde) and at the Crystallography Laboratory (Catherine Chaillout, Jean-Jacques Capponi, Massimo Marezio, and Miguel Alario Franco) obtained mercury cuprates, consisting of mercury, barium, calcium, and CuO[.sup]2[/] copper oxide, and more precisely with [sic] the phase Hg-1223 (HgBa[.sup]2[/]Ca[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]8+d[/]), as well as Hg-1245. What did the team headed by Jean-Louis Tholence and formed nearly seven years ago observe? The two "signatures" of superconductivity: a sudden drop of electric resistance (in seven of the samples) and the "diamagnetic transition," which shows as an apparent magnetization in a direction opposed to that of the magnetic field applied to the sample (on the 15 or so samples), at temperatures ranging from 190 K to 280 K, depending on the compounds. According to Jean-Louis Tholence, the record, a "superconductive transition" at 280 K, was observed on "one percent of the sample volume." Its structure remains to be determined in order to obtain samples with larger "superconductive" fractions. A report on this research will be published on 3 January in the American review PHYSICS LETTERS.[.sup]2[/] At the end of September, the Grenoble physicists had already achieved a record, reaching a critical temperature of 157 K in a mercury cuprate (Hg-1223, already), but subjecting the sample to a very high pressure: 235 kilobars. Like Paul Chu and his team at the Houston University, they used the fact that, in these cuprates, bringing atoms closer together (which can be done by applying pressure) will increase the critical temperature. In November 1992, the Crystallography Laboratory had discovered the first compound of the family, Hg-1201 (HgBa[.sup]2[/]CuO[.sub]4[/]) with the collaboration of Serguei Poutiline of the Lomonossov University in Moscow, who was in Grenoble at the time. The Grenoble researchers' samples measured about 10 cubic millimeters. The material in which the ESPCI team[.sup]3[/] observed a "resistive transition" at 250 K--i.e. a sudden decrease of electric resistance, "by a factor of 100,000," which led the researchers to believe that it involved a superconductive transition--was a bismuth cuprate, of the BiSrCaCuO family (bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper oxide), deposited on a substrate in the form of a 30-nanometer thick film. In addition, the characteristics of the phenomenon--in particular its non-linearity, i.e. the anomalies observed in the current/voltage ratio (which normally increase [sic] in a linear manner)--"point to the existence in this material of a superconductive phase at a still higher temperature, which a few minor changes might make evident." This result, an account of which was published in the American weekly SCIENCE,[.sup]4[/] was obtained through long and persistent research performed in collaboration at the Tel-Aviv University (Guy Deutscher), the Higher Normal School (Philippe Monod, Nicole Bontemps), the Pierre-et-Marie-Curie University (Julien Bok, also at the ESPCI), and the Institute of Materials Sciences and Radiation or ISMRA (Guy Raveau) in Caen. Actually, back in 1986 a Surfaces and Superconductors team was created at the ESPCI; the following year, the team leader, Michel Lagues (with the support of Jacques Lewiner, scientific director of the ESPCI, and Julien Bok) decided to attempt the development of thin-film superconductors. To deposit these films on a substrate, one atom layer at a time, the ESPCI decided to acquire a machine that Riber, the French manufacturer of epitaxial facilities (which currently supplies 50 percent of the world market) took two years to develop, jointly with the ESPCI team. Although the initial results were disappointing, which explains why many teams throughout the world became discouraged--actually, in cuprates, atoms are not always willing to cooperate and grow in a single plane (a phenomenon which Michel Lagues proposed to call "infinite phase" growth)--the team managed to master this method of "epitaxy through imposed sequence of atomic layers," which is continuously controlled by electronic diffraction, and they prepared their first sample, with three layers of copper oxide, and then, two years later, the present compound with eight CuO[.sup]2[/] layers. The technique was covered by a patent application and a structure was set up jointly with Sofinnova for "the industrial implementation of this research." Although the diamagnetism of the sample remains to be verified (a difficult operation considering the thinness of the film, which tests the sensitivity of measuring instruments), the ESPCI seems confident. These results, they estimated, "should open a new field for the study of the superconductive properties of cuprates," and above all "should make it possible to achieve the goal pursued for 15 years by many laboratories throughout the world: to dispense with cryogenics, which until now was required to achieve superconductivity at normal pressure." With the results of these two teams, the wild hope of obtaining superconductive materials at room temperature therefore seems to be taking shape. Although no "superconductor market" can be envisioned within the next five years, as Michel Lagues pointed out on 17 December, nevertheless huge long-term prospects are opening up in the low-current field, i.e. in electronics and data processing.
