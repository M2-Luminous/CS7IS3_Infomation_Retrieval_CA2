The directive points out: The total amount of debts to be collected nationwide during the second phase will include 6,000 billion dong, over 200 million U.S. dollars, and nearly 10 billion (Japanese) yen. So far, over 70 percent of it has been listed, determined, and confirmed and over 500 billion dong in debt have been paid off. A number of localities and sectors have analyzed the reasons for indebtedness, dealt with a number of cases of breaches of stipulations on financial management and debt repayment by various state enterprises and other economic organizations. However, the plan for all-out debt liquidation efforts in the second phase has been carried out very slowly. We have only been able to list, determine, and confirm the amount of debts. Up to 30 percent of of the debts listed so far have still not been determined and confirmed, while the majority of those that are have not been liquidated or dealt with. Because of a lack of close guidance, a number of ministries, sectors, and localities have adopted a wait- and-see attitude, have been evasive, and have not been decisive when it comes to debt settlement. To step up debt liquidation and debt solvency and to conclude the second phase of debt liquidation within 1994 so as to reestablish financial order and bring back normal work conditions for enterprises, the prime minister hereby decides: Debtor units must make full use of their existing sources of capital, including cash, assets, goods, real estate, equipment, and other valuables in their efforts to liquidate all their confirmed debts. These cover those owed to domestic enterprises, foreign debt, bank debts, and budget debts. As for state enterprises that are still active, their management organs must make them pay their debts within a set period. For enterprises that have already been dissolved, deactivated, or integrated into other enterprises, responsible organs must work out specific measures in accordance with the stipulations now in force to ensure that every enterprise concerned repays its debt. From 1 July 1994 onward, the resolution of debts for insolvent firms must be carried out in accordance with the law on enterprise bankruptcy. All cases of intentional delay or evasion of debt repayment will be liable to administrative penalties and disciplinary measures taken by relevant party organizations, if the debtors are party members. In serious cases, violators will be subjected to criminal liability as stipulated by the law regardless of their position. Debt liquidation and debt solvency must be carried out in accordance with guidance memoranda already promulgated, resolutely and urgently in the following ways: a. Debts already listed and confirmed among state enterprises that are still active must be settled immediately. The standing board of the Central Steering Committee for Debt Liquidation must guide debt liquidation and debt solvency-related activities in accordance with procedures applied in the first phase. b. For debtor state enterprises already dissolved, deactivated, or merged with other firms, the relevant debt liquidation committees established to determine the property of these enterprises are responsible for the debt liquidation task. In the event the debt liquidation committees no longer exist, the management organ and the one who endorsed the decision to establish the debtor units are responsible for resolving the debt liquidation issue. All property and capital of debtor units that have already been mustered, transfered, or used for other purposes must be recovered for debt repayment. As for debts already guaranteed by paper, in the event debtor units become insolvent, the guarantor units or individuals must shoulder the debt on behalf of the debtor units. For enterprise management cadres who, out of their irresponsiblity, cause a loss of capital and property or who have been tempted to corruption and malfeasance while in office, resolute measures should be taken to force them to pay compensation. Depending on the severity of their offenses, they must be subject to criminal liability and have their assets seized. The debt liquidation committee of the managerial echelon to which a debtor state enterprise belongs must take measures to list the property of the debtor unit concerned for sale to recover money for debt liquidation purposes. The debt liguidation committee concerned is also authorized to confiscate the assets of debtor enterprises which have been dissolved, deactivated, or merged with other enterprises for debt liquidation purposes. For debtor enterprises that have been dissolved, deactivated, or merged with other enterprises, in addition to inspections of their property and the full recovery of everything available for debt liquidation, we must clearly specify the collective and individual responsibilities of those organs that have ordered the founding, dissolution, or merger of these enterprises.
