The country needs a good opposition, if it refuses to be satisfied with that conducted by [League Secretary] Bossi within the government. It needs one both because we have a government composed of very diversified forces that has to carry out some enormously difficult tasks: This also makes the opposition's task more difficult, since it will have to wisely alternate stances of strict monitoring and counteraction with open cooperation. It also needs one because we have two oppositions now, one of which has by no means accepted the realignment of our political life between two poles. Therefore the part of the opposition that has accepted (and, indeed, stimulated) this realignment bears an even greater mission. Will Occhetto's resignation succeed in stimulating within the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], and the Left as a whole, a response equal to this mission? Those who, despite the evidence of the facts, still hope for an evolution of our political system toward a normal and civilized democracy of rotation can now only hope for this. However, there are two major difficulties. The first concerns the opposition that refuses to accept bipolarism -- the PPI [Italian Popular Party] and the Pact. The PDS and the left-wing forces can do little about them, since the responsibility and the decisions are not theirs. But this little is important: They can adopt a profile and a strategy which (while safeguarding a democratic left-wing identity and, indeed, making it clearer) will make an alliance of the center and left- wing forces desirable and beneficial. This leads us to the second difficulty, the internal one within the PDS. Leaving aside wrenches and splits, the PDS as a whole has not changed much, either with regard to the people that lead it or with regard to its organizational structure. And these two things go hand in hand, since the leaders are the expression of this organizational structure; it is they, with the federation and section secretaries, with officials, activists, and party members, who maintain the relations of acquaintance, trust, and mutual loyalty. But this weighty organization, the fact that it is part of a long history, constitute both an asset and a drawback. They are an asset inasmuch as they grant the PDS social and regional roots that not even the Berlusconi hurricane has managed to dismantle, just as Craxi before him failed to do so. And now, as almost the whole of the Left of noncommunist origins has disappeared, these roots are all the more valuable. They are a drawback inasmuch as they make the PDS very cumbersome in its movements -- a party which, even more than in its adversaries' eyes, is (formerly) communist in the minds of its members. Being aware of this, Occhetto tried to impart a greater element of leadership to his secretaryship: The rejection of this approach was due much more to the nature of the party (which is neither Forza Italia nor Craxi's Italian Socialist Party: superlight parties) than to any personal shortcomings on his part. This is why we must not expect too much from the debate that will begin and from whichever leader is elected. In its own way, the PDS is too "democratic," too responsible to the opinions and feelings of its activists and members to be able to introduce any drastic innovations. And in any case, why should it do so? Would it not thus risk losing a precious heritage? So it is entirely unrealistic to expect that the PDS could elect as its secretary a liberal such as [Venice Mayor] Cacciari or others like him, virtually unknown to the party structure. Rather, it is permissible to expect a step forward in the right direction. First, an in-depth debate on party strategy, on the election defeat, and on the tasks that the PDS must perform as an opposition force. Next, the choice of a leader who is both accepted by the organization and the members but nevertheless as little imbued with communist tradition as possible, and as open as possible to modern cultural tendencies, and who is capable of thoroughly renovating the organizational structure that is now paralyzing the party. There are not many candidates. And there is a strong fear that we will miss the innovative capacity and the courage of Occhetto, with all his defects and weaknesses.
