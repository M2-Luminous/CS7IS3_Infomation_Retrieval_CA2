Here is our radio comment on this event: The MIA Office in Hanoi said: A total of 102 U.S. experts will take part in the operation, which will run until 19 July, covering 27 northern, central, and southern provinces of Vietnam. One hundred Vietnamese will join the eight search teams, five of which will excavate U.S. Air Force crash sites, while the three others make interviews with the local population. By its concrete deeds, Vietnam has always proved its goodwill in solving the MIA issue. It has many a time confirmed that the MIA issue is a pure humanitarian question. Vietnam has done and will do its best to cooperate with the U.S. in solving the MIA issue. It is suitable to Vietnam's humanitarian tradition. In 1993, the two countries also gained encouraging results in solving this question. Vietnam has handed over to the U.S. side 580 sets of remains of the American servicemen, and joint expert teams of both sides have conducted three searches in northern, central, and southern provinces of Vietnam. Colonel of the U.S. Marines Mr. (John Brennon), head of the MIA Office in Hanoi, said thanks to Vietnam's effective cooperation and support, they have achieved encouraging results in solving MIA issue. Especially in late 1993, for the first time, Vietnam and Laos cooperated with the U.S. to conduct searches in areas between Vietnam and Laos border. Recent developments prove that the past has been closed and the relations between the two countries has been developing positively, creating favorable conditions for the solution of the MIA issue. Vietnam remains cooperative with the U.S. to effectively solve this issue.
