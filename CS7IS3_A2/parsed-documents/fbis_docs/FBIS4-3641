"We hope and believe that the Indonesian Government will properly settle this case so that people there can enjoy a stable and happy life," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. "China is a friendly country to Indonesia," Wu stressed. Anti-Chinese riots in the Sumatran capital Medan left one ethnic businessman dead and scores of Chinese-owned businesses sacked. There is widespread resentment in parts of Indonesia against the country's wealthy ethnic-Chinese minority, which comprises a mere three percent of the population but controls a disproportionate share of economic wealth.
