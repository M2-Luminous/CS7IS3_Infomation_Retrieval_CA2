Since that time, the World Ocean has become truly a storehouse of spent nuclear raw material... Great Britain has dumped three-fourths of all the world's RAO into the ocean, performing 34 burials of solid radioactive fuel in 15 sites in the North Atlantic, The Minch, the Bay of Biscay and in the region of the Canary Islands in the period from 1949 through 1982. The mass of dumped containers comprises 74,052 tonnes, with an overall activity of 949 kCi [kilocurie]. The disposal of liquid RAO from atomic industry enterprises by means of dumping through pipelines into the Irish Sea was also widely practiced in England. And this too was a considerable amount. From 1974 through 1982 the waste products dumped annually exceeded an overall activity of 100 kCi. The total scope of the dumping was so great that its effects were seen as far as the Barents and Karsk Seas. The Netherlands, in the period from 1967 through 1982, had 14 cases of RAO dumping at four sites in the North Atlantic at a depth of 3,200 - 5,200 meters, with a mass of 19,162 tonnes and overall activity of 9.1 kCi. France has had two cases of dumping RAO into the Atlantic Ocean. The mass of dumped waste comprised 14,299 tonnes, with activity of 9.54 kCi. In 1979, waste from nuclear enterprises was dumped into The Minch. Switzerland has dumped RAO 12 times in the period from 1969 through 1982 at three sites in the North Atlantic. The mass of the materials dumped comprised 5,321 tonnes, and their overall activity was 119 kCi. The USA, in the period from 1949 through 1967, has dumped 34,282 containers of RAO with overall activity of 79.4 kCi at 11 sites in the Atlantic. In the period from 1946 through 1970 it dumped 560,261 containers with overall activity of 15 kCi at 18 sites in the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, during the period of operation of the nuclear fleet, the U.S. naval forces have lost two nuclear submarines--the ``Thresher'' (April of 1969) and the ``Scorpion'' (May of 1968). Together with the first nuclear submarine alone, there turned out to be around 270 kCi in fission products at the bottom of the ocean. Plus the loss of a number of nuclear weapons. Japan performed dumping of RAO into the Pacific Ocean near its shores in 1956-1969. It performed 12 disposal operations at six sites, dumping 3,301 containers with overall activity of 0.416 kCi. Belgium has dumped RAO 15 times, in The Minch and the Bay of Biscay, disposing of 55,324 containers with overall activity of 57.24 kCi. This list is rounded out by Germany, Korea, Italy, New Zeleand and Sweden, through whose efforts the overall activity of RAO dumped into the World Ocean has been brought up to 1,240 kCi. This, we will emphasize, is without taking into consideration the waste from plants processing nuclear fuel, lost nuclear weapons and other sources of ionizing radiation, sunken nuclear submarines and radionuclides which have found their way into the ocean as a result of underwater nuclear explosions. However, a number of specialists maintain that the real number is somewhat higher. Yet the main mass of radioactive waste--over 98 percent--is buried in the Atlantic Ocean. We will note that in recent years, as a result of the sharp criticism of this practice, all the states have reduced or discontinued altogether their dumping of RAO into the seas. Yet in spite of this, they have reserved the right to dump radioactive waste in the World Ocean. In Great Britain and France the possibility of step-by-step dumping of RAO into the sea has been officially granted--by the Convention on Protection of the Marine Environment in the Northeast Atlantic--until the year 2018. And what about Russia? Or more precisely, the USSR, since it is specifically from it that we have inherited the problems of dumping radioactive waste in the seas. And so, the first dumping of RAO in the USSR was performed in 1959 and was associated with the testing of nuclear submarines and the nuclear ice-breaker ``Lenin.'' In September of that year, 600 cubic meters of waste with overall activity of 20 mKci were dumped into the White Sea. In 1960, 100 cubic meters of liquid RAO with overall activity of 200 mCi were dumped from the nuclear ice-breaker ``Lenin'' near Gotland Island (Gulf of Finland). That year marked the beginning of the practice of regular dumping of liquid radioactive waste, and 1964 marked the start of dumping of solid RAO into the northern and far eastern seas. Graphic Let us begin with the North. According to the report by the governmental commission on questions concerning the dumping of radioactive waste at sea, in the northern region of the USSR, and now in Russia, there are four regions for dumping liquid radioactive waste and disposal of solid radioactive waste. These are located generally north of the 72nd parallel and west of Novaya Zemlya. These regions were selected by the staff headquarters of the Northern Fleet in 1960-1966 and approved by the Naval Fleet Main Staff Headquarters. Up until 1986, the Murmansk Steamship Line also performed such dumping of RAO in the regions designated for the Northern Fleet. The dumping was extremely non-uniform, and the maximal values of activity were noted in 1965 (northeastern part of the Barents Sea, around 1,000 Ci), in 1975 (central part of the Barents Sea--800 Ci and Karsk Sea--8,500 Ci), in 1988 (northeastern part of Barents Sea, around 5,300 Ci), and in 1989 (as a result of the accident of the nuclear submarine at Ara-guba, 2,000 Ci). In a breakdown by seas, the level of overall activity is distributed as follows: Baltic--0.2 Ci, White--100 Ci, Barents--12,153 Ci, Karsk--8,500 Ci. On the whole, it is 24 kCi. Is this a lot? For comparison we may cite the following fact: Studies performed by a scientific expedition in 1985-1986 showed that the underwater current of the Gulf Stream in that year alone from the North Atlantic--the site of constant dumping of RAO by Great Britain and France--has brought us radioactive waste with overall activity of around 24 kCi. As much as we dumped in the northern seas over a period of 30 (!) years. The Far Eastern region. Since 1966, the USSR performed dumping of RAO in the Far Eastern seas in 10 regions. The greatest amount of radioactive waste (by volume) was dumped near the southeastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula. And the greatest amount by overall radioactivity was dumped into the Sea of Japan. The maximal amount of dumping in terms of radioactivity occurred in 1975 and 1985-1987. The overall radioactivity of the RAO comprised 18,565 Ci. In the opinion of specialists, considering the huge water area in the Far Eastern region, the RAO dumped by the Pacific Fleet comprises no more than a few percent in the balance of anthropogenic radioactive pollution, and therefore cannot cause an ecological catastrophe. This is true in full measure also of the Fall (1993) dumping of RAO by the ships of the Pacific Fleet. ``The dumping in the Sea of Japan in October,'' emphasized the head of the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Ecological Safety Main Administration, Viktor Kutsenko, in a speech presented at a recently held ``roundtable'' on problems of dumping RAO in the seas, ``posed no danger to the environment. And subsequent dumping, which will be practiced in this region until the end of next year, will also not pose a hazard. We may even not consider this waste as being radioactive.'' Nevertheless, according to Kutsenko himself, an ecological threat really does hang over the Far East. But the reason for it, as it turns out, is not the radioactive waste which has been dumped into the sea, but that which is being stored in special tankers of the Pacific Fleet. This problem is confirmed also by specialists at the VMF Glavkomat [Naval High Command]. In the opinion of one of them, Captain 1st rank Yevgeniy Romanov, the TNT-5 and TNT-27 industrial tankers loaded with liquid radioactive waste are in such a poor technical state that they may sink at any time. Then the huge concentration--several hundred cubic meters--of radioactive waste would really cause a catastrophe. In order to avoid this, the decision was adopted to begin dumping in the water basin of the Sea of Japan. The dumping, I repeat, is caused by technical necessity. And even if under the pressure of the world community we will have to discontinue such actions in neutral waters, the specialists at the VMF Glavkomat will insist on at least one-time dumping within the limits of Russian territorial waters. Of course, the dumping of radioactive waste in the World Ocean cannot continue for long. Yet today, practically in the entire world, the technology of processing radioactive waste lags behind the demands. Here in Russia, one other problem is added to this. Despite the fact that we possess sufficient scientific and technical potential to create the necessary conditions for processing liquid RAO into solid and for its subsequent disposal, we cannot take serious steps forward due to the shortage of finances. And a significant amount of these will be required. According to preliminary estimates, around 10 billion rubles (R) would be needed to solve the problem of radioactive waste in the Pacific Fleet. In the Northern Fleet--approximately half that amount would be needed. For a full resolution of the problem in the country--several hundred billion rubles would be needed, and with application of Western technologies--several hundred million dollars. However, it is erroneous to think that this problem is Russia's alone. The World Ocean is the cradle of life on the planet, and all countries which consider themselves civilized must apply their efforts to keep from destroying it.
