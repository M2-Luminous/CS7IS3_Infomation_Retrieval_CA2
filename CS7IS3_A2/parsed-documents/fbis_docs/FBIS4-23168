This could include forcing banks to disclose details of loans and deposits. ANC Banking and Finance President (Leo Morrison) says an act to this effect is to be tabled soon for discussion. He told a conference in Pretoria that a similar act in the United States had virtually outlawed discrimination by banks on the basis of gender or race. Banks there were obliged to disclose detailed information on deposits and loans by bank branches. Details of rejected loan applications, for example for mortgage bonds by members of specific communities, were also made public. Mr. (Morrison) said the American legislation could provide the basis for similar legislation in this country.
