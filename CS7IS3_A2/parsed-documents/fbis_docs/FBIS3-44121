Commissar for Refugees Samuel Mhiribidi has confirmed the presence of Malawian citizens in Harare, but he said that he does not know whether they belong to the "Young Pioneers" group because none of them presented themselves as a member of this organization. Mhiribidi said that there are some who have not yet presented themselves to the authorities, but some Malawian nationals residing here have told us that the aforementioned persons are members of the "Young Pioneers". Until last month, the "Young Pioneers" were the youth wing of President Kamuzu Banda's Malawi Congress Party, one of the most feared organizations in Malawi. Charles Kadama Manga, head of consular services in the Malawian Embassy in Harare, told LUSA that despite the fact that he does not have details on the aforementioned people, it seems "unreasonable" to him that they are seeking political asylum in Zimbabwe, adding that the Malawian authorities, including President Banda, have appealed to the Pioneers to return to Malawi, promising that they would not be tried for their crimes. About 7,000 Pioneers took refuge in the bush following violent clashes between the group and the Malawi Army that broke out after two soldiers were shot dead. The commissar for refugees has favored the decision to receive the group, stating that it is the country's policy to shelter people who flee their countries alleging political persecution. Mhiribidi said that the OAU Convention stipulates that granting refugee status does not mean hostility toward one's country of origin. The announcement of the presence of "Young Pioneers" in Zimbabwe comes less than one week after the Mozambican and Malawian Governments agreed on the repatriation of members of this organization who had penetrated the Mozambican territory. The "Young Pioneers" entered Mozambique from the Milange border area in Zambezia Province, heading for Tete Province. It is believed that they headed for Tete because it is the last province before reaching Zimbabwe. Malawi has a border with the Mozambican Provinces of Niassa, Zambezia and Tete, and out of these only Tete has a border with Zimbabwe. The agreement on the repatriation of the "Pioneers" from our country followed a request by the Malawian authorities, after talks between the Joint Defense and Security Commission of the two countries.
