Speaking of his recent tour of the Volga region and Russia's far north he said he had seen a sharp economic decline and a sharp rise in crime. He said that if this trend continues, the introduction of extraordinary measures by any government is inevitable within the next few months. Zyuganov also spoke of what he called favorable symptoms: All the regions he visited have swung to the political left and the position of the Communist Party has strengthened greatly. He said that what is called the democratic government has no prestige in these regions. He said that the best next move before the introduction of a state of emergency would be that suggested by the Accord for Russia movement: To work out a common opposition program, propose a team capable of carrying it out, unite political efforts and win over industrial circles and trade unions.
