Chen told the local party chief that in the second half of last year, when his family was moved to the new village, his family had reaped 5,000 kilograms of rice, three times more than the harvest in the past three years. He said that his family sold about 2,000 kilograms of rice for and 1,400 yuan. Xie Fei then visited six families in the town and he was pleased to see that more than 100 new houses for resettled people were under construction. Xie said that Guangdong has set a target of modernization in the next 20 years. But the limestone mountain areas presented a problem -- their barren conditions made them unfit for people. So Guangdong provincial government decied to resettle about 100,000 people from the mountain areas to the outskirts of Guangzhou city, including the counties of Qingyuan city, where there is more farmland with fewer farmers. Last year, about 5,700 households with more than 30,000 people were moved from the limestone mountain areas to the counties of Qingyuan city. Xie Fei urged the resettled farmers to open up the potential in agriculture and gradually get prosperous.
