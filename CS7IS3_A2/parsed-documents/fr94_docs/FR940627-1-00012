FR940627-1-00012 FR940627-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC56 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered Status for the Plant Delissea undulata (No Common Name) AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes endangered species status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), for the plant Delissea undulata (No Common Name). This species is known only from one individual, located on the island of Hawaii. The greatest immediate threats to the survival of this species are habitat degradation and predation by domestic and feral mammals, fire, and competition with alien plants. The small population size of one individual with its limited gene pool also comprises a serious threat to this species. This proposal, if made final, would implement the Federal protection and recovery provisions provided by the Act. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by August 26, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by August 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to Robert P. Smith, Field Supervisor, Pacific Islands Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Room 6307, P.O. Box 50167, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marie M. Bruegmann, at the above address (808/541&hyph;3441).
