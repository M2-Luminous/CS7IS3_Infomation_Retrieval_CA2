While China's resumption of state bond sales in 1981 has raised a lot of funds for the state, playing an important role in supplementing fiscal deficits, supporting economic development, and balancing revenues with expenditures, our state bond system went into effect rather late, so that it still contains certain practical and theoretical issues and weak links that are in urgent need of study and resolution. An Appropriate State Bond Sales Volume The sale of state bonds certainly does not directly increase the overall amount of social funds, rather only temporarily changing the flow of some social funds, shifting financial resources not under government control to government control, and making it essentially a redistribution of social funds. So premised on a set overall amount of social funds, state bonds should be sold in a rational volume, which if too low could not ease our current fiscal problems, and if too high might create repayment problems for state revenue. China's state bond sales are now too arbitrary and high in volume. In the decade from 1981 through 1990 alone, China's state bond sales volume grew at an average rate of 25.86 percent a year, exceeding our average state revenue growth rate of 15.09 percent a year, and far surpassing our average social gross output value growth rate of 16.22 percent a year, making it out of line with our economic growth. Since 1988, we have repeatedly postponed the repayment of capital with interest on matured state bonds purchased by units, leaving our debt burden growing larger each year. Meanwhile, as our national balance of revenue and expenditure has seen constant deficits in recent years, these excessive bond sales have affected our repayment capability and our national prestige. So the setting of a state bond sales volume should arouse much attention. Based on the experiences of advanced nations throughout the world combined with China's realities, our state bond sales volume should be subject to the following three limiting factors: 1) Our national economy's growth rates. Our state bond sales volume growth should be consistent with that of our social gross product, national income, and revenues, with this optimum-balance effect being used to determine whether sales volume is appropriate. 2) Our debt subject's operating capability. As our state bond debt subject is the government, this means that we must first learn the overall amount of government debt, on which basis to calculate the ratio scale of overall debt to the state's tangible funds and capital. 3) Social sustainability. Our state bond sales scale must consider social sustainability, including funding, material, and social sustainability. Based on China's existing debt burden and possible state revenue sustainability, China's annual state bond sales volume in recent years should have made up about 10 percent of the year's fiscal spending. Manipulating Our State Bond Sales Term Structure State bond sales terms come in long, medium, and short, with the ratio of long-, medium-, and short-term state bonds to state bond sales or accumulated overall volume being called the state bond term structure, which directly determines the length of the state's period of use of state bond revenue. All social funds, when idle, also come in long-, medium-, and short-term. While state bonds, as an effective means of attracting funds, should also be adapted to this feature, with a diversified term-structure policy, since China resumed state bond sales in 1981, they have been generally limited to only medium-term ones in the three grades of five to nine years, three years, and two years, meaning that we obviously lack long- and short-term state bonds. This irrational state bond term structure is a minus for the state on one hand, creating bond-repayment peaks, and even higher bond repayments than the year's bond sales, sapping the significance for the state of selling state bonds in the first place; on the other, it is also unsuited to a diversified social fund structure, making it hard to meet the needs of all purchasers. So, in order to suit our state bond sales term structure to China's national conditions, we should consider the following two aspects: 1) State bond term adjustment flexibility. In selling state bonds to raise funds, while medium- and long-term state bonds are naturally better, short-term ones are also indispensable, with the three types generally needing to be compatible. If it is said that the impact of selling medium- and long-term state bonds is to achieve revenue balance for the whole budget year, then selling short-term ones can make up for the various seasonal revenue differences within the year. More state bond categories with better options is undoubtedly attractive to investors, not only promoting state bond sales success, but also being a great plus in raising the use efficiency of treasury funds. 2. State bond category proportion-determination rationality. A) State bond sales terms ought to be suited to the needs of economic conditions. During economic depressions, we should expand as much as possible our sales of short-term state bonds that are economically expansionary. But during periods of inflation, we must increase as much as possible our sales of medium-and long-term state bonds that have a deflationary impact on the economy. B) State bond interest costs should be minimized. When money market interest rates are higher, we should sell more short-term state bonds; and when they are lower, we should appropriately sell more medium- and long-term ones. C) During state bond redemption peaks, we should sell short-term state bonds to repay old debts with new ones. At other times, we should sell medium- and long-term ones to postpone such peaks. Our Choice of State Bond Sales Method Our decade of state bond sales shows that almost all of China's state bond sales use the method of administrative apportionment, with mostly organized sales promotions through the diversified channels of banks, state revenue, and post offices, supplemented with free subscription by individuals. While this sales method was objectively more effective and practical under the market conditions of the time, both ensuring state bond sales success, and raising public awareness about securities investment, it severely violated the autonomy principle of financial asset transactions. For purchasers, mandated apportionment meant fiscal weakness and state credit crisis, thus shaking investor confidence in state bonds. On the other hand, setting subscription amounts based on employee wages did not consider differences in employee subsistence burdens and investor's inclinations. In light of China's national conditions, while continuing to employ administrative means, we should gradually try out economic ones, by expanding financing channels, and practicing comprehensive sales promotion methods, in order to pave the way for a gradual transition to economic means. This could be done by instituting a policy of free investment choice, to evolve a contract relationship between the state and investors based on creditor-liability relations, thus changing the state bond apportionment sales method, to change direct sales by state revenue to an indirect method of competitive group bidding for exclusive selling rights. That is, we would first sell state bonds through the method of competitive bidding by purchasing groups for exclusive sales rights, which would then sell them directly on markets in the form of voluntary transactions. The greatest plus of this method is that it would bring market forces to state bond sales. The state's first purchase of exclusive treasury bill selling rights by financial institutions in 1991 was a valuable try at this. Setting Rational State Bond Sales Interest Rates While interest rates are a key means of leverage for regulating bond market capital flow and volume, China's use of this method still contains certain problems. 1) It is overcentralized, with the authority to set and adjust interest rates completely controlled by the revenue sector, leaving markets with no leeway for spontaneous adjustment. 2) There is only one category, with unit and individual subscriptions, without regard for amounts or terms, all at a uniform price. 3) It has remained unchanged for too long, with state bond interest rates, once set, remaining unchanged for years. Thus, in order both to lower sales costs to lighten fiscal burdens and to complete bond sales promptly, we must pay attention to setting rational state bond interest rates, with the right criteria for setting them having a great impact on state bond efficiency and competitiveness. Generally, state bond interest rates should be set based on the following three considerations: 1) State bond interest rates must move in the same direction as money market ones. When setting state bond interest rates, we need to reference money market interest rates and project interest rate changes during state bond sale terms, in order to keep interest rate fluctuations moving in the same direction for both state bonds and money markets. 2) We need to combine fixed with floating interest rates. As short-term bond sales generally adapt to money market interest rate changes, they should use the fixed interest rate method. But as medium- and long-term bonds do not adapt well to money market interest rate changes due to their longer terms, they should use the floating interest rate method. That is, based on money market interest rates for the term of issue, fixed interest rates based on average market rates, and floating interest rates in consideration of investment stimulus and rational cost burdens, should be combined to make up the year's state bond sales interest rates. In successive years, as money market interest rates change and are affected by domestic policies, the fixed interest rates will remain constant, while the floating ones can rise or fall with the markets. This will enable state bond investors to both ensure their capital and make their anticipated and nominal compensation consistent, while reducing cost spending for the state. 3. The setting of state bond interest rates must also consider national economic policy needs. State bond sale interest rate control needs to be coordinated with government economic reforms during various periods. When the state is tightening money, state bond interest rates need to be appropriately higher; and when the state is expanding credit, its bond interest rates should be relatively lower. The Choice of State Bond Repayment Methods The state generally has three debt discharge methods; i.e., direct repayment, market transaction, and paying old debts with new ones. At various times and under varying economic conditions, the debt discharge method also varies. In light of China's state bond market status quo, it would be rational for us to use in the short-term a mixture of the two methods of direct repayment and payment of old debts with new ones. 1. In the direct repayment method, the state repays bonds as they mature in lump sums or payments. It requires the state to have a stronger discharge capability, with more abundant discharge fund sources. China's immediate fiscal condition is that revenues are growing slowly on one hand, while spending is pressing on. If we had maintained our state bond scale of 1989 for the two years of 1991 and 1992, we would not only have had to use all bond revenue to repay capital with interest, but we would also have had to take some revenue each year from our routine budget to make up the difference. As this would make fiscal balance difficult for the year, this method should now be applied only to the redemption of mature individual bonds. 2) In the method of paying old debts with new ones, we turn old bonds, where the government sale of bonds under varying terms and economic climates touched off bond type, repayment deadline, and payment method chaos, into new bonds in set percentages, as well as restudying bond terms and interest rates, in order to postpone the average bond repayment deadline. Since 1990, the state has used this redemption method. Under China's current bond structure status quo, this is a feasible way of solving state bond repayment problems during repayment peaks. This not only enables the state to acquire some repayment fund sources, but also adjusts old debt repayment terms to coordinate them with new state bond sale repayment terms, for a rational disposition and even distribution, to promote normal state bond sales. Of course, this method can be regarded as only a special means for one-time use and, in consideration of the political factor, can be used only for unit-purchased mature bonds.
