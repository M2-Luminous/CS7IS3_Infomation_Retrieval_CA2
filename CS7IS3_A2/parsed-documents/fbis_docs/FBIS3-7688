"We have to press North Korea by stages in order to solve the nuclear problem," Hong told a conference of the ruling camp's chapter leaders. "We will continue to show our efforts for a peaceful resolution in order to secure Chinese participation, but phased sanctions are inevitable after a statement by the UN Security Council president," he said. The council initially planned on adopting a resolution demanding that Pyongyang allow inspection of its suspected facilities, but has backed away to a presidential statement in the face of Chinese opposition. The statement is likely to be issued this week or next week. Possible sanctions could start with a halt to technical assistance and exchanges on peaceful use of atomic energy, then move to a ban on all exchanges of strategic materials, a ban on money transfers or trade in raw materials, and finally to a full embargo, Hong said. "The North Korean economy would be fatally wounded even if just 5 to 10 percent of its crude oil supply or money from Chochongnyon in Japan was embargoed," the vice foreign minister said. Chochongnyon is an association of pro-North Korea residents operating in Japan. North Korean-U.S. diplomatic normalization would take considerable time because it requires not only an international consensus but an understanding of bilateral issues including American POWs, missile export controls and human rights, said Hong. On the results of President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, Hong said he was under the impression that Beijing had emphasized its commitment to a peaceful solution rather than sanctions. "It seems to indicate China is unwilling to provoke North Korea," he said.
