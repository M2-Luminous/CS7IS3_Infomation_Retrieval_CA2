This is the government's monetary policy, when uncovered karbovantsi are not issued. Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy is the country's chief monetarist. Mr. Zvyahilskyy says that, owing to the introduction of the financial rate of currencies and the stringent monetary policy, inflation could be curbed and that now it amounts to about 20 percent a month (against 300 percent last year). However, monetarism is a double-edged weapon. Ex-prime minister Leonid Kuchma stresses that it is such a policy that has led to the crisis in industry. As of today, the debts of our enterprises in credits amount to 134.1 trillion karbovantsi [K] and in debits to K101.4 billion. In order to emerge from this situation, bills of exchange should have been introduced. However, for some reason, this procedure is being delayed. The Ministry of Finance, with Hryhoriy Pyatachenko at the head, refuses to redeem those bills of exchange that enterprises or private persons hold. Chairman of Ukraine's National Bank Viktor Yushchenko is yet another advocate of monetarism. It still remains a mystery on what principles he distributes the credits. It was only under the pressure of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [USPP] (with Leonid Kuchma as president) that industry received from Ukraine's National Bank K5.4 trillion in stabilization credits and K5.5 trillion in assistance. However, today's needs are much greater. To be sure, the karbovanets of the unpaid wages results in two or three karbovantsi of nonpayments. Because of this, members of the USPP are threatening to disband Ukraine's National Bank and instead, create some mysterious institution that will grant credits to everybody. Minister of Economics Roman Shpek says that this policy is meant for stabilizing the economic situation. However, in reality, it turns out that enterprises are becoming hostages to Zvyahilskyy and company. In the opinion of Volodymyr Lanovyy [former minister of economics], monetary policy is necessary, but only under the conditions of a stable economy, or else the state is simply covering up truly bankrupt enterprises, replaces real unemployment by a hidden one, and will lead the economy to total collapse.
