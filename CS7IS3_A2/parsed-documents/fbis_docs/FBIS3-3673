Rong was speaking to Arpad Bogsch, WIPO director-general, at the Great Hall of the People here today. Calling Bogsch a friend of the Chinese people, Rong said he was delighted to meet the WIPO chief, who is here on his 15th visit to China since 1979. Rong told Bogsch that China has in the past few years promulgated the major laws dealing with intellectual property, citing the Trade Mark Law, Patent Law, and Copyright Law. In the drafting and revision of these laws, China received much advice from WIPO, Rong said, adding that the institution has been providing training courses for relevant Chinese personnel, for which he expressed appreciation. Bogsch is leaving here this afternoon to attend a symposium on Asian copyright protection and its economic and cultural development, which is to be held in Kunming, capital of south-western Yunnan Province. The symposium will help develop copyright systems in the region, Rong said, wishing it success. Although the copyright system has been set up in China, there is still much room for the enhancement of the nation's awareness of its significance, Rong said. A comprehensive copyright protection system falls in line with the country's efforts of advancing its science and culture, developing a market-oriented economy and opening up, Rong noted. Bogsch said that China perfecting and implementing intellectual property legislation will bring benefits to its economic as well as cultural exchanges with other countries. He noted that China has achieved a lot in implementing its Trade Mark Law and Patent Law and that WIPO intends to continue its help to China in the copyright system and other areas. Yu Youxian, director of the National Copyright Administration of China, took part in today's meeting.
