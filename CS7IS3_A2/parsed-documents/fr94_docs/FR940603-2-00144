FR940603-2-00144 FR940603-2-00088 MDE does not agree that the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement violates the 49 CFR 383.21 prohibition against multiple licenses. It maintains that the driver's certification is directed to ensuring not the safe transport of oil, but its safe transfer, and that the certificate is not a driver's license within the meaning of 49 CFR 383.21. It argues that the Maryland oil cargo tank operator certification program is consistent with the training scheme of 49 CFR 172.700-.704, which sets a performance standard but does not stipulate specific training elements. In particular, it points to 49 CFR 172.702(c), which encourages training by ``public sources.'' In addition, it notes correctly that the CDL hazardous materials endorsement is required only for the transport of placarded shipments, and that not all oil movements require placards. (For example, oil that is a hazardous waste, but that does not meet the criteria for any other hazard class, is a Class 9 hazardous material not required to be placarded. 49 CFR 172.504(f)(9).) Transportation of non-placarded oil therefore does not require a hazmat endorsement and accordingly, MDE concludes, there is no duplication of CDL requirements. Finally, MDE argues that the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement is ``otherwise authorized by Federal law,'' and thus protected from preemption under 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). It finds this authority under sections 102 and 104 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1252(a) and 1254(a)(1). According to MDE, these sections empower States to institute training requirements directed to preventing and reducing water pollution. MDE also states that EPA approved Maryland's underground storage tank program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle I, 42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq., in part on the basis of the existence of the certification requirement. MassDEP asserts that a State's ability to require documentation of driver training is fundamental to effectively regulating hazardous waste transporters. It also refers to ongoing proceedings under 49 App. U.S.C. 1819, under which a working group, formed in part of State representatives, has recommended uniform forms and procedures for State registration and permitting of hazardous materials transporters. The recommendations have been transmitted to the Secretary of Transportation, and may form the basis for Department of Transportation regulations. MassDEP suggests that a determination that the Maryland requirement to document training is preempted would undermine both State regulatory efforts and the working group process. It requests that preemption be considered only to the extent that Maryland requires non-domiciled operators to come into the State for certification. D. Rebuttal Comments In rebuttal, CWTI/NTTC reiterate their contention that the Maryland requirements violate both the 49 CFR 172.701(a) prohibition on the application of stricter State training requirements to non-domiciled drivers and the ``one driver/one license'' rule of 49 CFR 383.21(a). They concur with Nortru, Environmental Transport Group and Custom Environmental Transport that delays inherent in the certification process will cause lost business opportunities. IV. Discussion The Maryland regulations under examination concern driver training and certification, and maintenance of training records. None of these is a ``covered subject'' listed in 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(B). Accordingly, the ``substantively the same'' preemption standard of 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(A) and 1811(a)(3) does not apply. Rather, the Maryland regulations are preempted if: (1) compliance with both the State *␣*␣* requirement and any requirement of [the HMTA or the HMR] is not possible [or] (2) the State *␣*␣* requirement as applied or enforced creates an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of [the HMTA or the HMR]. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). Both standards, the ``dual compliance'' and the ``obstacle'' standard, are employed to determine the preemptive effect of 49 CFR 172.700-.704 and 177.816. In considering the preemptive effect of 49 CFR 390.3(e)(2) and 392.1, however, only the dual compliance test applies. As discussed in section II, above, these provisions, due to their incorporation into the HMR through 49 CFR 177.804, have a narrower preemptive effect than do other HMR provisions. A. The ``Dual Compliance'' Test HMR training requirements for motor vehicle operators appear at 49 CFR 172.700-.704 and 177.816 and, through incorporation, at 49 CFR 390.3(e)(2) and 392.1. Each of these requirements specifies training in aspects of motor vehicle operation when hazardous materials are being transported. Sections 172.702(d), 172.704 and 177.816 require that operators be tested and records of training be maintained. To the extent that the Maryland regulations impose training requirements different from those of the HMR, they are additive. Neither CWTI/NTTC nor any other commenter has suggested that an operator cannot comply with both HMR training requirements and the applicable Maryland certification requirements. CWTI/NTTC and other commenters do assert, however, that transporters cannot comply with both the Maryland requirements and certain other HMR provisions, namely 49 CFR 172.701 and 383.21(a). The arguments advanced, however, are not persuasive. Section 172.701 prohibits States from imposing on non-domiciled operators training requirements stricter than those of the HMR. The fact that the regulation is a prohibition on what a State may do means that it cannot create a dual compliance problem for an operator. The dual compliance standard ensures that the regulated community is not put in the position where a non-Federal jurisdiction commands it to do an act that the HMR forbid, or, conversely, where the HMR require an act that the non-Federal jurisdiction forbids. For example, a transporter could not comply with a State requirement to placard a vehicle not carrying hazardous materials without violating 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(e)(2) and 49 CFR 171.2(f)(2), which prohibit representing that a hazardous material is present in a motor vehicle when it is not. See also 49 CFR 171.502(a). Because 49 CFR 172.701 is addressed solely to the State as a regulator, it imposes no duty on an operator, and an operator could not be found in violation of it. As discussed below, 49 CFR 172.701 is relevant to whether the Maryland requirements are an ``obstacle'' to accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA. It does not, however, present a dual compliance problem.
