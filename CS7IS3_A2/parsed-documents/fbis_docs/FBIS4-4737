"Japan should play much more central role in the economic development in Egypt," Yusuf Butrus-Ghali, state minister for international cooperation, said at a press meeting. During his four-day stay in Japan prior to Mubarak's scheduled visit, Butrus-Ghali met with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and senior officials of the International Trade and Industry Ministry and other ministries and agencies. He also spoke to Japanese business leaders about their on-going economic reform programs in Egypt at an investment seminar organized by the Federation of Economic Organizations. Ten Egyptian business leaders are also accompanying Butrus-Ghali, he added. The state minister said he briefed Japanese Government and business leaders about the successful results of economic reform program in Egypt towards self-sustaining and marketed-economy. "We have great faith in the way Japan has achieved its economic success," Butrus-Ghali said. "We are here to request Japan help us to achieve the similar success through technical assistance." He cited "export promotion, industry policy management and management of monetary policy" as the fields of possible Japanese technical assistance. However, when he was asked about diminishing U.S. aid to Egypt, he said that the current economic reform program aims at a "self-sustained economy without reliance on external assistance." Butrus-Ghali also said President Mubarak will discuss with Japanese leaders "all aspects of bilateral relations," Middle East and African issues as "Egypt represents Middle East and Africa." Butrus-Ghali is scheduled to return to Cairo on Saturday.
