Let us go to a report by Leke Musolli: [Musolli] In today's news conference Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, first welcomed the attitude of U.S. President Bill Clinton for not leaving the question of Kosova out of the ultimatum addressed to Serbs. With this, it is seen that Kosova and the Albanian question will take their rightful place in the final solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia. Rugova then briefed reporters on the present reality in Kosova, characterized as it is by Serbian police violence and terror. Recently, the Serbian courts convicted dozens of Albanians to more than 100 years of imprisonment on trumped-up charges. President Rugova said that this violence by the Serbian police aims to imprison Albanians and compromise their peaceful policy for resolving the question of Kosova. Rugova illustrated the intensity of the police violence with the closure of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the republic of Kosova. However, in spite of this, the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the Republic of Kosova will continue to exist and will continue to work and cooperate with all the foreign academies, as it has been doing for many years. This shameful act and the recent police repression have increased the tension in Kosova. That is why president Rugova invited the public and international diplomats to take steps to prevent any possible conflict in Kosova. Speaking about the recent initiatives on solutions to the problems in former Yugoslavia, Dr. Rugova concentrated on that of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Rugova said that we would not like this to replace the initiative for a global solution of the problems in former Yugoslavia and that we do not want another Yalta in the Balkans. Mr. Rugova said that we would not like the role of the Russian factor in this region to be one-sided. President Rugova said that the Balkans should not be considered as a region of spheres of interest. On the contrary, it should be seen as a sphere of integrating processes. At today's news conference, President Rugova welcomed the visit of Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha to Brussels and added that signing the Partnership for Peace agreement will be important not only for Albanians but for the whole region. He also greeted the report by the special envoy of the UN secretary general, Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, which objectively described the violation of human rights and freedoms in Kosova. At the news conference, Mr. Rugova answered many reporters' questions.
