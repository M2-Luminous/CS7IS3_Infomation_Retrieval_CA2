The sources told Radio Monte Carlo that Israeli statements after Christopher left the region, particularly Rabin's statements that the negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are frozen, mean that Israel does not welcome the U.S. secretary of state's return to the region, and that Israel, through its statements, appears to be dictating to the U.S. sponsor how to act and move in the peace process. The sources held Israel responsible for the delay and the stagnation in the peace process, and said that during his recent visit to the region Christopher had communicated to Israel the Syrian concept of the peace process, after which he directly left Israel for Washington. This shows he sensed a negative response from Israel on the Syrian peace concepts, which are within the framework of the realization of international legitimacy and the UN resolutions.
