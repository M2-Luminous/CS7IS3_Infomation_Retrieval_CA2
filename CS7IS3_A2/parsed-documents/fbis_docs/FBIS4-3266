This is regarded as a major strategic readjustment of the country's energy supply distribution. Coal still plays an important role in providing energy for China's heavy and chemical industries nationwide. But almost three-quarters of the country's coal are produced by provinces and regions in northern China and the country has to ship large quantities of coal to the prosperous south and east China every year to meet its huge demand for energy. This has seriously strained the country's transport capacity, while work in some factories in south and east China continues to be held up for lack of energy. Large-scale exploitation of the rich coal resources in Guizhou seems to be the most realistic and effective way out, experts said. Proven coal reserves in Guizhou, the well-known "sea of coal in southern China", hold the fifth position in the country, exceeding those of all the other provinces in southern China added together. Improved transport facilities in Guizhou, especially the completion of several railway arteries linking the province with neighboring regions, has guaranteed smooth flow of coal. Application of advanced technology in coal mining and comprehensive utilization of coal resources have promised even brighter prospects for this rising star. For example, the anthracite with ash content lower than 10 percent, in which Guizhou is extremely rich, used to be regarded as inappropriate for industrial use in China. But new technology has proved that it not only can be used to generate electricity but also is an ideal fuel for the chemical industry. Guizhou's coal enjoys another advantage: It causes less pollution to the environment because of low sulphur content. Exploitation of coal resources in Guizhou will not only greatly alleviate shortage of coal supplies in southern China, thus reducing pressures on transport, but also lay a firm foundation for the take-off of Guizhou's economy. China listed Guizhou as one of the major coal production centers since the 1960s and has earmarked altogether 3.2 billion yuan to the construction of modern mines during the past three decades. Expansion and renovation of some small or medium-sized mines started during recent years, aiming to improve the coal production capacity of the province to 60 million tons by the year 2,000. But inspecting officials from the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Coal Industry hold the opinion that its developing strategy is still too conservative and the province's great potential has far from been fully tapped. At present, the Guizhou provincial government is actively drawing up a blueprint with central government departments and hopes that both domestic and overseas investors will join in the exploitation of its rich resources.
