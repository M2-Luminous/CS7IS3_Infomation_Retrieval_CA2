Ukrainian Military Delegation Visits Almaty and Tashkent] [Text] A military delegation, headed by Colonel General Ivan Oliynyk, deputy minister of defense for armaments of Ukraine and chief of armaments of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, returned to Kiev from Central Asia. The delegation visited Almaty and Tashkent, where it held talks on a wide range of subjects with representatives of the war offices [viyskovi vidomstva] of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Among the topics discussed were the modernization of already existing equipment and weapons and the development of new models, scientific research, cooperation in the rocket and space research field, and the effective use of the capabilities of the military-industrial complexes of these sovereign countries. The parties expressed interest in cooperating in all these areas. In today's situation, this is understandable -- the shortest route to attaining our objective is by combining our endeavors. Summarizing the outcome of the talks after the conclusion of the Ukrainian military delegation's visit to Kazakhstan, Colonel-General Ivan Oliynyk underscored: "These talks not only enabled us to bring our positions closer together but also to lay a long-term foundation for a series of joint measures in the field of military cooperation. These meetings should have been held a year ago. We have lost time and certain opportunities, which we now have to make up for." Obviously, this applies not only to the talks with the Ministry of Defense of Kazakhstan, but also to Ukraine's relations with Uzbekistan. After all, the armed forces of all three independent young states find themselves in a similar situation. On the one hand, this means a huge inventory of equipment and weapons, which very often cannot be utilized to their full potential due to a shortage of component and spare parts, and, on the other hand, a complete lack of certain kinds of weapons that are essential for ensuring the military security of a sovereign state, difficulties in settling accounts between states for services of a military-technical nature (the national monetary units have not yet been made convertible and there is a catastrophic shortage of hard currency in the republics' budgets), and a decline in the output of the defense industry, whose task it is to supply the army of each state with everything it needs to maintain a high level of combat readiness [boyehotovnist]. Today, however, the situation is such that precisely because of prevailing economic conditions, the primary task facing the defense industry ["oboronka"] is not developing and producing new kinds of weapons (although this, too, must not be ignored), but rather modernizing and uniformizing existing inventory with a view to improving its tactical features. This is the sphere in which there are wide-ranging opportunities for cooperation on the part of Ukraine's defense industry enterprises with both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan -- above all, on a bilateral basis. The advantages of this are quite obvious, both in political and economic terms. Bilateral treaties and agreements are a real foundation for genuinely equal, mutually advantageous interstate relations that are free of the so-called older or younger brother syndrome. It was, after all, rather strange to learn during the talks that at one time Russia had offered to sell Ukraine weapons, which, as it turns out, are being produced not in Russia but by Kazakhstan's defense enterprises. And, as was to be expected, Russia offered its services in exchange for rubles. Would it not make more sense for Ukraine to deal directly with Kazakhstan, just as Kazakhstan should not need to look for products of Ukrainian manufacture in Russia, but should come directly to a reliable partner, who is guided by principles of trust and mutual economic benefits? It seems that after the talks this point became quite clear in both Almaty and Tashkent. The position of the chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan is quite telling in this respect. Despite the fact that, unlike Ukraine, Kazakhstan is a member of the Agreement on Collective Security of the CIS, Major-General Alibek Kasymov noted: "A state always has its interests. And if we build the relations between our states on the principles of mutual respect, mutual trust, and mutual economic advantage proposed by the Ukrainian side, there will never be any misunderstandings between us. The further strengthening of our relations and anything we do to broaden and deepen them -- and I regard the meeting of the representatives of the defense ministries of Kazakhstan and Ukraine as a step in precisely this direction -- will only benefit the defense capabilities of both countries." We should regard as quite logical the desire by the respective war offices to speed up the work of preparing the Treaty on Military Cooperation between the Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine that is reflected in the concluding protocol. There is indeed a great deal that we can work on together. Apart from modernizing and uniformizing armaments, an important role in the relations between Ukraine and Kazakhstan consists in cooperation directed at developing the rocket and space research potential of the two countries, both of which possess a real foundation and the necessary capabilities for this endeavor. Evidence of such cooperation will be Ukraine's Zenit carrier-rocket with a Ukrainian satellite, which will be launched from the Kazakh space center in Baykonur. Kiev's military is also interested in obtaining access to the proving grounds located in Kazakhstan to use for their own needs. The effective military training of anti-aircraft and rocket forces is next to impossible without such access, and it is much more difficult to modernize certain kinds of military equipment. What is interesting, however, is that although de jure these sites clearly belong to Kazakhstan, de facto they are quite actively controlled by Russia. In reference to this matter, Col-Gen Ivan Oliynyk stated: "The issue of using the military proving grounds and the space center located on the territory of Kazakhstan has to be decided on the basis of a tripartite agreement between Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. It is unlikely that we will be able to attain our objective without such an agreement. I think that at the outset Russia may oppose the signing of such trilateral agreements, but we have enough arguments at our disposal to ultimately succeed." As regards Uzbekistan, the visit of the Ukrainian military delegation to Tashkent will also produce fruitful and mutually advantageous results. For example, Ukrainian industry is in a position to offer the Ministry of Defense of Uzbekistan a broad range of products and services that are needed to refurbish and modernize the military equipment of the national armed forces of Uzbekistan. There exists a real basis for joint scientific-military projects and for establishing a mutually beneficial system of training military personnel. It is not unlikely that in the very near future Ukrainian enterprises will receive orders for the manufacture of cloth for Uzbek Army personnel, with Uzbekistan supplying our enterprises with cotton... Most of the plans based on the bilateral agreements, which are now interstate and intergovernmental in nature, are expected to benefit the armed forces in particular and the defense potential in general of all three countries -- Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan -- in the very near future.
