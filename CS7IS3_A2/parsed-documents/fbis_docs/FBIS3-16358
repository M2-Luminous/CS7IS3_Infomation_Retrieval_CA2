"Our life is full of rumors," Aleksandr Mikhailov, head of the FSK Public Relations Center, told Interfax on Tuesday. "In this particular case an elegant form was found to make gossip sound official, with some kind of source being cited `who asked not to be identified.'" "Yes, Stepashin did have a meeting on March 11, but with Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and not with the president," Mikhailov continued. "Neither that meeting nor [Stepashin's] telephone conversation with Yeltsin could have given the FSK director any cause for concern. Mood is not always a reason to see a doctor anyway." Mikhailov said Stepashin was currently at work.
