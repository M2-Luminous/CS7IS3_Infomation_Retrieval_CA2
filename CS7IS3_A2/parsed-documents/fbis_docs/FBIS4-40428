At a press conference held on his return from Luxembourg on Tuesday, Kravchuk reported that during this trip he intends to determine the scale of the aid which Kiev would render to Crimea. Speaking about the present conflict between Kiev and Simferopol, Kravchuk said that Crimea would be gradually introduced into Ukraine's "constitutional regime" by means of reasonable compromises but not by force. Kravchuk said there would be no coercive measures with respect to Crimea in the future and stressed that "Ukraine will never overstep this threshold and will not allow anybody to do this." Kravchuk underlined that in accordance with the treaty on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and European Union signed by him on Tuesday in Luxembourg, the European Union expresses its support to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. "Europe recognizes that this is a factor of European stability," Kravchuk said.
