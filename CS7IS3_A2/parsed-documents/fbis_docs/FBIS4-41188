It had better be done now, without bloodshed and fighting, President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan said in an interview published by the MOSCOW NEWS weekly [no end quotes, as received]. "Within the European Community small countries secured a position for themselves in which bigger countries are allowed less dictate," he said. "This is the aim of the European Union. I understand why certain circles in Russia are opposed to Nazarbayev's idea -- it is easier to dictate when the Commonwealth is in its present state, within a union, account must be taken of the interests of smaller states [sentence as received]. But there is no alternative, the way of dictatorship will inevitably make Russia weaker," Akayev said. "Russia is a priority direction of our foreign policy. Unfortunately, trade and economic relations with the Russian Federation are shrinking, it now ranks third after Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. But even when we do not meet with reciprocity, we can look only to Russia for protection. We were among the first to support the establishment of the collective security council within the frame of the Commonwealth of Independent States." "While among the former Soviet republics we lean on Russia for support, beyond this boundaries great moral support comes from the United States. The United States is the main donor to our programme of democratisation and transition to a market economy," the president said.
