In the crowded hall of the faculty President Gligorov talked to the students and businessmen of the town and the commune about foreign influences and the present situation in the state. "As a country that has achieved international legitimacy, as a member of the United Nations, Macedonia, being an independent state, must build its strategy from the positions that it takes on political and economic matters." This was the beginning of President Kiro Gligorov's speech. He then stressed the central location of our country and that this is why Macedonia and all the countries surrounding it must strive for peace in the Balkans. "In the present situation we are burdened with worries about the blockades and embargoes, but the moment the borders open we shall see the real significance of Macedonia's position," President Gligorov emphasized. "If we construct good neighborly relations with the states surrounding us, our state will become a country of initiatives and economic advantages, and the potential for our economy will then come to full fruition. We wish no new divisions in the Balkans because they will keep the nations in permanent conflict. Our membership in the European Union is a must. It represents an enormous national market, a factor in the economic life of the Union's countries. Small countries always make their living by exchanging goods on big markets. Macedonia is an open country -- it has proved this through its international activities and its efforts with neighboring and other European and world countries to include itself in the world's telecommunications system, to become a member of international institutions, and to construct railroads and roads to states with which it was not previously connected. "An end must be put to the war," Gligorov said. "We must restructure the economic, political, and democratic processes with a view to coming close to Europe and following the European norms of development.... The essential privatization process, which is stagnant in the neighboring countries because of criminal and mafia activities, with their far-reaching consequences, must be implemented in our country in a democratic way through a permanent concern for the individual, even if democracy is not always ideal." President Gligorov also spoke about the need for help from those financial institutions of which Macedonia is a member, about open borders and the free flow of ideas and goods, about the census, which is expected to demonstrate the real situation in the state, although now every kind of statistical manipulation is emerging from particular interests. "I am not worried about the present situation because we have large horizons open in front of us and every attempt to attack or endangering Macedonia will be faced by great resistance and everybody is aware of the consequences that may arise in the Balkans and generally," President Gligorov said, and continued: "Others did not think that Macedonia could survive independently, first of all in the economic sense. Nevertheless, those ideas did not come about. The most important thing for us is not to let internal conflicts happen. We can overcome everything else.
