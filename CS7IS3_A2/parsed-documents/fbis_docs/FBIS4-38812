As Fikret Yusifov, acting minister of finance of the Republic, stated to a correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVIS agency, the draft specifically envisages a suspension of the construction of secondary and tertiary facilities and long-term construction projects, as well as the adoption of special parallel measures in connection with the coming increase in the minimum wage which, in the words of the acting finance minister, will have a negative effect on inflationary processes. F. Yusifov declined to give a direct response to the agency correspondent's question as to how accurate are the rumors concerning anti-inflationary experiments by the directorship of the National Bank of Azerbaijan, that the bank flooded the black market with a large amount of foreign currency to stabilize the exchange rate of the manat. Yusifov noted that such rumors were being spread prior to his time as well, but they have not been corroborated. He added that the National Bank does not possess a large quantity of foreign currency, and that what currency exists is concentrated mainly in the International Bank.
