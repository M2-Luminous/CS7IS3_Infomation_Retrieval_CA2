There was no confrontation between the Indian forces and Somali criminals who allegedly intended to attack the food convoy. The spokesman said the area where the incident occurred is near the experimental station of [word indistinct] in Wanlaweyn District, Shabeellaha Hoose. He said no criminals attacked the Indian soldiers, but there was fighting going on between two communities who live in the area. It was at this point that the Indian troops, who were passing through, came across the fighting and, without ascertaining what was happening, opened fire, causing deaths and injuries. Investigations into the incident are currently under way. The USC spokesman called on the communities living in the area and involved in the conflict to end the shameful fighting immediately and assured them that the USC leadership would consult Indian military officials over the shooting incident, with a view to identifying those who committed the criminal act.
