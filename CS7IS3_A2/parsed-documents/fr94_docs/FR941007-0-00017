FR941007-0-00017 FR941007-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service 8 CFR Parts 103, 212, 217, and 245 [INS No. 1676&hyph;94] RIN 1115&hyph;AD83 Adjustment of Status to That of Person Admitted for Permanent Residence; Temporary Removal of Certain Restrictions of Eligibility AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim rule will amend the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations to allow certain persons in the United States to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident before October 1, 1997. These persons, although immediately eligible for immigrant visa issuance abroad, had been barred from adjustment of status in the United States because they had committed certain administrative violations of United States immigration law. This rule allows prospective lawful permanent residents to avoid the difficulties and expense of travel to a United States consulate or embassy abroad. It continues, however, to penalize these violators of the immigration laws by requiring most applicants to pay an additional sum in excess of the standard adjustment of status filing fee. After adjusting status, these persons can lawfully live and work in the United States and may later become eligible to seek United States citizenship through naturalization. DATES: This interim rule is effective October 1, 1994. Written comments must be received on or before December 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please submit written comments, in triplicate, to the Director, Policy Directives and Instructions Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., Room 5307, Washington, DC 20536, Attn: Public Comment Clerk. To ensure proper handling, Please reference the INS number 1676&hyph;94 on your correspondence. Comments are available for public inspection at this location by calling (202) 514&hyph;3048 to arrange an appointment. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rita A. Arthur, Senior Adjudications Officer, Adjudications Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., Room 3214, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;5014. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) allows a person who is neither a citizen nor a national of the United States to live and work in this country for an unlimited period of time if he or she has been granted lawful permanent resident status. It also provides for a grant of lawful permanent resident status on a conditional basis for an initial two-year period, if the residency is based on a recent marriage or on alien entrepreneur status, and allows for the removal of the conditions upon fulfillment of certain requirements.
