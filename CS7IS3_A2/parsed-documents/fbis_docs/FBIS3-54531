Can Washington, the West, and those who inform and carry out analyses for President Clinton possibly forget that pan-Arab Syria, with its secular system, is the only country without an Islamic fundamentalism problem, indeed, the only Arab country that uses fundamentalist groups to strengthen its position anywhere? The West cannot forget that Syria has often come under siege, so critical in one case that the Syrian Treasury contained under $50,000 in hard currency. Yet Syria never retreated; indeed, it became more committed and more determined. [passage omitted] What does al-Asad want and what did he achieve? What does Clinton want and what did he achieve? Al-Asad got an American presence in Geneva, a meeting with an Arab president, when the Americans are used to summoning Third World leaders, including some Arabs. Al-Asad had a chance for full, comprehensive, and methodic talks with Clinton. He forced the President of the world's biggest power to listen to him for five and a half hours. Al-Asad did most of the talking. Usually, the Americans summon presidents to convey brief messages within minutes. They then look at their watches and allow photographers in to take pictures--perhaps the most important outcome of meetings with U.S. Presidents. President al-Asad entrenched the Madrid formula for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on the exchange of land for peace and the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. President al-Asad added Security Council Resolution 425 concerning Lebanon and the American President agreed. This resolution was not discussed in the past so as to reassure Syria that Israel would not take advantage and tempt some Lebanese into thinking that a separate deal with Lebanon could be concluded on the basis of the resolution. Al-Asad established that dialogue to achieve settlement is not held directly with the Zionist enemy, but directly with Washington as a sponsor (together with Russia) of the peace conference. The conference was originally held on this basis. It continues to be held on the same basis although Israel affected the unified Arab position through the separate deal with Yasir 'Arafat and its Gaza-Jericho offshoot. Al-Asad returned the just and comprehensive peace to the peace process headlines. The American President stated his agreement publicly at the news conference after having stated it in the meeting. President al-Asad's success in reviving the idea of a comprehensive peace seems the equivalent of the fall of the Gaza-Jericho deal. This means al-Asad is again holding the Palestinian card. What the Palestinians lost through 'Arafat--the dream of a state--can be achieved through al-Asad within the framework of the comprehensive peace as an alternative to 'Arafat's separate deal. Al-Asad succeeded in turning the meeting with President Bill Clinton into a chance to normalize relations with the United States. This nullifies Israel's pronouncement--which succeeded in the cases of al-Sadat and 'Arafat--that normalization with Israel is the key to normalization with the United States. Al-Asad appeared very successful in making normalization with the United States the key to an Arab-Zionist settlement and then to the establishment of successful relations with the United States. Successful bilateral relations with Washington allow Syria to play a major regional role affecting Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and perhaps others, especially since Damascus has special relations with Tehran and good ties with Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and most Arab Gulf states. With this, the Golan is restored, and Syria's forthcoming role grows bigger. Israel sought normalization with Syria so that it could infiltrate the Arab east, as it succeeded through the Gaza-Jericho agreement with 'Arafat. But by normalizing its relations with Washington, Damascus can retain a full pan-Arab role that will certainly not be in Israel's favor. Al-Asad--and this is very important--succeeded in convincing the U.S. Administration that Israel is the party that must say whether it wants peace or not. Even more, he succeeded in persuading Clinton to rearrange the settlement priorities to be as follows: first, withdrawal; second, security; third, normal relations. Withdrawal is needed from Israel. Security is needed from Israel and Syria. Normal relations are needed from Syria. Moreover, al-Asad managed to tell the Americans, and Clinton agreed, that if peace is not achieved now, Israel will be held responsible; Syria will bear no consequences, and no one can then threaten it or accuse it of terrorism. Al-Asad also managed to differentiate between Hizballah, which the United States accuses of terrorism, and the resistance to liberate the south from the Zionist occupation, although Hizballah is the main tool of resistance there. Concerning withdrawal, Clinton accepted al-Asad's condition. Al-Asad threw the ball into the Zionist court and sowed the seeds of a U.S.-Israeli dispute. It must be said that al-Asad did not make the Golan issue the driving force behind his movement and demands so that he could not be easily besieged and forced into concessions. Although he said the Golan is in the heart of Syria, he never forgot that Syria's role is much larger than a piece of land, no matter how valuable. Concerning security, President al-Asad returned the ball to the American court. He said Damascus is threatened because it is only a few kilometers away from the occupied land while the Palestinian (Israeli) cities are hundreds of kilometers away from the front. This presents America with an invitation to come to the region at Syria's request, not against Syria's will. This would ensure security for Syria and stop resistance operations against occupation, which is supposed to end; occupation is removed and resistance then stops. As regards normal relations, peace is established through the desire of the Arab people at a time when such peace appears to be the least of all evils, made at the hands of a leadership that achieved the maximum level of hopes and dreams at this stage, and at a time when the world appeared stunned at the capabilities of this leader, who, in the darkest of times, manages to get the best terms and those closest to Arab hopes in an age of retreats. No one should forget that what President al-Asad achieved at this stage is the same thing offered to us when Arab solidarity was at its peak, when Egypt was the leader of the Arab world, when Arab oil and money were available and undepleted, when the Soviet Union existed with its military, economic, and political support and international influence, when Iraq was healthy before two destructive wars, when Israel did not have nuclear weapons, when Zionist superiority was clear but not decisive, when Lebanon was not destroyed, and when Palestinian resistance was active.
