Mitterrand signed a law creating a Monetary Policy Council as part of measures, required under the Maastricht Treaty for European monetary union, giving the central bank independent responsibility for the money supply, key interest rates, lending arrangements and bank reserve requirements. But the government is to be responsible for the overall exchange rate framework and the franc's exchange rate. Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said Wednesday afternoon that the Bank of France's independence would "at least equal that of the Bundesbank," thanks to the powers granted to the new council. He said the law changing the central bank's status "is of such nature as to create a stable environment, the best possible one for carrying out monetary policy." The council is composed of the governor, two vice governors, and six members named on Wednesday. One of those appointed was Michel Sapin, 41, who was finance minister in the outgoing socialist government headed by the late Pierre Beregovoy. Sapin had held to Beregovoy's "franc fort" (strong franc, with a pun on Frankfurt, Bundesbank headquarters) policy throughout massive speculative runs against the franc in 1992, and in 1993 during the dying months of the socialists' years in government under their socialist president. Officials at the presidential Elysee Palace said that Mitterrand had told conservative RPR [Rally for the Republic] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur that he would not sign the list of members if Sapin were not appointed, for reasons of balance and pluralism. He wanted a politician among the nine council members. The Prime Minister's Office agreed to this Tuesday evening, the Elysee officials said. Sapin announced that he was resigning as a member of the executive committee of the Socialist Party with the full agreement of party leader Michel Rocard. He said he remained a party "member and a militant." The governor of the bank, Jean Claude Trichet, was appointed in September. The government renewed the mandates of the first deputy governor, Denis Ferman, and of the second deputy, Herve Hannoun, on Wednesday. Trades unions and agriculture are not represented on the Monetary Policy Committee. Reliable sources said the president of the big FNSEA [National Federation of Unions of Farm Operators] farmers' union, Luc Guyau, had opposed appointment of the president of the Brittany Ferries company, Alexis Gourvennec, and unconfirmed reports said his name was withdrawn at the last moment to be replaced by that of Denise Flouzat, 65, a university economics professor. In 1991 she was appointed president of an association, "Demain la France" (Tomorrow France), which was created by Charles Pasqua and Philippe Seguin -- two leading conservative politicians who opposed the Maastricht Treaty. Hannoun is seen as the second socialist on the committee with Sapin. He had been the head of Beregovoy's private office. Another of those appointed was Michel Albert, aged 64, who was named president of the state-owned AGF insurance company for the third time in 1992. He is a convinced European and an admirer of the German model of capitalism. He helped draft the manifesto of the Radical Party in 1969, has worked for the European Investment Bank, and was Commissioner for the Plan from 1975 until 1981, when he was appointed to the AGF. Observers said that his departure from the company would enable Balladur to replace him with someone to his liking to handle company privatisation. Another appointee was economics journalist and broadcaster Jean Boissonnat, 64, a co-founder of EXPANSION business magazine. Albert and Boissonnat, who are seen as Christian Democrats, have written a book called "Crise, Krach, Boom".
