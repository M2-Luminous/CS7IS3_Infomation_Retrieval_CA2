FR941011-0-00038 FR941011-0-00011 (e) Disposition of an asset from a general asset account_ (1) Scope. This paragraph (e) provides rules applicable to dispositions of assets included in a general asset account. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an asset in a general asset account is disposed of when ownership of the asset is transferred or when the asset is permanently withdrawn from use either in the taxpayer's trade or business or in the production of income. A disposition includes the sale, exchange, retirement, physical abandonment, or destruction of an asset. A disposition also occurs when an asset is transferred to a supplies, scrap, or similar account. A disposition does not include, however, the retirement of a structural component of real property. (2) General rules for a disposition_ (i) No immediate recovery of basis. Immediately before a disposition of any asset in a general asset account, the asset is treated as having an adjusted basis of zero for purposes of section 1011. Therefore, no loss is realized upon the disposition of an asset from the general asset account. Similarly, where an asset is disposed of by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar account, the basis of the asset in the supplies, scrap, or similar account will be zero. (ii) Treatment of amount realized. Any amount realized on a disposition is recognized as ordinary income (notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code)) to the extent the sum of the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account and any expensed cost (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) for assets in the account exceeds any amounts previously recognized as ordinary income upon the disposition of other assets in the account. The recognition and character of any excess amount realized are determined under other applicable provisions of the Code (other than sections 1245 and 1250 or provisions of the Code that treat gain on a disposition as subject to section 1245 or 1250). (iii) Effect of disposition on a general asset account. The unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account are not affected as a result of a disposition of an asset from the general asset account. (iv) Coordination with nonrecognition provisions. For purposes of determining the basis of an asset acquired in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)( 4 ) of this section (relating to certain nonrecognition provisions), the amount of ordinary income recognized under this paragraph (e)(2) is treated as the amount of gain recognized on the disposition. (v) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(2). Example 1. (i) R, a calendar-year corporation, maintains one general asset account for ten machines. The machines cost a total of $10,000 and were placed in service in June 1995. Of the ten machines, one machine costs $8,200 and nine machines cost a total of $1,800. Assume this general asset account has a depreciation method of 200 percent declining balance, a recovery period of 5 years, and a half-year convention. R does not make a section 179 election for any of the machines. As of January 1, 1996, the depreciation reserve of the account is $2,000 [(($10,000^$0) × 40%)/2]. (ii) On February 8, 1996, R sells the machine that cost $8,200 to an unrelated party for $9,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, this machine has an adjusted basis of zero. (iii) On its 1996 tax return, R recognizes the amount realized of $9,000 as ordinary income because such amount does not exceed the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account ($10,000), plus any expensed cost for assets in the account ($0), less amounts previously recognized as ordinary income ($0). Moreover, the unadjusted depreciable basis and depreciation reserve of the account are not affected by the disposition of the machine. Thus, the depreciation allowance for the account in 1996 is $3,200 (($10,000^$2,000)×40%). Example 2. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, on June 4, 1997, R sells seven machines to an unrelated party for a total of $1,100. In accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, these machines have an adjusted basis of zero. (ii) On its 1997 tax return, R recognizes $1,000 as ordinary income (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $10,000, plus the expensed cost of $0, less the amount of $9,000 previously recognized as ordinary income). The recognition and character of the excess amount realized of $100 ($1,100^$1,000) are determined under applicable provisions of the Code other than section 1245 (such as section 1231). Moreover, the unadjusted depreciable basis and depreciation reserve of the account are not affected by the disposition of the machines. Thus, the depreciation allowance for the account in 1997 is $1,920 (($10,000^$5,200)×40%).
