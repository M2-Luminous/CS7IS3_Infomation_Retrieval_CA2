The president of the Bundesbank is annoyed by that "bunch of political activists." The German Institute for Economic Research, the DIW, is viewed as being on the far Left among the empirical economic research institutes. Just the same, DIW President Lutz Hoffmann cannot complain about a lack of research jobs. The reason for Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's friendly slap at the DIW was that the institute registered a dissenting opinion in the fall report by the six economic research institutes. The other five prophesied a GDP growth rate of 1 percent in western Germany for 1994 whereas the Berlin institute is still holding to its forecast of a 0.5 percent decline to this day. The reason the institute gave for its conclusions was that the interest structure is skewed in that short-term interest rates exceed long-term interest rates and that interest rates generally are still too high. Hoffmann, 59, says that the disagreement is not political but "about basics." Uncertainty about when the upturn will occur is a "very delicate situation" for all economic researchers. Under similar circumstances in 1992 the Institute for World Economics (IfW) dissented from the majority in the spring and the Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI) dissented in the fall. The DIW, Hoffmann says, is the only institute which compiles overall economic data on a quarterly basis. On this basis, "we believe we have a slightly greater sensitivity" for the mechanics of the economy. From a political point of view the institute continues to pay tribute to the Keynesian, demand-oriented approach but the spectrum of opinions "has broadened," the advantage being that there are frequent "vehement discussions." In spite of its sometimes unpleasant findings, e.g. the early warning of large-scale unemployment in eastern Germany, the institute's clients limit their critique to snide remarks. "We are not discriminated against when it comes to requests for expert opinions," Hoffmann says. The DIW also is skeptical with regard to the debate over Germany's viability as an industrial base. The institute's economic divison reached the conclusion that there is "no sign of a structural or cost crisis" in western Germany and that findings for western and eastern Germany are being mixed together "in inadmissible fashion" in public debate. Hoffmann would like to get away from the "hackneyed wage cost debate" by designing an indicator for technological competitiveness. By this fall this approach is to answer the question of whether the United States and Japan "have or have not outdistanced" Germany as an industrial power. In 1925, Ernst Wagemann, the president of the Reich Statistical Office, founded the "Institute for Economic Research." The institute received its present name in 1941. At the end of 1993 it had a staff of 215, including 100 social scientists, 61 of whom hold a doctorate. Lutz Hoffmann has headed the institute since 1989. His father already worked on empirical economic research as a unversity professor. Hoffmann himself went into industry initially but when Herbert Giersch offered him a position as a university lecturer in 1963 he decided that "this might be something I could do for a while." He stayed with it and became a professor, acting as an advisor to the prime minister of Malaysia and the World Bank. He also worked on developing countries, energy issues and international economic relations. In 1988, he was offered the presidency of two highly respected economic research institutes at once: the DIW and the Institute for Economic Research in Hamburg (HWWA). He chose the Berlin post, replacing Hans-Juergen Krupp. The president's job also includes a professorship in economics at the Free University in Berlin. At this time, the DIW has nine divisions: public sector, economy, structural research, Berlin-Brandenburg, world trade, industry and technology, East Europe, transportation, energy and raw materials. Since 1983 the researchers have polled the same households which make up the "socioeconomic panel" (SOEP) once a year regarding occupation, income, expenses as well as their satisfaction with their own economic situation. Hoffmann says that this "longitudinal survey" which has included the new laender as of 1990 is unique for Germany. He is also proud of the fact that U.S. Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker uses the SOEP data. The Berlin institute reports on its work in its weekly reports. A selection from these reports is published in a monthly English-language ECONOMIC BULLETIN. In addition, the institute publishes a quarterly and the annals of structural research. Over the past several years the DIW annual budget has steadily grown to 30 million German marks (DM). Along with the Institute for World Economic Research in Kiel, the Berlin institute has the biggest budget of the six institutes which put out their joint economic report. The DIW earned DM13 million from its economic studies, thus almost equaling the Munich Ifo Institute's third-party revenue, i.e. 42 and 43 percent respectively. Hoffmann has no intention of further increasing the percentage of outside contracts. Because of the government subsidy for the institute premises, the institutes are permitted to add no more than a 33-percent surcharge to their personnel costs in order to cover other costs. In other words, if research reports made up a greater percentage of income, less money would be available for basic research such as the National Economic Report or the calculation of capital stock. "We are not flexible enough" to obtain more lucrative contracts from the private sector, Hoffmann says. As at all other institutes, the DIW staff is paid according to civil service rates. Even if staff members were prepared to work 60 hours a week on a short-term basis, Hoffmann "could not legally" pay the corresponding salaries. Subsidies from the Federal Government and the land of Berlin totaled DM15.97 million in 1993 and DM16.12 million in 1994. The remaining funds come from membership fees to the DIW (which is a registered association) and the Society of Friends of the Institute chaired by Daimler-Benz board chairman Edazrd Reuter. As is the case with all six of the institutes, the DIW's principal client is the economics minister even though his share of the research reports has gone down to between 15 and 20 percent which Hoffmann says is due to increased competition, e.g. from Prognos AG, Basel and, increasingly, private management consultants. Other clients include various additional ministries both at the federal and the land level as well as the EU. Occasionally, foundations, labor unions, and industrial firms have also commissioned DIW studies. Every "two or three years" some client will want to keep research findings from being made public. The Berlin Senat, for example, asked for a study on the financial implications of a merger between Berlin and Brandenburg. Permission to make the study public which is a formality as a rule was "quietly refused," Hoffmann says. Why? "Because a merger would be a financial disaster for Berlin." In 1993, the DIW launched a study on potential population and economic trends in Germany up to the year 2000. On behalf of the minister for economics it is regularly preparing joint reports with the Kiel IfW on the situation in Russia and Belarus and on progress in eastern Germany. The Korean Development Institute of South Korea has asked the DIW to look into the question of what lessons divided Korea can learn from German unification. The study has not yet been completed but Hoffmann is already in a position to say that if there is a chance for Korean unification, monetary union should be the final step in the process. At the outset trade should be liberalized and North Korea should be opened for South Korean investment. As a "low-wage backwater," the North would then have "enormous opportunities to catch up." The precondition for any such development, however, would be that "the political freedom to move in that direction would be guaranteed." Looking to the future, Hoffmann expects demand for long-range scenarios on ecological issues. The DIW is working on a study for Greenpeace, for example, which focuses on the impact an ecological tax reform would have on the economy. Above all, Hoffmann says, development in the new laender "will keep us busy for another 10 or 20 years."
