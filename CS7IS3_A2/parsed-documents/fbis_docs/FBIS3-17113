This is his first visit to Ukraine in his capacity as the U.S. secretary of defense. We regard it as a sign of dynamism in the development of relations between our countries' military departments. My view is that the negotiations were held in the spirit of constructive cooperation, were fruitful, and achieved their aim. They once again confirmed Ukraine's intention to travel the path of democracy and openness to the world, which had not been inherent in the position of the former Soviet Union. The U.S. secretary of defense visited the 46th Missile Division's combat positions, which was a historic visit since we could not even think about this not so long ago. The negotiations convincingly proved that the course towards strengthening trust and understanding between the defense departments of Ukraine and the United States, initiated by our predecessors, is the right one and corresponds with the interests of our states and of ensuring peace in Europe. In the course of exchanging our opinions, our views on a wide variety of issues relating to mutual relations between Ukraine and the United States coincided considerably. These issues are closely linked to the problems of world and European security. It should also be emphasized that this is the third time that the secretary and I have met in the last three months, and I hope we understand each other well. Ukraine has made its choice in respect of nuclear disarmament. The world witnesses how Ukraine's good will with regard to lessening the threat of nuclear confrontation is being implemented in specific steps in practice. A certain number of strategic missiles have already been deactivated and two trainloads of nuclear warheads have already left for Russia on schedule. We are grateful to the United States for their diplomatic efforts, thanks to which the trilateral statement by the U.S., Ukrainian, and Russian presidents on nuclear disarmament in Ukraine became a reality in action. Financial aid from the American side will no doubt ease the heavy burden of nuclear disarmament on the economy of Ukraine, which is already in a difficult state. We have begun implementing conversion programs and you, Mr. Secretary, have already had an opportunity to see it for yourself. At the same time, you have come to know our scientific and military industrial complex and its potential. We are a rocket and space power, which is why the attitude towards us has to correspond with the aspects of reality that have arisen. It is in this respect that we hope for understanding and support from the United States. Our states are actively participating in peacekeeping activities under UN auspices. We have reached complete understanding with our American colleagues that any political issues must primarily be settled by peaceful means. A bloody crisis in the former Yugoslavia demonstrates that efforts to prevent the flare-up of military conflicts are vital. Attempts by certain political forces to play the so-called Crimean card and provide support overtly or covertly for the separatist movement on the peninsula cause concern in Ukraine. Ukraine will take all steps required to preserve its territorial integrity in a peaceful, civilized way. The fact that the United States consistently stands for the inviolability of the existing borders and is not indifferent to the Crimean problem, and in particular to the future destiny of the Black Sea Fleet, provides us with moral support in a complex process of the political settlement of the issue. We reached understanding with Mr. Perry on issues of the Black Sea Fleet and the sequence of actions on its division. This process should begin by making an inventory of all the property and combat machinery the fleet owns. Ukraine was the first CIS state to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program. This demonstrates our sincere endeavors to develop peaceful, good-neighborly relations with all participating countries. The program, initiated by the United States, gives hope for the strengthening of the European security system. We are certain that within this system Ukraine will occupy an important position befitting it. The value of the Partnership for Peace program for Ukraine in particular is that it gives our state an opportunity to establish multilateral ties with every interested country. Ukraine can become a bridge of understanding between East and West, the need for which is so perceptible. And it is this circumstance that imparts particular importance to fruitful bilateral relations between the defense departments of Ukraine and the United States. Now we have already achieved certain success in developing these bilateral relations. Our ministries' working groups have agreed on a work plan consisting of 17 paragraphs, each of which contains specific programs for the development of contacts in the military sphere. Some of them have already been put into practice. In the very near future, we intend to establish with our American partners a direct line of communications between our states' defense departments. This step will undoubtedly help resolve more promptly the problems that arise in our relations. We look forward to interesting meetings on a bilateral basis and contacts at various levels. In future, we can see participation in joint exercises and exchanges of military servicemen right from combat subunits. All this inspires hope that understanding between our countries' Armed Forces will strengthen. Mr. Perry's visit has lived up to the best of our expectations. An important document was adopted: an amendment to the agreement between our military departments on the provision of Ukraine with materials, machinery, and communications services in eliminating strategic nuclear weapons. Under this amendment, Ukraine will receive an additional $50 million towards nuclear disarmament, with the total sum to be 185 million. A joint statement has been worked out and signed on meeting Ukrainian Armed Forces servicemen's daily life and housing needs, providing for aid in the amount of $20 million for the construction of housing. In general, the program of the visit was intensive. A delegation from the U.S. Department of Defense had meetings with our state's leadership, scientists, and representatives of the military industrial complex. I express the viewpoint of the Ukrainian side: We evaluate the results of Mr. Perry's visit to Ukraine with satisfaction. It is the continuation of a constructive dialogue between our countries' military. This dialogue is now acquiring certain qualities of a good tradition. My deep conviction is that the development of bilateral relations between the defense departments of Ukraine and the United States will promote stronger peace and stability both in Europe and worldwide.
