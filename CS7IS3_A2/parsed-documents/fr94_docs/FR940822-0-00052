FR940822-0-00052 FR940822-0-00017 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 24 [PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253; FCC 94&hyph;217] Implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act_Competitive Bidding AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission, on its own motion, reconsiders several aspects of the competitive bidding rules adopted for personal communications services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband PCS''). The amendments adopted: exempt entities owned and controlled by Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village Corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act from the affiliation rules for purposes of eligibility to apply for licenses in frequency blocks C and F (``entrepreneurs' blocks''); and modify the rules governing the attribution of gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth of investors in corporate applicants in the entrepreneurs' blocks to permit non-attributable investors to own up to 15 percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock. The Commission's action furthers the congressional policies of ensuring that all classes of designated entities are provided opportunities for meaningful participation in broadband PCS spectrum auctions. It also introduces additional flexibility into the attribution rules to attract investment to all types of corporations controlled by entrepreneurs' block eligibles and to increase the level of participation by smaller corporate applicants which have not made a public offering of their stock. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Peter A. Tenhula, Attorney, Office of General Counsel, (202) 418&hyph;1720.
