FR940204-0-00017 FR940204-0-00011 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small Entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). It is anticipated that the impact of this regulation on non-participating small entities will actually benefit their business due to the increase in local tourism. The Coast Guard will certify under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Federalism Assessment This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it is anticipated that this regulation will not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment This regulation has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket, and is available for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES .
