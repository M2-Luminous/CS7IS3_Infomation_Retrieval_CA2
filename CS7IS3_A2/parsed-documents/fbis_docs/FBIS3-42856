Discussions concerning the law on citizenship and the status of foreigners in Latvia, which remains undetermined, are continuing in Latvia. Various opinions and evaluations could be better substantiated if political workers and the interested parties had a better knowledge of the actual situation. Data of the Register of Residents, which is currently being summarized in a centralized databank, will be indispensable in a future determination of the actual situation. Even though this data is not yet absolutely precise, inasmuch as it has not been qualified and verified, it can, however, already be used in political, economic, social, and cultural life. At present the Register of Residents lists 2,462,196 individuals. According to data of the State Committee on Statistics 2,566,000 persons lived in Latvia at the start of 1994. Consequently 96 percent of the residents were registered. The initial registration of residents has remained unchanged for several months. This makes it possible to believe that the initial registration can now be considered as being complete. As commonly known, the Register of Residents does not include Russian military personnel on active duty and members of their families. Unfortunately the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Affairs is thus far unable to provide precise information on how many of these people there are. Some 29,618 temporary residence permits have now been issued, which amounts to 1.2 percent of the total population of Latvia. It is clearly necessary to also take into account the fact that there are people who are consciously avoiding registration or doing so because of the pressure of circumstances. They are individuals, including Letts, who do not register because they were on active duty in the Soviet army and are now receiving a pension from Russia. It is understandable that the Register of Residents is being ignored by a large number of those military personnel who were discharged and are getting a pension from Russia. The total number of such individuals may reach 70,000, or 2.7 percent of the Latvian population. It is likewise not known what number of citizens of Russia residing in Latvia have registered with the Register of Residents. Finally, those who intend to leave Latvia in the immediate or distant future are attempting to circumvent the Register of Residents. In 1993 the migratory balance (the difference between those arriving and those departing) amounted to 28,000 people. That is considerably less than in 1992 when the migratory balance came to 47,200. As commonly known in 1991 that balance constituted 11,200 persons. The central databank of the Register of Residents summarized data on 2,410,763 residents, i.e. on 97.9 percent of individuals covered in the initial registration. A more detailed analysis of this data is given below. Citizens Some 71.4 percent or 1,720,302 persons of those included in the databank are citizens of the Latvian Republic. As commonly known those who held the citizenship of the Latvian Republic prior to 17 June 1940 and their descendants are citizens of the Latvian Republic. Consequently after registering with the Register of Residents it is possible to become a citizen of the Latvian Republic also if only one of the parents is a citizen of the Latvian Republic. A total of 432,200 citizens of Latvia live in Riga, 453,300 in Vidzeme, 319,200 in Latgale, 242,900 in Kurzeme, and 272,600 in Zemgale, while in cities like Jurmala there are 33,600 citizens, in Liepaja--47,700 citizens, and in Daugavpils-- 72,300 citizens. Both parents of 1,309,500 (71.1 percent) of the Latvian citizens hold Latvian citizenship. In Riga there are 312,400 (72.3 percent) such persons, 357,700 (78.9 percent) in Vidzeme, 228,600 (71.6 percent) in Latgale, 196,800 (81.0 percent) in Kurzeme, 213,900 (78.5 percent) in Zemgale, 21,000 (62.5 percent) in Jurmala, 38,200 (80.1 percent) in Liepaja, and 47,800 (66.1 percent) in Daugavpils. There are less than 60 percent of such citizens in the city of Rezekne, 50.3 percent in the Rezekne Rayon and 59.7 percent in Gulbene Rayon. Some 135,000 individuals (7.9 percent of the total number of citizens of the Latvian Republic) received citizenship on their maternal side. In Riga there are 52,700 such persons (12.2 percent of the citizens of the Latvian Republic living in Riga). A total of 114,100 persons (6.6 percent) received citizenship on their paternal side. In Riga--39,400 (9.1 percent). As we can see more people obtained citizenship on their maternal side than on the paternal side. This is apparently explained by the fact that women enter into mixed marriages more frequently than men, as a result of which the probability of them marrying foreigners increases. It is likewise necessary to take into account the fact that the specific share of women in the population of Latvia is higher than that of men. In addition to that 101,900 individuals (5.9 percent of citizens of the Latvian Republic) received citizenship on their maternal side without indication of the father's citizenship. The same applies to 22,600 (1.3 percent) of the citizens of the Latvian Republic who obtained citizenship on the paternal side without an indication of the mother's citizenship. As commonly known, in accordance with the terminology of the Register of Residents those foreigners who are not citizens of Latvia and have a permanent residence permit in Latvia are registered as former citizens of the USSR in the initial registration. In the case of some of those registered, as already mentioned, the citizenship of the parents is not mentioned. In individual cases the citizenship of the parents may truly be unknown, for instance, in the case of elderly people who received citizenship of the Latvian state in the first years of its existence, the citizenship of whose parents has not been determined. Foreigners A total of 690,461 persons (28.6 percent of those in the databank) are foreigners, or, in other words, residents of Latvia who are not citizens of the Latvian Republic. In the case of 634,000 of them neither the father nor the mother are citizens of the Latvian Republic. For the remainder the citizenship of either the father or the mother or of both parents is not indicated. Most of the foreigners consist of citizens of the USSR who entered Latvia illegally during the years of occupation. But they are not the only ones. The number of foreigners is also supplemented by Letts who returned to Latvia (most often from Russia) and in accordance with the existing law on citizenship are not citizens of the Latvian Republic. Their number totals 22,031. It is possible that there may be more of them inasmuch as during Stalinist times as well as subsequently, some of the Russian Letts became "Russians" (according to passport entry) even though they consider themselves to be Letts. In addition to that the category of foreigners includes Polish and Lithuanian agricultural workers, who entered Latvia legally before the war and have lived here all of these years, as well as their descendants. Some 466,600 (67.6 percent) of the foreigners entered Latvia from some other country, most from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, while 223,900 (32.4 percent) of the foreigners were born in Latvia. Fifty percent of the foreigners born in Latvia were born in Riga. During the occupation 9,800 persons on the average entered Latvia every year and remained living here. The greatest influx of foreigners into Latvia took place in 1946 (11,950), 1947 (11,500), 1960 (11,750), 1961 (11,200) and 1973 (10,730). It is characteristic that in 1957, 1958, and 1959 the number of those who arrived (and those who stayed) is smaller than in 1956, while in 1960 that index again showed a sharp increase. Those who are presently "heroically" reprimanding E. Berklavs should give some thought to the reason for that phenomenon. Some 337,200 foreigners, which comes to 48.8 percent of their total number in Latvia, live in Riga. Most of the foreigners wish to obtain citizenship of the Latvian state. It is characteristic that Latvian citizenship is most often desired by those foreigners who came here and not by those born here.

Analysis of data from the Register of Residents indicates that the foreigner problem is actually a "matter" facing Riga. There the share of foreigners is 43.8 percent. The problem is particularly acute in the Kurzeme suburb where the share of foreigners amounts to 51.2 percent. The share of foreigners, however, does not exceed 25 percent in any of the krays of Latvia--Kurzeme, Latgale, Vidzeme, Zemgale. Naturally, if we study separate data on citizens of the Latvian Republic and foreigners by electoral districts, it will turn out that, as anticipated, the foreigner problem is also a problem in the largest cities of Latvia. At Liepaja, for instance the share of foreigners comprises 49.0 percent, in Daugavpils--37.9 percent, in Jurmala--36.6 percent, in Yelgava (including the rayon)--34.4 percent, in Ventspils (including the rayon)--31.7 percent, and in the Riga Rayon--27.5 percent. At the same time the smallest share of foreigners is in the Talsi Rayon--55.6 percent, the Madona Rayon--7.0 percent, the Kuldiga Rayon--7.2 percent, the Balvi Rayon--8.0 percent, the Preyli Rayon--8.9 percent, the Aluksne Rayon--9.2 percent, the Gulbene Rayon--9.0 percent, and in the Liepaja Rayon--9.9 percent. In all of the other rayons the share of foreigners exceeds 10 percent. In Zemgale there is not a single rayon where the share of foreigners is less than 10 percent. Cited below is a survey of the largest groups of citizens of the Latvian Republic and foreigners and their distribution by nationality. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Distribution of Citizens of the Latvian Republic and Foreigners by Nationa-| |lity | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nationality |Citizens |Foreigners |Total | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Letts |1,355,259 |22,031 |1,377,290 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russians |278,087 |444,399 |722,486 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Poles |38,333 |24,060 |62,393 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belarusians |20,455 |82,849 |103,304 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lithuanians |7,062 |26,206 |33,268 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jews |6,638 |8,074 |14,712 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gypsies |6,146 |673 |6,819 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukrainians |3,929 |59,853 |63,782 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Estonians |1,309 |1,566 |2,875 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Germans |926 |2,636 |3,562 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenians |277 |1,917 |2,194 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Livonians |179 |1 |180 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Others |1,702 |16,196 |17,895 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Virtually all of the Livonians living in Latvia are citizens of the Latvian Republic along with 98.4 percent of the Latvians, followed by Gypsies--90.1 percent, Poles--61.4 percent, Estonians--45.5 percent, Jews--45.1 percent, Russians--38.5 percent, Germans--26.0 percent, Lithuanians--21.2 percent, Belarusians--19.8 percent, Armenians--12.6 percent, and Ukrainians--6.2 percent. The overall share of citizens of the Latvian Republic among Ukrainians and Armenians is rather low for the reason that they are not historical national groups in Latvia. The same can also be said about Tatars whose overall number totals 3,200 individuals with a 95.5 percent share of foreigners. The centralized databank has not yet provided information on the national composition of krays and rayons of Latvia. If such data is obtained, along with information on the composition of citizens and foreigners in each district and city, that will make it possible to work out naturalization tactics for each kray and city of Latvia in accordance with the interests of Letts and citizens of the Latvian Republic.
