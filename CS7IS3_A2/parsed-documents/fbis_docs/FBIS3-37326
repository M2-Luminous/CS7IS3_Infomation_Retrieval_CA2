The commision will comprise representatives of Canada, Italy, France, and Great Britain. As is known, the treaty which was signed in Paris on 19 November 1990 provides for each participant country to have certain quotas of armaments which can be achieved only by reductions in its existing combat equipment. The main object of attention for the foreign inspectors who will be staying in the WGF's positions until 18 February will be the former tank repair works in Wuensdorf which since August 1992 has been turned into a base for destroying armored equipment. As the ITAR-TASS correspondent was told in the WGF press center, before the final withdrawal of the Russian forces from Germany, it is planned to reduce the armored combat vehicles by 2,632, which represents 42 percent of the total number of these vehicles due to be reduced by the Russian Federation. To date 2,279 have already been reduced including 1,679 armored transports (BTR-60) and 600 infantry combat vehicles. Over the period that the base for the destruction of combat equipment in Wuensdorf has been in operation, representatives of the states which are signatories to the treaty have carried out six inspections. There have been no complaints from the inspectors.
