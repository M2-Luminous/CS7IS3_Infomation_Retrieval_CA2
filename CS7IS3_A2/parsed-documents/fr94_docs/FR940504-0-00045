FR940504-0-00045 FR940504-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 88&hyph;21, Notice No. 8] RIN 2127&hyph;AC88 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Bus Emergency Exits and Window Retention and Release AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule, delay of effective date. SUMMARY: This final rule delays until September 1, 1994, the effective date of the requirements in one section of a final rule issued November 2, 1992, which amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 217, Bus Emergency Exits and Window Retention and Release, to revise the minimum requirements for school bus emergency exits and improve access to school bus emergency doors. On March 24, 1994, NHTSA issued an interpretation of the term ``daylight opening'' used in the final rule. Subsequently, NHTSA has learned that several school bus manufacturers had misunderstood this term and as a result, will not have designed many of their buses with sufficient exits to comply with the new requirement by the May 2, 1994 effective date. Because NHTSA agrees that this term could have been misunderstood, NHTSA is allowing manufacturers to continue certifying their buses as having the exits required prior to the November 2, 1992 final rule until September 1, 1994. All other requirements of the November 2, 1992 final rule will continue to be effective on May 2, 1994. DATES: Effective Date: The amendments made in this rule are effective May 2, 1994. Petition Date: Any petitions for reconsideration must be received by NHTSA no later than June 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Any petitions for reconsideration should refer to the docket and notice number of this notice and be submitted to: Docket Section, room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. (Docket Room hours are 9:30 a.m.&hyph;4 p.m., Monday through Friday.) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Leon DeLarm, NRM&hyph;15, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;4920. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 15, 1991, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend Standard No. 217 to require that the minimum number of emergency exits on school buses be based upon the seating capacity of the school bus (56 FR 11153). Under the proposal, all school buses would have been required to have either a rear emergency exit door or a side emergency exit door and a rear push-out window. Depending on capacity, some school buses would have been required to have additional exits. The NPRM proposed two options regarding the means for providing the additional emergency exits. Option A would have required the use of emergency exit doors. Option B would have required a combination of emergency exit doors and emergency roof exits. The NPRM included a table indicating the additional exits required under each option for any bus with a designated seating capacity between 24 and 90. The determination of the number and type of exits used in the tables was based on crediting an emergency exit door with its minimum area (24 inches Ã— 45 inches, or 1,080 inches2) and crediting two emergency roof exits as a single emergency exit door. On November 2, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule increasing the amount of emergency exit area required on school buses (57 FR 49413). As in the proposal, the final rule required that the minimum emergency exit area on school buses be based upon the seating capacity of the school bus. However, the final rule differed from the NPRM concerning the calculation by which the need for additional emergency exits was to be determined. (On December 2, 1992 NHTSA published a technical amendment to the November 2, 1992 final rule. Both of these notices will be referred to collectively as the November 2, 1992 final rule.) The November 2, 1992 final rule specified that after calculating the total amount of additional emergency exit area [AEEA] needed for a school bus, using the formula proposed in the NPRM, each exit was to be credited with its ``daylight opening.'' ``Daylight opening'' was defined as ``the maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit when viewed from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.'' The preamble to the final rule did not include a further discussion of what might constitute an obstruction. On January 8, 1994, Mr. Bob Carver of Wayne Wheeled Vehicles (Wayne) wrote to the agency requesting clarification of the terms ``daylight opening'' and ``unobstructed opening.'' The Wayne letter included Figure 5C from the November 2, 1992 final rule. This figure illustrates the permitted placement of a seat adjacent to a side emergency exit door. Wayne stated that agency personnel had indicated that only the area visually obstructed by the seat could not be credited, and requested confirmation of this interpretation.
