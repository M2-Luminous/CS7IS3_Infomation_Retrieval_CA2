BHP is a partner in a consortium which is expected to begin producing oil later this year from the Dai Hung field in the Spratlys. The consortium leases the field from Vietnam. Company's chief executive, John Prescott, has said in Hanoi that nothing BHP was doing or plan to do in Vietnam was impaired by the company's assessment of the political situation. However, Mr. Prescott did express disappointment at new figures on the likely oil reserves in the Dai Hung oil reserves in the Dai Hung field which was originally thought to hold 800 million barrels. The Dai Hung field is expected to produce up to 35,000 barrels a day when it goes into production next October.
