The relevant laws will have to be consulted on whether it is possible to extradite the MP for trial in the United States. [Begin recording] [Prasong] There was a discussion this morning regarding the relevant laws. We will look into every angle. [Unidentified reporter] What is the government's position? Will the MP be tried here or extradited to the United States? [Prasong] If there is a law that allows an extradition, we will probably have to cooperate with the United States to preserve our country's reputation. If the law does not allow this, then we will not be able to extradite him. The legal specialists will consult the law in case the United States requests an extradition. [Reporter] In most previous cases, the United States was able to bring major drug traffickers to trial in its courts. [Prasong] Most of them were arrested in the United States or in third countries. [Reporter] What if there are other officials involved in this case? [Prasong] [Words indistinct]. [end recording]
