According to MP Ivan Genov, deputy chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee for the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the Partnership for Peace offer is NATO's and the United States' compromise with the East because they do not want to isolate Russia from the processes of European and Euro-Atlantic security. The Partnership for Peace plan is a function of the relations among the great powers, he said. Mr. Genov absolutely disagrees with the statement that the U.S. initiative gives equal chances to the countries participating in it. The Partnership for Peace is based on bilateral contracts, which means a different approach to each country that is not a member of NATO, therefore the participants are placed on an utterly unequal footing, Mr. Genov stressed. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) believes that Bulgaria should join the Partnership for Peace framework the soonest possible as this is the first important step towards integration into the structures of NATO, MP Yunal Lyutfi, deputy chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee for the DPS, said. In his opinion, the Partnership for Peace plan treats the countries on an equal footing without placing the Visegrad Four in a privileged position. Bulgaria's clearly and categorically stated desire for participation in the initiative is a serious guarantee for its national security, Mr. Lyutfi said. He said that a special group with the Council of Ministers was working on the programme of Bulgaria's participation in the Partnership for Peace. The initiative gives a very good chance to each individual country participating in it to take the necessary steps for integration with NATO, MP Asparukh Panov, deputy chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee for the Union of Democratic Forces, said. He expressed his hope that the committee would actively participate and assist in the elaboration of a programme for joining the Partnership for Peace plan. It is the SDS MP's desire that rapid and resolute action be taken with this purpose in view. According to Mr. Panov, Bulgaria has always had an advantage over the Visegrad Four because of its geopolitical position. We do not have a common border with Russia but with two NATO member countries and the establishment of a future triangular of NATO member-states will contribute a lot to the stabilization of the Balkan region, Mr. Panov believes.
