"This means that people still have confidence in Spain," and that the myth of disinvestment caused by the departure of some multinational enterprises "is neither correct nor corresponds to reality," the minister said. In statements made to Spanish National Radio, Solbes harshly criticized the People's Party and United Left for denying the figures showing a clear start of economic recovery, "simply because of not acknowledging that the policy which the government is implementing is the correct one." According to Solbes, growth and job creation will be gradually consolidated until 1,000 jobs per day are being created, which is the government's aim. The Economics Ministry is finalizing the Plan for European Integration, which will be presented in Brussels in July. The plan contains budget projections for the next three years. According to these forecasts, the economy will grow by 1.3 percent this year, 2.6 percent in 1995, and 3.5 percent in 1996. That is, the aim is to triple growth in three years, and this will make it possible to move from a zero increase in jobs to around 400,000 at the end of the period. At the same time, the program envisions a drastic reduction in the public deficit, which will fall from the 6.4 percent forecast for the public administrations as a whole in 1994 to 3.2 percent of GDP for the 1996-1997 fiscal year. The intent is to achieve this reduction without increasing the individual tax burden. Hence, government activity will center on cutting public spending: Civil Service staffing will be frozen, transfers to state-run businesses will be reduced, transfers to the autonomous communities will be stabilized, and spending on health and unemployment will be rationalized. As far as revenue is concerned, an additional increase in revenue is envisioned as a result of the struggle against fraud and the increase in consumption, profits, and employment. The plan also foresees a considerable decline in inflation from 3.5 percent in 1994 to 2.5 percent at the end of 1997. The minister acknowledges that this is a very difficult aim, since "lowering prices from 5 percent is almost quite ambitious." However, he believes that it will be reduced significantly in the second half of the year, when food prices fall. Solbes believes that the structural reforms of the labor market which have been begun must be completed in order to defeat inflation. In fact, the second part of the integration plan centers mainly on these reforms in order to "be on the same level as the soundest economies in Europe and be able to join in the third stage of [monetary and economic] union." In the minister's opinion, it would be a very grave mistake for us to join in this third stage "solely for political reasons, and it is essential that we achieve the economic conditions enabling us to take that step." He told a select group of diplomats at the Ortega y Gasset Foundation that "European unity is not being built in the way which the government would have liked." EU Enlargement Solbes has publicly acknowledged that the aforementioned change is due to the disappearance of the East bloc countries, which has caused a fundamental change in the role played by Germany. The minister publicly acknowledged that with the Community's enlargement, Spain's political influence in Europe has diminished, and the center of gravity has shifted from south to north. "The complexities which have developed are leading us toward a confederal Europe, although we would have preferred the federal formula." He explained that the government would have liked the creation of a common political area, yet it is increasingly clear that we are heading for a "Thatcher-style" economic option. Pedro Solbes also acknowledged that "liberalism has triumphed over the more interventionist social democratic visions of Europe." The minister asked whether a process of integrating markets can be gotten under way without compensatory arrangements. In any event, he emphasized that Spain must be involved in the first stage, "and we are going to do everything possible to achieve this."
