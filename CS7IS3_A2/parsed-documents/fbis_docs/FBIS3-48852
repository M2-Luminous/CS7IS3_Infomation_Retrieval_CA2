We cannot but take a serious view of his preposterous sophism, which is an intolerable insult to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. His utterances reveal a base scheme to impose unreasonable "nuclear inspections" on the DPRK at any cost with international pressure by spreading again the rumor of the DPRK's "suspected nuclear development." This "suspicion" is an offspring of the U.S. anti-socialist, anti-DPRK moves. It is a fiction. It is really ridiculous of Japan to cry over "a factor of instability in Asia" and "a global problem", basing itself on this fiction. It is only too clear that Japan itself is the biggest factor of instability in Asia. Japan's moves to become a military power equipped with nuclear arms, which are entering a dangerous stage, pose a potential, grave threat to peace and security not only in Asia but in the world. The scheme of the Japanese reactionaries to develop the "Theatre Missile Defence" system in collusion with the United States is a grave threat and open challenge to the Korean people. While crying for the "Theatre Missile Defence" system, Aichi twaddled about "Japan-U.S. security system" and South Korea-U.S. "alliance." This revealed the sinister intention to strengthen the U.S.-Japan-South Korea "tripartite military alliance" and contain the DPRK militarily. It is, however, a foolish daydream. The Japanese reactionaries must abandon the habit of caviling at others and give up their moves to convert Japan into a nuclear power and military power, which pose a threat to peace and security in Asia and the world.
