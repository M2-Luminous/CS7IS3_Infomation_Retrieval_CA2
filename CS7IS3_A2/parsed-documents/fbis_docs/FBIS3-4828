He survived the leadership challenge which led to a snap election just 20 months into his first term in office. Fiji votes under a racial system guaranteeing indigenous Fijian dominance in the Parliament. However, Mr. Rabuka now has a stronger mandate and says he can work with the country's other major race, the Indians. Erina Reddan reports from Fiji: [Begin recording] [Reddan] (?Several observers said) Fiji has voted along racial lines. The smaller multiracial parties were the big losers as Fiji went for the more established Fijian and Indian parties. Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka's SPT [Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei] Party won most of the Fijian seats -- 31 of the 37 -- which successfully fought off the challenge by the new one-month-old Fijian Association. Its leader and long-time Rabuka rival, Josevata Kamikamica, who launched the leadership challenge last November which led to the snap poll, has lost his seat. Mr. Rabuka can now lead the government apparently unhampered by internal strife. On the Indian side, the electorate also returned to its party of tradition, the National Federation Party. It won 20 of the 27 seats at the expense of the Labor Party, which lost heavily -- down from 13 to six seats. Despite the strong race vote, there is more chance now healing the bitter rift between Indians and Fijians at any time since the 1987 military coups which overthrew an Indian-dominated government and led to systematic discrimination against Indians. The extremist anti-Indian Nationalists lost their five seats, while the Fijian SPT Party and the Indian National Federation Party are both talking about understanding each other. After swearing in Prime Minister Rabuka, President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara called for a Fiji free of racial conflict. [Mara] People of Fiji: The world is watching us closely, and there are some who still believe our nation of many races, cultures, and faiths is doomed to failure. As your chosen government takes office, let us once more show the naysayers the depth and strength of this country and our determination to find common ground for a common future.
