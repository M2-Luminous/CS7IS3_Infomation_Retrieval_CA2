ESA reports that under the conditions which dominate in distant space, the solar cells reach an efficiency factor of 25 percent. This is the highest efficiency factor yet attained with silicium cells without the use of optical concentrators. According to reports, the silicium cells are 6 x 4 centimeters in size. ESA had already made the first breakthrough about a year ago, an efficiency factor of 23 percent, which was, however, achieved using 2 x 4 centimeter gallium-arsenide cells. The new record performance with silicium is credited to a team of companies under the direction of DASA [German Aerospace] (Heilbronn), to which the Milan company Cise also belongs, which was already responsible for the development of the gallium-arsenide cells. The progress is particularly noteworthy, because European space flight cannot rely on the thermoelectric radioisotope generators (TRG) used elsewhere, which are employed to supply energy for missions into deeper space. In addition, the solar cells currently used in space flight are generally not designed for such low temperatures and such meager radiant [solar] intensity, [conditions] which must be taken into consideration at greater distances from the sun. In orbits near the sun they have an efficiency factor of 10 to 20 percent, but they lose their efficiency in distant space. For example, the radiant intensity of sunlight on Jupiter is only five percent of its intensity near the Earth. The equilibrium temperature of the solar cell designs falls to about minus 100ï¿½C at these distances.
