Because there are only a few of them, they control prices. The influence of these economic groups on the lives of ordinary citizens goes from the cement used for refurbishing a house to the cigarette a person smokes with a cup of coffee, and encompasses a spectrum from razor blades to sugar-cane firewater. Is this just fantasy? Not at all. The above assertion is based on facts. The Votorantim and Joao Santos groups, for example, account for 70 percent of cement sales -- worth nearly $2.6 billion annually -- on the Brazilian market. Souza Cruz and Philip Morris control 98 percent of the cigarette sales while Gilette controls 81 percent of razor blade sales. Believe it or not, three groups -- Pirassunga 51, Velho Barreiro, and Pitu -- control at least 51 percent of the sugar-cane firewater market. Luciano Coutinho is an economist from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) who was hired by the government to coordinate a study on the competitiveness of Brazilian manufacturing companies. The study was recently delivered to the government. Coutinho says: The Brazilian economy comprises mainly oligopolists. A few companies and brand names control the market, leaving only a small segment for their competitors. Even in sectors where there are hundreds of manufacturers, only a few are able to set prices. For instance, there are between 1,200 and 1,500 textile manufacturers, but their prices are closely tied to those set by half a dozen large companies such as Hering, Pettenati, and Alcatez. Although there are many brands of jeans, Vicunha and Alpargatas-Santista control 72 percent of the supply of denim, so they control garment manufacturers too. The same happens in the area of fibers and synthetic yarns. Rhodia, Fibra (Vicunha Group), and Celibras control 75 percent. To give an idea of how prices are pushed up, one only needs to look at a survey conducted by the Industrial Marketing and Studies Institute (IEMI). While garment prices increased by 81.23 percent this year, textile prices increased by 101.64 percent. When it comes to electronic equipment, Brazilians are controlled by oligopolists. Just four manufacturers -- Sharp, Philips, Philco, and Semp-Toshiba -- supply 69 percent of all television sets at a total annual cost of nearly $1.1 billion. Domestic manufacturers do not have much a choice because only RTC-Sharp and Philips supply television tubes. Except when produced by autonomous manufacturers, all ice cream comes from two companies: Kibon, which accounts for 80 percent of the sales; while Nestle accounts for the rest. The Philip Morris group owns Kibon, which operates only in oligopolistic sectors. In addition to its undisputed leadership in ice cream, Philip Morris also controls 70 percent of the sale of powdered soft drinks through its brand name Tang, and 20 percent of cigarette sales through its brand names Marlboro, Galaxy, and L&M. Notwithstanding all this, Clodoaldo Celentano -- financial director of the Philip Morris group -- contends that there is "a tough competition" in each of these three sectors. Celentano said: Some oligopolists may reach price agreements under certain circumstances, but this is not our case. Cigarettes, for instance, face tough competition because the government is a majority partner in this sector. The government is interested in maintaining its tax revenues, which account for 73 percent of the price of each pack of cigarettes. Few companies are as closely identified with the word oligopoly as Gessy Lever. Although its president, Umberto Aprile, recently told O GLOBO he did not understand the meaning of the word oligopoly, Gessy Lever -- a subsidiary of the British-Dutch group Unilever, one of the world's largest groups -- plays a significant role in various concentrated sectors of the economy. Among others, it accounts for 72 percent of the powdered soap market. It also accounts for nearly 30 percent of margarine sales. Gessy Lever, which tomorrow will have to justify its price increases in URV's [Real Value Units] before the Finance Ministry, is not willing to leave any room for its competitors. In addition to controlling 75 percent of the powder soap market, it has just invested $56 million in a recently opened factory in Minas Gerais State, which will increase its annual production to 550,000 tons -- well above the annual domestic consumption of 420,000 tons. Other companies operate in concentrated sectors of the economy, but they are less noticeable and are thus able to keep a lower profile. This is the case of companies manufacturing fiber-cement roofing sheets and water tanks. Brasilit and Eternit control virtually half of this sector, and their factories have been consolidated in the past two years. Furthermore, the French group Saint Gobain, the owner of Brasilit, owns 17 percent of Eternit shares with voting rights. Additionally, these two companies own Sama, the only producer of fiber-cement in the country. Carlos William de M. Ferreira, assistant to the chairman of Brasilit, said: This does not mean that there is a concentration of economic power in this sector. A price survey conducted by the Sao Paulo State Association of Civil Construction Industries shows that this concentration in no way benefits its customers. Of a list of 65 construction materials, fiber-cement roofing sheets registered the highest increase in URV's in February -- 38.15 percent -- compared to the average increase during the last fourth-month period of 1993.
