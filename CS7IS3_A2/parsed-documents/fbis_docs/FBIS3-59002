Please bring along all the military clothes and equipment that you received." These weeks and months, all over Austria, tens of thousands of militia soldiers will receive similar call-up orders. He who has a company commander who is generous with information may learn from an accompanying letter that this is a measure within the framework of restructuring the Federal Army and that the exercise will be held in civilian clothes. This is necessary because some men will turn in their military clothes. No further details are mentioned. The largest organizational reform of the Federal Army in 20 years is taking place almost without people noticing. "Heeresgliederung (HG) neu" ["New Army Structure"] is the catchword, and it will lead to a reduction of the real mobilizing strength from 240,000 to 120,000 men. The new definition of tasks provides for disaster relief, assistance operations (Burgenland), and border protection operations (Slovenia 1991). A limited defensive action is regarded as less probable, although manageable. In the future, potential threats are to be warded off at the border. For this purpose, a 15,000-men reaction force should be available by 1995, two-thirds of which will consist of professional soldiers. How much the new army structure focuses on operations is also reflected in the fact that there is no longer a differentiation between organization for peace and for operations. The new structure provides for three corps, each consisting of one command battalion, one telecommunications battalion, one engineering battalion, and one reconnaissance battalion. Moreover, there are artillery, medical, and supply units at regiment strength. The 3d Corps (Lower and Upper Austria) has one extra regiment of engineers and the three Army brigades of armored infantrymen. In the sphere of the military command of Carinthia, Styria, and Burgenland, two brigades of infantrymen each -- each with 4,000 men -- and several units of guards and blocking troops will be set up. In the remaining six military commands, only brigades of infantrymen and guards and blocking troops will be established. With the establishment of the new army structure, almost all area-bound units (such as blocking battalions) have been dissolved. Only the personnel of the fixed installations retain their assignments. The futures of militia soldiers of dissolved units will depend on their qualifications, their abilities, and the personnel needs of the new units. What is certain is that all militia soldiers who have reached the new 35-year age limit will be discharged. Those who are younger and have not yet served all compulsory 60 days of exercises have to continue service until the age of 35, unless they are no longer needed because there are enough men or because of insufficient qualifications. The establishment of the new 120,000-man task organization will be concluded by the middle of 1995. "The conversion is going really well as far as the militia are concerned," Brigadier Friedrich Hessel, head of the General Staff Department in the Defense Ministry said. All troops receive Field Uniform 75 and Automatic Rifle 77. The old uniforms and the 58-rifle will no longer be used. The restructuring process will take somewhat longer in the area of training units. "Service regulations and ossified structures will cause delays," Hessel said. The Landwehrstammregimenter (LWSR) (infantry parent regiments), which were needed in the past as recruit schools for the militia army, have ceased to exist at the beginning of the year. In Lower Austria, for example, the LWSR 32 (Korneuburg) and 33 (Mautern) will become Motorized Infantry Regiment 3. The facilities will be kept. Basically, one can say that each unit will train its own recruits. He who starts his basic military service at Motorized Infantry Regiment 8 in Salzburg, will be used as a militia soldier within the framework of Motorized Infantry Brigade 8. Even in the restructured army, somewhat more than half of those doing basic military service will serve eight months in a row. Then they will be assigned to a task organization for a few years without, however, having to participate in any exercises. Those who used to serve six months will now have to do seven months, with the last 30 days mainly being dedicated to operational exercises. Then the remaining 30 days will have to be served in two-year intervals in the form of six-day exercises. Social hardship -- that is to say the dismissal of professional soldiers -- should be avoided whenever possible, although some officers and noncommissioned officers might be forced to commute to other facilities. "A soldier has to be that flexible," Brigadier Hessel said.
