Yet few have asked what such sanctions would achieve, it being assumed that sooner or later North Korea would have to admit to its nuclear ambitions. But if such an admission is not forthcoming, and if neither Russia nor China cooperate fully with Washington's policy, the US will have little real leverage, and North Korea will have succeeded in undermining the post-Cold War principle of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The assumption behind much of the manoeuvring over the Korean crisis has been that in the right circumstances North Korea would assent to international inspections which would establish the true character of the country's nuclear program. In the past year, following the breakdown in inspection which occurred in early 1993, it has further been assumed that such inspections would expose this program as having the purpose of producing nuclear weapons. This fact being demonstrated to the international community, pressures and inducements would then be used to motivate North Korea to abandon this weapons program. Tensions in the peninsula would ease, the Washington-Seoul alliance would be vindicated, and the principle of the unacceptability of nuclear weapons proliferation would be established. These assumptions have never been valid, and have now been exposed as flawed. There is little chance that North Korea would take any steps which would make available incontrovertible evidence that the country has a nuclear weapons program. All through this crisis, North Korean spokesmen have asserted that such a program does not exist. North Korea has rejected the final appeal to make available its nuclear records, so the issue will again be debated by the United Nations Security Council. If a resolution is proposed which would impose sanctions against the regime, what policy will North Korea follow? The most likely step North Korea would take would be to leave the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] regime. For more than a year, the country has been on its own reckoning but not according to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] in a position of "suspended withdrawal" with regard to the treaty. Such a step is the sovereign right of all signatories of the NPT, though withdrawal must be according to a set procedure which includes a three-month period of notice. Once outside the NPT, North Korea would undoubtedly suffer further recriminations and isolation. But UN action to levy sanctions or take other measures would only be legitimised if the country could be declared a common security danger to the general peace and safety of the world. Is it credible to regard North Korea as such a danger? The claim that the country is a general threat by virtue of its development of nuclear weapons is a weak one. There are a number of states outside the NPT, including Pakistan, Israel and India, that have nuclear weapons programs more sophisticated than that possessed by North Korea. North Korea has not been engaged in a war since 1953, and although its international behaviour leaves something to be desired, its recent record is no worse than (for example) Syria which is presently courted by Washington as an associate in the Middle East peace process. With these considerations in mind, it is unlikely that China would cooperate in levying sanctions. Without active Chinese support sanctions would not work, as more than half of North Korea's trade is with China. And it is always possible that China would act positively to veto any UN Security Council resolution on this issue. Meanwhile, the Russian proposal to convene an international conference on the issue, rather than adopt sanctions, has complicated matters further. Ever since President Yeltsin's visit to Seoul in 1992 the Russian influence in North Korea has been very much reduced. Now, smarting from domestic criticism from the right to the effect that Moscow's foreign policy has been made in Washington, Russia seeks to revive a role in a region long of strategic concern. This leaves the US in a difficult position. South Korea and Japan are prepared to act in concert with the US to pressure Pyongyang. Without cooperation from Beijing and Moscow, however, it is not clear what pressure will achieve beyond including further perceptions of isolation and embattlement in North Korea. American actions have contributed to these difficulties. Initially, it was said that North Korea had to surrender its nuclear capability, and unless it did so the military option would be considered. Then the US Secretary of State lectured the Chinese Government on its human rights failures. And Pakistan was offered a nuclear deal whereby provided no further fissile material was produced and the capping of its nuclear program was internationally verified, the country would be allowed to acquire further US weaponry. The first initiative undermined efforts to co-operate with China on the North Korea issue. The second must have signalled to Pyongyang that the US was prepared to refrain from too close a scrutiny of the past activities of nuclear proliferators provided that their behaviour improved in the future. But by arguing that the International Atomic Energy Agency have free access to the nuclear fuel elements currently being replaced in the reactor at Yongbyon, the US is insisting that all of the past history of North Korea's program should be exposed. Just at the time that it is possible to speak of the post-Cold War era in Europe, the Cold War alliance structure in North-East Asia has been given a new lease of life.
