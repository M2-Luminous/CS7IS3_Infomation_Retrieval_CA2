It will notably be recalled that when in September 1993, in the face of the serious economic and financial crisis our country had been experiencing, it became necessary to look for cost-saving measures that could remedy the situation, the government did not at any time hesitate to undertake direct negotiations with the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN] in order to agree on the level of sacrifices workers had to make. The government has always given the same attention to any matter affecting the life of workers. Thus, as soon as the CFA franc was devalued, various administrative and fiscal measures were taken to minimize the effects of the decision on the living conditions of workers. In this regard, apart from the reintroduction of price controls, various tax alleviation and inflation reduction measures on essential commodities were taken to make them accessible to the general consumer and, particularly, to workers. In the same desire to protect workers' purchasing power, salary deductions effected since August 1993 as part of the cost-saving measures, were stopped as from January. Instead, government workers' nominal salaries were automatically increased by 10 to 20 percent. Furthermore, during the ongoing negotiations with the labor unions, the government proposed an across-the-board and immediate increase of 5 to 12 percent in government workers' salaries. As it can be deduced, the cumulative salary increase that the government proposed ranges from 15 to 32 percent in relation to the predevaluation situation. Furthermore, after paying one -- that of March -- out of the four months of salary arrears inherited from the transition period, the government has undertaken to reduce the arrears for the remaining months in the course of this year, according to the following timetable. Nearing the 'Id al-Kabir festival, one month's worth of salaries will be paid, and at the beginning of the school term, another month's worth will be paid. At the end of the year, yet another month's worth will be paid. In other words, within 12 months, the government will pay the equivalent of 16 months of salaries of which three have already been paid to date. It should also be recalled that from May 1993 -- the beginning of the Third Republic -- to the end of March this year, salaries have been regularly paid without taking the months of arrears into account. Such efforts should not be underestimated in view of all the economic and financial difficulties that our country is battling with. All workers are aware of such difficulties today. This is why the government is greatly surprised to hear that despite these efforts, the USTN has launched a strike order to demand a salary increase following the devaluation, and a repeal of Ordinance 9302 of 3 September 1993 regulating government workers' right to strike as well as Decree 9412 PRM of 3 February 1994. The government is even more surprised because not only are the negotiations initiated with the unions in connection with the first point still under way, but especially because the USTN, in the very words of its secretary general, plans to refer the disputed law to the Supreme Court. How then does one explain the decision of a labor federation, which claims to respect republican values, to embark on a strike against a law it intends to contest before the highest legal body of our country without even waiting for a ruling on the matter. The essentially unionist rationale for this form of struggle, as one can see, is far from being established. This is why the government is urgently appealing to all democrats of integrity to foil the maneuvers of all those who, under the guise of (?unionism), are trying to satisfy their personal ambitions. At any rate, the government wishes to point out that since Ordinance 9302 of 3 September 1993, which regulates strike rights was enacted by the National Assembly, it will be fully and rigorously enforced. It should be noted, in particular, that failure by workers to comply with orders to go back to work and interference with work freedom will be punished in accordance with the law. Salary deductions corresponding to the number of strike days will be effected on the salaries of striking workers whose names shall be drawn up by the personnel director and forwarded to the finance and planning minister. Thank you. [end recording]
