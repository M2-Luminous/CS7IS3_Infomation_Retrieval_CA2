Senada Cumurovic has the details: [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] At the beginning of today's meeting, Assembly Secretary Avdo Campara announced that the assembly meeting will be held on Monday, 28 March. Deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Parliament will be able to express their views on the documents of the Washington agreement and adopt decisions on the future work of the assembly. Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic will speak at the assembly meeting on the political elements of the Washington agreement, while the expert portion will be expounded upon by Kasim Trnka, minister of the judiciary. In the second part of today's meeting, Dr. Trnka briefed the assembly deputies on the section of the Washington agreement that applies to the future work and setup of the assembly, pointing out that two significant (?aims) have been broached in the chapter on transient provisions: Bosnia-Herzegovina's international subjectivity and the internal continuity of institutions, especially the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since there is a possibility that the 28 March meeting could turn into a constitutional assembly, Minister Trnka expounded on this possibility: [Trnka] This means that during the debate about the proffered documents, the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina may in fact turn into a constitutional assembly, which consists of deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly elected in the 1990 elections whose term of office is still valid. This assembly would function as a constitutional assembly. One should take care not to [words indistinct] that the constitution is adopted in a way that the consensus of deputies who feel as Croats and the deputies who feel as Bosniaks be devalued. However, this national consensus is not sufficient. What is also needed is a two-thirds majority of the overall number of deputies. This in fact means that all other deputies have the same right to vote. If this constitution, which is for the time being only a proposal [words indistinct] political agreement, is adopted, then the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly will continue its work having two functions -- as the Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina which is going to continue to adopt decisions concerning the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its international relations and the Assembly of the Federation, whose competences encompass only the territory that is, by definition, populated by the majority Bosniak and Muslim population and, regarding its factual borders, (?when borders are definitely established) in the talks with the third side and in the talks about canonization of this federation. [Cumurovic] After providing an explanation, Dr. Kasim Trnka answered several questions from the deputies. Questions focused on, for example, how the occupied part of Bosnia-Herzegovina is defined in the agreement and who is supposed to pay war reparations. Dr. Trnka said that the agreement used the term of the territory with the majority Serbian population and as for war reparations, they are to be reimbursed by the state. [Words indistinct] establish the ways how to obtain the funds. The deputies today were informed that (Nazim Koledar) has been released from the camp, while Irfan Ajanovic is still (?detained). Concerning this, as well as some other cases, the Human Rights commission will meet and discuss the release of prisoners according to the already reached agreements.
