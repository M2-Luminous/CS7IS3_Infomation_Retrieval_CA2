Incredible as it might seem, if the past few days are any indication, Beijing looks like it has drawn a line under political reform and decided to allow cooperation to continue in other areas. Although the most hardline of mainland officials continue to utter dire threats that the gazettal of the electoral bill will harm Sino-British relations on all fronts, this has so far not proved to be the case. Instead there was the incredible sight of Chinese negotiators giving ground over the size of their future naval base on Stonecutters Island, during last week's defence lands talks, even as Governor Chris Patten was announcing his decision to go it alone on political reform. Then there was the heartening declaration from Guangdong Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Shaoji that cross-border co-operation would not be affected by the row. Yesterday, Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang even predicted that a date for further airport talks may be agreed this week. That will be the acid test of Beijing's intentions. The wind can change very fast in Zhongnanhai, and Chinese leaders may yet decide they need to use all the weapons at their disposal to try and drive down public support for Mr Patten to encourage legislators to vote down his proposals. But, for the moment at least, China seems to have recognised the harm that could result to its and the territory's interests, in following a strategy of severing co- operation on all fronts. That means there can be some hope that the years ahead may not be as rough as might otherwise have been expected.
