Russian Blue Helmets Off to the Balkans"] [Text] A send-off ceremony for a peacekeeping contingent of the Russian Armed Forces leaving for Yugoslavia was held at a military airfield in Ryazan. One-hundred strong, young volunteer servicemen comprising a staff company are to reinforce the 629th infantry battalion. Among them are men of 10 nationalities and religious faiths. The volunteer airborne troops servicemen, according to the edict of the president and government of Russia, will be carrying out a peacekeeping mission in a world hotspot. As Major General Nikolay Staskov, deputy commander of the MP [expansion unknown] of the airborne troops noted, the staff company includes a platoon of Muslim servicemen. This is being done at the request of the Russian Foreign Ministry in order to increase trust in our mission. In April, 200 more Russian peacekeepers will be sent to the East sector. Thus, the strength of our peacekeeping forces will be brought to 1,000 men. As the airborne troops commanders have stated, Russian peacekeeping servicemen are paid $800 to $1,000 as before. The government of Russia will soon make a decision on raising the allowance. First of all it envisions the payment of a second allowance in rubles in Russia and a number of other benefits, especially in social protection. For example, one year of service in Yugoslavia or in hotspots around the CIS will go on record as three years.
