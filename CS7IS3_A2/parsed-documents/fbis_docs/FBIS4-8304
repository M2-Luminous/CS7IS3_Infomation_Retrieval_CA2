FBIS4-8304 "dreeu070__a94072" FBIS-EEU-94-070-A Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Coalition Council Discusses Media Issues Coalition Council Discusses Media Issues AU1204100994 Prague CTK in English 2152 GMT 11 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1204100994 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, April 11 (CTK) -- The position of the general director of the News Agency of the Slovak Republic (TA SR), Dusan Kleiman, seems uncertain after today's meeting of the Slovak Coalition Council, which was mostly taken up by discussion of the situation in the Slovak media. Chairman of the Deputies' Group of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) Milan Ftacnik told journalists after the meeting that Deputy Premier Roman Kovac would be meeting with Kleiman soon, so that the latter could "explain his behavior with TA SR property and its transfer to private persons." According to the Slovak press, Kleiman gave the order for the agency's publishing rights to the "pro-Meciar" paper REPUBLIKA to be transferred to the paper's editor-in-chief, Jan Smolec, by March 20. They were transferred back eight days later, but during this time TA SR operated the newspaper and paid its costs. The press is also saying that the very publishing of the loss-making REPUBLIKA by the agency is a violation of the law. Ftacnik also said that the situation surrounding the Slovak Television and Radio Councils and the Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting also had to be clarified. The law should be changed so that each parliamentary party nominated an expert to the Council, he said. "The Councils' activity could thus be renewed without the suspicion that the ruling majority of the moment will always fill it with its people, people who suit it," Ftacnik said, adding that it was not impossible that a bill would be put before parliament at the end of April. Deputy Vladimir Miskovsky said that reservations concerning television news broadcasting were the main reason for the intended changes. Critics said, for example, that with party press conferences more coverage was given to the opposition than to the governing parties. Speculation about alleged "painful spots" in the government coalition was groundless, Ftacnik said. "Sometimes there are differences in opinion concerning the speed or effectiveness of several measures, but we always agree in the end," Miskovsky said of the state within the coalition, which comprises the SDL, three centrist groupings and the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). The coalition is also supported by the Hungarian minority parties, representatives of which also attended today's meeting.
