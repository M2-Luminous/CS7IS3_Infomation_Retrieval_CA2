"I cannot say there were any differences between the two sides," Mr. Velichkov said. The leader of Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] major opposition parliamentary party arrived Sunday on an informal visit to Bulgaria at the invitation of the extraparliamentary Fatherland Union. The Bulgarian side reminded that this country was the first one to recognize the sovereignty of Macedonia in January 1992 and laid a stress on the necessity for Macedonia to get in closer contacts with the European structures, the president's adviser said. He reiterated this country's stand against the embargo Greece has enforced against Macedonia and said Bulgaria believes it does not contribute to the stability in the Balkans. Dr. Zhelev expressed his desire that the two countries develop unselfish relations based on an equal footing. Bulgaria will, however, profit from the cooperation, Mr. Velichkov said. The meeting between Dr. Zhelev and Mr. Georgievski was held without the help of an interpreter, Mr. Velichkov also said. The Macedonian guest today met National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov to discuss the performance of the two countries' parliaments.
