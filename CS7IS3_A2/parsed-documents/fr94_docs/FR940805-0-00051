EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits, that contain conditions based upon the federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization, and which were issued by EPA prior to the effective date of this authorization. EPA has previously suspended issuance of permits for the other provisions on January 31, 1986, June 6, 1989, January 22, 1990, April 24, 1992, and August 2, 1993, the effective dates of Wisconsin's final authorization for the RCRA base program, and for subsequent program revisions. Wisconsin is not authorized to operate the Federal program on Indian lands. This authority remains with EPA unless provided otherwise in a future statute or regulation. C. Decision I conclude that Wisconsin's program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the HSWA. Accordingly, EPA grants Wisconsin final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Wisconsin currently has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program and its amendments. Wisconsin also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. D. Codification in Part 272 EPA incorporates by reference authorized State programs in Part 272 of 40 CFR to provide notice to the public of the scope of the authorized program in each State. Incorporation by reference of the Wisconsin program will be completed at a later date. Compliance with Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866.
