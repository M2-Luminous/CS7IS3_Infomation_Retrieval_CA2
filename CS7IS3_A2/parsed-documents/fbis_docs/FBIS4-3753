After hearing the reports by various cities, districts, towns, and the provincial department for foreign trade and economic cooperation and visiting 10-odd production enterprises, markets, and peasant households, Comrade Gu Jinchi said pleasantly: "The areas in the southern part of the province have clear targets for developing agriculture, town and township enterprises, and the export-oriented economy; early entered the orbit of sustained, stable, and fast development; and made positive contributions to and provided extremely good experiences for the province's economic development." Simultaneously, he made an important speech on the current economic work, the current social situation, and party building. It Is Necessary To Modernize Agriculture and To Urbanize the Rural Areas Comrade Gu Jinchi first stopped in Haicheng, one of the "100 economically powerful counties" in the country. As soon as he arrived in Haicheng, he did not give a thought to his rest but asked the leading comrades of Anshan and Haicheng about the situations. The first question he asked was agricultural production. He said: "Liaoning is a large industrial province. Last year, the province reaped a bumper grain harvest and had grain and vegetables enough and to spare. The central authorities highly assessed this. On the basis of ensuring stable growing areas, this year, we should reap another grain, oil-bearing crop, and cotton harvests. This is a major issue which we should pay attention to. [passage omitted] It Is Necessary To Combine Various Sectors of the Economy and To Accelerate the Rejuvenation of the Economy Inspired by the spring wind of reform over the past years, the southern areas of the province have rapidly developed various sectors of the economy, including the individual, private, and collective ones, persistently with the public ownership constituting the mainstay. Last year, the total output value of the town and township enterprises in Haicheng reached 13.7 billion yuan, and the profits realized by these enterprises reached 1.4 billion yuan. Town and township enterprises account for two thirds of the economic sphere. [passage omitted] To Develop Economy and Trade On a Large Scale, We Should First Mobilize the Forces of All Fronts On the morning of 2 April, Comrade Gu Jinchi heard the work reports of the Dalian city party committee and government and fully affirmed the work done by the city. He maintained: Last year, Dalian city made great achievements in its work. The 1994 work ideas and priorities conform to the reality of the city. He hoped that according to the defined targets, the city will grasp favorable opportunities, deepen reform, expand the scale of opening up, and further play a leading role in opening the province to the outside world. [passage omitted] We Should Conscientiously Strengthen Party Building Wherever he went, he laid special stress on strengthening party building. He pointed out: we should pay attention to accumulating the experiences in bringing into play the party's role as a political core in the course of developing the socialist market economy. We should cultivate a group of young party-member specialized talents; select, according to the standards for "having ideals, education, morality, and a sense of discipline," young cadres with both ability and political integrity; and transfer them to the leading bodies at various levels. We should persist in the mass line when selecting and promoting cadres. Some individual leaders select persons according to their own tastes. So, they often make mistakes. The leading bodies at various levels should persist in the principle of democratic centralism, strengthen unity, closely cooperate with one another, and make concerted efforts to achieve their work. Comrade Gu Jinchi said: We should realistically strengthen the construction of the grass-roots party organizations and pay attention to recruiting young outstanding party members from the forefront of production. The party organizations at various levels should proceed from the new situation and the new tasks and achieve the construction of ideas, organizations, and work style. Party-member cadres should take the lead in carrying forward the fine traditions of the party, establish close contacts with the masses, be the first to carry out the reform and open policies and develop the economy, and take the lead in guiding the masses to seek wealth.
