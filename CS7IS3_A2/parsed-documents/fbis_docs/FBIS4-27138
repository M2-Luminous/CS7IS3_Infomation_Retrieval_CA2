Perricos and one other IAEA senior envoy sent to Pyongyang to discuss possible measurements of fuel rods unloaded from an experimental 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon nuclear compound on Tuesday, arrived in Beijing together with the chief of IAEA team that conducted inspections in nuclear reprocessing facilities since may 17. The procedures proposed by North Korea were insufficient for IAEA to determine safeguards of the nuclear facilities and the talks ended in failure because the stalinist country refused the UN body's demand to stop unilateral unloading of the fuel rods, calling it political restriction, Perricos said. He said North Koreans refused to accept nuclear safeguards, admitting that IAEA and Pyongyang failed to narrow differences over lasting safeguards measures such as by regular and ad hoc inspections. The senior IAEA official was, however, cautious in forecasting the failure in talks could lead to sanctions against North Korea, saying it was up to the United Nations to decide. He said he told North Koreans that talks could be resumed if they wanted to. Perricos said his team had sent short report on the results of talks with North Korea and nuclear inspections to the IAEA headquarters on Friday, but added that he didn't know whether IAEA Director-General Hans Blix reported the results to the UN Security Council. He said the final report would be submitted at the IAEA headquarters when they arrive in Vienna.
