This was learned from the urban construction work conference yesterday. BOT is an investment form which is different from the previous practice of state appropriation. Chinese and foreign enterprises are not only investors in various projects, but are also managers and operators. Thus, investors may earn certain returns. At present, the cross-river tunnel that links Yanan East Road on both sides of the Huangbu Jiang was a project which adopted the BOT form, and the investor in the project is Hong Kong's CITIC Group. Earlier this year, the institutions concerned in Pudong put forth a number of BOT projects for inviting overseas investment, and these projects aroused strong interest among would-be investors. These projects included Route Number 1 of the Light Railway, a garbage incinerator, a central heating system, a waterworks, an airport express highway, and trunk roads in the new district. In addition, Pudong will allow collectives and individuals to make investments in or run some projects which are urgently needed. The government will adopt certain favorable policies to support such investment. At the same time, the market system for urban construction will be established and fostered, and the policymaking consulting mechanisms and technological reserve for urban construction and management will be strengthened. This year is a crucial year in the construction of the new district. A number of major projects, including five major roads and one major bridge, power supply facilities, communications facilities, and environmental improvement projects, will be completed within this year. People in the institutions concerned said that the measures adopted by Pudong for strengthening urban construction will be favorable to overcoming the shortage of funds, to introducing advanced management methods from foreign countries, and to bringing a benign cycle to the construction of the new district.
