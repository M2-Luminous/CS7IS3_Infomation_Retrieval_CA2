The LDP made the decision at a meeting of executives, party officials said. If two-thirds of the 20 joint panel members agree on a compromise plan, the four bills can be enacted into law once they are endorsed by a majority of votes at plenary sessions of both houses. The seven-party coalition hopes that the package would be enacted during the current Diet session by reaching a compromise with the LDP at the joint committee but the prospect of reaching an accord before the Saturday closure of the Diet is slim, political sources said. The coalition will be forced to take a floor vote on the package again at a plenary session of the lower chamber, the sources said. The legislation, which passed through the lower house last November, could become a law when passed a second time by the lower chamber by a majority of two-thirds or more of the members present. However, the coalition will need about 70 defections from the LDP to secure a majority of two-thirds in the lower house and political analysts say such a case is unlikely. Senior officials from the ruling coalition and the opposition of the lower house steering committee will agree later in the day to set up the committee and the forming of the committee will be formally endorsed at a lower house plenary session on Wednesday, Diet sources said. The committee will hold its first meeting after the two houses elect 10 members each, the sources said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has staked his political career on enacting the legislation before the current Diet session ends Saturday, is planning to hold a press conference to call for popular support for enactment of the package, government sources said. Hosokawa also hopes to hold a top meeting with LDP president Yohei Kono to break the deadlock, the sources said. The Hosokawa government displaced the LDP from power last August for the first time in nearly 40 years, pledging to clean up Japan's scandal-tainted political system. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata hinted at the possibility of dissolution of the lower house for a snap election should the government-proposed political reform bills be scrapped by the Diet. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi ruled out such a possibility.
