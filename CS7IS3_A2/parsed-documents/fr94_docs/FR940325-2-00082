Definitions of Terms For purposes of this Program Announcement the following definitions apply: ``Training'' is an educational activity or event which is designed to impart knowledge, understanding, or increase the development of skills. Such training activities may be in the form of assembled events such as workshops, seminars, or programs of self-instructional activities. ``Technical assistance'' is a problem-solving event generally utilizing the services of an expert. Such services may be provided on-site, by telephone, or other communications. These services address specific problems and are intended to assist with the immediate resolution of a given problem or set of problems. ``State'' means all of the States and the District of Columbia. Except where specifically noted, for purposes of this Program Announcement it also means ``Territory.'' ``Territory'' refers to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the American Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. ``Local service providers'' are the approximately 1,000 local public or private nonprofit agencies that receive Community Services Block Grant funds from States to provide services to, or undertake activities on behalf of, low-income people. ``Nationwide'' refers to the scope of the technical assistance training on data collection projects to be undertaken with grant funds. Proposed projects must provide for the implementation of technical assistance, training or data collection for a significant number of States, and the local service providers who administer CSBG funds. Part B_Purpose Section 681(a)(3) of the CSBG Act authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to States and public agencies and private nonprofit organizations, or to enter into contracts or jointly financed cooperative arrangements with States and public agencies and private nonprofit organizations, to provide for training and technical assistance to aid States in carrying out their responsibilities for conducting and administering the CSBG Program. OCS is soliciting applications which implement these legislative mandates on a national basis and in a comprehensive manner. OCS believes that training and technical assistance needs are best identified at the State and local levels, not at the Federal level. Therefore, funds will be provided in the form of grants. Proposed projects under this Program Announcement must focus on one of the following program priorities: Priority 1_ Training and Technical Assistance: The development and implementation of a comprehensive, nationwide training and/or technical assistance program to assist State staff and/or staff of local service providers which receive funding under the CSBG Act, to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to administer and implement programs designed to ameliorate the causes of poverty in the communities. Programs must include the provision of training and/or technical assistance to State staff and/or staff of local service providers nationwide, i.e., in each of the Federal Regions, in the most cost effective manner possible. Collaboration with State CSBG coordinators and local service providers will be required in identifying the training and technical assistance needs of staff of local service providers. Priority 2_ Data Collection: The design of a survey instrument, and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information on FY 1993 CSBG Programs on a nationwide basis through a process that relies on voluntary State cooperation. The information must be comprehensive enough and disseminated in such formats as to enable States and local service providers to improve their planning, management, and delivery of services and to assure that the general public has a clear understanding of those programs and their outcomes.
