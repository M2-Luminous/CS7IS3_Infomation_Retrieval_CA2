FR940920-1-00109 FR940920-1-00008 F. Executive Order 12875 Under Executive Order 12875, the EPA is required to consult with representatives of affected State, local, and tribal governments, and keep these affected parties informed about the content and effect of the proposed standards. The following discussion provides a brief summary of the content, need for, and cost of the proposal, as well as the actions that the EPA has taken to communicate and consult with the affected parties. 1. Summary of the Proposed Guidelines The proposed emission guidelines would establish emission limitations for existing MWC units located at MWC plants with plant capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW. The proposed guidelines do not specify which type of air pollution control equipment must be used at MWC's to meet the proposed emission limitations. The EPA expects, however, that, as a result of the proposal, most large MWC plants (plants with greater than 225 Mg/day capacity) would retrofit scrubbing systems (SD/ESP) for dioxins/furans, metals, and acid gas control and SNCR for NO X control. Small MWC plants (plants with 35 to 225 Mg/day capacity) would be expected to install scrubbing systems (DSI/ESP), but SNCR technology would not be necessary. Refer to section II of this preamble for a more detailed discussion of the proposed guidelines. 2. Need for the Proposed Guidelines Under the Act Amendments of 1990, section 129 includes a schedule that requires the EPA to adopt the emission guidelines for large and small MWC plants by the end of 1991 and 1992, respectively. The EPA did not comply with that schedule and is now under court order to propose the emission guidelines by September 1, 1994 and promulgate the emission guidelines by September 1, 1995. As required by section 129, the proposed emission guidelines would establish guideline emission levels for MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, PM, and opacity), MWC acid gases (HCl and SO 2 ), and NO X . See section I of this preamble for further discussion of the regulatory history and general goals of the proposed guidelines. 3. Cost of the Proposal The national cost of the proposed guidelines would be about $445 million per year. More than 40 percent of all existing MWC capacity subject to this proposal has already installed acid gas/PM control systems. The retrofit cost of the air pollution control system for an individual combustor subject to the proposed guidelines will vary depending on the plant size and difficulty of the retrofit. The average annualized retrofit cost of the proposed guidelines for a typical large MWC plant requiring retrofit would be about $4.1 million per year. The average annualized retrofit cost of the proposed guidelines for a typical small MWC plant requiring retrofit would be about $0.9 million per year. Tipping fees at combustors currently average about $57/Mg of MSW combusted. For those MWC plants that would require an air pollution control retrofit as a result of the proposal, the tipping fees would typically increase by $17 to $28/Mg, with the lower cost being for large MWC plants and the higher cost being for small MWC plants. Regarding the impact of the proposed guidelines directly or indirectly on households, the EPA projects an increase in the household cost of waste disposal of about $22 to $26 per year or about $2 per month for communities that have MWC's. Refer to section III.D of this preamble for a more complete summary of the cost and economic impacts of the proposed guidelines, on both national and plant-specific bases. 4. Communication With Affected Parties As previously mentioned, Executive Order 12875 requires the EPA to consult with representatives of affected State, local, and tribal governments, and prior to promulgation of final standards, summarize concerns of the governmental entities and respond to their comments. The EPA has already initiated consultations with numerous governmental entities including, but not limited to, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, the Municipal Waste Management Association, and the Solid Waste Association of North America. These groups have been informed of the content of the proposal and the estimated impacts. In drafting the proposal, the EPA has considered the concerns expressed by these groups, and discussions with these groups will continue following proposal. Following proposal, the EPA will mail a copy of this proposal to all owners/operators of MWC's and their associated local governmental official. The EPA awaits their comments on the proposal and will respond to their comments.
