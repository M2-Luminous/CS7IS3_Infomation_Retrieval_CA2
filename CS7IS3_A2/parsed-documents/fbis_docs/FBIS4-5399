"I have no request on the part of my government," Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's government representative for external economic affairs, told reporters after a private session with Kantor. Matsunaga, who heads a think tank on international relations, said he called on Kantor for advice on setting up a private forum to promote economic cooperation between Japan and North America. "Most of our conversations were about the forum I am thinking to establish," Matsunaga said. Matsunaga, a close confidant of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, insisted he and Kantor did not discuss any specific issues on how to resume stalled bilateral framework trade talks. But Matsunaga said he stressed to Kantor the importance to maintaining healthy bilateral ties between Japan and the United States, a conviction he said Kantor shared. "I am convinced that we can ultimately sort out our differences," Matsunaga later told reporters. Matsunaga said he met with both Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata before coming to Washington and will report back to Hosokawa after returning home this weekend. Apart from Kantor, he met with the top state department official in charge of economic relations, Undersecretary of State Joan Spero, on Wednesday. On Friday, Matsunaga is scheduled to meet separately with Robert Rubin, head of the White House National Economic Council, and Presidential National Security Adviser Tony Lake. Matsunaga's trip to Washington came as the Clinton administration was shifting to a less confrontational approach in resolving trade disputes with Tokyo. "We are moving in a measured and responsible and careful manner in order to work with Japan," Kantor told reporters Thursday. Kantor said he expects to review all outstanding trade issues between Japan and the U.S. when he sees Hata next week in Morocco. "I expect we will have a good meeting," Kantor said. Kantor and Hata are going to Morocco to join trade and foreign ministers from around the world in signing a new global trade pact.
