The measure aimed at protecting the local textile industry, which is facing a crisis of low prices because of an abundant and inexpensive supply of foreign textile products, affects 18 fiber, wool and cotton manufactured products. The Chilean Government has stated that the surcharge on Chinese textile products may be increased once a study establishes the extent of direct and indirect subsidies received by the Chinese textile and clothing industry. Chilean Textile Union Leader Manuel Bustos, who is currently president of the United Labor Confederation, has said that some Chinese companies have a zero-cost hand labor because people serving judicial sentences are used as forced labor.
