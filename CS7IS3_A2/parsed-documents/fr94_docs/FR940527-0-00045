ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Subsistence Board (Board) has amended that portion of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Federal Public Lands in Alaska, subpart C, which lists the areas and communities, and residents thereof, determined to have customary and traditional use of moose and rainbow trout on public lands (57 FR 22957&hyph;22964). Specifically, Board decisions made on April 5, 1993 and August 10, 1993 have changed the customary and traditional use determinations for rainbow trout in the Kuskokwim Area and for moose in Unit 1(B). EFFECTIVE DATES: April 5, 1993, for the customary and traditional use determination relevant to rainbow trout in the Kuskokwim Area, and, August 10, 1993, for the customary and traditional use determination relevant to moose in Unit 1(B).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Rainbow Trout In 1992, the communities of Quinhagak, Goodnews Bay, Kwethluk, Eek, Akiak, Akiachak, and Platinum requested that the Board reconsider a negative customary and traditional use determination for rainbow trout. These communities provided extensive testimony to the Board regarding their use of rainbow trout. In the summer and fall of 1992, staff from the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge and the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge conducted interviews in 19 communities within the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta to obtain additional information on customary and traditional uses of rainbow trout. Based on public testimony, more current survey data, and contemporary Alaska Department of Fish and Game subsistence use reports, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report (FWS report) on the subsistence uses of rainbow trout was completed in April 1993, and entitled Customary and Traditional use Eligibility Report: Rainbow Trout, Unit 18: Villages of Goodnews Bay, Platinum, Quinhagak, Eek, Kwethluk, Akiachak, and Akiak. Applying the eight factors of customary and traditional use as specified at 36 CFR 242.16 and 50 CFR 100.16, this FWS report assessed the customary and traditional uses employed by residents of these seven communities. The FWS report, which the Board used as support for its ultimate decision, found that the communities of Goodnews Bay, Platinum, Quinhagak, Eek, Kwethluk, Akiachak, and Akiak substantially met the requirements of the eight characteristics which exemplify customary and traditional use of rainbow trout in the lower Kuskokwim River region. Therefore, the Board concluded that residents of those villages have customarily and traditionally used rainbow trout for subsistence purposes. Moose, Unit 1(B) Concern for the health of the moose population in the Stikine River drainage of southeast Alaska prompted the Board to take action in April 1993 to: (1) Limit subsistence uses of moose on public lands in the Stikine River drainage to those qualified rural residents with a positive customary and traditional use determination for moose within the Stikine River drainage, and (2) reduce pressure on that moose population by only authorizing subsistence harvest of bulls with a spike-fork, or 50-inch antler configuration (or three brow tines on either antler). Federal customary and traditional use determinations, which had been adopted in 1990 from State of Alaska regulations, only recognized residents of Wrangell as having customary and traditional use of the moose population found in the Stikine River drainage.
