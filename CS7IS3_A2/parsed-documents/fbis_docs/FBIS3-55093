She said Gamsakhurdia and part of his supporters were ambushed in a village but she was not told about its location. Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said her husband had told his supporters to blow themselves up with grenades in the face of an overpowering pro-government unit. But he later shot himself dead "not wanting to cause anguish and pain to his associates," she said. Gamsakhurdia said she was told about her husband's death only on Wednesday. Gamsakhurdia's death puts an end to the national liberation movement in Georgia, which will forever remain in slavery, Manana said in tears. She said her husband was Georgia's last hope. She said she would like her husband to be buried next to his father's grave in the courtyard of their house in Tbilisi, something she said the government would never allow. The 54-year-old Gamsakhurdia took over the country's national democratic movement in 1989 following the death of its leader and well-known human rights campaigner Merab Kostava. In the same year, pro-democracy groups forged a "Round Table-Free Georgia" alliance which won an overwhelming majority in Georgia's free elections a year later, its first for many years. In 1991, Gamsakhurdia became the country's first democratically-elected head of state after gaining 97 percent of the vote. However, he was accused of dictatorship and overthrown in December 1991, after the anti-government forces mounted an attack on the presidential palace. Gamsakhurdia left it and went into hiding in the Chechen republic early in January 1992. However, the former president returned to western Georgia last fall to take charge of troops loyal to him.
