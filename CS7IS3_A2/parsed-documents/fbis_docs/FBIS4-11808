He added that this solution must not be a divided or a phased one. He stressed that the main topic on the Jordanian track is represented by restoring the occupied Jordanian territory, whose area is more than 350 km square, in addition to restoring Jordan's share of water, which was seized by Israel in the late fifties and in the early sixties, as well as the major part of the al-Yarmuk River water which it seized. Addressing a delegation of the Foreign Policy Association in Denmark, the prime minister added that when it addresses the issue of peace, Jordan is not thinking of war, and that Jordan has joined the peace process out of its awareness of the importance of peace, which should provide gains for all parties, whether these gains are material or moral, immediate or deferred ones. Dr. al-Majali reviewed the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the changes in the region and the world after the end of the Cold War, as well as the spread of new concepts in the world, which have introduced changes in the strategies of the United States and the Arabs. However, Israel took some time to adapt to the new situation away from the concepts of war, he added. He said: The process of change and the time required for this has been exhausted by Israel. The prime minister also reviewed Jordan's efforts to guarantee the Palestinians' participation in the peace talks, and to provide them with an umbrella through the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. He also touched on the obstacles Jordan has faced, beginning with the Jordanian-Israeli talks, and ending with the signing of the joint agenda, which included basic elements defining the objective of the negotiations; namely, the realization of a lasting and comprehensive peace, as well as the pillars of building mutual confidence in the future. Answering a question, the prime minister said: We cannot talk about the establishment of regional cooperative institutions before achieving peace. This is in order to avert the occurrence of problems in the future, taking into consideration that the original problem of the Middle East situation lies in the fact that Israelis have the land, while the Palestinians do not have it. Answering another question, he said: The refugees issue constitutes the biggest price Jordan has had to pay for peace since 1950 when the Palestinians decided to unite with Jordan to establish one state, something which was exploited by the Israelis. Jordan's stand toward this can be summed up by the fact that everyone who lives here is a Jordanian citizen whose political rights in his mother homeland are safeguarded as agreed upon in the 1950 unity agreement. This is one of the reasons that most of the refugees are still living in camps.
