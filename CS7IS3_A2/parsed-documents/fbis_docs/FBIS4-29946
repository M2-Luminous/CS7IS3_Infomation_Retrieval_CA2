FBIS4-29946 "dreas120__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-120-A Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Semiconductor Imports From Korea, Taiwan Grow Semiconductor Imports From Korea, Taiwan Grow 942A0315A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Jun 94 p 8--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0315A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The import of semiconductors from South Korea and Taiwan is rapidly increasing. According to trade statistics of the Ministry of Finance, the amount of memory imports from January to April 1994 was 36.7 billion yen or 3.3 times the same period of the previous year for Korean-made chips and 3.1 billion yen or 8.6 times the same period of the previous year for Taiwan-made chips. The high yen and recovery of domestic demand is behind the rapid increase in imports. On the other hand, with the favorable trend of U.S. personal computer shipments, exports to the United States are progressing steadily at 95.1 billion yen, a 26.5-percent increase over the same period of the previous year, and amplified the sense of a product shortage in the domestic market. It seems that the influx of Korean and Taiwan imports will continue in the future also. The core of imports from South Korea is 4-megabit DRAM (dynamic random access memory), which are procured by information communications instrument makers and personal computer peripheral makers who produce extended memory boards for the United States. Imports of mask ROM (read-only memory) used in game machines have also been increasing since around last year. Many of the Taiwan products are mask ROM and EPROM (erasable, programmable ROM) used in OA [office automation] machines. The fact that "the quality of Taiwan-made semiconductors is steadily rising" (electrical machinery manufacturer) has been cited as a primary factor for the increase in imports. Driven by the increased production of memory for personal computers for the United States, a shortage is continuing for various kinds of memory in the domestic market, including DRAM. Actually, the BB ratio (ratio of amount of orders received to amount of shipments) of the U.S. semiconductor market in April was on a high level of 1.14. The amount of memory needed due to the strengthened functions of personal computer software is increasing, and major domestic semiconductor manufacturers just about agree with the view that "at least the U.S. memory demand will progress vigorously within the year."
