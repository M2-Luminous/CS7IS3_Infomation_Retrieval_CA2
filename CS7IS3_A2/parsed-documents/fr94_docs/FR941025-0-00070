FR941025-0-00070 FR941025-0-00025 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 658 [Docket No. 941093&hyph;4293; I.D. 100394B] Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Emergency interim rule. SUMMARY: NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule at the request of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) to increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico. The intent of this action is to prevent an unnecessary closure of the royal red shrimp fishery. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 19, 1994, through December 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of documents supporting this action may be obtained from the Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, FL 33702. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael E. Justen, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The shrimp fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 658. The FMP was prepared by the Council under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The FMP establishes an optimum yield (OY) equal to the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for royal red shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico of 177.8 metric tons (mt) and estimates the domestic annual harvest (DAH) at 111.6 mt. All weights are tail weights. As specified in section 201(d) of the Magnuson Act, the difference between OY and DAH, 66.2 mt, is designated as the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). Accordingly, the shrimp regulations at 50 CFR 658.21 specify a domestic quota for royal red shrimp of 111.6 mt and require the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, to close the fishery for royal red shrimp when the quota is reached. The TALFF for royal red shrimp was published on February 3, 1987 (52 FR 3248). Since that time, there has been no foreign harvest of royal red shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico. As of July 30, 1994, the domestic harvest of royal red shrimp was 88.3 mt. At the present rate of harvest, the domestic quota is expected to be reached in early October 1994, and the fishery must be closed. Such a closure, although required by the regulations, would be contrary to the goals of the FMP and the Magnuson Act because it would prevent attainment of the OY from the fishery.
