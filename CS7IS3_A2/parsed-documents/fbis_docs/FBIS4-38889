Dniester Region and Moldavia at Negotiating Table"] [Text] As you know, the meetings in April between the president of Moldavia [Moldova] and the Dniester Moldavian [Moldovan] Republic ended with the signing of a statement in the presence of representatives of the CSCE and the Russian president, which speaks of the need to resolve all contentious issues solely by means of talks and by peaceful means alone. Mircea Snegur and Igor Smirnov agreed on the need to define the state-legal status of the Dniester Region as well as the need for a phased program to establish and implement state-legal relations and delegate and demarcate the sides' powers. The latest meeting at expert level is now in preparation. But Mircea Snegur believes that the talks will nonetheless be hard. Kishinev [Chisinau] is considering defining the status of the Dniester Region within the framework of a single state. Especially since the statement signed by the two presidents is based on the principle of the unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. Tiraspol has not as yet revealed its view of the state-legal status of its unrecognized republic. But, in Mircea Snegur's opinion, the DMR wants more -- federalization or even confederalization. Incidentally, this conclusion is prompted by the Dniester Moldavian Republic's support for the idea of legalizing unrecognized states put forward by Robert Kocharyan, chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh State Defense Committee. It is also obvious that Russia's position will still particularly influence the settlement of the Dniester problem. Incidentally, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has learned that the latest ninth round of Russian-Moldavian talks on the status of the Russian Army in Moldavia will be held in Moscow 7-8 June 1994. As you know, progress at these talks depends completely on Moldavia's granting the Dniester Region state-legal status.
