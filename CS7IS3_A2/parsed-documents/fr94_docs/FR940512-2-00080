FR940512-2-00080 FR940512-2-00052 2. Second claim for relief-monopolization. EPS's actions and practices also constitute monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. An unlawful monopoly involves both the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power. Willful acquisition or maintenance of a monopoly is shown by conduct that excludes rivals on some basis other than efficiency, superior skill, foresight or industry. Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp. , 472 U.S. 585 (1985); United States v. Grinnell Corp. , 384 U.S. 563 (1966). As described above, EPS's MAC network is the only ubiquitous regional ATM network available to banks in the affected states, and banks cannot forego access to such a network. EPS's prohibition of third party processing and other practices prevents many banks from using competing regional ATM networks, and results in the exclusion of those networks. EPS's conduct therefore constitutes unlawful monopolization. III Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgments The proposed Final Judgment will end unlawful practices that substantially reduce competition in the markets for regional ATM network access and ATM processing. The injunctions of the proposed Final Judgment do so by removing substantial barriers to the entry of competition in the affected states. Removal of these barriers is the most effective means of providing current and future MAC member banks with additional options for the purchase of these services. These practices are enjoined, and these barriers are removed, by the injunctions of Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment, which require EPS to terminate its restrictions on the use of third party processors by MAC members, to ensure that qualified third party processors can obtain access to the MAC network, and to enable MAC members to join other regional ATM networks. Paragraphs A through D of Section IV require EPS to terminate its restrictions on the use of third party processors by MAC members. EPS is enjoined from requiring its members to purchase ATM processing from MAC, from forbidding the use of third party processors, from conditioning the price or other terms of MAC membership on the use or non-use of third party processors, and from restricting the ability of MAC members to obtain third party processing. EPA is also enjoined from charging any additional fees to MAC members for the use of third party processors. 7 7 The proposed Final Judgment permits EPS to charge an hourly fee for reasonably necessary work performed by its personnel in connection with a bank becoming the customer of a third party processor. The total charge may not exceed $1000 unless significant difficulties arise at the processor's or bank customer's end. Paragrahs E and F of Section IV ensure that qualified third party processors will be able to access the MAC network in order to forward network transactions of their MAC member customers. To ensure that qualified third party processors will obtain adequate communications links to MAC, the links provided to third party processors must be provided on the same terms as the links MAC provides to its intercept processor customers. 8 So that qualified third party processors can operate in the most efficient manner, EPS must, to the extent feasible, permit transactions from multiple banks to pass over a single communications link rather than requiring a separate link for each bank. Except under specified circumstances where immediate termination would be appropriate, EPS may not terminate a third party processor without providing 30 days notice, and it must provide a copy of the notice to the United States. This will give the United States an opportunity to examine the competitive consequences of any such termination. 8 As explained in Section II.A.2 of this Competitive Impact Statement, intercept processors are generally the larger banks and therefore those that have the largest ATM transaction volumes. Accordingly, they provide the most revenue per bank to EPS, giving EPS a strong incentive to provide them adequate services, including communications links. Because EPS has an incentive to deal fairly with its intercept processor customers, several provisions of the decree concerning treatment by EPS of third party processors (and MAC members that use third party processors) are tied to EPS's treatment of intercept processors in similar circumstances. By using the treatment of intercept processors as a benchmark, the proposed Final Judgment avoids a detailed regulatory approach to these issues. To allow EPS to ensure the quality of the MAC network, the proposed Final Judgment requires EPS to provide MAC network access only to qualified third party processors. As with the quality of communications links, the standards for qualification of third party processors are tied to MAC's qualification standards for intercept processors. A third party processor is qualified if it meets MAC's technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party processors providing services to only one bank, and whatever additional technical criteria concerning the format and content of transmissions are appropriate for third party processors processing for multiple banks. These criteria may not discriminate between intercept and third party processors, nor may EPS charge additional fees to third party processors for certification. 9 9 As discussed in footnote 7, EPS may charge a one-time fee for reasonably necessary work it performs when a third party processor adds another bank. This charge, whether directed to the bank or the third party processor, may not exceed $1000. Paragraph G of Section IV prevents EPS from discriminating in the price of ATM network access against MAC members that choose to utilize third party processors. The volume discounts available to members using third party processors must be the same as the volume discounts available to intercept processors. Also, EPS must use a single price schedule for banks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, the areas in which the MAC network has historically had the greatest monopoly power, and in which two of its principal owners (CoreStates and PNC) are located. By drawing this larger area, EPS may not favor its own stockholders in Pennsylvania without giving similar volume discounts to large banks in New Jersey and Delaware. EPS may use different price schedules in other states. The preceding injunctions will remove the restrictions EPS has imposed on MAC member banks in their choice of ATM processors, and thereby break the unlawful tie EPS has established between purchase of MAC ATM network services and purchase of ATM processing. The direct consequence will be to make the purchase of third party processing a realistic option for MAC members. This should bring about the entry of competitors to MAC for ATM processing. As discussed in Section II.A.3 of this Competitive Impact Statement, third party processors often have links to many regional ATM networks, and so use of a third party processor by a bank can facilitate its joining of multiple ATM networks. Therefore, an indirect consequence of breaking the unlawful tie between MAC ATM network services and processing services will likely be an increase in competition in the markets for regional ATM network access in the affected states.
