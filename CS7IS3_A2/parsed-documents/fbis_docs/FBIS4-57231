The drafters of the document believe the PT should promote a national movement calling for structural reforms in the country. They thus consider it essential that the party, its economists, and congressmen launch an offensive to publicly fight the plan. The call for a mobilization against the economic plan is made in a document entitled "The Current Situation and Our Campaign Strategy," which was drafted by a committee appointed by the PT national executive board and approved at the PT national meeting in Brasilia on 1 May. Coordinators of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's campaign believe that unfulfilled social and salary demands at this time will later result in a wave of demands on the future government. They deny, however, charges that they are instigating political strikes to benefit Lula's campaign. Economist Joao Machado, who is the deputy coordinator of the PT program, said: "The fact is that the PT is urging all those who are unhappy with the government's plan to vent their dissatisfaction. It is ridiculous, however, to charge us with instigating political strikes."
