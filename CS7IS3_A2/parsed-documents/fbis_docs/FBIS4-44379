With four parties hovering around the 4-percent barrier, glorious days are ahead for party strategists. Receiving 3.9 percent of the vote will mean having no seats and being out in the cold, while 4.1 percent will mean 14 seats and a chance at cooperation in the government. The difference amounts to about 150,000 votes. If, for example, New Democracy splits and disappears from the Riksdag, that will presumably wreck the only chance for a government across the bloc boundary -- meaning, in fact, a coalition government consisting of the Social Democrats and the Liberal Party. New Democracy's future will probably be decided as early as this weekend, when the party holds its special congress. With the party standing at about 2 percent in the polls, its party group split into three factions, and a palace revolution under way against the party leader, the odds do not look good. But this does not necessarily mean that the party is on its way out. That depends on how skillful it is at persuading "tactical voters." The reason is that all four small parties are swarming with tactical voters, who are fickle by nature. A full four out of every 10 New Democracy voters actually favored a different party in the last election, according to a voter poll by election researchers Mikael Gilljam and Soren Holmberg. The most common case was that of a Moderate Party voter who voted for New Democracy just to get fresh faces in the Riksdag. The Green Party's electorate also includes a great many unfaithful voters. One-fourth of its voters actually favored some other party -- in this case mostly the Liberal Party or the Social Democratic Party [SDP]. Of the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] voters, 14 percent actually favored another party -- not unexpectedly, the Moderate Party. On the other hand, the Left Party, which by tradition has always had a large element of tactical voters, has lost some of its attractiveness in recent elections. Among those who voted for it in 1991, only 10 percent were SDP supporters. That has favored the Social Democrats. The question, then, is what the tactical voters will do in this fall's election: Will they abandon a sinking ship or put their votes on the line to save it? Things look brightest for the Left Party. Although that party has not yet benefited to any great extent from the wind blowing to the left, it has the longest tradition of tactical voting. It is strange, however, that the Left Party has not done better at exploiting the feminist winds that are blowing, especially since the party's leader is a woman. For the moment, it seems that women prefer the SDP and the Liberal Party. It is also true that Gudrun Schyman lacks Lars Werner's folksiness, and she will probably never equal him in popularity. With the child care allowance, the KDS has lost its only distinctive issue in this fall's election. "Further improvements" is a message that presumably will not sell as well. The KDS will no doubt be wiser to become the nonsocialists' "comrade 4 percent." Alf Svensson will presumably be able to attract votes by standing out as a more obvious supporter of a nonsocialist (Moderate) government than Olof Johansson and Bengt Westerberg. Both the Left Party and the KDS are helped by the fact that they have taken a clear stand on the government issue. This fall's election will be between two clear alternatives for government, and the focus will be on the big issues: the economy and unemployment. The Green Party has cleared away most of its internal conflicts, and that should bring some of its voters back. But the party is empty-handed on economic issues, its profile is fuzzy, its right wing from 1988 has still not returned, and its set of leaders is a little weak. "The party must come across properly in the media, otherwise it probably won't succeed," says Mikael Gilljam. What about New Democracy, then? Well, if the party still exists in its present form after this weekend's special congress, it will presumably have to make a big effort. "It will probably be saved only if Bert Karlsson takes command and succeeds in attracting conservative opponents of the EU [European Union]," says Mikael Gilljam. Strong and Weak Points of Small Parties The Left Party (leader: Gudrun Schyman) is in an extremely strong position in terms of its opposition to the EU, and its stands on the environment and women's issues are strong points. It is neither strong nor weak as "comrade 4 percent." Schyman is a weak point. Faithful tactical voters may save the day for this party, although their numbers are dwindling. The Green Party (leader: Birger Schlaug) is in a very strong position in terms of its opposition to the EU and its stands on the environment and the bridge over the Sound, but is extremely weak in that it has not chosen sides and from the standpoint that it is a single-issue party. The party probably needs a nuclear accident, a couple of dead seals, or a comeback by Asa Domeij. The KDS (leader: Alf Svensson) is in a strong position in terms of its family policy and a very strong position as a "nonsocialist guarantor." Its stand in support of Christian morality is an extremely weak point, and its stand on the child care allowance is also a weak point. Having Alf Svensson as its leader is an extremely strong point. The child care allowance is dead as an election issue, although the KDS will certainly try to revive it once again. New Democracy (leader: Harriet Colliander) is extremely weak from the standpoint of its internal split, its leadership crisis, and its fuzzy profile. Its stand on the refugee issue is an extremely strong point. As things stand now, there is no chance that the party will win any seats in the Riksdag. Forming New Government May Be Harder Than Ever Forming a new government after this fall's election may be more complicated than ever. The more small parties there are that clear the 4-percent hurdle and win seats in the Riksdag, the more possibilities there will be for forming a government coalition. From a purely technical standpoint, the procedure for equalizing representation in the Riksdag may create problems if three or four parties end up just above the 4-percent mark. In such a case, the 39 seats set aside for the equalization procedure will probably not suffice for ensuring a completely proportional distribution of seats. In that case, the formation of a government may depend on which parties end up under- or overrepresented. In the present situation, three main alternatives emerge as far as the government issue is concerned: First, the four-party coalition could continue in power. Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerberg has stated firmly that he is not willing to be part of another nonsocialist minority government dependent upon New Democracy. If Westerberg keeps his word, what it will mean in practice is that the only chance for the four-party coalition's survival will be New Democracy's departure from the Riksdag. It seems completely unrealistic to think that the four parties will win their own majority and that the New Democrats will manage at the same time to remain in the Riksdag. This means that from the purely technical standpoint of forming a government, hara-kiri by the New Democrats would make it easier for the four-party coalition to survive. Where New Democracy's former voters would go after that is another question. This alternative would also require that Alf Svensson and his Christian Democrats persuade their voters that they are needed in the Riksdag for another term. The very best solution, of course, would be for the Left Party to pack its bags and for the Green Party to have to stay in its dandelion patch. Second, the Social Democrats could form a government on their own. If they win their own majority, it will be just a matter of moving ahead. But even though they are doing well in the opinion polls, it is not likely that they will receive more than 50 percent of the vote in this election. But if they win such a large majority on their own that no other constellation of parties can form a majority, they could form a minority government with one or more supporting parties. In that case, it would be preferable for both the KDS and New Democracy to lose their representation in the Riksdag. On the other hand, it would be best if the Left Party, which has traditionally been the guarantor of a Social Democratic minority government, were to remain in the Riksdag. Gudrun Schyman can hope that "comrade 4 percent" is still functioning. Alternatively, the Social Democrats would have to seek support from a Green Party willing to negotiate. That is probably a considerably less attractive alternative. After a Social Democratic government is actually formed, it can seek support from the Liberal Party or the Center Party on specific issues. Third, a government across the bloc boundary will be formed only if none of the other alternatives is possible. In this case, the most likely alliance would be one between the Social Democrats and the Liberal Party. Bengt Westerberg and Ingvar Carlsson have similar views on the public sector and on welfare policy. The Center Party might also be brought into the government, but that is less likely. But this alternative is based on the assumption that the Liberal Party will do well in the election and at least equal its 1991 results. The Liberal Party can scarcely enter a coalition government with the Social Democrats if it does worse this time than it did in 1991. It will also have to be wooed with a fairly fat offer giving it considerably more influence than its size warrants. A government across the bloc boundary will be more likely if neither the Left Party nor the Green Party clears the 4-percent hurdle and if New Democracy hangs on in the Riksdag. Guide for Tactical Voters If the KDS wins seats in the Riksdag but New Democracy, the Green Party, and the Left Party do not, the probable result will be a nonsocialist four-party coalition. If the Left Party and the Green Party win seats but the KDS and New Democracy do not, the probable result will be a Social Democratic government. If New Democracy wins seats but the Left Party and the Green Party do not, the probable result will be a government across the bloc boundary. If the KDS and the Left Party win seats but New Democracy does not, it is probable that neither bloc will have the advantage.
