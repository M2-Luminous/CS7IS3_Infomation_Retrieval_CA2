He claims he has no "Lulaphobia" and says he does not approve of constitutional revision in the way it is now being carried out. [Rothenburg] Do you believe that parties such as the PMDB, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], and others can form an alliance capable of defeating the PT [Workers Party] at the ballot box, considering that all the polls now show Lula as the favorite? [Sarney] An alliance cannot be against anyone. We must have an alliance, true, but not to defeat the PT. An alliance must be based on a plan for the country, and we are going to work to that end. I have no Lulaphobia. The PT is now a large organization and part of the country's institutional structure. The PT needs to combat its radicals whether it wins or loses, and Lula is mindful of that. I am not one of those who start talking disaster when they think of the PT. [Rothenburg] Does this mean that you might even support Lula in the second round of balloting? [Sarney] In politics, we cannot talk about what might happen in the future. At the moment, our problem is to establish an alliance that will have a plan for the country. And that alliance cannot exclude the PFL [Liberal Front Party]. [Rothenburg] Do you believe it will be easy to bring the PSDB, PFL, and PMDB with all their different factions together following Governor Ciro Gomes's criticism of certain people in the PMDB? [Sarney] The evaluation of alliances will have to be made by those entrusted with making it. I will not comment on the statements by Governor Ciro Gomes. What I do know is that we have already had one experience with the PFL--the Democratic Alliance--and it resulted in the election of 22 governors and an absolute majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. [Rothenburg] But who would be the ideal candidate for that alliance? [Sarney] I don't know, but it will have to be someone from the PMDB, since that is the largest party. It is necessary in an alliance to take the weight of each party into account. The PMDB is a center-left party. It was responsible for the democratic transition, and it has some outstanding people. Anyone from that party who is a candidate will have my support. [Rothenburg] Would you exclude your own name from those negotiations? [Sarney] I have received several letters from admirers asking me not to exclude my own name. I have told all of them that I do not want to throw my hat in the ring. I have already been president, and I have no more ambitions. [Rothenburg] You had dinner on Tuesday with Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Was there any promise of support for the plan? [Sarney] Basically, what we talked about was constitutional revision. What I see is an absence of guidelines in our work. There is no coordination regarding the points that need revision. [Rothenburg] Are you against revision? [Sarney] No. The problem is that we are concerning ourselves with peripheral matters and engaging in casuistry.
