North Korea has notified the United States of its wish to resume last-minute talks with the IAEA as the Feb. 21 opening of the agency's board meeting nears, the sources said, predicting a breakthrough in the disagreement over nuclear inspections. Previous talks went nowhere as North Korea flatly opposed full-scale inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites while insisting on limited inspection of the secretive reprocessing facility and reactor at Yongbyon. The North Koreans may show more flexibility on allowing inspections in this round of negotiations, the sources said. Pyongyang, informing Washington of its intention to resume talks with the IAEA at a recent unofficial meeting, urged the United States to keep its promise to hold a third round of high-level negotiations to discuss suspension of the annual military exercise "Team Spirit" with South Korea and improving bilateral ties. The sources said Pyongyang and Washington have narrowed their differences over nuclear inspections a great deal, but did not elaborate. There is a possibility that North Korea may accept full-scale nuclear inspections by attaching a number of conditions, but it is uncertain whether it will use that card before the IAEA board meeting or before the end of the month, when the North Korean nuclear matter will likely be referred to the U.N. Security Council if there is no progress on inspections. After six rounds of unsuccessful talks, North Korea has shunned the IAEA since Jan. 25, accusing the U.N. nuclear watchdog of trying to force complete inspections. It remains uncertain whether Pyongyang will resume talks with the IAEA and working-level contacts with the United States in New York at the same time.
