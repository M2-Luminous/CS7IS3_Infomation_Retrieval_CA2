Lage said this opening is one of the paths that the Cuban Government must try in an effort to pay off its debts. The official said Cuba could pay what it owes Venezuela, approximately $47 million, through investments by Venezuelan businessmen. Cuba's debt problem can be traced back to the agreement signed between Venezuela and Russia in 1986. Under that agreement, Russia committed itself to supplying oil to Germany (a client of Venezuela), and, in exchange, Venezuela supplied oil to Cuba. In 1991, the Caribbean island found itself in the position of having to pay for Venezuelan oil deliveries in cash in line with demands made by the Venezuelan Government. Cuba, however, was unable to meet the requirements. With a view to establishing trade relations that would allow the island to pay off its debt, the Cuban vice president showed special interest in activities related to tourism, because he believes this sector could ultimately attract Venezuelan investments. Lage also believes that Venezuela has more tourist experience than Cuba. Cuba wants to learn from other Latin American countries, avoid environmental problems, and create a modern infrastructure. The meeting held at FIV headquarters was attended by Cuban Ambassador Norberto Hernandez; Gonzalo Garcia Bustillo, Venezuela's diplomatic representative to Cuba; and Carlos Sequera Yepez, former president of the Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Although it is gratifying to know that the representative of a nearby country considers Venezuela's experience to be a reference point for establishing its own framework for development, the FIV's record in attracting foreign investments has been scant in recent years. We have to give time to the new FIV administration headed by Abdon Vivas Teran to determine whether we will see the fruits of the privatization of hotels and the channeling of multilateral financial support aimed at turning tourism and the services industry into a source of economic development.
