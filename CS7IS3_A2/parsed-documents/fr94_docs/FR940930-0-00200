FR940930-0-00200 FR940930-0-00028 (ii) Within 120 days of receipt of the application for exemption, the Administrator will notify the applicant either that an exemption is granted or that sufficient cause for an exemption has not been demonstrated and that all of the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier's vehicles are subject to the post-installation test requirement of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (iii) If the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier granted an exemption originally estimates that 300 or fewer conversions would be performed in the calendar year, and then later revises the estimate to more than 300 for the year, the certifier shall inform the Administrator of such revision. A post-installation emissions test for each conversion performed after the estimate is revised is required pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The estimated number of conversions from such a clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier must be greater than 300 in the following calendar year. (2) A clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with aggregate sales less than 10,000 converted vehicles within a given calendar year shall conduct post-installation emissions testing using either of the following test methods: (i) The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the converted vehicle must be determined in the manner in which CO emissions are determined according to the inspection and maintenance requirements applicable in the area in which the vehicle is converted or is expected to be operated. (A) For dual-fuel vehicles, a separate test is required for each fuel on which the vehicle is capable of operating. For flexible fuel vehicles, a single test is required on a fuel that falls within the range of fuel mixtures for which the vehicle was designed. The test fuel(s) used must be commercially available. (B) A converted vehicle shall be considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph if the vehicle's measured exhaust CO concentration(s) is lower than the cutpoint(s) used to determine CO pass/fail under the inspection and maintenance program in the area in which the conversion is expected to be operated. (1) If CO pass/fail criteria are not available for a vehicle fuel type then pass/fail criteria specific to gasoline use are to be used for vehicles of that fuel type. (2) [Reserved]. (ii) The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the converted vehicle must be determined in the manner specified in the two speed idle test-EPA 91 found in 40 CFR 85.2215. All provisions in the two speed idle test must be observed except as detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. (A) For dual and flexible fuel vehicles, a separate test is required for each certification test fuel required for exhaust emissions testing pursuant to 40 CFR 86.113 or 40 CFR 86.1313. (B) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the test fuels used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR 86.113. For heavy-duty engines the test fuels used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR 86.1313. (C) A converted vehicle shall be considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph if the following criteria are satisfied: (1) The vehicle's measured idle mode exhaust CO concentration(s) must be lower than the sum of 0.4 percent CO plus the idle mode certification CO emissions reference value as determined according to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (2) The vehicle's measured high-speed mode exhaust CO concentration(s) must be lower than the sum of 0.4 percent CO plus the high-speed certification CO emissions reference value as determined according to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (D) For the purposes of the post-installation emissions testing required by paragraph (c) of this section, the following adjustments to the two speed idle test-EPA 91 in 40 CFR 85.2215 are necessary. (1) Testing of hydrocarbon emissions and equipment associated solely with hydrocarbon emissions testing is not required. (2) The CO emissions pass/fail criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215(a)(2), (c)(1)(ii)(A), (c)(2)(ii)(A)( 1 ), (c)(2)(iii)(A)( 1 ), and (d)(3)(i) are to be replaced with the pass/fail criteria detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. All HC pass/fail criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215 do not apply. (3) The void test criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215(a)(3) and (b)(2)(iv) associated with maintaining the measured concentration of CO plus CO 2 above six percent does not apply. However, the Administrator may reconsider requiring that the void test criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215(a)(3) and (b)(2)(iv) be applied, and may issue an advisory memorandum to this effect in the future. (4) The ambient temperature levels encountered by the vehicle during testing must comply with the specifications in 40 CFR 86.130 or 40 CFR 86.1330. (d) The clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier shall be considered a manufacturer for purposes of Clean Air Act sections 206 and 207 and related enforcement provisions, and must accept liability for in-use performance of all the vehicles produced under the certificate of conformity as outlined in 40 CFR part 85. (1) The useful life period for the purposes of determining the in-use liability of the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier shall be the original useful life of the vehicle prior to conversion. (2) [Reserved]. (e) Tampering. (1) The conversion from an engine or vehicle capable of operating on gasoline or diesel fuel only to a clean-fuel engine or vehicle shall not be considered a violation of the tampering provisions of Clean Air Act section 203(a)(3), if such conversion is done pursuant to a conversion configuration certificate by the aftermarket conversion certifier or by an installer listed on the certificate.
