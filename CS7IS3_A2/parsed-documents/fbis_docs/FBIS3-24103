Now We Have To Sort Out Who Got Elected"] [Text] ALMATY The three-month-long election marathon in Kazakhstan, which was to determine the composition of the first professional parliament and new local representative bodies--maslikhats--has reached the finish line. On 7 March, At exactly 0700, the doors of more than 10,000 republic election precincts opened, almost 7,000 of them in rural settlements and at animal breeders' winter camps. Kazakhstan citizens abroad also voted--at 14 precincts in our representations. Almaty election precincts were crowded from the very early morning. This confirmed once again the validity of sociological services' forecasts: Population polls conducted on the eve of the elections showed that at least 70 percent of the voters intended to participate. Most of them, in answering correspondents' questions before dropping the ballot in the box, did not hide that they would choose progressively-minded candidates for deputies. Nursultan Nazarbayev and his spouse came to cast their votes at the election precinct set up in Friendship House. The head of the government held an impromptu press conference for local and foreign journalists on the spot. The questions asked were mainly one and the same, just different phraseology: What hopes does the president pin on the new parliament? I hope very much, he said, that a professional parliament will work more actively than the old one, and will contribute more to the democratization of our young sovereign state, the advancement of economic reforms, and the reorganization of the legal system. In order to successfully carry out this role, it will have to adopt laws that will realistically advance transformations in the republic and at the same time will attract Western investors into its economy. Journalists got no reply to the question, however, which of the candidates for Supreme Council deputy seats did the Nazarbayevs vote for. All I can tell you, joked the president, is that my wife and I had no disagreement in this respect. Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko also cast his vote in the same precinct. In an interview by journalists he emphasized that in any civilized country the government and the parliament are in certain opposition to each other, and this is quite logical. But at the same time, it is very important for the Supreme Council to adopt laws and decrees that the government could realistically carry out and that would be backed by financial and material resources. Deputies should not make strictly populist decisions. One of the precincts was located in Kazakh Secondary School No. 12 in the center of the capital. The stream of voters here was such that lines quite often formed to the enclosed ballot booths. There are quite a few young people, and this clearly refutes certain maxims on this subject: Our youth, they say, is apolitical. Vice President Erik Asanbayev came to cast his vote here. Answering correspondents' questions, he said that he believes in the vitality of the republic's future first professional parliament. The Supreme Council is elected on a multiparty basis and reflects the attitudes and interests of a most diverse social strata. This is what provides hope that the new parliament will meet the expectations of the republic's multinational population and will become a real and effective representative power. Its professional level, in the vice president's opinion, will be determined not just by the degree of deputies' personal abilities--the old Supreme Soviet also had quite a few competent specialists and scientists. The important part is that now drafting and adopting laws becomes the only business of parliament members. SHYMKENT The elections just held have been dubbed not only the most democratic but also the most difficult. Probably for the first time in several decades, ballots could not be delivered to two election precincts in the southern part of Kazakhstan--the Ugam animal husbandry distant pastures in Kazgurtskiy Rayon, where 47 voters live, and the Taykanu precinct in Suzakskiy Rayon, with its 380 voters. Because of weather conditions, a military armored vehicle and an all-terrain vehicle were dispatched to deliver ballots to Taykanu. Another spell of raging elements kept even them from arriving at the election precinct in time. Moreover, until the last moment there was no information on the whereabouts of the crews. All other election precincts opened on time on 7 March. In oblast rayons voters quite actively and, by old habit, early in the morning went to fulfill their civic duty. The election headquarters, set up under the oblast administration, where all information flowed, by lunchtime breathed a sigh of relief: The voter turnout would be sufficient. As British observer Steve Lane noted, in Sayrama he saw early in the morning voter activism, enthusiasm, and lines to voting booths. Shymkent's election precincts did not begin to buzz with life until 1000-1100. At that time, one could see sizable lines for the ballots and to the voting booths. There were candidates' observers present at practically all election precincts in the oblast center. Most of them behaved properly, watching the proceedings and not interfering with the process of voting. Unfortunately, there were some unpleasant excesses. The authorized representatives of one of the candidates grabbed a stack of ballots and tore them up, and also opened the ballot box on their own. There also have been instances of illegal agitation in front of election precincts. The Procuracy is looking into all this now. Dutch observers did not see the elections in as favorable a light as Mr. Steve Lane did. They saw a violation of the democratic process in the fact that invitations had been delivered to voters' homes. As well as in that 3,000 signatures were required for a candidate's registration rather than only the 10 in their country. The Dutch were also puzzled, to put it mildly, by monotonous propaganda leaflets, which, they said, are boring to read. There were many other comments, which will be discussed. Now the data from rayon elections continues to flow into the oblast electoral commission; they are sorted out and analyzed. It is hard to tell at this point how many candidates from which party or public movement will win parliamentary seats. Overall, in Yuzhnyy Kazakhstan Oblast the voter turnout was 79.8 percent. UST-KAMENOGORSK Literally on the eve on 7 March, in election precinct No. 38, the registration of M. Kozlov, a candidate for Supreme Council deputy, was overturned by a court ruling for violating the Election Code. The ballots with his name were already in the precincts, however. Therefore, the name of the failed candidate had to be struck out as bulletins were issued to voters, which, naturally, caused incomprehension and indignation. Some voters in protest struck out all candidate names on the ballot--both for the Supreme Council and for local bodies of representative power. M. Kozlov probably has himself and his team to blame for what happened. Having made a last-minute mistake, they gave rivals an opening to put them out of the game, which is what the latter did. This is a lesson that in an election campaign one cannot relax till the very end. Nobody can count on greenhouse conditions these days. Those times have gone irretrievably into the past. AKMOLA According to the oblast electoral commission data, 76.1 percent of the residents in the Ishim virgin lands area participated in Supreme Council elections. Overall, elections proceeded calmly, although there have been a few excesses. "Most trouble came from observers," explained R. Koval, chairman of the Akmolinsk Oblast electoral commission. "By decision of the central electoral commission, the deadline for candidates to file an application to field observers was 21 February. They did not do it in time. The deadline was extended to 3 March. And still, many candidates scrambled only on election day." There were a total of 361 observers monitoring elections in Akmolinsk Oblast, including British citizen Mr. Nigel Butler, who has already served as an observer in Romanian, Russian, and African states. Having said that it is against his principles to criticize the electoral system of another state, Nigel Butler nevertheless noted a number of insignificant but violations nevertheless that have been observed in the course of elections. Among them are incidents of some voters casting ballots not just for themselves but also for family members; filling out ballots outside the voting booth; and the shortage of booths. Nor was Nigel Butler satisfied with the quality of work of local observers who, as he put it, mostly just sat at a distance instead of watching the course of elections. KZYL-ORDA The results of elections to the oblast maslikhat were interesting and even unexpected. Of seven SNEK [expansion not given], Kzyl-Orda residents elected six. Four seats in the oblast maslikhat went to representatives of the Azat civic movement, three, to members of the Socialist Party, and one, to the Republican Party. Representatives of the People's Congress of Kazakhstan see their two seats as a defeat. Judging by the results, it looks like Kzyl-Orda residents do not particularly trust parties and movements: 19 mandates went to candidates not affiliated with any parties. This is something for party and movement activists to contemplate.
