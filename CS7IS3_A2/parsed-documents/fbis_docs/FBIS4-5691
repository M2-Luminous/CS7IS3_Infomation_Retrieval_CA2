FBIS4-5691 "dreas071_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 North Korea N-S Envoy Exchange, Inspections Separate Issues N-S Envoy Exchange, Inspections Separate Issues OW1304062594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0607 GMT 13 Apr 94 OW1304062594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] New York, April 12 KYODO -- The issue of an exchange of special envoys between North and South Korea should be separated from the nuclear issue in North Korea's talks with the United States, a Pyongyang official said Tuesday. North Korea is "strongly opposed" to making the exchange of envoys a topic in talks with the U.S., he said. The question of separation of the two issues of inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities and the exchange of envoys is likely to be a main topic during visits to South Korea, China and Japan by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political and Military Affairs Robert Gallucci from Tuesday. The official described as "incorrect" reports that North Korea notified the U.S. at the end of March that it would permit further inspections of its nuclear facilities if the issue of the special envoys is treated separately. He denied that separating the issues is enough to guarantee that North Korea will permit continued inspections. The official said Gallucci's three-nation visit is an attempt to involve Japan and South Korea in what should be a matter for negotiation only between North Korea and the U.S. The U.S. and South Korea have set the exchange of envoys aimed at laying the basis for a North-South summit, and the international inspections, as preconditions for North Korea-U.S. high level talks. But North Korea maintains that the U.S. insisted on the conditions under pressure from South Korea. Washington has spearheaded an international campaign to persuade Pyongyang to accept full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure that its nuclear program is not being used to manufacture an atomic weapons arsenal. Pyongyang has denied allegations it is seeking to build an atomic bomb, but it refused to permit IAEA inspectors in March to carry out certain tests at a radio chemical laboratory. Two rounds of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang last summer yielded an agreement for the inspections that were held last month. The IAEA, however, was prevented from completing the inspections and referred the matter to the UN Security Council, which issued a presidential statement on March 31 urging Pyongyang to permit completion of the checks.
