Has this issue been settled? ['Abd-al-Ghani] There are two choices -- to hold the meeting either in Yemen or Amman. In all cases, we consider the accord document a great achievement, and we insist on signing it, and are ready to sign it. I would like to point out here that the subcommittee has been meeting for some time. It is now planning to discuss the security issue after reaching agreement on the venue. When we talk about the security issue, we mean those measures preceding the signing process, as well as the necessary measures to implement this document after it is signed. These measures include restoring cohesion to the Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and all the other state institutions. [Al-Qallab] We have learned that the committee has set 6 February as a date for signing the document? ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, around this date. If the meeting is to be held in Amman, then the date will be agreed upon in the light of His Majesty King Husayn's schedule and his return from his trip abroad, and also in the light of the time the Jordanian authorities need to arrange for such a meeting. [Al-Qallab] This means that the president and vice president have accepted in principle the invitation that was extended to them by His Majesty King Husayn's adviser? ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, we have accepted the invitation with gratitude and appreciation. [passage omitted] [Al-Qallab] Egypt has more than once complained that Yemen has turned into a base for the elements and sides which work against it. Is there any coordination between you and Egypt on these issues? ['Abd-al-Ghani] We denounce all actions aimed against the security of the brothers in Egypt and elsewhere. We contacted the Egyptian brothers and told them that we are fully ready to cooperate with them to check any action meant to harm fraternal Egypt. We are against terrorism and we denounce it in part and parcel anywhere in the world. [Al-Qallab] Have you arrested any non-Yemeni elements? ['Abd-al-Ghani] We have arrested a number of Arabs who fought in Afghanistan. We have the full list of the names of members of this organization inside and outside Yemen. [passage omitted]
