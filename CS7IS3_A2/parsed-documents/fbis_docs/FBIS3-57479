In view of Moscow's clear conservative turn in recent weeks, the departure from the cabinet of key figures committed to reforms, and Viktor Chernomyrdin's statements leaving no doubt of his intention to halt the country's movement toward a market economy, Tokyo intends as a matter of the greatest urgency to adjust its policy of providing economic assistance for the Russian reforms. From a formal viewpoint the economic package of $1.82 billion in credits for Russia and insurance for trade operations with Russia which Japan had promised remains on the agenda, but in actual fact even this lifeline is being put on ice, so the same source points out, because the change in the political situation in Moscow and the Chernomyrdin government's sharp turn to the right require a commensurate response. According to the major Japanese newspapers the recent changes in Moscow have unambiguously shifted the Japanese perception of Russia in a negative direction. Fears that the agreements reached during Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October can now be confidently written off are becoming firm convictions. Bilateral relations themselves are being plunged into a new period of uncertainty, the length of which cannot be estimated. Japanese analysts are more and more frequently comparing Yeltsin's Russia with Hindenburg's Germany, and are rebuking the president for appeasement and other sins. But perhaps the most notable feature is that hints are emerging, tentative as yet, about the need to review Russia's relations with the G-7, the Paris Club, and other common Western structures. So, for example, Japanese Foreign Ministry sources are now actively arguing that it is logical to help the reformers, to meet them halfway on the question of deferring payments on Russian liabilities, and to seek other forms of collaboration. But the logic clearly collapses if Moscow intends changing course and putting the brakes on reforms. Moreover, according to TOKYO SHIMBUN, Japan is inclined to put on the agenda of the forthcoming G-7 meeting in Naples the question of reviewing the whole package of Western economic aid for Russia to take account of the changes in Moscow's political reference points. You do not have to be a great prophet to divine that there will be a further sharpening of tone if Chernomyrdin really does resort to reintroducing the antimarket model.
