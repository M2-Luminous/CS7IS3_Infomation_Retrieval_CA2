Using the "Information Super Highway Project," which the United States plans to introduce by 2000, as a model, the group confirmed that it will study the possibility of promoting a similar project aimed at easing regulations and creating new projects in the field of information and telecommunications. In the United States, Vice President Albert Gore has played a major role in promoting the "National Information Infrastructure (NII) Concept" (also known as the Information Super Highway Concept). This is designed to create optical fiber communication networks throughout the nation and link ordinary households to various places -- such as schools, hospitals, and libraries -- and enabling people to exchange data through screens. To popularize this system under the private sector's leadership, the U.S. Government has studied the easing of regulations, give preferential tax treatment, and grant subsidies to promote technological renovation. From the same viewpoint as that of the United States, Japan will promote its own project. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation] have already showed a concept designed to construct optical fiber communication networks by 2010. However, at the 14 May meeting, the working group of the headquarters for promotion of administrative reform clearly launched a plan to study the concept from the viewpoint of easing government regulations. The prime minister gave a speech at this meeting and said: "Deregulation is one of my cabinet's biggest tasks. I would like you to tackle this task to bring about tangible results. Although time for this work is limited, I would like to ask for thorough and in-depth discussions on this matter." In this way, he explained that he expects the working group to present concrete measures to ease regulations in the information and telecommunications sector. The group comprises five ministers, including the prime minister, the international trade and industry minister, and the posts and telecommunications minister, as official members and four experts from the private sector, such as Takeo Shiina, chairman of IBM Japan. The group aims at reviewing the current regulations to help the industrial sectors create new projects in the information and telecommunications sector. This is the administrative reform headquarters' second working group following the first 1 March one on housing and land transactions. The headquarters plans to form another working group for expanding imports, opening up the market, and improving the distribution system late March. By starting these three working groups, the headquarters intends to work out comprehensive measures for deregulation, hopefully by late June.
