Ambassador Rasoul Movahedian, who on Tuesday met Skoda General Director Lubomir Soudek, said he welcomed stronger ties with the Czech heavy engineering company but said the relationship was aimed at peaceful projects only, the agency said. Ambassador Movahedian's meeting with Soudek was confirmed to CTK last night by Skoda's spokesman Jaroslav Hudec. He gave no details of the contents of the meeting, describing it as a courtesy call. In his statement, Movahedian said Iran gives priority to ``friendly and traditional partners'' who offer reliable technical and economic joint projects. ``Iran has really no intention to be engaged in non-peaceful efforts, neither by the Czech side nor by any other international side,'' the agency quoted Movahedian as saying.
