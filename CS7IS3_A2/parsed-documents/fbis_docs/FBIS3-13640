This view is shared by (Umayah) Tahbub, Hebron's former deputy police commander. Our correspondent Moti Amir notes that the two served in the Israel Police in the territories and resigned early in the intifadah, and now guard Faysal al-Husayni. They said that the proposal has not yet reached the PLO leadership in Tunis and that the Palestinians will not agree to deploy the policemen if they remain under Israeli command. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 17 March carries a live telephone interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, a member of the Palestinian advisory council, by Itay Engel and Mikhal Gazit, on the same issue. Abu-Zayyad thinks "the proposal can serve as a basis for trying to reach a wording acceptable to both sides, but to deploy the Palestinian police force which existed prior to the intifadah and say that it means the Palestinians are responsible for their own defense will not work."] Hebron's Jewish settlers are furious about the reports that the government will consider the deployment of Palestinian policemen in Hebron. They said such a move would lead to continued bloodshed in the area. A member of the Mate Binyamin Regional Council told our correspondent Gil Litman that the names of many officers and soldiers in the military reserve are listed in their offices and if Palestinian policemen come to Hebron they will be recruited to defend Hebron against these policemen.
