Vladimir Shumeyko, for whom the chair of Federation Council chairman had already been prepared, failed to get it by one vote, having secured the support of 85 deputies (it is noteworthy that one voting paper was not dropped into the box but was taken away). The previous day Shumeyko had been thought sure to win, since in the secret nomination of candidacies he had collected 78 votes, whereas his closest rival in terms of the number of votes had just 13 (Petr Romanov, general director of Krasnoyarsk's "Yenisey" Chemical Combine Production Association). Meanwhile, Shumeyko had been confidently answering any questions, not being diffident. "My daughter is working in the United States, and my grandson is a U.S. citizen. This is how it has worked out." At the same time another candidate -- Eduard Rossel -- was posing as someone "humiliated and insulted," persecuted by the central power. According to the deputies' reaction, he did not win any sympathy with this. Moreover, the senators categorically disliked the allusion that he made: What has happened to me is just the beginning, and you will see there is worse to come. Rossel did not forget to make digs at Shumeyko, getting at his moves from one branch of power to another. As a result, in the admission of deputies, some of the votes "flowed" from Rossel to Romanov. Nobody doubts that Shumeyko will be elected. But what will such a choice mean? That the majority of the regions (voluntarily or compulsorily) will go along with the president and the government and will support its policy. Deputy Aman Tuleyev believes that in this situation the Federation Council is being turned virtually "into a presidential council." Can they, however, vote differently when 54 percent of the deputies are administration heads, to whom are added people on the president's team and economic planners dependent on the center? According to Aman Tuleyev and Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, there was strong individual pressure [obrabotka] on deputies. Since the budget for 1994 has not yet been adopted, and the majority need subsidies, direct investments, and quotas, it is obvious what the subtext of such talk is. Let us not forget that the administration heads who received deputies' mandates from their voters had, at the same time, been appointed by the president. Boris Yeltsin appointed them and can also remove them: The Bryansk "experience" of former Administration Head Yu. Lodkin will be remembered for a long time. According to Karelian Supreme Soviet Chairman Viktor Stepanov, it is important that the Federation Council does not turn into an ideological department or tool of the president. Not that the threat of this is that great, since, when the talk turns to specific questions -- the budget, for example -- the administration heads might be transformed. The reason? If contradictions arise between the regions and the center, their actual responsibility to their own district could outweigh the pressure from the government. I have ascertained from conversations with administration heads that they also want Shumeyko to be elected because "he is the only person who will be able to control us. If Romanov is elected, the same situation as with the former Supreme Soviet will be repeated." The second round of the secret vote intensified the sensation which had become apparent. Petr Romanov got 79 votes and Vladimir Shumeyko 81 votes. The reason for this was Yu. Chernichenko in the chair and...Shumeyko himself. After the results of the first round of voting were announced, the former attempted to "quash" an additional vote for Vladimir Shumeyko, referring to a telegram received from North Ossetian Supreme Soviet Chairman Askharbek Galazov. The deputies objected categorically. It unexpectedly came to light that the telegram had been sent not to the chairman of the tellers commission but to the president of Russia and directly to Vladimir Shumeyko. Instead of getting up and removing the tension which had arisen in the hall, Vladimir Shumeyko stayed silent and so lost votes.
