National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;195&hyph;000] Take notice that on January 24, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;195&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to continue to operate facilities constructed on an emergency basis to implement an interruptible transportation service for a new shipper, Songer Gas Company (Songer), under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;4&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. National Fuel states that on January 16, 1994, a customer of Songer's notified National Fuel that he and sixteen other customers were out of gas. It was indicated that a phone call to Mr. Ken Songer revealed that he was planning to thaw out his wells but that he could not get his tractor started. It is then indicated that on that same day National Fuel installed a temporary connection to provide service for Songer's customers and subsequently filed a report of emergency transaction with the Commission. National Fuel states that it proposes to continue the operation of the emergency facility beyond the sixty-day period permitted under the emergency regulations. National Fuel estimates total annual deliveries of 500 Mcf. National Fuel indicates that the facility cost approximately $850. National Fuel also states that the proposed delivery point is not prohibited by its existing tariff. National Fuel further states that the addition of the delivery facilities would have a minimal impact on its peak day and annual deliveries. Comment date : March 11, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).

If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
