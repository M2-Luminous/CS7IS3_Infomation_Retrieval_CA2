Ekeus told the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY his talks addressed political and technical points. He called the talks a professional and ongoing exercise. Asked whether the talks sought to work out a timetable for long-term monitoring and the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, Ekeus said the subject was discussed in detail. It is up to the UN Security Council to lift the sanctions, since such a move is a political decision, Ekeus said. Iraqi officials and the Special Commission, he said, are now drafting a joint statement about the result of the latest talks. The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY has learned that subcommittees on both sides began holding closed sessions to prepare the statement. Rolf Ekeus is due to hold a news conference this afternoon at the al-Rashid Hotel where he is staying.
