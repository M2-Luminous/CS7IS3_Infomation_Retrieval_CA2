The interview you gave to last Monday's edition of NARODNA OBRODA seems to have confirmed such rumors. [Moravcik] This is definitely not the case. We have made a decision. The parliament has approved the relevant constitutional law and set the date of the elections and this is binding for us. Therefore, nothing has happened. [Pospisilova] It has been claimed that a pretext for postponing the date of the election from autumn could be the issue of the entry in the identity card testifying to citizenship of the Slovak Republic. The fact is that this entry is posing a problem. Regrettably the relevant authorities have up to now done nothing to resolve the matter. [Moravcik] It is really not true that nothing is being done in this matter. When discussing the bill amending the existing law on elections we also examined that problem. It can be resolved technically. This is matter that the finance minister will have to tackle so that the elections can take place without a hitch. [Pospisilova] Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, said that the National Council was experiencing a deep political and moral crisis and that he was not certain whether it would last until the autumn elections. What do you think? Will it last? [Moravcik] The question is, who was it who caused this deep moral crisis? It would be apt and very useful if former Prime Minister Meciar examined his own conscience. I believe, however, that what happened in connection with the vote of no confidence in Vladimir Meciar resulted in the consolidation of the parliament, making it capable of taking action -- although problems naturally keep cropping up. We have, however, been successful in overcoming these problems and have to do everything possible to ensure that the plan we have set ourselves concerning legislative tasks facing the government is implemented. We must indeed be successful in this endeavor. [Pospisilova] Your government survived the first stern parliamentary test this week. The opposition failed to secure a vote of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. One can, however, hear voices that similar motions of no confidence are being planned for the coming parliamentary meetings. [Moravcik] This method should not become an accepted thing in our parliament. We have to express ourselves very critically on the course of action chosen by the present opposition when, with no justification whatsoever, it proposes such motions. On the one hand we are wasting time, which is very precious. We are wasting resources since deputies, who on the whole are well paid, could do a more useful job and not have to listen to fabricated arguments. [passage omitted] [Pospisilova] You are therefore not afraid of this? [Moravcik] Of course, we have a sufficient amount of self-confidence because we feel that there is nothing that might realistically threaten the government position of any member of the present cabinet. [passage omitted] [Pospisilova] Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmoegnerova and Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus have stressed repeatedly that the abolition of the so-called old clearing account for payments between the Czech and Slovak Republics could not come out of meetings between experts and that a political decision is needed. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has, however, let it be known that in this matter he has nothing to discuss with you. He said moreover that he is not certain whether the Slovak side had a detailed knowledge of the given problem. What will be your answer to him, Mr. Prime Minister? [Moravcik] We have examined the payments agreement between the Czech and Slovak republics, including the problem of the old clearing account. We have also consulted foreign experts. It has been shown that that agreement was a bad one; that it was rather disadvantageous precisely for Slovakia, especially as far as the old account was concerned. Since it is disadvantageous for Slovakia it is on the whole natural that it is in our interest to have it amended. Therefore, from this viewpoint, the situation is on the whole unequivocal. I firmly believe that the representatives of the Czech Republic will be accommodating toward us in this matter. [passage omitted] [Pospisilova] Vaclav Klaus wants to discuss with you the issue concerning the border area at Kasarna. What is the attitude of the Slovak Government in this case? [Moravcik] Unchanged, so far. This means we see no reason why there should be an exchange of territory in that locality.
