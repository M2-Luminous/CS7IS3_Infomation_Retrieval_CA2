FR940826-1-00051 FR940826-1-00008 (3) HCFA determines the payment amount in accordance with the following rules: (i) The amount is prospectively determined, as specified in section 1881(b)(11)(B)(ii) of the Act, reviewed and adjusted by HCFA, if necessary, and paid to hospital-based and independent dialysis facilities and to suppliers of home dialysis equipment and supplies, regardless of the location of the facility, supplier, or patient. (ii) If HCFA determines that an adjustment to the payment amount is necessary, HCFA publishes a Federal Register notice proposing a revision to the EPO payment amount and requesting public comment. (iii) Any increase in this amount for a year does not exceed the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator for gross national product (as published by the Department of Commerce) for the second quarter of the preceding year over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the second preceding year. (iv) The Medicare payment amount is subject to the Part B deductible and coinsurance. (g) In addition to the prospective payment described in this section, HCFA makes an additional payment for certain drugs furnished to ESRD patients by a Medicare-approved ESRD facility. HCFA makes this payment directly to the ESRD facility. The facility must accept the allowance determined by HCFA as payment in full. Payment for these drugs is made as described below: (1) Hospital-based facilities . HCFA makes payment in accordance with the cost reimbursement rules set forth in this part. (2) Independent facilities . HCFA makes payment in accordance with the methodology set forth in §405.517 of this chapter for paying for drugs that are not paid on a cost or prospective payment basis. 7. A new §413.176 is added to read as follows: §413.176 Amount of payments. (a) If the beneficiary has incurred the full deductible applicable under Part B of Medicare before the treatment, the intermediary pays the facility 80 percent of its prospective payment rate. (b) If the beneficiary has not incurred the full deductible applicable under Part B of Medicare before the treatment, the intermediary subtracts the amount applicable to the deductible from the facility's prospective rate and pays the facility 80 percent of the remainder, if any. §413.178 [Redesignated as §413.200] 8. Existing §413.178 is redesignated as §413.200. 9. A new §413.178 is added to read as follows: §413.178 Bad debts. (a) HCFA reimburses each facility its allowable Medicare bad debts, up to the facility's costs as determined under Medicare principles, in a single lump sum payment after the facility's cost reporting period ends. (b) A facility must attempt to collect deductible and coinsurance amounts owed by beneficiaries before requesting payment from HCFA for uncollectible amounts. Section 413.80 specifies the collection efforts facilities must make. (c) A facility must request payment for uncollectible deductible and coinsurance amounts owed by beneficiaries by submitting an itemized list of all specific uncollectible amounts related to covered services. §413.179 [Redesignated as §413.202] 10. Existing §413.179 is redesignated as §413.202. 11. A new §413.180 is added to read as follows: §413.180 Procedures for requesting exceptions to payment rates. (a) All payments for outpatient maintenance dialysis furnished at or by facilities are made on the basis of prospective payment rates. (b) If a facility projects on the basis of prior year cost and utilization trends that it will have an allowable cost per treatment higher than its prospective rate set under this chapter and if these excess costs are attributable to one or more of the factors in §413.182, the facility may request that HCFA approve an exception to that rate and set a higher prospective payment rate. (c) This higher payment rate is subject to the rules governing the amount of payment in §413.176. (d) A facility must request an exception to its payment rate within 180 days of_ (1) The effective date of its new prospective payment rate; (2) The effective date that HCFA opens the exceptions process; or (3) The date on which an extraordinary cost increasing event occurs, as described in §§413.182(c) and 413.188. (e) The facility must demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that the requirements of this section and the criteria in §413.182 are fully met. The burden of proof is on the facility to show that one or more of the criteria are met and that the excessive costs are justifiable under the reasonable cost principles set forth in this part. The burden of proof is not on HCFA to show that the criteria are not met and that the facility's costs are not allowable. (f) If requesting an exception to its payment rate, a facility must submit to HCFA its most recently completed cost report as required under §413.198 and whatever statistics, data, and budgetary projections are determined by HCFA to be needed to adjudicate the exception. HCFA may audit any cost report or other information submitted. The materials submitted to HCFA must_ (1) Separately identify elements of cost contributing to costs per treatment in excess of the facility's payment rate; (2) Show that the facility's costs, including those costs that are not directly attributable to the exception criteria, are allowable and reasonable under the reasonable cost principles set forth in this part; (3) Show that the elements of excessive cost are specifically attributable to one or more conditions specified in §413.182; (4) Specify the amount of additional payment per treatment the facility believes is required for it to recover its justifiable excess costs; and (5) Specify that the facility has compared its most recently completed cost report with prior years. The facility must explain any material cost changes and include the data and explanation with the documentation supporting the exception request.
