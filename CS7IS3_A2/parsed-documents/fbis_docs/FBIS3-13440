CONTENTS: 1. Protest Rallies 2. Demonstrations 3. Call to Jihad 4. Attitudes Toward Israel 5. Government Policy and Establishment Media 6. Church and State 7. Cultural Conflict 8. Regime's Downfall Predicted PROTEST RALLIES AL-SHA'B's 8 March issue continues the paper's broad coverage of domestic reaction to the al-Ibrahimi massacre, devoting pages 2-5 to accounts of demonstrations and rallies protesting the Hebron shooting and citing speeches by Socialist Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri, the party's Secretary General 'Adil Husayn, Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Ahmad al-Malat, and lesser figures, all castigating the government's policies and Israeli and U.S. "hegemony" plans. This issue carries a special banner in the upper left-hand corner reading: "A special edition on the Egyptian people's intifadah." The major headline is: "The Revolution of the Mosques." Several stories and comments deal with the confrontation between police and demonstrators at al-Azhar on 4 March. On page 2 an approximately 3,000-word account of two SLP rallies in al-Fashn and al-Basatin townships reports party leader Ibrahim Shukri's remarks that the Interior Ministry tried to ban student demonstrations at the country's top universities and refused to allow an SLP-organized march from al-Azhar to the mufti's office that would have included major personalities following Friday prayers on 4 March. Shukri says: "Let the Egyptian authorities know that marches were organized in Britain, India, and most of the world's capitals to protest the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The marchers were not harmed but in Egypt they were beaten up in al-Tahrir Square, their wounds bled, and they were suffocated by police tear gas grenades, simply because they dared to show their anger against the criminal Zionist murderers." Shukri criticizes the restrictions on opposition press, police violence, and rigged elections but tells his audience that "the wheel has started to turn and God's victory will come, even after a long night." A 600-word report on page 6 is about a conference held inside al-Azhar Mosque by the leaders of several opposition groups, the SLP, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Nasirists, and the Liberal Party. The meeting was held to coincide with popular demonstrations outside the compound. The conferees urged the PLO to reject surrender and withdraw from the "so-called peace" conferences. They also urged the Egyptian and other Arab governments to release political detainees. DEMONSTRATIONS A 300-word report on page 2 describes the 4 March Friday prayers at al-Istikamah Mosque in al-Jizah Square in Cairo, cites the prayer imam's remarks on Jewish treachery, and slogan shouting by the worshipers. The report says security forces surrounded the area to forestall any planned march on the Israeli Embassy. A report on page 3 describes similar protests following Friday prayers in Alexandria and police measures to prevent demonstrations. A 500-word report on page 3 describes the security forces' confrontation with worshipers who marched out of al-Azhar Mosque after Friday prayers to protest the Hebron shooting. The mosque was surrounded and tear gas was used to disperse the demonstrators. Other accounts of protests against the al-Ibrahimi incident include a clash between police and demonstrators following Friday prayers outside Mustafa Mahmud Mosque in Cairo's al-Muhandisin quarter, marches by factory workers and students in Hulwan, and reports on prayers said for the souls of the victims of the Hebron incident in various parts of the country. The paper carries on page 1 a six-column by 7-inch photograph showing police cars and security personnel against a backdrop of an al-Azhar building. The photo has the following caption: "Al-Azhar Square turns into a battleground." The rest of the page is almost entirely taken up by seven other smaller photographs depicting security measures around al-Azhar and worshipers marching and raising Koran copies in their hands. One picture shows "security forces arresting Labor Party member Muhammad Ibrahim." The only text on the page is part of the chief editor's article. CALL TO JIHAD A 1,500-word account of a professional associations conference in Cairo cites a speech by SLP [referred to here as the Islamic Labor Party] Secretary General 'Adil Husayn who says Ramadan this year has turned into a month of martyrdom in addition to fasting and worship. He appeals to Egyptian police officers not to confront young demonstrators with bullets because he views the Egyptian police as too worthy to be equated with the Israelis. He declares: "We have not met here to weep for there is no time for weeping. Indeed, it is almost a sin to weep. It is the time of anger and preparation for revenge." Speaking at the same conference, Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Ahmad al-Malat chastises the government for doing nothing about the Hebron shooting and asks: "Have they been struck dumb? Has Clinton not given them permission yet?" Al-Malat says: "Young people, you are the remaining hope. You are the resource. Work should begin today, not tomorrow. It is the hope to rescue Palestine... by jihad. Jihad is the only way. Every young man among you must prepare himself for the day when he will answer the call to jihad." ATTITUDES TOWARD ISRAEL On page 5 there is a 2,000-word report on a conference organized by faculty members from various Egyptian universities during which academics expressed solidarity with the Palestinian people, backed the Palestinian demand for the removal of the Israeli settlements, and urged the immediate severance of diplomatic ties with Israel. Mustafa Bakri, in a 700-word article on page 5 carrying the headline "The Volcano of Anger," says the conflict with Israel is one of existence, not a mere border dispute, and the whole of Palestine must be regained. Noting that the regime is incapable of confronting Israel, he says the hope lies with the people, especially the young. Islamic preacher and writer Muhammad al-Ghazali, in his Tuesday column "This Is Our Religion," says the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre comes as no surprise because Jews are brought up in the religious tradition of waging "a war of extermination against their enemies." GOVERNMENT POLICY AND ESTABLISMENT MEDIA Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn in a 1,500-word article on pages 1 and 9 speaks of the eruption of public anger against Israel and the Egyptian Government which cooperates, normalizes ties, and advocates "hot peace" with it. After referring to the protests of 4 March at al-Azhar and the concurrent meeting of opposition leaders there, he contrasts the government's failure to respond to the Hebron massacre with its success at putting down domestic unrest and protests. He declares that no good can come from a government riddled with financial corruption and whose inability to remedy the country's problems is rivalled only by its success in clinging to power against the public wish. He urges all patriotic forces to unite in order to force the government to listen to the opposition's views and calls for pursuing the difficult road of democracy until the time comes when the people can choose their own rulers. A 1,500-word article by Muhammad Hilal on page 4 takes Egyptian television to task for carrying less coverage on the Hebron massacre than Israeli television and continuing to show its quiz shows, boring serials, and "rotten" films. He notes that Egyptian television took care not to cover the 4-March Friday prayers from al-Azhar Mosque because its officials realized it was going to be the scene of protests and instead relayed prayers from another Cairo mosque. SLP deputy leader Muhammad Hilmi Murad, writing about the country's "popular awakening" in an article on page 7, calls on the government to take people's wishes into account and urges opposition parties, professional associations, and labor parties to advocate and defend popular causes. CHURCH AND STATE Muslim Brotherhood columnist Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus addresses his thanks to university students across the country for refuting the initial foreign news agencies' description of the popular Egyptian reaction to the Hebron massacre as "lukewarm and feeble." In his back-page column on page 12, he also refers to the massive protests by professional associations and worshipers and notes that these demonstrations reassured him that Arabhood and Islam still flow in the country's veins. He says: "Frankly, I feared for my country from the advocates of pharaonism and isolation and the haters who demand separation of religion and state." Adding that such people control state media and education, he notes that he had been worrying that they would "brainwash" the people into believing that they were solely Egyptian, unconcerned with events in the Arab and Islamic world. CULTURAL CONFLICT An approximately 3,000-word article on page 12, by Mahjub 'Umar, analyzes the cultural conflict between the Arabs and Israel, which cannot be ended by interim agreements but will continue until the "racist aggressor agrees to restore rights and to live in equality under the aegis of the region's prevailing, Arab-Islamic culture." He says that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was a microcosm of this cultural conflict and that the attacker, Baruch Goldstein, was a product of his culture and cannot be called insane unless all members of his community are called insane too. Noting that Israel itself is the original, large settlement, he foresees the day when the world will accept its disarmament. Muslim Brotherhood official and columnist Mustafa Mashhur refers, in a 1,500-word article on page 7, to the long-standing but unsuccessful attempts by Egypt's enemies to dilute its Islamic character, including attempts by French and British occupiers to introduce foreign laws into the country, by proselytizing, and the propagation of dissolute Western culture. He says that after Hasan al-Banna founded the Muslim Brotherhood in 1928 with the aim of reviving the Muslim state following the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire, there came the secularist onslaught against al-Azhar and against Islamic laws and courts, the shackling of Egypt by the Camp David Accord, and the attempt to forge normal ties between "Egypt's Muslim people and the Zionist enemy who usurps Palestine." He declares that all these attempts have failed and young men and women are embracing religion, filling mosques to capacity, and wearing Islamic attire voluntarily. He adds that their support for the Palestinian cause remains strong. REGIME'S DOWNFALL PREDICTED A 750-word article by Dr. Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad on page 4 accuses the government of idiocy, hatred for the public, and love for Israel and the Kach movement. In the article, entitled "An Eyewitness to the Regime's Crime," the writer views the security forces' use of tear gas against al-Azhar as a sign of the regime's imminent demise.
