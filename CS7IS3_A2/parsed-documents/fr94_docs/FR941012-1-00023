FR941012-1-00023 FR941012-1-00004 In general, the argument presented to the Agency has been, because these expenditures are scheduled to occur in the future (often many years in the future), a financial instrument for less than the aggregate costs (i.e. the ``present value'' of the aggregated costs) would pay off these expenditures in the future. 4 This is the case because there is a time dimension to the value of a monetary or financial instrument_$100 in hand today is worth more than a (guaranteed) promise to pay $100 in ten years. One hundred dollars invested today, for example, in a ten-year Treasury bond paying at an interest rate of 7 percent will pay back $197 ten years from now, assuming that interest is compounded continually. 4 In order to make comparisons between alternative financial instruments on capital investment decisions involving different streams of payments over time, financial analysts, economists, etc., calculate the ``present value'' of the alternatives. This method involves calculating in terms of current dollars using the interest rate_or discount rate_present value of a promised future receipt (or expenditure). For example, at a 7 percent interest rate, an investor would be indifferent between receiving $100 five years from now or receiving $71.30 today. The present value, then of the promise to pay $100 in five years (at a discount rate of 7 percent) would be $71.30. In much the same way, if the Agency allowed owners and operators to discount their future costs when they demonstrated financial responsibility, an owner or operator who had a $10 million closure scheduled to occur 20 years in the future could demonstrate financial responsibility for as little as $2.6 million today, assuming they could invest that amount at the same 7% interest (or discount ) rate described above. The effect of discounting becomes more pronounced as the time period and discount rate increase. The Agency has not proposed to allow owners and operators to discount costs because the Agency remains unconvinced that by doing so it would assure that adequate funds will be available in a timely manner to perform required activities in the event that the owner or operator is unable or unwilling to perform these activities. First, the Agency is concerned that for an approach based on discounting to be effective, it is important that the owner or operator be able to predict with certainty when the costs will incur. For example, an owner or operator who estimates that the closure costs of its MSWLF will be $10 million to occur 20 years in the future would only have to demonstrate financial responsibility for $2.6 million today, assuming a 7 percent discount rate. If that MSWLF unexpectedly has to close, it may not have sufficient resources to properly complete all closure activities since the amount of financial responsibility could be substantially less than the actual need. Despite these concerns, the Agency is interested in allowing owners and operators to discount costs under the subtitle D program wherever it can do so and still assure that sufficient resources will be available to perform required activities. The Agency believes that discounting may be more applicable for some activities than others. For example, where the cost of an activity is known, the timing of the activity can be predicted with a greater degree of certainty, or where the activity takes place over an extended time period, it may be appropriate to discount costs. Although current regulations require owners to have the financial resources to carry out all closure and post-closure activities in one year, some activities, such as post-closure groundwater monitoring, can only be done over several decades. Therefore, even if a landfill must close unexpectedly, certain activities (like post-closure care) and the associated costs will still occur over a number of years in the future. EPA could allow owners to discount these costs in computing their obligations. However, where the timing and costs associated with an activity are not known, discounting may not be appropriate. Because of its interest in allowing owners and operators to discount costs, and because of its concerns about allowing them to do so, the Agency again solicits comment on the practice of discounting, and how it might be applied to the subtitle D program. Members of the public who submitted comments on discounting during the comment period of the local government financial test need not submit those comments again. If the Agency modifies the subtitle D regulations to allow owners and operators to discount costs under that program, the Agency will consider all comments related to discounting that were submitted to the docket for this proposal during the public comment period and to the docket for the local government financial test proposal during the comment period for that rulemaking. The Agency specifically requests comment and supporting information on the following and on any other issues that commenters identify regarding discounting for MSWLF financial responsibility requirements:
