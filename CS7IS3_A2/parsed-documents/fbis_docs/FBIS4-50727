Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Liu Tai-ying, president of the Kuomintang [KMT] Business Management Committee, said Friday [13 May] that KMT-run enterprises will strengthen cooperation with South Korea, Japan, Russia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Liu, a renowned economist, made the statement upon his return from a week-long visit to South Korea and Japan. He said KMT-owned firms have made plans to work together with South Korea's financial sector to open banks and leasing companies in Indonesia in line with the government's "southern strategy," which encourages Taiwan investors to increase investments in Southeast Asia. He said he had visited the Mitsubishi Co. and the Mitsui Co. in Japan to seek bilateral cooperation in shipping, energy, transportation, tourism, and trade. The ruling party is also considering investing in Russia's salmon, cement, and forestry industries, Liu said. Russian made goods could be shipped to Hong Kong for resale to Indonesia and Vietnam, while Taiwan's electronics products and Indonesia's petrochemical goods could be exported to Russia, he elaborated. To help promote the "southern strategy," he said, senior executives of KMT-run enterprises will make a trip to Jakarta and Surabaya in Indonesia next month to talk with their Indonesian counterparts on cooperative ties. Liu said that he will visit Indonesia again in July to make a final decision on the investment plans. He first visited the Southeast Asian country in early April. The KMT-owned companies are also planning to make inspection tours of Myanmar [Burma], North Korea, and Palau this year as part of their efforts to explore new outlets, he added.
