Vasilis Tzovaras has the following report: [Begin Tzovaras recording] The embargo on Skopje will be implemented normally for all Greek products sent to this statelet, while our country will not give its consent to the granting of any Community loan unless Skopje changes its policy. This statement was made today by Commerce and Industry Minister Konstandinos Simitis, who made it clear that the embargo against Skopje would have no repercussions for our country's foreign trade and the smooth channeling of supplies to our market. The Panhellenic Exporters Association agrees with Simitis' assessments while the North Greece Exporters Association expresses the opposite view. As to why the transportation trade and our country's general foreign trade would not be affected by the embargo on Skopje, Simitis said that for about two years now, the passage through Skopje of goods being exported from or imported to Greece has virtually been reduced to nothing because of the situation in the former Yugoslavia and mainly after the implementation of the UN embargo on particular statelets of the former Yugoslavia. The transport of goods is being carried out primarily through Italy or Bulgaria and with preference given to Italy after recent developments in mixed transportation. Our country's foreign trade with the statelet of Skopje is slight: In 1992, goods worth $9 million were imported and items worth $16 million were exported. During the first 10 months of 1993, the imports from Skopje were $12 million and the exports $108 million. This big variation in exports is due to the supply of large quantities of oil from Greece to Skopje last year. Skopje recently bought large quantities of fuel, much more than it could consume, Simitis confirmed, and probably built up some reserves, possibly disposing of the surplus in favor of third parties, that is, reselling it.

The loading of fuel [words indistinct] for Skopje has already stopped, while no foreign freighter appeared outside the Kalokhori installations to load fuel. According to Thessaloniki Port Authority records, 3,000 tons of crude oil were leaving the port daily for Skopje while 1 million tons of dry cargo was loaded and unloaded at its installations for Skopje or was coming from this statelet for export. Skopje's products were in transit at Thessaloniki port. The dry cargo was stored in warehouses and the liquid fuel unloaded from tankers was stored in private companies' tanks due to leave for the statelet by rail. The oil and its products, which until yesterday were transported from Thessaloniki port by tanker or other means, were the lever of power for this statelet's industry and communications and its heating requirements. The administrative council of the Thessaloniki Chamber of Commerce and Industry passed a resolution assessing that the measures the Greek Government announced concerning the Skopje issue--the suspension of the operation of our country's consulate in Skopje and a ban on the use of Thessaloniki port for freight to and from Skopje--is a necessary consequence of the premature recognition of this republic. The resolution of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry stresses: We believe the Greek Government could have made no other decision while [words indistinct] the process of recognition was cultivating Skopje's intransigence.
