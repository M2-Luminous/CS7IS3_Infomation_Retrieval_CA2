Because even some coalition deputies were not present in parliament, the legislative body did not have a quorum. Ludovit Cernak (National Democratic Party-New Alternative), who chaired the session, therefore declared yesterday's third day of the 30th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic closed at noon, shortly after 1200. At the outset of yesterday's session, before 0930, the deputies started discussing the government-sponsored draft law on environmental impact assessment, which has been in preparation for over two years. In putting forward the bill, Minister of Environment Juraj Hrasko stressed that it is fully compatible with comparable legislation in member countries of the European Union and other economically advanced countries of the world. [passage omitted] Parliament approved the bill with the proviso that it will go into effect on 1 July 1994. [passage omitted] The National Council then approved, for the second time, the amendment to the law on arbitration proceedings in international trade relations and the execution of arbitration decisions, which had been returned to parliament by the president. The amendment, which will go into effect on 1 June 1994, changes the name of the law and extends its applicability to domestic trade, as well. The deputies then elected Frantisek Javorsky (Christian Democratic Movement) as member of the special parliamentary body for supervising the activity of the Slovak Information Service. (He replaces Ladislav Pittner, who has become the minister of the interior.) Parliament also acknowledged the resignation of Peter Papan from the Slovak Television Council. A secret vote was held, in which parliament was to elect three new members of the Slovak Television Council to replace members who resigned. The vote was invalid, however, because only 65 deputies participated in it and not the required 50 percent plus one majority of deputies. [passage omitted] Ludovit Cernak therefore declared the deliberations closed. He also said that parliament did not have a quorum because deputies for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party did not present themselves, even though they were present. The parliament meeting will continue on Wednesday [4 May].
