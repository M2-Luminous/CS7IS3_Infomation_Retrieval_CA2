[passage omitted] Croatian Defense Council [HVO] formations in the Lasva river valley have placed their heavy guns under UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] supervision at the UN base in Bila, in the municipality of Vitez, but HVO military sources said that the same action was not taken by Muslim soldiers. The command of the HVO Vitez operational zone lodged a protest with UNPROFOR because the Muslim side in that area had not placed a single gun under UNPROFOR supervision. [passage omitted] Herceg-Bosna Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic and Chamber of Deputies President Ivan Bender had talks with French Ambassador Henri Jacolin today. In their talks they put forward a demand for Mostar not to be placed under European Union administration but to be included in the Croat Grand County, with a separate Muslim municipality within it. They also put forward a proposal by the Croat side that the Croat Grand County be given a land link with Herzegovina.
