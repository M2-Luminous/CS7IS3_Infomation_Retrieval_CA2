There is no danger of the dinar falling in relation to the German mark, Kontic said, adding that prices did not rise last week. A total price rise of 0.8 percent was recorded between 24 January and 11 June, but that period saw an unacceptable rise in the price of agricultural produce and services, Kontic said, and pointed to the need for a further reduction in prices, especially for certain products. [passage omitted] Despite statistical indicators that there was a fall in production in May, Kontic said that industrial production has seen a 3 percent rise in relation to April, of course, excluding the production of energy, which accounts for one-fifth of production, and which fell in that period.
