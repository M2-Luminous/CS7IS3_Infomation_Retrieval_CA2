In practice, the Clinton Administration's foreign policy has undergone several adjustments. At the start, it was a Tarnoff doctrine. Later, it was an enlargement strategy, and then six strategic priorities. The United States is still exploring how to define its position in the post-Cold War world. In such exploration, an inevitable question is how to adapt America's foreign policy ideas to the reality of the contemporary multipolar and diverse world. In early 1993 when Clinton assumed the presidency, he was confronted with a grim situation both at home and abroad. The post-Cold War world was filled with complex, volatile, and uncertain factors. The Western economy remained in the doldrums on the whole. In the United States, there were innumerable economic and social problems. Quite common among the public was the introversive feeling that "we have only to sweep the snow at our doors and not bother about the frost on others' roofs." As regards the role to be played by the United States in the post-Cold War era, divergent views existed among various circles, and no consensus could be reached. Over the past year, Clinton has firmly taken the reinvigoration of the American economy as the central task. His foreign policy has shown the heritage of the past as well as something new created by himself. The heritage finds expression mainly in his upholding America's leading role in the world, stressing the need to maintain a strong national defense despite the reduction of the armed forces and military spending, giving generous assistance to Russia, and promoting the peace process in the Middle East. The new part of Clinton's foreign policy reflects both the salient features of the post-Cold War era and the characteristic tradition of the Democratic Party. The past year has seen a painstaking course traversed by the Clinton Administration's foreign policy, with achievements as well as faults and setbacks. Accordingly, the policy has been continuously adjusted in the course of practice. I. Five Basic Ideas Characterizing the Clinton Administration's Foreign Policy 1. Ensuring U.S. economic security as a primary pillar of U.S. foreign policy. Clinton and his foreign-policy team have all along taken the reinvigoration of the U.S. economy and the promotion of world economic development as the central goal of the foreign policy. For instance, Clinton's efforts at the July 1993 summit meeting of the G-7 nations in Tokyo brought about an industrial products market access agreement among the U.S. and European countries and Japan. Later, he made all-out efforts to win Congress approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement. In November, he officiated the APEC ministerial conference and held informal meetings with leaders of the APEC members in Seattle. And, finally, he managed to conclude successfully the seven-year-old Uruguay Round of GATT talks before the 15 December 1993 deadline. As U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, Clinton's above-mentioned activities plus his plan to cut the U.S. deficit by $500 billion within five years constitute the "integral elements of the most ambitious international economic agenda that any President has undertaken in almost half a century."[.sup]1[/] In foreign trade, the Clinton Administration stresses a "fair trade" principle in opening overseas markets to boost U.S. exports and increase employment at home. It has taken a firm stand in trade talks and, on many occasions, even resorted to unilateral sanctions, which have led to serious confrontation with its allies, including European countries and Japan. In addition, the Clinton Administration has adopted an export-oriented national strategy of "less aid to foreign countries and more trade development," "linking aid to foreign countries with trade promotion," and "relaxing restrictions on exports of certain high-tech products." As a result, more world markets were opened to American products in 1993 than at any time in the last two generations.[.sup]2[/] 2. An apparent shift of foreign policy priorities to the Asia-Pacific region. In recent years, the trade volume between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region has accounted for 40 percent of America's total foreign trade and exceeded its trade with Western Europe by 50 percent. East Asia contains the most dynamic economies in the world. Historically, the United States fought in three wars in Asia during the last 50 years, while more and more Asian immigrants have served to "enrich America's cultural and economic mosaic."[.sup]3[/] For this reason, Christopher said: "No area of the world will be more important for American interests than the Asia-Pacific region." "It is thus crucial to the President's domestic agenda."[.sup]4[/] Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, also made the remark that "the Clinton Administration has elevated Asia's importance and, in short, Asia is now more important than ever."[.sup]5[/] This is why Clinton's first overseas trip was to Asia and he proposed the establishment of a "New Pacific Community." Christopher made three visits to Asia within one year, and on his visit to ASEAN countries, he clearly expressed the intention to get positively involved in the multilateral Asian security dialogue following the ASEAN ministerial meeting. Taking the opportunity of the APEC conference in Seattle, the United States sponsored informal meetings with the leaders of the countries concerned. The meetings deepened the U.S. cooperative relations with the Asian-Pacific countries and promoted the APEC's development. In addition, the Clinton Administration has maintained the U.S. troops in the Asia-Pacific region at the same 100,000-strong level as in Europe. It is with such a background that the Clinton Administration has "recognized China's obvious importance in bilateral, regional, and global partnership."[.sup]6[/] In September 1993, Clinton himself made a decision to proceed with "all-round contacts," raise the level of dialogues, and develop extensive exchanges with China. In November, a U.S.-China summit took place in Seattle, the first such official meeting since 1989. This meeting helped improve the relations between the two countries. 3. Promotion of Western democracy and human rights worldwide raised to the height of one of the three pillars of U.S. foreign policy. There are several reasons for this: First, stressing the promotion of democracy and human rights is a historical tradition of the Democratic Party. Second, the United States regards its victory in the Cold War as a triumph of its ideology and values. As Clinton once said, "our greatest strength is the power of our ideas."[.sup]7[/] Third, after the Cold War, the United States has no arch enemy and needs to uphold an ideological banner as a major instrument to maintain its rallying force at home and abroad. For these reasons, the Clinton Administration has put forth an "enlargement strategy" to enlarge worldwide "the community of market democracies" as a U.S. global strategy to replace the "containment strategy" of the Cold War era. To carry out its democracy and human rights policy, the Clinton Administration has applied pressure through bilateral and multilateral channels, by means of ideological infiltration through cultural exchanges, and by using assistance and most-favored-nation treatment to foreign countries and the State Department's annual human rights reports. It has even set up so-called "free" radio stations of one kind or another to conduct subversive agitation and propaganda in an effort to unscrupulously intervene in others' internal affairs. 4. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their vehicle missiles viewed as a practical and primary threat to U.S. national security; prevention of arms proliferation put to the fore in the U.S. foreign policy and regarded as "one of the most urgent priorities of the U.S. national commitments."[.sup]8[/] This involves two principal tasks: One is to make every effort to remove the threats from the massive nuclear weapons kept by Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The other is to prevent nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and missiles from proliferating to those Third World countries that the United States believes are the most dangerous. To this end, the United States has used both the carrot and the stick. It has either used the tactics of improving bilateral relations and providing aid or resorted to sanctions as a threat and punishment. The Clinton Administration is trying to consolidate the system of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, conclude a treaty of comprehensive ban to all nuclear testing, and establish a sound "missile technology control mechanism" by 1996. In the eyes of the Clinton Administration, "the most urgent arms-control issue in the 1990's is to fight the long-term threat caused by arms proliferation."[.sup]9[/] 5. The United Nations and other international organizations are utilized to promote so-called multilateralism. The purpose of multilateralism advanced by the United States is to achieve its foreign policy goals while dividing the burden among nations to remedy its own financial and material deficiencies. Also, if action must be taken, the United States will be "in a legal position" to do so, and it will be easy to win support from the American public. In June 1993, Madelenine Albright, chief of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, further stressed that multilateral engagement must be led by the United States and become an "assertive multilateralism"; otherwise, it cannot serve America's goals well and may even damage major U.S. interests.[.sup]10[/] In this regard, the Clinton Administration particularly underscores the important role of the United Nations and, in actual fact, regards it as "a major means of the U.S. foreign policy."[.sup]11[/] Because of this, Christopher visited the UN Headquarters in New York and called on Secretary General Boutros Ghali shortly after he took office. It was also for this reason that the U.S. Mission to the United Nations has been extremely active. In particular, the Clinton Administration attaches importance to the UN peace-keeping function in dealing with regional conflicts. If necessary, Christopher said, the United States will act alone, but if at all possible, it will deal with problems in a multilateral way and prefer to act together with others.[.sup]12[/] This is precisely the policy the United States pursues in dealing with the issues of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti. Under the U.S. powerful impetus, the UN peace-keeping operation has expanded from five missions, less than 10,000 troops and military observers, and a $233 million expenditure in 1987 to 13 missions, 75,000 troops, and an expenditure as high as $3 billion in 1993, resulting in a hard-to-bear burden on the United Nations. Three Adjustments in the Clinton Administration's Diplomatic Practice (1) Appearance of the "Tarnoff Doctrine" The first major test faced by the Clinton Administration with respect to foreign policy was how to deal with the armed clashes among the three factions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the beginning, Clinton took a firm stand and directed the spearhead of pressure at the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serbia Republic. In addition to stepping up economic sanctions, establishing an international court to prosecute "ethnic cleansing" criminals, setting up no-fly zones, and air dropping relief supplies, he made two proposals: lifting the arms embargo on the Muslim force and launching air strikes on Serb positions. But, due to the opposition within the U.S. Government, especially from the military, plus the strong objection by its NATO allies such as Britain and France, the Clinton Administration later took a retreat policy and shelved these two proposals. The U.S. hesitation and vacillation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue induced doubt and perplexity at home and abroad. On May 1993, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff made a candid statement to the press. He stated unequivocally that the Clinton Administration's stand and action on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue were by no means an expedient move, but manifested a new basic policy: Limited by its financial and material resources, the United States must now concentrate its efforts primarily on developing the economy. It can no longer assume a leading role everywhere as in the Cold War era. Instead, the U.S. involvement in regional conflicts must be commensurate with the threat to its interests. With regard to the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, which is primarily a European question, the United States has no intention of acting unilaterally; it is necessary to take concerted action with the European allies playing a main role. This is the "Tarnoff Doctrine" foreign policy later so-called by the U.S. press. Originally, the "Tarnoff Doctrine" represented a selective-engagement and proper-retreat policy that the Clinton Administration tried to implement to cope with the new post-Cold War situation. Yet, because of its improper presentation and the inopportune time (when Clinton had some failings in domestic affairs), this kind of statement just helped intensify the image of weakness of Clinton's leadership, added to the growth of isolationism at home, and produced a harmful effect on America's "leading position" in the world. Under such circumstances, it was immediately denied by the authorities. (2) Presentation of the "enlargement strategy" Since then, the Clinton Administration has not only stressed in words that "the United States must play a leading role in the world; this is the core of Clintonism,"[.sup]13[/] but taken deliberate actions to show America's strong image and active engagement in international affairs. Chief among them are: At the Tokyo summit of the G-7 nations, the United States displayed a leading role in reducing deficits, promoting the Uruguay Round negotiations, and developing the world economy. It promoted and organized the Western action to aid Russia. It launched a sudden raid on the Intelligence Building in Iraq's capital to show its determination and ability to act unilaterally. It decided to send 300 troops to Macedonia to prevent the spread of the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and promised to send as large a peace-keeping force as 25,000 men to the area after the factions involved have reached a peace agreement that they are willing to abide by. In Somalia, it expanded the role of the UN peace-keeping force and the U.S. troops, saying that their mission is not only to provide humanitarian relief but also to build a local police force and restore the country's order. With regard to banning arms proliferation, it took a strong stance and imposed blockades and sanctions against other countries. In the Middle East, its active mediation eased the problems aggravated by the incident of Lebanese violence and sustained the peace talks. And Christopher personally led a U.S. delegation to the UN human rights conference and launched an offensive against some Third World countries on the issue of human rights. These U.S. actions have scored some achievements. The most remarkable one was the signing on 13 September 1993 in Washington of a Declaration of Peace Principles between Palestine and Israel for self-government of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. On the other hand, setbacks were encountered and prices paid. The most prominent was that bloody clashes continued in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, for this, the United States and its European allies criticized each other scathingly. In Somalia, armed clashes intensified between the UN peace-keeping force and the United Somali Congress, leading to casualties of the peace-keeping troops, American servicemen included. This immediately triggered a strong voice at home, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from that country. With this background, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Assistant to the President for National Security Anthony Lake, Chief of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations Madelene Albright, and President Clinton, one after another, made four attention-drawing speeches in late September 1993. Two notable ideas were set forth. One was the "enlargement strategy" expounded by Lake. It consists of four points: 1) consolidating cooperation and unity among those democracies that have instituted the market system as a core force in carrying out this strategy; 2) actively supporting nascent forces that are building market-based democracies--i.e., Russia, central and East European countries, and other CIS states; 3) isolating diplomatically, economically, militarily, and technologically those states hostile to the market and democratic systems and prompting those non-democratic countries that have adopted the market mechanism to advance toward democracy; and 4) providing humanitarian aid to developing countries suffering bitterly from natural disasters or man-made calamities and prompting them to develop markets and democracy.[.sup]14[/] The other idea was prominently reflected in the following passage in Clinton's address to the United Nations General Assembly: "The United Nations simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world's conflicts. If the American people are to say `yes' to UN peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say `no.'"[.sup]15[/] From now on, he said, the United States will ask some rigorous questions before deciding on whether to take part in a peace-keeping operation. Examples of the questions are how much threat is posed to peace, whether the peace-keeping mission has a clear objective, whether an end point can be identified for the mission, and how much the mission will cost. In people's eyes, this is a retreat from the original U.S. miltilateralist stand of vigorously advocating the reliance on UN peace-keeping operations to deal with issues of regional conflicts. The above-mentioned "enlargement strategy" and the selective peace-keeping operations reflect the confusion and self-contradiction of the U.S. foreign policy ideas. On the one hand, it has a great ambitious goal. On the other hand, it feels that it has limited methods and is incapable in practice. As a commentary published in a U.S. newspaper puts it well, "the Clinton Administration's difficulty lies in how to preserve America's traditional leadership while minimizing its international commitments so as to concentrate its efforts on domestic affairs."[.sup]16[/] Shortly after Clinton's above address, the U.S. and UN peace-keeping operation suffered a serious setback in Somalia. In a combat on 3 October, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed, and another several dozens were wounded. The U.S. military personnel sent to Haiti to restore the democratic order were rebuffed and forced to come back before landing. At that time, U.S. public opinion vied to criticize the government. Representative Frank McCloskey of the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote an article openly asking Christopher to resign. Meanwhile, the acute difference between the United States and its European allies in the Uruguay Round negotiations threw their relations to an all-time low. And the U.S. relations with some Third World countries also kept deteriorating. (3) "Six strategic priorities" put forth by Christopher Under these circumstances, the U.S. Government once again reviewed and reexamined its foreign policy. On 4 November when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Christopher delivered another important speech, setting forth "six strategic priorities" for the U.S. foreign policy and the "realistic principles" for dealing with regional conflicts. The contents and order of the six strategic priorities are as follows: 1) ensuring U.S. economic security; 2) supporting the political and economic reforms in Russia and other CIS members; 3) revitalizing NATO to meet the challenges faced by Europe under the new circumstances; 4) enhancing ties and cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region--this includes the "U.S. efforts to work out a comprehensive relationship with China that permits resolution of differences in a broad, strategic context"; 5) advancing on the basis of the breakthroughs made in the Arab-Israel peace process and trying to bring about an overall and lasting peace in the Middle East; and 6) promoting the nuclear nonproliferation principle worldwide and solving other global questions. In dealing with regional conflicts such as those in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.S. general guideline is: The U.S. role and the extent of its involvement will need to be informed by a strict assessment of its own interests and the interests of others. It must examine every case--asking rigorous questions and giving measured answers--to find the course commensurate with U.S. interests. "The United States will not attempt to force a settlement on Bosnia militarily. No imposed settlement would endure," Christopher pointed out unequivocally.[.sup]17[/] It seems that his testimony reflects a relatively pragmatic attitude now taken by the Clinton Administration. In action, this attitude is essentially reflected in two ways: One, the Clinton Administration is more able to face up its mistakes and has made a more appropriate policy adjustment. Two, it pays attention to using dialogues and consultations to reduce naked suppressive action. The Clinton Administration Still Exploring How To Define U.S. Position in the World In a February 1993 article entitled "Clinton and the World," Dr. Henry Kissinger said that Clinton's task is to find a role for the United States to play in a world that it can neither dominate nor simply withdraw from.[.sup]18[/] Generally speaking, the Clinton Administration's diplomatic practice over the past year seemed to "zigzag" on the road to explore how to do this. The "Tarnoff Doctrine" at the inception was a not-so-successful attempt to "retreat" and "shrink." The subsequent "enlargement strategy" was aimed at reestablishing the U.S. dominance in the world as a general guiding principle for the American foreign policy. Yet the ruthless reality gave a lesson to this principle. As Charles Maynes, chief editor of the U.S. quarterly FOREIGN POLICY, commented in an article, "the United States must recognize the ruthless reality that even a superpower will become exhausted in trying to act as a world police." Under the current U.S. situation marked by a strained financial budget and a shrinking military force, the adoption of the "enlargement strategy" "seems to be marching toward shouldering unlimited new responsibilities rather than limiting the U.S. commitments."[.sup]19[/] So the "six strategic priorities" and the realistic principle for dealing with regional conflicts were put forward in an attempt to resume America's relatively pragmatic status in the world. Of course, regardless of the adjustments, the above-mentioned five major foreign policy ideas remain in the Clinton Administration's foreign policy. At this time, it appears that the United States is still in the process of exploring how to define its position in the post-Cold War world. Nonetheless, it should be noted that an inevitable question in this exploration is how to adapt the U.S. foreign policy ideas to the multipolarization trend and diversification reality in the contemporary world. An obstacle to such adaption is the traditional U.S. concept that its foreign policy should serve the American values. As I see it, while United States is fully entitled to believe in and publicize its values, it has no right at all to impose its values on others. Nor does it have any right to press other countries and interfere in their internal affairs in various ways in an attempt to create a global order and peace under the rule of the United States. This is the key reason for the sharpening contradictions between the United States and many Third World countries. It is also a main cause leading to unrest in the world. There is no exaggeration if we attribute such contradictions and unrest to the hegemonism and power politics contained in the U.S. foreign policy. Footnotes 1.
