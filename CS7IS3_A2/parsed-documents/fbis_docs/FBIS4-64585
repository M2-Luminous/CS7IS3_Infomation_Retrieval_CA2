Let Us Begin by Having Faith in It'"] [Text] Whether at the Labor Ministry or the Industry Ministry, in Via Flavia or Via Molise, there seems to be no doubt about the destiny of Vito Gnutti, businessman and founding member of the Northern League: He will be a minister in the Berlusconi "team." Indeed, his name is one of the few that has never been missing from the countless ministerial sweepstakes published by the dailies over the last month. A sure winner, for everyone except himself, an unorthodox conservative who only dropped two names, Keynes and Gramsci, in the course of a 45-minute interview: "I keep hearing this rumor reported in the papers, and I have to thank you, but I can only deny it. I have been told nothing official." [Arcidiacono] Maybe, but as of today, 1 May, no one is better qualified than you to talk about the million jobs we have heard so much about. But, to change the subject, is your preference for the Labor or Industry Ministry? [Gnutti] There you go again. There is a certain difference between the two ministries. However, even if the eventuality arises, I do not believe that I shall be given a choice. You have the wrong person, I am not as important as that. Of course, I am an industrialist, but you must draw your own conclusions. As far as the million jobs are concerned, I have few illusions. I am not naive enough to believe that once the government is formed, a million jobs will pop up out of nowhere on 2 May. I do not believe it, and Berlusconi does not believe it either, but I know that the basic requisite for achieving this target is optimism of the will. If we have that, then I believe that we will achieve the target, not overnight, but by making the right, prudent decisions. Indeed, I believe that we shall need even more jobs: We shall have to compensate for the unemployment rife in some public sectors, unproductive work, false employment. I am convinced that it is possible to do this; what I do not share is the pessimism of those who believe that the unemployed will always be with us. I just believe that it is the prime task of politicians, no matter whether right- or left-wing, to create jobs. [Arcidiacono] So it is by no mere coincidence that Berlusconi has opted to begin his consultations with the two sides of industry (the unions and the employers) rather than with the usual parties. [Gnutti] Unlike you, I do not attach such great significance to this decision. After all, he had to start somewhere. In a way, he is showing that many of the things that have been said about the marketeers, about the conquering, evil Right, can be proved false. What is more important is the sequel to this decision: I hope there will be talks in which listening and discussion will be the order of the day, not interparty compromise, as used to be the case. [Arcidiacono] Nevertheless, once the government has been formed, faith will not be enough. The right recipe, so to speak, will be needed. Have you any "ingredients" to suggest? [Gnutti] First of all, greater mobility, because this is the only thing that creates higher employment. Then temporary work, apprenticeships, part-time work, and fair wages for those accessing the labor market. You see, the Left has always considered that rendering the system more rigid constituted a social advance, but it was wrong, as this only provided guarantees for those who already had jobs, not those who had to acquire one. This is not being progressive, it means conserving the status quo; this is where the Left contradicts itself, and it lost votes on this issue. [Arcidiacono] Just to be clear, will you explain why it would be right to resort to the controversial system of wage zoning in the south.... [Gnutti] We in the League believe that pay should be linked to the cost of living. If the cost of living indexes show that a worker in the south spends less than his counterpart in the north, his earnings must reflect that ratio, in other words they must be lower. It is not a malicious desire to "punish" the people in the south that leads me to say these things, it is a conviction that it can be a helpful solution. The International Monetary Fund, the Bank of Italy, and a CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor] survey agree on the need to do away with this constraint. Federalism could be another instrument, and the true supporters of the south believe in it. And there are many other constraints from which firms should be freed; it is the only way to raise employment, becoming more competitive, reducing taxes on profits so that firms can plow them back, redeploying resources, combating subsidies, and thus reducing the public deficit. It is not true that it cannot be done, it is not true that computers merely eat up jobs. [Arcidiacono] You will encounter obstacles. Which ones do you expect? [Gnutti] We must have faith in our ability to get there. This is no invention of mine, it is the lesson of Keynes, it is Gramsci's optimism of the will, as opposed to the pessimism of intelligence. One obstacle could be preconceived opposition from the Left, but I do not think so. After all, they are working for people's good as well.
