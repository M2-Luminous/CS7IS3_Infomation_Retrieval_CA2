As far as Japan is concerned, it is important that the United States see Japan's position in an economic package to be compiled in June." The source indicated that the framework talks will not be resumed earlier than June, at which time Japan is scheduled to compile a final package of measures to reduce its current account surplus, including market-opening measures through deregulation. In response, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, said at a news conference following a cabinet meeting on the same day: "It is inappropriate to say we have nothing to do. Each ministry and agency is trying to come up with such measures as deregulation. We have a chance to discuss the issue on various occasions. It is important for us to discuss what efforts are now being made." He thus criticized the remarks by the government source.
