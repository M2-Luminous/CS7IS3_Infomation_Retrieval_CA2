Satarov; place and date not given: "Kremlin Hopes for Success of Peace Agreement. Immoderate Opposition Continues To Gamble on Confrontation"] [Text] The Agreement on Civil Peace in Russia is expected to be signed on 28 April. By then, in addition to "Russia's Choice" representatives, all leaders of State Duma factions will have been to the Kremlin. The president's next consultation will be with representatives of parties of a centrist persuasion. B. Yeltsin will then hold a second meeting of the working group, which will determine the procedure for signing this document and the mechanism for implementing it. In addition, he is also expected to meet with heads of administration and the leaders of the Russian republics, who will evidently also participate in signing the agreement at the second stage (it is envisaged that at the first stage the document will be signed by the approximately 25 main political forces in Russia). Since the text of the document is still being kept secret, numerous questions arise. Including: Can it be acceptable to political forces with diametrically opposed ideologies? And the recent report, citing I. Rybkin, that the State Duma will not examine the proposed version of the agreement pending the preparation of a new one has caused confusion and a wave of speculation. It was immediately interpreted as a rejection by the State Duma of the ideas and provisions embedded in the document. This report drove presidential aide G. Satarov to telephone I. Rybkin. His answer was unexpected: "It's a fake. I said nothing of the kind," I. Rybkin stated. I assumed that I would hear from G. Satarov about clashes in the course of the work on the document, but the president's aide was upbeat. He has already consulted with many factions in parliament -- both those of a democratic persuasion and those on the opposite flank. As yet he has not had occasion to hear any terms or ultimatums expressed. Such a constructive approach by parliamentarians, including from the opposition camp, who only recently were stirring up society with their decision to amnesty the participants in the October putsch, puts you on your guard. But the explanation for this phenomenon in the presidential entourage is as follows: The opposition sees the agreement as a guarantee of the stability which it needs to implement its long-term plans -- to attempt to come to power in the 1996 elections in a calm atmosphere by constitutional means. But it is obvious that the immoderate opposition is continuing to gamble on confrontation. This is confirmed by A. Rutskoy's PRAVDA interview. "What accord? And with whom.... These games involving consensuses and agreements must be stopped...." "What is the current state of readiness of the Agreement on Civil Peace?" I asked G. Satarov. [Satarov] I sent the latest version to the State Duma 4 April. It has already been distributed to committees for study and further work. It has proved possible to work out a scheme which promises to make the document viable. I am talking about a permanently operating mechanism for building accord. Such accord is only possible when specific problems in public life are singled out. In this connection the document provides for the creation of a conciliation commission, which is called upon to keep the situation in the country under review. If conflicts emerge "roundtables" will be held to conduct a collective analysis, and ways to solve the problems which arise will be sought by a working group involving all interested parties. Disputes and conflicts on the path toward seeking accord could arise if someone attempts to "reconcile" various ideologies in this document or to incorporate elements of party programs in it. To date not one of the parties represented in parliament has opposed the inclusion of measures of prohibition in the agreement. And they are indeed present; in particular, there is a provision for prohibiting political parties, movements, and commercial structures from creating any kind of armed formations and for the renunciation of illegal attempts to involve the power structures in supporting political objectives.
