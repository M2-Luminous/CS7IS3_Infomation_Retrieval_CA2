This wish of both sides was expressed by Azerbaijan's president, Heydar Aliyev, at a meeting held with elders from the neighboring Dagestan Republic who were in Azerbaijan on a trip. The head of Azerbaijan's state, expressing our republic's position to the Dagestani guests, said that the border between us has a conditional character. For centuries representatives of the Azeris, Avars, Sakhurs, Kumyks, Dargins and other ethnic groups have lived in solidarity and mingled. Azerbaijan's president, while noting that the uniting of national minorities in various societies, including ethnic organizations, was worthy, also noted that common human values must unite all men, no matter what their identity. They have opted to live in our republic, and each of them are Azerbaijanians. As the rights and responsibilities of all of us are one, we must also correctly understand our duties. Seid Gurbanov, head of the executive government of Derbend Rayon and spokesman for Dagestan's elders, in discussing the goal of the talks, said that they were of a mind to confirm the good ties between the states and make some proposals about aiding the refugees, which are a common problem. Abbas Abbasov, republic deputy prime minister, took part in the reception.
