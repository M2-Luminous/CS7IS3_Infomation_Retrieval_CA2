Provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang delivered at the conference an important speech in which he stated: As we are to make a bigger stride forward in respect of reform in 1994, Gansu is expected to confront a rigorous challenge in building a market economy. In view of this situation, party committees at all levels in Gansu should make a correct analysis and acquire a clear understanding of the province's rural situation, unswervingly give top priority to agriculture in the province's overall economic work, mobilize and protect the enthusiasm of peasants, push ahead with in- depth rural reform, implement rural policies to the letter, be good at guiding and developing specialized rural commodity production, build a sound market system and a new economic structure characterized by a big circulation and a big market, and create favorable conditions under which peasants and enterprises will be able to comprehensively enter the market. Comrade Yan Haiwang emphatically called in his speech for more energy to be devoted to increasing peasants' income, formulating measures suited to actual rural conditions, readjusting rural industrial structure, and expediting the pace of eradicating poverty, achieving prosperity, and bringing about a comparatively well-off livelihood. While readjusting the rural industrial structure, Yan Haiwang said, it is imperative to make continued and persistent efforts to stabilize and develop grain production and increase peasants' income. Yan Haiwang maintained: It is imperative to go all out to develop products and industries with higher extra value, higher commodity rates, and higher foreign exchange earning rates and to implement a joint-stock cooperative system to improve the quality and vitality of township and town enterprises. In a word, we should strive to transform a rural economy into a market economy in an orderly way by carrying out effective macroeconomic regulation and control, enforcing laws and regulations aimed at protecting agriculture and peasants' interests, and comprehensively applying all sorts of economic measures and necessary administrative measures.
