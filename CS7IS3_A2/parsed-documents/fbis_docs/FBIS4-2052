Following the enlarged session of the municipal party committee, people throughout the municipality have conscientiously studied and thoroughly implemented its guidelines, taken quick actions, exerted earnest efforts, and created a good momentum. A good beginning has been achieved in the work of all fields. I will now speak on 10 opinions on economic work. 1. Seize Favorable Opportunities To Further Accelerate Development The 1990's constitutes a very important historical period for Tianjin's economic and social development. Seizing the opportunity to accelerate development is our task of prime importance and also the common desire of the people across the municipality. Based on the general demand put forward at last year's municipal party congress and people's congress and to meet the needs of the development of the situation, we have put forward clear targets to quadruple Tianjin's GNP three years ahead of schedule in 1997; to complete the renovation of dilapidated houses in large areas of the city proper in five to seven years; to transplant, adjust, and technically transform all the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the municipality in about eight years; and to generally complete the construction of the new coastal area in about 10 years. Having attained these targets, Tianjin will regain the magnificence of a large commercial port, create new advantages in the modern economy, and gradually become a large international city. An arduous, yet great cause, this period is important for Tianjin's development. We must bravely shoulder tasks that are heavier than anytime before. To attain these targets, we should earnestly summarize the experiences gained from the many years of economic development and make innovations. The general road for development is to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and, paying attention to the economy's new growth points to accelerate development there while paying attention to the renovation of the older city proper and its older enterprises by accelerating adjustment and invigoration of existing areas and enterprises. The older city proper should support new areas, and the new areas should lead the older city proper. They should develop together and promote each other so that a new situation can be created in which Tianjin is opened wider to the outside world, provides better service to the country, and achieves great development in service and the process of opening up. To attain these targets, we must make every year and every step successful, effect new changes every year, and effect a large change every five years. A review of last year's work showed that we made important steps in accelerating development and achieved new changes in the work in all fields. Our GNP grew by 11.8 percent, industrial output value 24.5 percent, fixed asset investment 32.4 percent, contracted amount of foreign capital 84.9 percent, and revenues 21.8 percent, all of which are the best records for the past few years. Agricultural production increased steadily, commodity distribution was expanded, markets thrived, and urban construction, science and technology, education, culture, public health, and other undertakings made new headway. The 20 tasks to benefit urban and rural people were fulfilled on schedule, and people's living standards were improved. We continued to maintain an excellent situation of political and social stability. All this resulted from the unified and indomitable efforts of the people throughout the municipality which has laid a good foundation for success in this year's work. The year 1994 is critical to the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, to making even greater breakthroughs in reform and opening up, and to effecting even quicker progress in the economy. Therefore, it is of extremely great significance to do this year's work well. We should deepen the reform, expand the opening up, enhance morale, and go all out to do our work in line with the work principle and general demand defined by the municipal party committee. All localities, all departments, and all professions and trades should foster a high degree of urgency and responsibility, start from a high level, stress high efficiency, high quality, and good economic returns, and achieve better major economic targets than last year. Continued efforts should be made to maintain sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy. Major goals of the municipal economic work are: to effect a 12-percent increase in the GNP; to top $5 billion in the total value of contracted foreign investment directly utilized by the municipality, with investment made by foreign traders reaching $3.5 billion; to effect $2.3 million in foreign export trade volume; to complete 3.6 million square meters of housing; to effect obvious improvement in economic returns; and to further improve the income level of urban and rural residents. The tasks we face are arduous, but, when viewed from the general situation, there are also many favorable conditions. Thus, it is entirely possible for us to realize these tasks through hard work. As far as reform is concerned, the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee will certainly be carried out in an all-round way, and the establishment of the socialist market economic structure will certainly develop in depth. Now, the new round of reform has already begun, a series of major reform measures of the state have been put forth, and macro-economic environment will become even more stable and better. As far as opening up is concerned, international capital finds favor China, and Tianjin has become a popular area for foreign investment, resulting in an upsurge in our utilization of foreign capital. Regarding the condition for development, the international market's capacity has expanded, the demands on domestic markets are brisk, and the adaptability of enterprises to market demands has been strengthened further. Meanwhile, the scale of investment and credit funds have improved over last year. Some key projects related to the development of strength and momentum in Tianjin have already been built, some of which have already witnessed results and manifested great potential for development. Some old enterprises have transformed mechanisms, undergone renovation, and thus become more vigorous and active. Tianjin has taken the lead in carrying out the tax assignment system and the system of separating tax payment from profit retention, thus gaining an initiative. The mental outlook of leading cadres at all levels is undergoing profound changes, and the broad masses of the people in the municipality are trying to make changes and rapid progress. The work in the past several years has laid a good foundation for future development. Central leading comrades and responsible comrades of relative state ministries and commissions have come to Tianjin to learn about the situation and give guidance to our work, thus giving us great support and help. We must have a full understanding of this new situation in reform, opening up, and development. Of course, while viewing these favorable conditions, we should also catch sight of the problems and difficulties emerging in our way of advance, catch sight of all sorts of factors that restrict our development, and catch sight of the shortcomings and the deficiencies in our work. We should clearly notice that both favorable and unfavorable factors are in a dynamic state and that one can be transformed by the other. While favorable conditions can be obtained and created through our energetic endeavors; unfavorable conditions can also be transformed and overcome through our energetic endeavor. Under the same conditions and problems, whether Tianjin can create a new situation and effect even more rapid progress depends chiefly on our mental outlook, our morale, our determination, and our work level. On the whole, we are now in an excellent opportunity of large-scale development, and favorable conditions are a main trend. Such a good opportunity is not frequent for Tianjin, and thus it is very valuable. The opportunity cannot be missed, and the opportunity will not await us. We must seize the opportunity to accelerate development. 2. Build a New Coastal Area and Quicken the Pace of Building It Into the Largest Economic Growth Point of the Municipality. To quicken the development of Tianjin and to create new economic development advantages, we must cultivate large economic growth points. Occupying a forward position in opening the municipality to the outside world, this coastal area has more advantages and potentials for accelerating the pace of development than any other places in the municipality. With the efforts made by the previous municipal party committees and governments, the thinking of accelerating the construction of the new coastal area has basically been ripe. The general project is as follows: Build a high-degree, open-type modernized new economic area with Tianjin Harbor, development zones, and bonded area as its framework and metallurgical and chemical industries as its foundation; where commerce and trade, banking industry, and tourist trade vie with one another for development; with new rising industries and export-oriented enterprises as its mainstay; with complete sets of infrastructural facilities and service functions; and catering to the needs of the 21st century. Based on this, Tianjin will be able to further develop itself into a free port. Through the development and construction in the next 10 years, the new coastal area's GNP and foreign exchange earnings from exports will account for more than 40 percent of the municipality's total. The development and construction of the new coastal area should be regarded as a key economic work priority of the municipality. We should work out a unified plan and implement the plan in a step-by-step manner. We should mobilize the enthusiasm of all fronts, concentrate energy, accelerate the construction, and build the new coastal area into one whose economic growth rate is faster than any other places in the municipality as well as the largest economic growth point of the municipality. First, we should exert efforts to accelerate the port construction. Port is the largest advantage of Tianjin. Cities rejuvenate themselves in reliance on ports and ports become flourishing in reliance on cities. Therefore, the construction of ports should be regarded as the most important task. In line with the principle of increasing the total capacity and having full functions, we should accelerate the pace of construction and strive to build Tianjin harbor into an international large harbor with an annual loading and unloading capacity of more than 100 million tonnes at the beginning of the next century. We should open various channels to attract capital, use both domestic and foreign capital, and develop both cooperatively- and independently-funded enterprises. Anyone who wants to make investment is welcomed. Second, we should further bring into play the functions of the development zone and the bonded area. The development zone and the bonded area are the banners in opening Tianjin to the outside world. Thus, the development zone and the bonded area should exert greater efforts to continuously maintain their leading role in the whole country and play an experimental, guiding, and serving role for the new coastal area and even the municipality as a whole. The development zone should accelerate the development of land on a large scale, its development on a snowballing basis, the development of inter-regional circulation of capital; and develop itself into a large-scale, high-level, technologically advanced export processing zone and a financial, commercial, and trade zone. It should develop 25 square kilometers by 1997 and 33 square kilometers by the end of this century. The bonded area should firmly attend to the construction of the second-phase project and try every possible means to set up a system of making storage, transportation, and processing a coordinate process. We should draw on the methods of the international free trade areas, expand the circulation of goods and materials, develop entrepot trade, and build itself into the largest international trade window in north China. Third, we should build a heavy chemical industrial area. Key maritime chemical industrial and petrochemical industrial enterprises are concentrated in the new coastal area. A modern metallurgical industrial foundation with seamless steel tube as a symbol has been laid. There are also several on-going projects and several projects whose construction has been prepared, including a 140,000-tonne ethylene project, a 200,000-tonne polyester project, and a 5 million-tonne oil refining project. So, a new-typed heavy chemical industry zone has preliminarily taken shape and shown a vast prospects for development. This is a key investment area. From now on, new large-sized industrial projects should be developed in this area in principle. It is necessary to accelerate the construction of the projects that have started construction and firmly attend to the pre-phase preparatory work for the projects whose construction has been defined. The old enterprises in urban districts can be moved to this area when conditions permit. The enterprises in the new coastal area should accelerate the transformation of managerial mechanisms, set up completely new enterprise systems, and create new modernized industrial advantages. Fourth, we should speed up construction of infrastructural facilities. To start up the new coastal area early, we should make a breakthrough in infrastructural construction. Urban construction departments should improve the plan, make arrangements, and put forward a clear demand on progress. This year, we should make the best of the funds from various sources and increase investment to complete the construction of the overpass on the Xinhua Road in Tanggu District, start construction of the Gangtang Road and Shanguang Road, speed up construction of the Nanjiang Bridge, and complete, as soon as possible, the heat and power plant and water plant in the development zone and the project to divert Luan He water to Hangu District. We should make active efforts to use foreign capital to build the expressway from the city proper to the new coastal region. Speeding up construction of the new coastal area is a major task in Tianjin's economic work. All fields should take the overall situation into consideration, make concerted efforts, devote energy, and make contributions to construction. Tanggu, Hangu, Dagang, Dongli, and Jinnan Districts should do their work well to meet the needs in the construction of the new coastal area, compete with and promote each other, and accelerate development. 3. Deepen Reform and Invigorate Existing Enterprises To accelerate development, we should also make more efforts to invigorate existing enterprises. If existing enterprises are not invigorated, it will be very difficult to develop new ones. We may say that invigorating existing enterprises, especially state-owned, large and medium-sized ones, is the foundation for future development. After over four decades of construction, Tianjin has accumulated a considerable amount of property and technology and possesses a number of backbone enterprises and highly competitive products. A valuable source of wealth, their potential should be fully tapped in every way. We should invigorate existing enterprises by accelerating reform. Through the means of reform, adjustment, and reorganization, we should adopt different measures according to differing conditions and keep some while abandoning others to suit the remedy for each case. Large and medium-sized enterprises whose conditions permit should actively experiment with reform in the modern enterprise system and turn themselves into limited liability companies or limited liability stock companies. Small enterprises should make great efforts to adopt the cooperative shareholding system or the leasing and contract methods to become enterprises "run by the people without changing their state-owned status." Enterprises which have achieved notable efficiency and large shares of the market and have bright prospects for development should be encouraged to expand their scale and upgrade their levels and, by merging and cooperating, expand their strength and develop enterprise groups linked mainly by property rights. Enterprises with poor efficiency may be divided into several smaller ones and improved with measures that match their actual conditions so that they can be invigorated. In short, all enterprises should adopt reform measures that match their actual conditions and take actions as soon as possible. Enterprises should make earnest efforts in reform, take the initiative in finding ways, and try to liberate themselves through their own efforts instead of relying on assistance and relief. We should invigorate existing enterprises through technical transformation carried out with foreign funds and technology. The experience of a number of enterprises, such as Otis Elevator, Honda Motorcycle, Tianyang Washing Machine, and Jinmeile Beverage, proved that technical transformation with foreign funds and technology is an important way to invigorate existing enterprises. Therefore, we should have greater courage and greater determination to promote this work. Not only small enterprises but large ones, not only one enterprise but a whole trade, and not only enterprises in a slump but also ones that are doing well may conduct technical transformation with foreign funds and technology as long as foreign firms are willing. This year, Tianjin should select a group of large enterprises for contacts with foreign firms and they should achieve great progress in technical transformation with foreign funds and technology. We should invigorate existing enterprises by encouraging them to do business with various industries and various trades and professions. Development of the market economy requires that enterprises break the mode of developing only one plant or one product and that they conduct unitary management, adapt themselves to market changes on their own initiative, accelerate structural readjustment, and do business with various industries and various trades and professions in a timely manner. This has become the law of economic development. Therefore, it is necessary to do business this way. It is not an expedient measure. We should be determined to do it in a big way, gather momentum, select a number of enterprises that were running in the red for a long time in downtown areas, particularly in the golden areas, to practice this and make big strides in this aspect. All enterprises that need to do business with various industries must take action quickly, because they will gain initiative in this regard if they start this work early and will be in a passive situation if they carry out this work late. They must change their ideas, never put on airs, suit measures to local conditions, each display their own strong points, and seek development by doing business with various industrial sectors. We should create necessary external conditions for invigorating the existing economic units. Invigorating economic units is not a matter of enterprises only, it is also an unshirkable duty of all departments. We must give enterprises a free hand, decontrol their management, and delegate powers to them. Powers which have been defined to be delegated to enterprises must be put in place, and more powers should be delegated to the lower levels according to needs and possibility. It is necessary to boldly allow enterprises to manage things which they can manage well. The higher level pertinent departments and functional departments should actively support enterprises conduct readjustment, reorganization, grafting, and development of various industries, and should not interfere with or restrict their work. With regard to enterprises which the municipality authorities do not want to manage but the district authorities are willing to accept, we should place them under the management of district authorities. 4. We Should Expand the Use of Foreign Capital and Open the Municipality to All Directions, at Home and Abroad Being an open coastal city with development of export-oriented economy as the mainstay, Tianjin should strive to do a good job in opening itself at home and abroad and give rise to a situation of opening up to all directions, various spheres, and higher levels. First, we should further expand the scope of using foreign capital. To accelerate development, it is necessary to increase investments. Judging from the possibility of raising funds, using foreign capital is a very practical and convenient and rapid way of getting money. Introducing foreign capital will bring in not only funds but also advanced technology and management. In order to develop the new coastal area, accelerate the pace of enterprise grafting and transformation, fulfill the target of renovating dangerous and shoddy houses, and conduct infrastructure facilities, Following the path of expanding the degree of opening to the outside world and using foreign capital, Tianjin must take quick action in using foreign capital. If we do a good job in using foreign capital, we will be able to accelerate the realization of our defined goal, if not, accelerated development will be empty talk. The higher and lower levels across the municipality should make due contributions to this major matter of extreme importance and urgency. We should proceed from the overall situation, mobilize all sectors, take coordinated action, and form a joint force to speed up introduction of foreign capital and use them practically and wisely. We should regard introduction of more foreign funds and good efficiency as the standards for testing this work. This year, the trend of using foreign capital is very good, the prelude has been played, and the climate is being formed. This trend has appeared more quickly than expected. We should take advantage of this trend to advance, carry out this work comprehensively, and make breakthroughs in some major aspects. In addition to achieving major progress in the direct use of foreign capital, we should also actively open up the channel of effectively using inter-government loans, loans from international banking organs, and buyers' credit. Cooperation can be conducted in all sectors, including the primary, secondary, and tertiary industrial sectors; all large, medium-sized, and small items are welcomed and various cooperative forms may be adopted. We should firmly grasp those large projects which, once imported, will result in the development of a large area. All units should not delay this work. Regarding some major items, we should report the situation of progress to the higher level in a timely manner in an effort to combine the efforts of the higher and the lower levels to make this work a success. Second, we should vigorously improve the intangible environment of investment. Whether we can utilize a large amount of foreign capital depends chiefly on our investment environment, the intangible environment in particular. To improve the intangible environment for investment, we should always proceed from ourselves. We should create an environment in which foreign traders have profits to net and have money to make. We should be good at doing accounts and lay emphasis on long-term benefits. We should persist in the service forms of "one continuous line" and "one station," characterized by quick tempo and high efficiency. Proceeding from expediting the completion of our projects, we should revise and prefect our policies in a timely manner. By improving the intangible environment, we should be able to attract and retain more foreign capital, utilize foreign capital more quickly, and yield better results from utilizing foreign capital. We should make great efforts to build Tianjin into an area that is most attractive to investors and make foreign traders more enthusiastic in investing in Tianjin. Third, we should try every possible means to make Tianjin more popular. Since last year, all fields have exerted great effort in going abroad and bringing in foreign funds and have done a lot of work in absorbing foreign investment and spreading propaganda abroad. Not long ago, the municipal government delegation paid a visit to the ROK and Malaysia via Hong Kong, and the visit left a deep impression on the delegation. There are many funds that can be utilized in the world. The key lies in whether we can absorb them. From now on, we should make even better use of all sorts of channels, opportunities, and propaganda media to extensively propagate Tianjin, spread its influence in the world, and interest more foreign investment by foreign friends. In absorbing foreign investment, we should attach great importance on the role of noted persons, large enterprises, and large financial groups that are influential in the world. If we have the ability to invite them to Tianjin to carry out several large projects, we will be able to further expand Tianjin's influence in the outside world and attract even more investors to Tianjin. Fourth, we should play the "service card" well. Tianjin's reform is multi-directional, and thus its service should also be multi- directional. We should strive for development with service and set up the role as the economic central city with service. Not only should we improve the service abroad, but also improve the service at home. Not only should we serve the areas around Bohai Bay, but also serve the areas in north, northeast, and northwest China. Not only should we serve various departments under the central authorities, but also serve various provinces and municipalities. We should drop the haughtiness of being a large city and jump out of the closed circle to open Tianjin's gate wide. Convenience and service should be given by every possible means to the projects that are conducive to the economic development of both sides, regardless of their scale, distance, and order of cooperation. All localities, all departments, all units, and even all social members should foster a strong sense of opening up and a strong idea of service and should find proper places to conduct service. We should enhance the comprehensive service functions of cities, use first-class service to win sentiment and reputation, and constantly enhance our attraction to bring in even more professional talents, materials, funds, and information in order to create a completely new situation of opening the whole municipality in all directions at home and abroad. 5. Accelerate the Development of the Tertiary Industry, With Emphasis on Cultivating and Developing the Market Structure To successfully establish the socialist market economy, we are required to cultivate large markets and develop large-scale circulation. In the past, enterprises relied on plans, but now they rely on markets. Establishment of several large markets will provide conditions for developing enterprises, and the image of the entire municipality will experience big changes. In future economic work, we should regard the cultivation and development of large markets as an important part of government's service to enterprises and change of government functions and should place this work in an even more conspicuous position so that we can gradually build Tianjin into the biggest commercial and trading center in northern China. It is necessary to consolidate and develop the existing trading markets. Over the past years, the municipality has done a lot of work in setting up markets. So far, 64 commodity wholesale markets, 28 trading markets for capital goods, and a group of banking, technology, skilled persons, and labor markets have been set up. A market system framework has beginning to take shape. This has positively helped promote the reasonable flow of production factors, the enlivening of the economy, and the acceleration of development. But, the existing markets are still less advanced in terms of the development scale, the categories, the influential power, and the service level. We must further adopt positive and effective administrative measures to expand the scale of management, intensify the service functions, improve the trading environment, form a big climate. On the basis of developing spot markets, we should create conditions to run, on a trial basis, one or two futures trading centers. We should fully apply market information to serve enterprises. Simultaneously, enterprises should be good at using information to guide production and management. It is necessary to build another group of trading markets. First, we should form, as soon as possible, the banking markets dominated by the flow of funds by banks. We should positively expand the categories and scale of various bonds, increase the negotiable securities management organizations and service networks, achieve the issue and listing of stocks, enhance the influential power and attractiveness of the municipality's securities markets, and create conditions for striving to run the third securities trading center in China. We should also strive to run gold trading centers. Second, in line with the setup of the modern enterprise system, we should positively cultivate and develop the markets for trading enterprise property rights. Third, we should firmly attend to organizing the state-level north China technology trading market and build the municipality into a key scientific and technological findings and information distribution area and a technology trading center in north China. Fourth, in line with the development of land resources, the reconstruction of the old urban areas, and the reform of the housing system, we should further improve and expand the real estate market. Fifth, we should continue to build a group of national and regional large markets in cooperation with state departments and commissions and brotherly provinces and municipalities. Simultaneously, we should positively develop various kinds of professional intermediate organizations of market and bring into full play their functions for serving, notarizing, and supervising economic activities. By developing various categories of markets, we should further promote the development of transportation, postal and telecommunications, information consultation, catering service, shopping, tourist, and entertainment trades; increase the proportion of the tertiary industry in the GNP; and further make Tianjin vigorous and flourishing. 6. Accelerate the Construction of Key Projects and Enhance the Reserve Strength for Economic Development. To elevate the economy to a new height, Tianjin must build, as soon as possible, a group of pillar industries and develop a group of large-scale, high-level, and wide-needed products with competitiveness so as to enhance the reserve strength for development and competitiveness. Otherwise, Tianjin will lose the position as a key city. Tianjin's machinery industry with automobiles and machinery equipment as the mainstay, electronic industry with telecommunication and computers as the mainstay, chemical industry with petrochemical products, marine chemical products, and fine chemicals as the mainstay, and metallurgical industry with fine-quality steel tubes and high-grade metal products as the mainstay have taken an initial shape. Their output value accounts for 70 percent of the total industrial enterprises, and their profits and taxes account for 80 percent of the total of all budgetary industrial enterprises. We should continue to accelerate the development of these four pillar industries and expand them. In automobile production, we should increase the capacity to 150,000 as soon as possible. In seamless steel tube production, we should organize and operate it well, make the best of its investment, and apply its advanced technology to other trades. Construction of the ethylene and polyester projects should be accelerated. Regarding the production of the 20 key products, such as program-controlled telephone exchanges, video recorders, engineering machines, metal products, and chemical fibers, we should expand the scale, upgrade the levels, and improve the efficiency. Guided by market demand, we should expedite the adjustment and renovation of light and textile industries and their technical transformation with foreign funds and technology. Larger-scale renovation and reorganization should be made in some key industries. All districts, counties, and bureaus should also pay attention to their own key products. We should comprehensively speed up construction of infrastructural facilities, further improve the investment climate, and enable the municipality to play a better role as the carrier to meet the requirement for the great economic development. This year, we should step up the expansion of the Beimalu Road and Laotieqiao Street, link up all the sections of the inner ring road, build four new overpasses, and expand and renovate some road sections with snarled traffic to ease strained transportation in urban areas as soon as possible. We should speed up construction of a number of commercial, trading, and public cultural facilities, such as the Quanyechang Department Store, Baihuo Shopping Center, Zhongshan commercial building, Huaxin commercial building, Beiyang industrial and medicinal herb commercial and trading integrated building, TIANJIN RIBAO multi-purpose building, and JINWAN BAO building, to effect a notable change in the outlook of the municipality. We should continue construction of the second-phase project of the Xinkaihe Water Works, expedite construction of such energy facilities as the Jixian Power Plant and Chentangzhuang Heat and Power Plant, actively prepare for the construction of the No. 3 gas plant, ensure supplies of heat to 3 million square meters of houses, and increase the local telephone capacity to 400,000 lines. We should make all-out efforts to organize the implementation of the projects for the 43d Works Table Tennis Games and make sure that they are completed on schedule. 7. Strengthen the Fundamental Position of Agriculture and Further Expand the Rural Economy Persisting in the integrated and common development of urban and rural areas and quicken the process of Tianjin's rural modernization constitute an important aspect of the endeavor to develop Tianjin's economy. We should always attach importance to agriculture and rural work and never shake the fundamental position of agriculture in the process of establishing the socialist market economy system. Agriculture can only be strengthened and never weakened. All trades and professions should support agriculture and rural work and forge closer ties between urban and rural areas and between industry and agriculture. To accelerate rural economic development, we should continue to develop suburban-type and export-oriented economy, adhere to the principle of serving the city and making peasants prosper, further restructure the rural economy, develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture, stabilize and increase grain and cotton production, make the "shopping basket" project successful, and improve the socialized service system. We should increase agricultural investment continuously and improve rural policies. We should focus all our efforts on increasing peasants' income. This is the basic guarantee for stabilizing agriculture and rural areas. All localities should adopt various forms in line with their actual situation to greatly enhance the living standards and actual income of peasants. This should be regarded as a major criterion for assessing the work achievements of leading bodies at all levels on the agricultural front. Continued efforts should be made to grasp the work of helping the poor people, and study and adopt some permanent measures to rapidly change the backward outlook of the poverty-stricken areas. Greatly developing township enterprises is a major move for invigorating Tianjin's economy. We should further deepen reform, clearly define the property right relations, promote the shareholding cooperative system, and standardize and develop township enterprise groups. We should keep a flexible mechanism in township enterprises and never follow the old pattern of state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to take the market as the guidance, actively expand the use of foreign capital, readjust the structure, upgrade quality and management, enlarge the scope, upgrade products, and form a leading industry and key enterprises, and produce competitive products of our own in an effort to strengthen the ability to compete. We should combine the development of the rural economy with the building of small towns, carry out this work ahead of schedule, clearly define the major points, provide support and guidance, and build a number of new towns with their own characteristics through several years of efforts. 8. We Should Develop High and New Technology, and Combine Science With Economy We are now in a period of rapidly developing technology and information. Science and technology have infiltrated into all spheres of our social and economic life, playing an increasingly important role. Under the market economic condition, commodity competition is actually a contest of technology. As a big city, it certainly cannot find a foothold if its technology is backward. It must strengthen the sense of urgency in relying on scientific and technological progress. Through reform and opening up, we should apply the market mechanism to further promote a combination of science and technology. We should unceasingly use advanced technology to transform traditional industries and old enterprises, digest and absorb imported technologies, blaze new trials, and raise the technological content of products. Pertinent economic and scientific and technological departments at all levels, all scientific research organs, and all enterprises should make arrangements for the work of relying on scientific and technological progress, and achieve actual progress. We should expedite the development of a new technology industrial park. The park must be built to become our municipality's high and new-tech industrial base, the source of radiation in transforming traditional industries, the showcase of opening to the outside world, and the experimental area for deepening reform. We should give play to our advantages of having many scientific research organs, a good foundation in high and new technology, and a strong capacity in research and development, actively use foreign capital, and achieve big progress in developing jointly-funded and cooperative scientific and technological items and new industries. We should further improve all policies, laws, and regulations, raise the service level, and realistically enhance cohesion in the park. This year we should accelerate the construction of Huayuan industrial zone, Wuqing industrial zone, the management and service base, and the second Baidilu science and trade street, and rapidly form an atmosphere in this aspect. We should actively establish the science and technology service system. This year we should give priority to building science and technology coordination centers and technology trading centers in northern provinces, and raise and perfect the science and technology pioneering center. On this basis, we should establish the science and technology evaluation center and the productive forces promotion center. It is necessary to make our municipality produce more and better achievements rapidly through the establishment of science and technology service system, and rapidly translate scientific and technological achievements into real productive forces. Tianjin, being one of our country's old industrial bases and the economic center of northern China, should follow the world's advanced technology in some spheres. We should give full play to the role of scientific research units, institutions of higher learning, and municipal scientific research organs in Tianjin, and speed up the process of commercialization and industrialization of the scientific and technological achievements. We should implement the doctrine of bringing in, and graft advanced technology with pillar industries and transplant it to competitive products. Personnel are the guarantee and education is the foundation for implementing the principle of developing the municipality with science and technology and for developing high and new technology. To develop the economy, education should be developed first; to promote the economy to a new height, education should be promoted to a new height first; and to make the economy a cut above others, personnel and the education that trains the personnel should be made a cut above others first. All relevant departments should put education in a strategic position for development on a priority basis, conscientiously implement the arrangements made at the municipal education work conference held by the municipal party committee and government, accelerate educational reform and development, and train a large number of high-quality personnel of various specialties for Tianjin's economic development and social progress. We should establish a social practice of respecting knowledge and respecting personnel throughout the municipality, realistically raise the social status and material benefits of intellectuals, and give full play to their role in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. 9. Achieve a Breakthrough in the Renovation of Single-Story Houses To Further Improve People's Living Standard Seizing the opportunity to accelerate development, in the final analysis, depends on the enthusiasm, initiative, creativity, wisdom, and forces of the masses. Without them, everything will be out of the question. When the masses are plunging themselves into reform, opening up, and the modernization drive with high spirit, we should all the more show concern for their vital interests and exert utmost efforts to do practical work for them. All our leading cadres come from the masses and are at the service of the people. At no time and under no circumstances should they forget the masses. They should put themselves in the position of the masses and work for them. They should step up the work urgently needed by the masses and create favorable conditions for doing the work for which conditions are lacking for the time being. Regarding the work most urgent in people's lives, in particular, they should not wait until the revenue is improved or the economy is promoted to a new height. They should adopt every means to carry it out and truly regard the difficulties of the masses as the focus of their work. Housing, income, children's education, and public security are the issues the masses are currently most concerned about. Due to numerous reasons, Tianjin still has many dilapidated single-story houses, where many people are living. There are even some houses where three generations live together, sweating in the summer and freezing in the winter. If we remain indifferent to this, serving the people will become an empty talk, the endeavor to accelerate development will have no appeal, and the image and prestige of the party and the government among the masses will be damaged. This is a serious issue. We should also note that speeding up the renovation of dilapidated single-story houses cannot only directly benefit the masses but it can also lead to the improvement of urban traffic conditions, the renovation of the old city proper, the construction of infrastructural facilities, and the development of the tertiary industry, increase urban employment opportunities, and raise the degree of urban civilization. It is a good thing that has plenty of benefits and a major measure to make the city prosper and the people happy. We should enhance understanding and confidence and race against the time to carry it out. In 1994, we launch the first battle to rebuild the one-storey houses. We must be successful in the first battle. Six districts in the municipality should set historical records in the number of areas where houses are dismantled and the people have to move to other places because of the reconstruction, the number of construction areas, and the number of newly built houses. A total of 2.795 million square meters of houses should be built this year. All districts should ensure to achieve this target. We should try every possible means to increase the use of foreign capital. We should timely sum up experiences, revise and perfect policies, and attract more foreign businessmen to engage in the reconstruction of one-storey houses. All supporting units should take the overall situation into consideration, care for the weal and woe of the people, strive to reduce various expenses, and make up no excuses to gain profits from the reconstruction of one-storey houses. According to the requirements of the overall urban planning, we should ensure that the construction designs are new, carefully organize construction, and guarantee the construction quality so the masses are satisfied. We should achieve the work in such channels as dismantling old houses, having the people move to other places, exchanging houses, and returning to newly built houses; handle affairs strictly according to policies; make the accomplishments visible to the public; and end various kinds of unhealthy tendencies. We should conscientiously treat and appropriately handle the problems that the masses have complaints and carefully accomplish the good things. It is necessary to organically link the reconstruction of one-storey houses with the deepening of the housing reform coordinately in line with policies and to encourage and guide the masses to accurately understand that the individuals must undertake reasonable burden. It is necessary to eliminate administrative interference and monopoly and to open bidding and make competition on equal terms in participating in the reconstruction of one-storey houses and developing the real estate industry. At the time of accelerating the reconstruction of dangerous, shabby, and one-storey houses, the leading cadres at various levels should experience in various aspects the weal and woe of the masses and do more good deeds to help the people with difficulties. Particularly, we should try every possible means to help the enterprises whose production has wholly or partially been suspended, the staff members and workers with low income, and those with living difficulties; provide necessary relief for the households with special difficulties; and ensure that all households can live a good life. We should adopt necessary measures to make the markets flourish and stabilize the prices of goods. We should persistently do 20 deeds to improve the livelihood of the urban and rural people and mainly do the things that can directly benefit the people and that are closely related to the people. It is necessary to continuously strengthen the overall improvement of social order, deal strict blows to various criminal activities, and make the people live in peace and contentment. 10. Be Inspired With Enthusiasm And Creatively Carry Our Work. The key to making a high start in the 1994 work and to making new changes in various aspects hinges on the leading cadres at various levels. It is not easy to create a new situation. The situation is pressing. There are no routes of retreat. With new ideas, new field of vision, greater courage, and greater boldness, we should carry forward the spirit of pioneering undertakings in the new situation and guide the broad masses of the people to create a new situation in accelerating the pace of development. It is necessary to emancipate the mind. To make new headway in our work, we should emancipate the mind. To emphasize the emancipation of the mind, the leading cadres should be the first in emancipating the mind, handle affairs resolutely in line with the ideological line of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, thoroughly free themselves from the restrictions of rigid and outdated ideas, foster new ideas, and have the daring to be the first in the world. We should give free reins and have the daring to do the things that are conducive to the development of Tianjin and lose no good opportunities. To emphasize the necessity to emancipate the mind, we should see real results in our work. The leading cadres at various levels occupy important positions. So, their work performances not only have the bearing on their own political achievements but also are related to the personal interests of the 9 million people in the municipality. Facing the heavy tasks, we cannot spend 1994 easily and steadily. We should be ready to perspire, use energy, and lose weight. Some comrades think that the tasks are heavy and they bear heavy pressure. It is normal. The situation must not be submitted to us. On the contrary, we should consciously suit the requirements for the development of the situation. We should think out new methods, pioneer new ways, vie with one another to do things, select and bear heavy burden, do several concrete deeds, and live up to the expectations of the party and the people. We should dare to aim high and win the first place. In assessing the work in various fields, we should not compare ourselves with what was achieved in the past, but should compare with the advanced places in the nation and with the standards the municipalities should attain. Tianjin dwellers are not foolish, and those who are seated here will also not admit that they are more foolish than others. Tianjin dwellers are able to do a big cause. We should persist in high standards and set strict demands on the work in all fields, should have a strong spirit of admitting no defeat and a spirit of working with all our might. The time cannot be delayed and all work should be done hurriedly to create a first- class work. We should stress on overall situation and unity. Accelerating development is precisely the overall situation. All our speeches and actions should subject to this overall situation. The entire municipality should develop according to a unified plan, and all the people there should make encouraging remarks and support each other to form a concerted power. All the remarks that are detrimental to unity should not be made, and all the things that are detrimental to unity should not be done. We should advocate the selfless spirit, face up to difficulties, yield convenience to others, render service to lower levels, find out shortcomings among ourselves, and concentrate our efforts on our own work. We should comprehensively carry out the system of being responsible for attaining one's own work targets. We should give assignments to everyone and let each level assume responsibility for its own work. For the major matters that have a bearing on the overall situation, we should allow everyone to air his views and listen to the opinions of the masses before making policy decisions. Once a policy is determined, it should be executed resolutely to ensure its smooth implementation. We should fully believe and depend on the masses. Over the past several years, Tianjin has given rise to the basic work idea of "doing everything for the people and relying on the people to do everything." This idea must be carried forward. On the final analysis, we must depend on the masses to fulfill this year's arduous tasks and to realize our fighting goals. Our determination and our methods are all from the aspirations and wisdom of the masses. In establishing the socialist market economic structure, we will certainly meet many new circumstances and new problems. Under such a situation, leading cadres at all levels must frequently go deep into the grass-roots areas to set off the atmosphere of conducting investigation and study and avoid subjectivism and making mistakes that should not be made. We should make best possible use of our political advantages and extensively launch voluntary labor activities in order to fully mobilize the initiative of the masses and reasonably exploit their initiative. For the overall situation of accelerating the development of Tianjin, and for the common interest of the people in Tianjin, we should eliminate all resistance and should not hold on to a post without doing any work. The basic quality of the ranks of our cadres is good, and the overwhelming majority of our cadres are competent. We sincerely hope that all cadres will stand the test, perform their duties on their posts, run forward every day, and make their due contributions to garner the support of the masses. While concentrating on carrying out reform, opening up, and economic work, we should attach importance to the work of propaganda, culture, public health, sports, environmental protection, and family planning, and should strengthen the building of spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the legal system with a view to effecting a comprehensive progress in society. Nineteen ninety four is an extremely important year to the acceleration of Tianjin's development. The people's aspirations are ardent and the tasks are arduous. Let us closely rally around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus. Let us unite as one, struggle arduously, and truly attend to practical work under the correct leadership of the municipal party committee in order to win a new victory in Tianjin's reform, opening up, and various other undertakings in 1994!
