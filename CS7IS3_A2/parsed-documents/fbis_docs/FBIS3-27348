According to statistics, some 80 percent of the province's 12,778 foreign-funded firms are making profits, 15 percent maintain a balance and the other three percent to five percent are losing money. The promising investment environment and profitable production spur foreign business people to expand their projects. It is estimated that the increased amount of foreign investment so far this year is nearly 2 billion yuan. Foreign-funded enterprises have become a major force in exports from the province. Last year, foreign-funded companies achieved an export value of 3.004 billion dollars, constituting 52.9 percent of the total for Fujian. Their exports include garments, shoes, electronic and chemical products and building materials. The markets are in Europe, the United States and Japan. The average foreign investment in each foreign-funded project was 2.41 million U.S. dollars last year, much higher than the average for the country as a whole. Overseas funds are increasing in infrastructure, the power industry and service sector. A number of foreign-funded electric power projects have been approved by the province. The Meizhou Bay power plant is a solely foreign funded project. Its initial investment topped 350 million U.S. dollars. Foreign-funded firms have also started to conduct management based on Chinese monetary and taxation policies. In addition, many of them have set up retirement insurance schemes for their employees.
