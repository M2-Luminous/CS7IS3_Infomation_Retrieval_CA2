What new elements will the meeting contribute toward mutual relations between the two states? [Nazarbayev] First, the meeting concluded six months of work to bring our economic integration closer. Our experts and governments intend the program to last until the year 2000. As a result of this work an agreement was signed on joint economic space. [Karimov, in progress] ...which presupposes, above all, a free economy, a free movement of goods, capital, labor resources, manpower, services, and so forth. My view is that that we are now tackling problems, difficult economic problems, and we are thereby also settling political issues. Today we have made the first step toward integration.
