More precisely, it will provide the last opportunity to assess their real stature. It will highlight their sense of responsibility toward the state in the near future. It will clearly show their concern for our national fate, regardless of their verbal declarations and oaths. Their morals will become obvious and we will finally see whether they still have a certain responsibility to "the voters," or whether they have really sunk in the mire of their insurmountable selfishness and corporate-party greed. If the suspicion about Professor Berov's illness is confirmed, it would mean that he will be absent for at least six months. This means that our state will find itself in the paradoxical situation in which it is led by a government without a leader, who is the only one authorized to adopt strategic decisions. The reshuffle planned for a long time by the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the other parliamentary groups will fail to materialize. Indeed, the differences in the concealed goals of those parliamentary groups are so great that even if the prime minister was healthy this reshuffle could not have been carried out without the powerful partner from the left making his preferences known. The reshuffle will fail to materialize because it is immoral to pressurize a sick prime minister to "repair" his cabinet under the dictation of politicians who are pursuing their own or their parties' interests. However, according to Ahmed Dogan, the "prime minister had the willingness to rule," and it is expected of him that he will show this willingness by accepting the ideas of personnel changes that will be submitted to him while he lies in his hospital bed. The BSP intends to discuss the situation. One should not wonder if the new situation that emerged would serve the BSP better than the situation of having a healthy prime minister. This way his deputy, Matinchev, will remain as acting prime minister very conveniently for a long period of time. On 13 April he clearly stated that Professor Berov should rest, and that he should leave the governing to him and his colleagues. Since the Constitution does not provide a solution, what Matinchev said could become Bulgaria's reality in the next few months. If our politicians have preserved in themselves at least a small measure of responsibility and statesmanship the parliament should pass a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet because of the new circumstances rather than providing it with the straw of the international agreements, used to justify its staying in power. If Prime Minister Berov is really concerned with the efficient ruling of the country, he must resign and thus prove that he is the master of his own will. The rest is merely irresponsibility at the expense of the people.
