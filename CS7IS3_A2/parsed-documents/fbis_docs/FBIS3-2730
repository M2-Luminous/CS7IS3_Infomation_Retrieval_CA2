The report on economic and social development, to be tabled by Mr Chen at the National People's Congress (NPC) this morning, laid down a detailed strategy to introduce macro-level adjustment and control over the economy through economic and legal tools, as well as "the requisite state fiats". The preservation of social stability is a must in the process of further seeking economic growth and pushing forward the reform programme for a market economy, Mr Chen said in his 29-page report. "Nothing can start without a stable social environment," he said. Adjustment and control over the economy must be strengthened and further improved to ensure targets of economic and social development for 1994 will be realised, said Mr Chen. The major targets listed by Mr Chen included: -- GNP growth rate of nine percent. -- Total fixed asset investment of 1,300 billion yuan (HK$1,154 billion) for 1994. -- A deficit forecast of 66.9 billion yuan. Together with domestic and foreign debts and loans, total debts will reach 129.2 billion yuan this year. -- A ceiling of 470 billion yuan for new bank credit. -- A total value of imports and exports of US$200 billion (HK$1,544 billion). Imports of US$100 billion and exports of US$ 100 billion. -- An increase in retail prices will be kept within 10 percent. Speaking yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli explained that the total estimated deficit was much higher as a result of the introduction of a new budget auditing system in order to keep inline with international practice. He put the estimate of deficit at about 30 billion yuan based on last year's accounting method which is significantly higher than the 20.5 billion yuan deficit last year. The country's financial situation, described by Mr Liu as "severe" in his budget, will also be reported on at today's NPC session. The macro-adjustment and control was to "mutually coordinate" and "harmonise" with the need to maintain "reform development and stability". Although "development is the rigorous test of reason", the SPC head said the pursuit of development should have "new ideas". The crux is to focus on optimising economic structure, speed up technological improvement, strengthen management and boost efficiency," he said. "Only by doing this can development help create a better economic environment for re form and be beneficial to social stability." Mr Chen maintained that the enforcement of major fiscal, taxation, investment, foreign trade and enterprise reforms should be closely monitored. Any new problems should be solved promptly, he said. All regions and departments should make efforts to contain inflation by co-ordinating all economic and legal tools and the necessary administrative measures, he said. The senior official, seen as a close ally of Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, indicated that the major task of macro-adjustment and control was to balance the overall supply and demand. The task must begin with strict control over fixed assets investment, he said. In addition to the ban on fixed assets projects, Mr Chen ordered banks at all levels to strictly follow the loan plan for such projects. Inter-bank loans should be scrutinised and any illegal raising of funds should not be allowed to revive, the official said. The focus of real estate should be placed in co-ordination with the Government's housing reform, he said, warning against any move to expand capital investment under the disguise of building more residential flats. Mr Chen revealed that the SPC and relevant departments and regions would tighten up supervision over the planning of projects of some special "popular products and projects". This, he maintained, will avoid blind and repetitive construction plans and maximise the use of resources. On the demand side, Mr Chen has vowed to strictly control the growth of the level of wages. Unregulated payment of bonus and subsidies will be stopped, he said. The central Government would also promote frugality and resolutely oppose the prevailing phenomenon of extravagance, he said. Mr Chen said the central bank would be strengthened to control on the growth of money supply and credit. The revamp of the fiscal order will continue, he added. In the face of the high inflation last year, the SPC chief admitted that the inflationary pressure this year remained strong, citing plans to readjust the prices of daily necessities including energy, grain and cotton. A series of measures have to be taken to ensure price rises are being kept at an acceptable level. These included the increase of supply by boosting the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, sugar and meat; cracking-down against illicit raising of prices; and the establishment of a comprehensive supervisory and controlling mechanism on prices. Mr Chen disclosed that the State Council had decided to launch two nationwide inspection on prices in the first and second halves of this year to crack down on price hoarding and activities that disrupt market order.
