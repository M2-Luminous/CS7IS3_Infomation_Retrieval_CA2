Among those parties are the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Japan New Party. Within Rengo, moves toward the political realignment have been observed. For example, the All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers Union, the Japan Teachers Union, the Japan Electric Communications Union [as published], and the Japan Postal Workers Union have agreed to provide financial assistance and electoral cooperation so as to unite the SDPJ, the DSP, and liberal forces. The purpose of this organ is to create grounds for unifying a new force by engaging in policy coordination between various parties. At Rengo's Central Committee session scheduled for 17 March, Chairman Akira Yamagishi will officially propose the establishment of the organ. Then, members of both the SDPJ and the DSP and some intellectuals will form a preparatory team in early April to work on establishing the new organ.
