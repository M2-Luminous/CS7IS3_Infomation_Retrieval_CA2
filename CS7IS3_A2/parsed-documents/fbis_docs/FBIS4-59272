How do you view the future of these talks? What is Lebanon's role in these talks? [Fadlallah] In my opinion, in Lebanon the dimensions of the peace talks are far greater than in other countries because we have factions that differ on the peace talks. There is a group that accepts the concept of absolute peace and another group rejects it in toto. Another group wishes to accept it conditionally while yet another group wants to reject it if there are any conditions. Thus, I believe that in Lebanon, any cultural or political move on peace or other issues has far greater consequences than in other countires. As for the future of peace, the talks lack an element of greatness and effectiveness which could culminate in some definite outcome in the future. This is because the problems between the Arabs and the Zionist regime have some difficult conflicts that cannot be resolved in a year. In any case, I do feel that the talks are moving toward peace. This is because the regional and international situations--with all they entail--exert pressure on all sides to sign the peace accord. Of course, this pressure is directed more toward the Arabs than Israel. The present political and security situation in the region has endangered the interests of the big governments, the United States in particular. [passage omitted] If the Arab and Islamic worlds were to wake up from their prolonged slumber, it is possible that they could foil the U.S. and Zionist plans, but the problem is that we do not see any basic political revolution. What we see here is only political talk or political plans. In fact, those who reject the peace process do not have any definite or formulated program on how to handle the various stages of the peace plan. Therefore what we see are mere airy notions, slogans, plans and stances, most of which have no relation to other stances and programs. Thus, when we look at international realities and the current weakness in the Arab and Islamic world, as well as those who are opposed to the talks, we conclude that in the course of one or two years the talks will fall into the groove that was envisioned for them. Many people believe that if the peace talks do not yield any results by the end of 1994, they will be postponed to after the U.S. elections, as the Americans usually begin preparing for the next presidential elections two years after a new president takes office. Meanwhile, the American Jews will be able to take advantage of this opportunity to put the necessary pressure on the talks, which will then halt these talks. It is to the Zionists' advantage to keep the talks like this and not to let them make any headway, but at the same time they want to get whatever they want from the talks. Lebanon does not have a fundamental role in these talks, as it usually keeps in step with Syria with regard to relations with the Zionist regime and on the subject of peace talks. It is no secret that Lebanon's position is closely linked with the Syrian stance. It is natural that this would prevent Lebanon from falling into internal or external schemes for a separate peace with the Zionist regime. This relationship between Lebanon and Syria--even though it is considered to have some weak points--has some positive aspects too. [ETTELA'AT] How do you assess the latest events in Lebanon, the revelation of those responsible for the bombing of Sayyidat al- Najat Church, and the Lebanese Government's clash with the Lebanese Forces led by Samir Ja'ja'? Is it expected that the Lebanese Government will step up its confrontation with other groups in Lebanon? [Fadlallah] It is natural that there should be a U.S. plan for Lebanon, namely, that the army take over the security bases in Lebanon. This would enable it to exert political pressure. The United States is seeking to do this with all its might. The United States has chosen the Lebanese Army as a means to this end. It is not too farfetched to believe that on the domestic level, there has been some sort of agreement with Syria. But the Army's complete control or deployment is not as negative for Lebanon as chaos and disarray would be harmful to it. But many politicians believe that this Lebanese fear of chaos and disarray may be misused to impose new restrictions in Lebanon, which would not be in the interest of public freedom. We do see such stances, which are opposed to freedom, in Lebanon. In the newspapers, in the general political atmosphere, and in some of the government sources in Lebanon, there is talk of pressure on some groups, especially Hizballah. This is because Hizballah is considered the representative of the opposition forces, considered to be under Iran's support and orders. It is the only armed group that still has its weapons, because its weapons are used in the resistance of the occupation of south Lebanon. This has prevented pressure from being exerted on it by the Lebanese Government. In the circumstances, the Lebanese Government will not permit the suppression of Hizballah or of the Islamic Resistance. This is because the Islamic Resistance Movement has lawful local, regional, and international reasons for existing and the governments are forced to accept them. The Islamic Resistance Movement is a popular movement that demands the withdrawal of foreigners from these territories. From this angle, the Lebanese Government, an ally of the Syrian Government, cannot resort to crushing the Resistance, because Syria would not agree. Any confrontation of the Resistance by the Lebanese Government would also generate problems, which could usher in a return to civil war in Lebanon. Despite this and without resorting to tackling the issue of the Islamic Resistance directly, the Lebanese Government will take measures to implement some plans that would place Hizballah in a position of weakness. [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the role of the Islamic Resistance in the south? [Fadlallah] In my view, the Islamic Resistance Movement enjoys freedom of action politically and militarily. But it may encounter major difficulties if the talks achieve results and peace with the Zionist regime. Then the conditions in the Arab world will exert pressure on the Islamic Resistance. There could be efforts to embroil the Islamic Resistance in differences and internal dissent, just as we witnessed clashes in the past between the Hizballah and Amal movements. The Resistance will face greater hardships and problems but this does not mean it will succumb to them. The Islamic Resistance may have other choices in the resistance of the Zionist regime and these may be different from those they have now. [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the effect of the Gaza-Jericho Accord and a regional economic accord between the Arab countries and the Zionist regime on Iran, from the security and economic point of view? [Fadlallah] The Zionist regime is using the Gaza-Jericho Accord as a gateway to the Arab world through the Palestinians. The Zionist regime is using the Palestinians as a bridge to link it with the Arab world by signing economic agreements. This is why we see the Zionists giving greater importance to talks on economic issues with the Palestinians, as their objective is to gain economic influence in the Arab world and the Middle East. The U.S. role in this regard is to abolish the concept of the "Arab world" so that it can create a strategic, political, and economic region in the Middle East within an international order which conforms to U.S. interests. It is for this reason that the United States speaks of the Middle East and not of the Arab world, and is considering using Turkey as a strong factor in security, political, and economic transactions in the region. I imagine that the future position of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be difficult as the United States is proposing to embargo it unless it accepts U.S. conditions. In the U.S. scheme of things, a toppling of the Islamic system is not necessary, as long as it conforms to U.S. plans in the region and retreats where U.S. policies are concerned. This is something that Iran has not accepted so far. Therefore, the current economic situation will exert greater pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran as economic relations increase. This will also be true from a security point of view. Iran should be especially prepared, as this plan has some dangerous elements. We have complete faith that the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khamene'i, and President Hashemi- Rafsanjani, will follow these developments through the Supreme National Security Council or other bodies. It is also the obligation of the Muslim Iranian people to ward off these new plots -- that is the economic, security, and political embargo by the United States -- and they should remain steadfastly their leadership.
