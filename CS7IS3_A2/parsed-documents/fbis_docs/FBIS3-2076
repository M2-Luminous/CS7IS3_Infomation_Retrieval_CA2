This industrial system became one of the three pillars for production of civil products in 1993, with the gross output value and sales turnover of the entire industrial system jumping to 45 percent and over 50 percent, respectively, over those in 1992. In 1993, the number of enterprises from province's national defense scientific and technological industry with an annual output value exceeding 100 million yuan and over 50 million yuan totalled three and six, respectively. Among them was Swan Air Conditioner Company, which realized an output value of 260 million yuan, posted an increase over 50 percent in terms of production and sales over those in 1992, acquired the capability to produce 300,000 air conditioner units annually, despite having been hit with another unseasonably cool summer. Huaihai Machinery Plant rolled out over 10,000 Flying Tiger brand cars, quadrupling output value to 254 million yuan and generating 14.85 million yuan of profits and taxes for the state from those in 1992, acquiring the capability to annually turn out 20,000 Flying Tiger cars, thus initially meeting the requirements for large-scale production. Wuhu Shipyard began building the first 10,000 [dead weight ton] dwt-class vessel -- a 12,000 dwt low-waterline freighter which can dock at harbors along the Changjiang -- thus opening the way for 10,000 dwt-class freighters to call at ports along Changjiang all the year round as well as bringing good market prospects for Wuhu Shipyard to build 10,000 dwt-class freighters. In 1993, in addition to becoming one of the three pillars for production of products for civil use, the province's national defense scientific and technological industrial system also set up an assembly line for production of 200,000 hinge joint sets for sedans, an assembly line for 20,000 car air conditioners, and an assembly line for 1,500 gear reducer sets, thus constituting new growth areas for the province's national defense scientific and technological industry in 1994. In 1993, the province's national defense scientific and technological industrial system invested 210 million yuan in technological transformation, a 49-percent increase percent over 1992. The province's national defense scientific and technological system also developed 102 new products. Among them were an international-class colloidal core for ring-type antisprayers [huan xing fang pen qi jiao xin 3883 1748 7089 0899 0892 5231 5361], a colloidal core for antisprayer valves, a container for super-fine filters, portable microwave communications equipment, and a water recycling and cooling system. Some 90 new products were put into mass production, with their output rate reaching 22.97 percent. Industrial product mix experienced a profound transformation thanks to a large scale technological transformation carried out by the province's national defense scientific and technological industry and to its development of new products in 1993. Based on the achievements in 1993, in 1994, provincial national defense science and industry office will, making key enterprises and key products to serve as the point of departure, promote the economic development of the entire system; strive to increase output value by 35 percent and efficiency by 80 percent; establish four and eight enterprises with output value over 100 million yuan and over 50 million yuan, respectively; and further expand the results of the entire system to switch from military production to civil-product production.
