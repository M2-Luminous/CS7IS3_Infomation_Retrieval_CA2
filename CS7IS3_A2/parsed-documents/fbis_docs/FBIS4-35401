The letter reads: Brother Esteemed Speaker of the House of Representatives, Esteemed Members of the House of Representatives. May God's peace and blessing be upon you. The House of Representatives had earlier approved the declaration of the state of emergency in accordance with Republican Decree No. 20 of 1994, which was necessitated by the internal sedition which was the result of the rebellion of secessionist elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership against the constitutional legitimacy, and the ensuing military actions and direct threat to the citizens' security and stability. Since the political leadership was concerned to make the period of the state of emergency very limited in harmony with the democratic policy of our country, the period was set for 30 days. However, the circumstances which necessitated the declaration of the state of emergency have not been finally settled. This calls for extending the state of emergency for another similar period. Based on Article 97 of the Constitution on the need to obtain the House of Representatives' approval for extending the state of emergency, we hope that the House will extend it for another 30 days as of the end of the previous period, taking into consideration that the National Defense Council, which is entrusted with assessing the state of emergency, has approved such extension. In light of this, we present this request to your esteemed house. Please accept our greetings and appreciation. The Parliament has agreed to extend the state of emergency for another 30 days in accordance with the public interest. [passage omitted]
