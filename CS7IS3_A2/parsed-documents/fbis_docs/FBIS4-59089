These media organizations, he said, speak of a conflict between north and south and northern and southern forces, while, in reality, there is a single state and a single constitutional legitimacy. The military operations in some governorates of the Republic of Yemen are not pitting two systems of government or two states against each other. They are confrontations between the regular forces of the united government of Yemen and secessionist rebels defying legitimacy and law and order. The spokesman said he regretted that certain Arab media are making the same mistake, using the same phrases that reflect the former state of division, which existed before 22 May 1990, after which date Yemen was reunified and the Republic of Yemen proclaimed. The spokesman hoped the media, particularly the Arab, would be more accurate and observe the official designations.
