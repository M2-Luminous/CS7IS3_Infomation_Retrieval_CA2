FR940406-2-00148 FR940406-2-00090 II. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority and Background The funding made available under this NOFA is authorized by section 312 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) in order to provide assistance to resident groups and Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developers (CBDs) involved in projects proceeding under the provisions of the Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (Pub. L.100&hyph;242, section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, approved Feb. 5, 1988) (ELIHPA) or the Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, section 601 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), approved November 28, 1990) (LIHPRHA). The origins of LIHPRHA are in ELIHPA. The purpose of ELIHPA was to preserve low-income affordability restrictions on certain HUD-insured or assisted multifamily projects. ELIHPA authorized the use of incentives to encourage owners to retain low-income affordability restrictions or to transfer the property to purchasers who would agree to retain those restrictions. The fundamental principles underlying ELIHPA were that the low-income housing should be preserved for the intended beneficiaries and that owners should be guaranteed a fair and reasonable return on their investments. ELIHPA was intended to be a temporary measure that would allow Congress time to fashion a permanent program for the preservation of existing low-income housing projects. This permanent program is LIHPRHA, which replaced ELIHPA except to the extent that section 604 of NAHA provides a transition option for certain owners. In addition, section 226 of LIHPRHA establishes the Resident Homeownership Program, under which tenants may become homeowners of eligible low income housing. The Department's regulations implementing these statutory provisions are set out in 24 CFR part 248. (Applicants should note that part 248, as codified in the April 1, 1993, revision of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) was amended subsequently in a rule published on July 13, 1993 (57 FR 3384). Most requirements under this NOFA were imposed by title III of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and are included in the July 13, 1993, amendments to part 248.) B. Request for Applications Eligible intermediaries are invited to apply to administer funds under the provisions of this NOFA (see Section V.A, ``Obtaining Intermediary Applications'' of this NOFA). The Department will announce the selected intermediaries and will publish the addresses of the intermediaries and the date on which applicants may apply to intermediaries for technical assistance grant funds. Selected intermediaries will also announce the availability of technical assistance grant funds as described in Section III of this NOFA. C. Allocation and Funding The purpose of this NOFA is to make available $45 million in funds to and through intermediaries for eligible resident and community organizations. The dollar amounts will be made available on a State-by-State basis for two types of grants: Resident Capacity grants and Predevelopment grants. The description of how funds will initially be divided by State is listed in Appendix B of this NOFA. The Department will rate local intermediaries, then State intermediaries, then regional intermediaries before making selections for each geographic area. Some States may be subdivided for purposes of the NOFA activities if there are a sufficient number of eligible low-income housing projects in the State to justify sub-State intermediaries. Local or sub-State intermediaries applying to perform grant administration activities must apply to perform activities covering at least the jurisdiction of one HUD area office. The Department will generally favor local or sub-State intermediaries over State intermediaries, and will favor State intermediaries over regional intermediaries. However, before making the final intermediary selections, the Department will assess the overall capacity and experience of intermediary applicants. If no intermediary applicant applies to administer grants in a particular State or area, the Department will select a national intermediary to perform those activities in that State or area. If no acceptable application is received from a national intermediary, the Department's field offices will administer the Resident Capacity and Predevelopment grants for all areas not covered by local, State, or regional intermediaries.
