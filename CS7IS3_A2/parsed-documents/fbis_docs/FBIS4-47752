Phosa also told SOWETAN in an interview that urgent steps needed to be taken in "order to avoid money being misused by people who are presently in state offices". He said his plan would be to: - Immediately put in place strict monitoring of government and administration in KwaNdebele, KaNgwane and the Transvaal Province Administration; - Decentralisation of power; - Kick-start all the structures of state so that they should function in a cohesive manner; - Finalise the policy position of all 29 regional structures; - Start reconstruction and development; - Identify the needs of the people and immediately begin to deliver and; - Management of the expectations of the people must be people-driven. People should know what is happening so that if there is a delay in fulfilling their needs, they would be in the know. Phosa said: "Government must develop a culture of communication because this will help to solve problems that might arise. "The people of South Africa have managed to liberate themselves and this they did by communicating their aspirations through the ballot box," said Phosa.
