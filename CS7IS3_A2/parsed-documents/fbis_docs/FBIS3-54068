The YSP Central Committee declared that the document, which was prepared with the help of various political forces, is a document of national consensus. It appears, however, that implementing the agreement's clauses will run into some difficulties particularly in light of a reply message sent by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih accusing him of squandering public funds. Another difficulty is that the leaders in the south have stressed that their return to take up their posts in Sanaa hinges on the removal of the causes that made them leave the city in the first place. Our correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit interviewed Prime Minister al-'Attas and prepared the following report: [Begin recording] [Jazulit] The YSP Central Committee held an extraordinary session in Aden today under the chairmanship of Yemeni Vice President and YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid. YSP deputies in the Yemeni parliament and the secretaries of YSP branches in Yemeni governorates attended the session. [Al-'Attas] The YSP Central Committee has devoted considerable attention to this document. This meeting was held specifically to consider this document in a manner appropriate to its importance and to enable every YSP member to carry out his duty in implementing it. [Jazulit] Therefore the YSP will sign the Pledge and Accord Document, isn't that right? [Al-'Attas] The YSP will sign the document, as the National Dialogue Committee did, during a major ceremony, the date and venue of which will be agreed upon. This will happen when a special committee completes clause number seven which deals specifically with security arrangements and when guarantees are drawn up that the agreement will be implemented. [Jazulit] What powers will be given to the vice president in the amended constitution? [Al-'Attas] The vice president will assist the president and will carry out the president's tasks when he is abroad, ill, or cannot carry out his duties for any other reason. He will also have the power to supervise the prime minister's work in connection with local government affairs. [Jazulit] Is the crisis in unified Yemen over or do some reservations persist? [Al-'Attas] To tell the truth, some parties to the dialogue -- specifically parties within the coalition -- have some reservations about the document. This casts doubt on the prospects for implementing it. [end recording]
