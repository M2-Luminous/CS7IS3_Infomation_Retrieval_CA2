The delegation includes deputy ministers of defence, economy, finance, etc., managers of the military industrial complex and businessmen. Despite the difficulties in restoring bilateral economic ties, in 1993 commercial exchange between Russia and Bulgaria went up 20 percent, Mr. Yeltsin observed with satisfaction, the Russian guest added. President Zhelev was particularly interested in the prospects for setting up direct transport links between Russia and Bulgaria across the Black Sea and along Russian rivers, Mr. Lobov said. Cooperation between the two countries will continue as before despite the changed situation in the Black Sea basin which should remain a zone of peace, Dr. Zhelev said in a verbal message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The interests of our two countries and armies dictate that the two states preserve their own defence industries and develop efficient kinds of armaments and combat equipment, Oleg Lobov told journalists today. During the delegation's visit to the Ministry of Defence today he assessed the prospects for bilateral cooperation in the military industrial sphere as optimistic. The meeting was attended by all directors of Bulgarian defence enterprises and the talks were quite specific and businesslike, a government spokesman told BTA. A protocol signed today by Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev and Oleg Lobov covers issues of military cooperation and ways to upgrade transport links between Bulgaria and Russia. The two sides also initialled a document on the setting up of an intergovernmental Bulgarian-Russian Commission in the defence industry. A representative of the Government Press Office described the document as confidential. The Bulgarian side will be headed by Evgeni Matinchev. Eight Bulgarian-Russian joint ventures are already working in this field and five more are preparing their documentation, Oleg Lobov told journalists. He pointed to the importance of the eased tax and customs regulations these ventures enjoy under Russian legislation and the need to exchange experience in conversion. According to Mr. Lobov, at the delegation's meeting with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov today, the prime minister expressed full support for the work carried out so far and showed particular interest in the setting up of a system for transporting cargo by ferryboat along the Varna (on the Black Sea) to Novorossiysk (Russia) line. Additional work should be done on issues related to partial repayment of Russia's debt to Bulgaria with military equipment deliveries, Mr. Lobov added. Joint expert groups will work on this in the next two weeks. During the meeting we expressed the wish to promote joint construction of oil industry projects in Russia and to increase the number of the 12,000 Bulgarian builders in the Russian Federation who are doing an excellent job there, Mr. Lobov added.
