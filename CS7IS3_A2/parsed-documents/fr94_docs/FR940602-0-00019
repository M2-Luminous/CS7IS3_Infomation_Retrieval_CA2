FR940602-0-00019 FR940602-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;167&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8923; AD 94&hyph;11&hyph;07] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes, that requires inspection of the landing gear brakes for wear, and replacement of the brakes if the wear limits prescribed in this amendment are not met. This amendment also requires that the specified maximum brake wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This amendment is prompted by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Information pertaining to this rulemaking action may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Quam, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2145; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3798). That action proposed to require the inspection of certain landing gear brakes for wear, and the replacement of brakes if the wear limits prescribed in the proposal are not met. That action also proposed that the specified maximum brake wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposal. Another commenter requests that NOTE 2 of the proposal be clarified. This commenter points out that proposed NOTE 2 states, ``*␣*␣* Brake units having wear indicators set at 1.06 inch will be considered to be fully worn when either wear indicator pin is 1.0 inch or less above the surface of the carrier. *␣*␣*'' In effect, this wording permits a total brake wear (from new to fully worn brake) of only 0.06 inch. This clearly is incorrect. This commenter states that a correctly set wear indicator pin protrudes above the surface of the carrier when in normal operation, but will be flush with the surface when the brake is fully worn. Thus, the dimension by which the pin protrudes above the surface of the carrier is the amount of wear still available. Therefore, a wear indicator pin set for the existing limit of 1.06 inch will protrude above the surface of the carrier by 0.06 inch when the new wear limit of 1.00 inch is reached. The FAA concurs and has revised NOTE 2 of the final rule to clarify this point. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 100 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 10 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 2 U.S. operators of these airplanes will be affected by this proposed AD. For these airplanes and operators, although the rule requires the incorporation of maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, no other specific additional action, inspection, or part replacement costs relative to that requirement is involved; such actions are currently a part of the current maintenance program. However, it is estimated that it will take approximately 1 work hour, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the revision into its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the requirement to revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes is estimated to be $110, or $55 per operator. The FAA estimates that 20 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 19 U.S. operators of these airplanes will be affected by this AD. It is estimated that it will take approximately 1 work hour, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the revision into its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes is estimated to be $1,045, or $55 per operator.
