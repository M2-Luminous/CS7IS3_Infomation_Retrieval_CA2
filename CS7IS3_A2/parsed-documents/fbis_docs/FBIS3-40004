And now, there is the recent Greek boycott, which is costing FYROM another 70 percent of its trade. But Foreign Trade Minister Stevo Crvenkovski remains optimistic. The FYROM Foreign Trade Minister Stevo Crvenkovski, who was in the Netherlands for a brief visit, said he still did not know why Greece had chosen this moment to restart its boycott of FYROM which ended last year. "We have not provoked them," he said. In fact, Greece has made it very clear why they want to close off FYROM from the outside world at this particular time. The measures, Greek Trade Minister Simitis said last week, were "a necessary consequence of the premature recognition" of FYROM by the entire international community, including EU [European Union] countries and the United States. The recognition has irritated the Greeks because they feel, as they have done since 1991 when their northern neighbor became independent, that FYROM should change its name, flag, and constitution. Because the name and constitution contain implicit territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia and the flag still contains a Greek symbol, the Star of Vergina, it is therefore "a provocation." Athens wants to talk about bilateral relations only when FYROM has met these conditions. The solidarity from abroad has not yet helped FYROM: Greece is holding firm. Nor will the visit by European Commissioner Hans van den Broek to Skopje and Athens today and tomorrow produce much, because "Van den Broek is not mediating," Crvenkovski said. "Our talks with him will be limited to trade relations with the EU only." Therefore FYROM must reckon with an economic blockade which will last some time and could have dramatic consequences. No trade is possible with its northern neighbor, the former Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), because of the UN embargo. Trading with FYROM's other neighbors, Albania and Bulgaria, is difficult, because there are no rail links with these countries and, as Crvenkovski said, "the road links are bad, they are fully used and are completely jammed." Therefore FYROM is isolated economically by the Greek decision. "It is one disaster after another," Crvenkovksi said. "The embargo against Yugoslavia has cost us US$3 billion, according to international estimates. The EU has promised us US$120 million compensation but that has only been given in part and what still gets through has to come via Greece, therefore that too is at a standstill. We have suffered relatively more damage than the rest of Yugoslavia's neighbors: They have lost 5-10 percent of their foreign trade, we have lost 60-70 percent." Add to that the fact that FYROM was already poor, that it is in the middle of economic restructuring, that it is groaning under the strict conditions of an IMF stabilization program, and that last year it was hit by the worst drought in 50 years. It was clear that the Greek measure, to put it mildly, came at a very bad time, he said. "In a normal situation the closure of the southern border by the Greeks would have been a big, but not extreme problem," he said. "However, now it is an extreme problem. There is no alternative to the route through Greece." He went to Albania himself last week, he said, and Tirana is offering full cooperation but can do little in practice. Bulgaria is offering FYROM the harbor of Boergas as an alternative to Thessaloniki but this "good gesture" does not mean much, because "the harbor is not the problem, but the roads, the connections." No, he said, the best thing was to talk to the Greeks, but they did not want to. "Talks continued until last April," he said. "Then the Greeks asked to suspend them because of their elections. The talks were never restarted. As far as we are concerned we have not finished discussing; we are ready to talk again at any moment." But Crvenkovski would hear nothing of prior conditions, as demanded by Greece. "After all it is impossible to negotiate about any subject whatsoever without a negotiating process," he said. It was clear in advance that FYROM has no territorial claims on any of its neighbors. "But we have always said that," he added. FYROM, closed off as it is, will only be able to defend itself against Greek surprise attacks in the long term. With international aid, work is continuing on an East-West link, a Transbalkan road, railroad and communication networks which are to link FYROM to the world -- Italy and Turkey -- via Albania and Bulgaria. However, that is a question of years and in the meantime the whole of the FYROM economy could be run down. There were already social and ethnic tensions in FYROM, Crvenkovski said. "As experience shows, they grow as economic conditions worsen," he said. "No economy in the world is able to survive complete isolation from its normal markets." This does not stop the minister from remaining optimistic. "The FYROM economy is stronger than during the previous Greek boycott," he said. "We have been independent for three years now. We are better organized. We have state institutions. There is a functioning system." In the meantime 50,000 private companies have been set up in FYROM, he said. "If two-thirds go bankrupt, one third will still remain, with which we can continue. We have already gone through a lot. The fact that we have survived these blows during these three years illustrates the vitality of our economy. If we survive this, we will survive anything. Then there will be every reason for optimism."
