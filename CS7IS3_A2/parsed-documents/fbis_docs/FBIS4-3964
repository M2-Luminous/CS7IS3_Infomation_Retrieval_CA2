Today is the third day of Li Peng's visit to Kyrgyzstan. In a most solemn ceremony of the Kyrgyz nationality held at a national park famous for its "multicolored dragon spruces," Dzhumagulov offered this fine-bred steed as a present to Premier Li Peng to show respect and friendship for the Chinese people. The horse is named after a Kyrgyz river called "Naolusi" [name as received]. It is also the name of a traditional festival of the Kyrgyz nationality, meaning "the beginning of spring." The horse, 1.7 meters tall and over 2 meters long, is six years old. It won a horse race at Bishkek last year. When the Chinese premier approached the fine steed, it raised its head and neighed. Softly touching the steed's long mane, Li Peng said laughingly: "It is very friendly." On a slope at an altitude of 2,000 meters above sea level and against a backdrop of mountains whose peaks are perennially covered with snow, Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin gladly posed for a group photo with Kyrgyz girls and boys singing a song in front of a forest of multicolored, evergreen dragon spruces at the foot of the mountain. Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Pan Zhanlin told reporters Premier Li Peng has entrusted the raising of the fine steed symbolizing the spring of Sino-Kyrgyz friendship to the Ili Army Horse Ranch in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which borders Kyrgyzstan.
