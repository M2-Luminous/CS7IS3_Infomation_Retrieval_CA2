The representatives of these countries issued a press statement in which they allowed themselves to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs. They have also launched lies and allegations, full of fallacies, about Iraq's domestic situation, in an attempt to distort facts that are no longer a secret to world public opinion. We strongly condemn this blatant interference in Iraq's domestic affairs by the parties that met in Ankara. The deteriorating situation and the spread of crime and looting and killing in the governorates of al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, and Dahuk are caused by the illegal and illegitimate action carried out by the governments of these four countries when they imposed, by brute force, a no-fly zone in northern Iraq. They have also encouraged rebel gangs to tamper with the region. The official Foreign Ministry spokesman added: Respecting Iraq's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity has one expression, namely, stopping the interference in Iraq's domestic affairs and lifting the illegal and illegitimate ban on flights in northern Iraq imposed by the governments of these states. The official spokesman denounced the fact that the press statement issued by the representatives of the four countries addressed the internal situation in Iraq and spoke about it in the language of a custodian. The spokesman said: Iraq strongly condemns this rude attempt and thinks that the press statement issued in Ankara reflects the true interventionist policy pursued by the Government of the United States and its allies against Iraq and the region. The official Foreign Ministry spokesman asserted that the Iraqi leadership and people will not allow any party to interfere in their domestic affairs and that all attempts by the governments of the countries that seek to perpetuate the abnormal situation prevailing in northern Iraq will definitely fail. Our Kurdish people in Iraq will be the first to defeat these attempts. On the stand of the Turkish Government, the official spokesman said that the Iraqi Foreign Ministry has cautioned the Turkish side through a number of official memorandums declaring that Turkey's participation in the illegitimate and illegal actions of the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq contravenes the relations of good-neighborliness and runs totally counter to the UN Charter, international law and the Iraqi-Turkish border treaty of 1926. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry has also frequently notified the Turkish side that Turkey's problems should not be tackled by depending on the abnormal situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq and dealing with outlawed rebels who are wreaking havoc in the region. We also cautioned our Turkish neighbors against the gravity of double policies and double-dealing. We told them that such policies cannot but cause more difficulties and gravely harm Turkey's interests as well as Iraq's, especially since the Americans and their allies care about nothing but their selfish interests and wicked ambitions in the region. They will neither respect Turkey's nor anybody else's interests.
