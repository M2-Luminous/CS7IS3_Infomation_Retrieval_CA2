The paper says that the remarks are also bound to torpedo the principle of dialogue and negotiations that has been pursued by the parties to the conflict as a way to resolve an issue that has been going on for years. In its editorial today, AL-JUMHURIYAH states the belief that these remarks demonstrate that the Israeli tactics in negotiating and in dealing with the issues at hand will negatively affect the other tracks. The paper goes on to say that the fact that Rabin's statements were made following the laying of the cornerstones of 20 new West Bank settlements raises questions about Israel's intentions and Rabin's credibility. AL-JUMHURIYAH maintains that the policy of playing for time cannot wipe out the rights of the wronged nations that are struggling to wrest back their legitimate rights. The paper concludes its editorial by saying that this policy is a time bomb that will open wide the door of violence.
