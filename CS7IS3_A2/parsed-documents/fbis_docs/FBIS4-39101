Speaking about prospects for bilateral relations during a reception in honor of the high guest, the Uzbek leader stressed that all preconditions for these ties had been created during the past two years. Encouraging South Korean entrepreneurs to step up investments in Uzbekistan's key industries, Karimov described Uzbek cotton, gold, well-organized chemical and metallurgical industries as the best guarantee of their investments. The republic's president also belives that Uzbekistan and South Korea could closely cooperate in international political issues, for example to work for a nuclear- free status for the Central Asian region. In his turn, the South Korean president said he believed in the great future of the newly-independent Uzbek state, which is to play a key role in Central Asia in the near future. Speaking about over 200,000 ethnic Koreans living in Uzbekistan, Kim Young-sam thanked Uzbek people for their warm and hearty attitude towards his compatriots. Were it not for their assistance, the bitter fate of the Koreans deported from the Far East under Josef Stalin's order would have been even more tragic, the South Korean leader noted. He said he did not worry about his fellow-countrymen living in Uzbekistan.
