Inflation, at least according to last month's indicators, is slowly easing. The rate is not only at a nearly complete standstill, but the black market, as an indicator of all the movements in the country, is slowly losing its breath. After the January shock, when a 22-percent inflation came to light, which did not coincide with what had been planned in the Government Stabilization Program (to have an inflation below 10 percent in the first months, around 5 percent in the middle of the year, and around 3 percent at the end), the dose of optimism that matters would start improving returned the figures of the last month's rate of inflation to around 6 percent, which is only 0.8 percent over the plan. According to the announcements of statisticians, the fall of inflation will be even greater in the next months, certainly if some unpredictable disturbances don't occur. Thus, an inflation of only 2.5 percent is foreseen for July, which will fulfill the plans -- to reduce last year's inflation rate of 300 percent to an annual level of 70 percent! If this becomes our reality, we shall finally take a break in the race with inflation that we have felt in the past months of this year, concerning the exchange rate of the domestic currency. The exchange rate, the official one, according to the information we got from the Macedonian National Bank, is real, and the black market exchange rate is on almost the same level. Taking into consideration its stability, as Dusanka Hristova, general manager of the sector for foreign currency system and policy of the Macedonian National Bank said, the Central Bank has not intervened at all in the foreign currency market this year with the aim of maintaining the rate. Since the official and black market rates are close, according to what Hristova said, the number of those purchasing foreign currency on the street is smaller, and on the other hand, the inflow of foreign currency from authorized exchange bureaus has been increased. That is certainly one of the reasons for the fact that the black market is losing its breath, and it influences the decrease of money circulation, according to the planned proportions adjusted to the International Monetary Fund.
