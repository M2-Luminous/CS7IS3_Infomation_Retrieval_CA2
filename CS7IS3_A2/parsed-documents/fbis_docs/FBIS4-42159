Do you believe that even if our economy gets back on track, Greece will be able to play a decisive role in the Balkans at a time when its "fronts" with Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and Albania are sensitive? [Papandreou] You are right. We have problems at the present time. Your question is very correct. Indeed, Greece is a lot more advanced in the economic area than all other Balkan countries--it is a member of the European Union, has a business world with proven capabilities at the international level, and its prospects are indeed bright. However, in the short term we have problems that, to a certain degree, throw shadows on our expectations and hopes. They include the climate of conflict which has developed between Albania and Greece and of course the problem with Skopje. It would have been very good if these did not exist; we would have been absolutely free in our moves to have us, the peoples of the Balkans, all proceed together in a new direction of progress and economic cooperation. Unfortunately, these two thorns indeed exist. [Papadhopoulos] Can we take these issues one at a time in order to see what we could do in each of the two cases? [Papandreou] Regarding the issue of Albania, it is clear that the provocations are intentional. The violations of the human rights of the Greek minority of Albania are very obvious and unacceptable. Our policy, even during the previous PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government, was one of "open doors" toward Albania. We do not have anything to divide. We ask and demand that the handling of the Greek minority be consistent with human rights. [Papadhopoulos] Do you feel that Berisha's regime is trying to kick out the Greeks from their homeland in North Ipirus? [Papandreou] Albania's policy does not seem to be totally autonomous. However, I cannot say with certainty what forces may be using Albania. [Papadhopoulos] Do you mean that these forces may be from outside the Balkans? [Papandreou] Of course, clearly. What is obvious, is that Albania's policy appears to be an effort to kick Albania's Greeks out of their homes, either to Greece or elsewhere in Albania so that there will no longer be any contact by the Greeks of Albania with what we call North Ipirus. [Papadhopoulos] Are there large settlements stretching from northern Albania to the south? [Papandreou] They are exactly settlements. As a result, there is a policy of breaking their ties to a geographic area, if you will, and destroying the identity of the Greeks of Albania. This is unacceptable to us. Of course we are in a position to take measures of our own, but we would prefer not to. We would prefer to follow a policy in accordance with the established world criteria of human rights and stop the attempt at demographic and geographic adulteration of the Greeks. There have been many representations; we have talked to Russia, and the United States, and to Europe, and of course we are in a position to respond both politically and diplomatically. [Papadhopoulos] During your interview with Mega Channel [television], you inferred that we are ready to make other moves as well. Do you mean, for example, closing the border and controlling the traffic flow? Do you mean to control who enters and leaves? Do you intend to heighten control so that fewer illegal immigrants come to Greece? [Papandreou] This is also included. The only thing we did not mention is military action. This is clear. [Papadhopoulos] Let us go on to the issue of Skopje. A few days ago, speaking to members of PASOK's Executive Bureau, you expressed certain optimism over the Skopje issue. [Papandreou] Of course there is the issue of Skopje, which indeed is an obstacle in our acting as a significant factor in the Balkans; and I hope--I believe everyone hopes--that this wound will heal. Yes, I expressed optimism, but I do not want to get into details because the dialogue with [UN Special Envoy Cyrus] Vance and [U.S. Special Presidential Envoy Matthew] Nimetz continues. I would say that there has been a U.S. contribution to this dialogue, but I can not make predictions and nor do I want to get into details. I should not. However I have hopes, let us put it like that, that the problem will be overcome in a short time. [Papadhopoulos] Does this mean that you believe it can happen even before [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's elections in October? Before the end of this year? [Papandreou] I do not rule it out. However, I do not want to imply a climate of optimism, euphoria, that the problem has been solved. There is a problem and it still remains; and of course our positions are very well known; there is no need to repeat them. At this point I should say that the issue of Skopje had been buried when we took over. There were international recognitions of it every day under the name FYROM [as published in English] or "Republic of Macedonia." We simply waited until the recognitions, the catalogue, ended. However, we overturned this completely with our action and the implementation of the embargo. I think it was a critical decision. Of course, I knew the reaction it would cause. When one fights for his national interests, it is strange to see that the solidarity he believed he would find from his partners and allies does not come automatically. [Papadhopoulos] During the last couple of days we have seen a new attempt by Turkey to trump up tension artificially with Greece. They even claim that we train Kurds; and there are some in the United States who take these things seriously. [Papandreou] You know that what they say--that we train Kurds--is very dangerous. When I visited Washington, I raised this issue during our discussion at the negotiating table. I raised the issue that Turkey continuously sends signals that Kurds are being trained in Greece for terrorist actions against Turkey. I want to say it now: Greece has a very clear position on this. There are two sides to this coin: Human rights and terrorism. We support the rights and the human rights of a minority, of the Kurds. But we condemn and protest against terrorism as a means of solving the problem they face. And in any case, there is nothing in Greece that would even prompt the suspicion that we have any such contact with the Kurds who live as free citizens in Greece. I raised the issue myself. Because it is one of Turkey's techniques to describe Greece as a country that helps terrorists, gives cover to terrorists, to back us into a corner with regard with our international public relations. What is Turkey trying to justify by raising these questions regarding our role? This is what we do not know yet. Consequently, it is clear that we should be very careful, very decisive, not only to deny but also protest this accusation by Turkey, which is an intentional move in preparation for something. What it is I do not know. [passage omitted]
