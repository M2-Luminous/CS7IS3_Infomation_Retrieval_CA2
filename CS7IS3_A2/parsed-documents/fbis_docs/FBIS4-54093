Present at the meeting were Pak Song-chol, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and vice-president; Choe Kwang, member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and chief of the general staff of the Korean People's Army; and other party and government officials. Kang Sok-sung, member of the C.C., the WPK and director of the Party History Institute of the Party Central Committee, delivered a report. He said the battle, which recorded a shining page in the Korean people's anti-Japanese national liberation struggle, was a historic operation of advance into the homeland which was organized under an outstanding plan of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song to lead to a constant upsurge the Korean revolution as a whole with the anti- Japanese armed struggle in its centre, thus promoting the cause of national liberation, and which was waged under his wise guidance. He quoted President Kim Il-song as saying: "...The Musan area battle was, indeed, a significant one which greatly helped further inspire the people in the homeland with the spirit of the anti-Japanese struggle and lead the revolutionary movement to a higher tide." The reporter said: Grave difficulties were created before the Korean revolution in the period around the Musan area battle, with the Japanese imperialists intensifying the reactionary offensive as never before. In those days President Kim Il-song called a meeting at Beidadingzi in April 1939 and indicated the policy of dealing one strike after another at the Japanese imperialist aggressors through a vigorous counter-offensive and advancing into the homeland again. Under this policy, the great leader advanced into the homeland across the Amnok River, leading the main unit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) on May 18, 1939. The members of the KPRA including Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an indomitable communist revolutionary fighter, conducted political propaganda in various forms, renewing their firm determination to bring earlier the day of national liberation. President Kim Il-song made a historic speech "Let Us Rise Up Vigorously in the Anti-Japanese Struggle To Hasten the Liberation of the Homeland" before Sinsadong people. In his speech, he clarified the character and mission of the KPRA and said that the entire nation must unite closely as one on the anti-Japanese front, turn out courageously in the sacred war against Japanese imperialism and actively support the KPRA. Upset by the advance of the KPRA into the Musan area, the Japanese imperialists mobilized a large force and desperately chased the unit. Seeing through the enemy's intention, the great leader, with a superb operation of allurement and ambush, wiped out at one stroke the enemy attempting to "encircle and annihilate" the KPRA on the Taehongdan plain on May 23, thus concluding the historic operation of advance into the Musan area with a brilliant victory. In his report, Kang Sok-sung said "the advance of the KPRA into the homeland and the historic victory in the Musan area battle were a brilliant fruition of the chuche-based military idea and commanding art of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song, an ever- victorious iron-willed brilliant commander and great military strategist, and a historic event which led the Korean revolution as a whole centering on the anti-Japanese armed struggle to a constant upswing under the banner of chuche."
