FR940412-2-00028 FR940412-2-00016 Department of the Air Force Supplemental Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton Air Force Base (AFB), CA On March 30, 1994, the Air Force signed the Supplemental ROD for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB. The decisions included in this Supplemental ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information contained in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 4, 1993. Norton AFB will close on March 31, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act (BCRA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. This Supplemental ROD documents certain disposal decisions which this office previously deferred, and modifies certain previous decisions made in the December 15, 1993, Partial ROD supplemented on January 14, 1994. The decisions in this document, coupled with those in the previous ROD, complete the disposal decisions for Norton AFB. The decision conveyed by the Partial ROD was to dispose of Norton AFB in a manner that enabled the development of a regional airport with the capacity for commercial and industrial development. This allowed for the central theme of the proposed future land use plans discussed in the FEIS to be fully implemented. The environmental findings and mitigation measures contained in the initial ROD remain fully applicable. Approximately 109 acres within three (3) noncontiguous parcels are retained within the Department of Defense for continued military use. This Supplemental ROD contains minor boundary realignments of some parcels previously addressed. Two (2) parcels comprising approximately 24.9 acres were declared access and are reserved for transfer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. In total, approximately 1,942 acres are surplus to the needs of he Federal Government. The base has been divided into twenty-four (24) parcels of land, roadways and utilities. Five (5) airfield parcels were previously conveyed for public benefit (airport purposes), and three (3) parcels were previously made available for negotiated sale to eligible public bodies or public sale. Two (2) parcels will be assigned to the Secretary of the Interior for further disposal as a public benefit conveyance for recreation purposes, two (2) parcels will be assigned to the Department of Education for further disposal as a public benefit conveyance for health purposes, and two (2) parcels will be assigned to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for further disposal as a public benefit conveyance for homeless assistance. Eight (8) parcels will be conveyed by negotiated sale. The road network is an integral part of all parcels. Primary roads may be conveyed by negotiated sale to an eligible public body. Secondary roadways that fall within a parcel completely will be included as part of the parcel. The utility systems are totally integrated systems, prohibiting their separation among the various parcels. Therefore, disposal of the utility systems will include conditions under which the recipients must provide service to all parcels. Utility easements will be granted as appropriate. The gas and electric systems with appropriate easements for maintenance and repair will be conveyed through negotiated sale to utility purveyors, or eligible public bodies. Water and wastewater are required to support redevelopment efforts and are contingent on the recipient continuing to provide the necessary service to all parcels. Water and wastewater systems will be assigned to HHS contingent upon formal request for conveyance for use in the protection of public health. The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local statutes and regulations, and all reasonable and practical efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public and environment. Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John E.B. Smith or Ms. De Carlo Ciccel at (703) 696&hyph;5534. Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/SP, 1700 North Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809. Patsy J. Conner, Air Force Federal Register Liaison Officer.
