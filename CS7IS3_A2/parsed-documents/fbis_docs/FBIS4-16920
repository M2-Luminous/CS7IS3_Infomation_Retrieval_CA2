Interfax was informed by the opposition head quarters that the movements concerned discussed how they might form one body to represent both political parties and public and national movements in Chechnya opposed to Dudayev's policies. The stabilization of the situation inside the republic was also discussed. One option for dialogue with Russia was that proposed by Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray. That involved a presidential instruction stating, among other things, that the Russian government had been charged with "holding consultations with representatives of state power and of all political movements in the Chechen Republic" to find a way out of the social and political tension which had arisen. Asked by Interfax why the meeting had taken place in Moscow, one opposition representative replied: "Not all opposition leaders are able to travel to Chechnya because they are being literally hunted down there."
