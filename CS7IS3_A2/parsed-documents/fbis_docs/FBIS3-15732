In his interview with Interfax Wednesday Movladiy Udugov declared that Shakhray is directly responsible for the destabilization of the situation in the North Caucuses and the unsettledness of Russian- Chechen relations. "We still hope that such politicians as Sergey Filatov or Viktor Chernomyrdin (leader of presidential administration and Russian premier -- INTERFAX) will take the negotiating process under their control. In an adverse situation, if Russian nationalities minister interferes into the negotiations they will inevitably windup in a dead alley," said Udugov. Udugov expressed the opinion that on the issue of Chechnya's sovereignty (Chechnya insists on its official recognition) the greatest disagreement will arise at the upcoming negotiations in Moscow. In Udugov's opinion, it would be expedient to first discuss those issues which are not so controversial and then to start discussing the issue of Chechnya's independence. "The Chechen party was always ready for negotiations with Russia at any level and on any issue and we welcome the statement of the head of the presidential administration Sergey Filatov on the necessity to normalize relations with Chechnya," said Udugov.
