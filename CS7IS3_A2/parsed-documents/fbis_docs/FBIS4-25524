This is a remark very easy to understand which was made by Hainan Governor Ruan Chongwu when talking about how government functions should be transformed in the course of establishing a socialist market economy. Some explorations have been made in theory and practice according to the above idea. These reporters interviewed him in Haikou a few days ago in order to know what actually happened. [Reporter] What do you think of the above simple and figurative expression concerning the transformation of government functions? [Ruan Chongwu] Before answering this question, I should like to explain the following view first: The readjustment of interests is an issue that cannot be evaded in carrying out reform. Generally speaking, our reform is in the interests of the state, nation, and people. Meanwhile, reform is also a process in which the interest pattern is repeatedly readjusted. In the course of specific readjustments during a certain period, four circumstances--gaining a lot, gaining a little, gaining nothing, and gaining less--may occur. Interest relationships will, to a certain extent, affect people's attitude toward reform. A great majority of the people in our country have benefited from reform, which is also very obvious in Hainan. Since the founding of the province six years ago, more than 200 enterprises directly under the provincial authority have increased their vitality, as most of them have transformed operational mechanisms and adapted themselves to the market. A great majority of the masses have also enhanced their living standards. However, in a certain stage of the reform process, some enterprises may suffer losses and the income of their staff and workers may be affected. This situation calls for our government to exercise the role of leader and guide and take care to exert influence on the main bodies of social behavior so that the masses will, in light of the overall and long-term interests, adopt a correct attitude toward the current difficulty, continue to participate in reform enthusiastically, and unite as one to strive for a magnificent future. [Reporter] What has the view that you just talked about to do with the transformation of government functions? [Ruan] They are quite closely related. In the course of moving from a planned economy to a market economy, fundamental changes have taken place in the mode of allocating social resources. Human, financial, material, and other resources which were previously distributed by government planning are gradually changed to be primarily allocated by the market. With regard to government departments, their previous authority in target assignment, examination, and approval have now been withdrawn, or the procedures have been changed. If the minds of government personnel are still confined in outmoded conventions, they will feel "frustrated." Moreover, they will even feel that their interests have been damaged because they have lost certain real power which they possessed in the past. Though the great majority of our government personnel are good, if this issue is not properly resolved, some of them will consciously or unconsciously take a passive attitude toward reform measures. In the meantime, the masses will find it difficult to approach government personnel for handling affairs as they are afraid of seeing the unpleasant countenance of the personnel. If things go on like this, the administrative efficiency and reputation of the government, being the leader and booster of reform, will be adversely affected, and the smooth progress of reform as a whole will certainly be affected too. [Reporter] Is it for the purpose of enhancing government personnel's reform consciousness that you have clearly put forth this issue? [Ruan] Yes. Such consciousness is chiefly manifested in the following two aspects: On one hand, every government worker must more consciously treat and handle the issue in light of the overall interests of reform. Our people's government has the obligation to serve the people wholeheartedly, so it and its personnel have no longer any interests of their own to consider except for those of the state and the people. Hence, every worker should seek his own development in serving the people. On the other hand, government workers should perform their work more consciously, vigorously, and in a clear-cut manner in their specific actions of transforming government functions. "Small government, big society" is an important experience we have gained. If government organs are excessively big, not only do we have to increase administrative expenditure, but many personnel have to "look for something to do." In this way, they will take up this and check up that, only disturbing people and making trouble for enterprises. We have carried out reform in this area. In the future, we will divert some of our personnel to work in enterprises or in the service sector. "Reducing the number of overseers but increasing the number of sanitary inspectors" is our general idea. Previously, government departments were in charge of a good many links in examination and approval, so they were regarded as "overseers." What the market economy needs most, however, are not overseers, but those exercising standardized management and supervision. Hence, they are vividly likened to "sanitary inspectors." More overseers mean more expenses, which not only increase the cost of handling affairs, but reduce work efficiency. In addition, the practice also provides opportunities of "seeking personal gain by abuse of power" to a few personnel who lack strict self-discipline. Since last year, our work to transform government functions has started from this. For example, according to the principle of "relaxing the procedures of examination and approval while tightening management work" under the new enterprise registration system which we have practiced for a year, more than 100 units in charge of examination and approval have been abolished, and only 24 are licensed to carry on the work. This action has been well received, and, in a certain sense, it has removed the cause of corruption in the area of structure. Hainan's reform of tax collection and control system and labor power employment system have been carried out in line with this idea. [Reporter] "Reducing the number of overseers" mainly refers to changing the economic management method of the planned economy, then does "increasing the number of sanitary inspectors" mainly refer to how government work can be better suited to the development of a market economy? [Ruan] Yes, you may take it this way. Under a market economy, both the buyer and seller determine their own actions in light of gaining benefit to the maximum. The most fundamental requirement of the market economy is: Any enterprise and individual can freely enter or exit the market, and commodities can circulate without restriction. Therefore, the creation of a fine environment for free circulation in the commodity, service, and factor markets is a matter that the government should consider as top priority. In the past, there were quite a few regulations restricting free entry, exit, and circulation of commodities, and production factors which should be considerably simplified now. For example, there were many check-points on the roads that had fostered the malpractice of levying charges arbitrarily. In Hainan this year, the practice of collecting charges such as highway maintenance fees and others by various departments has been changed to a unified levy of "fuel sub- charge" by the petroleum retail sales department, and various check-points on the roads have been totally abolished, thereby creating the condition for free commodity circulation. Of course, some concrete measures have yet to be improved. Another example is that if property rights are unable to circulate, it is very difficult to achieve the objective of optimum allocation of resources. For this reason, we have started to standardize transaction behavior in this field to create conditions for property rights transactions. As regards the labor force market, a job search agency has been set up so that labor force markets in the province have been initially centralized, which has played a remarkable role in the rational flow of labor force in the province. While resolving this issue, we should energetically carry out housing reform and social insurance system reform to remove anxieties arising from the flow of laborers. In short, we should create a fine market environment with the authority of the government and its fair service in a bid to fully mobilize the initiative of various social sectors and give impetus to the development in Hainan. [Reporter] Now we roughly understand the meaning of your remark regarding "overseers" and "sanitary inspectors." It is associated with the idea of strolling around a park, which people are quite familiar with. The manager of a park is capable not because he sets up many gates to collect tickets, but because he puts in a lot of efforts to make the park very clean and beautiful so that people can enjoy their stroll there with pleasure. However, a market is not a park after all, and it is not omnipotent either. In the meantime, market mechanisms do not take effect spontaneously by solely depending on the market itself, because the macroeconomic regulation and control of the government should also be an essential component of a market economy. What do you think the government should do in this area? [Ruan] Under a market economy, government's macroeconomic regulation and control really play an important part. In my opinion, the government should be adept at concretely exercising the functions of macroeconomic regulation and control through the following eight means--laws, regulations, policies, planning, coordination, balancing, intervention, and imposition of sanctions. With regard to the major projects which have social benefit but lack good direct economic results, the government must see to it that they are properly organized and brought into execution. What is more, the government must seriously manage rare resources and resources that cannot be regenerated, guard against monopoly, maintain fair competition and market order, stress efficiency while giving consideration to fairness; ensure rational distribution, maintain good social order, intensify ideological education, step up the building of spiritual civilization, and encourage honesty while combating corruption. [Reporter] Judging from your above remark, it seems to me that the government's duties have increased rather than decreased, and its responsibility has become heavier rather than lighter. [Ruan] Yes, we will continue to perform our work in line with this idea. [Reporter] We hope that you will make even greater progress in your work. Thank you for the interview.
