The situation, however, is not similar to the morning of August 2, 1990, he added. "Iraqi troops in the south (of Iraq) are posing a continuous threat to Kuwait. These troops could begin moving any moment and we are closely watching its movements and are completely ready to repulse any attack on Kuwait. These troops are capable of doing something but we are very alert," Shaykh 'Ali told a press conference. The meeting took place Wednesday, was delayed for half an hour as the Minister was meeting with ambassadors of U.S. UK. and France who came to congratulate him for the Assembly's approval of the defense budget and discuss other issues. The Minister accused Iraq of attempting to violate the Kuwaiti borders. "Firing across the borders against our troops was still taking place," affirmed the minister. He declared that Kuwait has completed digging the security trench on the borders with Iraq. leaving "four gates" as demanded by the United Nations. He launched a scathing attack on those who have been criticising and opposing Kuwait's arms procurement. "Those have been acting out of their self interests," asserted the Minister who repeatedly came under fire in the National Assembly for allegedly squandering public funds to buy hundreds of millions worth of unnecessary arms. MPs alleged wide-ranging misuse of funds and kickbacks. A parliamentary committee is looking into such allegations. Shaykh 'Ali said he could have easily gotten the KD3.5 billion [Kuwait dinars] defense budget through, had he approved "some personal favours for a number of MPs. The Minister said that the latest Iraqi military moves in the south are not directed against Kuwait but could be any time. "Although these moves are not directed against Kuwait, it does not mean Kuwait is safe of Iraqi regime's plots, Iraq is still keeping relatively large forces. So, I may tell you now it's safe and there is nothing, and Iraqi troops start moving towards us the next morning", he said. [sentence as published] "Iraqi troops stationed in the south are capable of doing something and the extent of this "thing" can be determined only after those troops start moving". The Kuwaiti Defense Minister said Iraqi troops have been in the south for over a year now. "They are large troops and it's natural that we, and our allies, have been closely monitoring them round the clock," he said and added. "So far we have not seen a direct threat but the presence of such large number of troops and machinery is posing a certain threat to Kuwait". Shaykh 'Ali said Iraqi troops have not made any aggressive moves so far as its movements have been confined to south of Iraq. He added that defense pacts Kuwait signed with four big powers include clauses on how to "organise and regulate repulsing an external attack on Kuwait." Under those agreements, Kuwaiti armed forces carried out about 100 military excercises with the Coalition countries and Russia. "These exercises have been intended at applying defensive plans" on how to defend the country. He stressed that the position at present is not similar to what it was on August 2, 1990, when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait. "But the presence of regular Iraqi army in the south for training and crushing the uprising in southern Iraq, is a threat to the country. These troops could receive orders to move further south, towards Kuwait," he said. "The way Iraqi troops are scattered now does not pose an immediate threat on Kuwait but this assumption could change. This could be true for now, but it could reverse 180 degrees just one hour after this meeting. The decision is surely with Saddam Husayn," asserted the minister. About the credibility of reports saying that Kuwait and the coalition countries have made a deal to carry out a military operation to rescue Kuwaiti POWs in Iraq, the minister said no deal has been signed with him personally. But he affirmed that all government bodies have been working very hard to achieve this target. "The Kuwaiti National Committeee for POWs has made a very important progress to put international pressure on Iraq to release the POWs. But whether or not Iraq would respond, the answer is surely with Saddam Husayn," he insisted. He praised the decision taken by the UN Security Council members to continue sanctions against Iraqi regime. He said this shows these countries are convinced not to ease or lift sanctions against Iraqi regime. He said this shows these countries are convinced not to ease or lift sanction unless Iraq complied with all UN resolutions, especially those relating to border demarcation, respect of human rights and release of POWs and missing. "Until now, things look promising and satisfactory for us." Shaykh 'Ali asserted that Kuwaiti post-liberation arms procurement has been based on scientific foundations and thorough evaluation and study. "Most of the defense ministry critics are inexperienced and their criticism lacked substance and facts", he said. Critics, mostly from the National Assembly, have based their opposition on the assumption that the KD3.5 billion budget was going to be used immediately. People should know it's for 12 years. He also denied allegations that half of the budget has already been spent. The Defense Minister said that Kuwait has accepted a U.S. defense study on formulating a defense strategy in Kuwait. The U.S. study was picked up by top Kuwaiti military commanders in preference to studies submitted by Britain and France. "We explained to our friends in the three countries our position and requested a defense strategy to be suitable to us. A highly qualified Kuwaiti military team found that the U.S. study was the most appropriate. The strategy took into consideration Kuwait's financial and human resources," he said. The amounts allocated also involve expenses for training. After the liberation, as many as 14,000 Kuwaiti military personnel have undergone training courses mainly how to handle the advanced weapons. Shaykh 'Ali insisted that the Ministry of Defense cannot disclose all defense information because "most of it is classified." He challenged those who criticise the military establishment to prove their allegations. "These very same people have criticised the purchase of the Warrior APCs from UK after about 90 officers from the Army decided it was the best for Kuwait after conducting on spot examinations on the vehicle. Commander of the land troops, Brigadier Salim Mas'ud recommended the APC and he is the one who is going to use in fighting". The Minister urged MPs to "isolate Kuwait's national interests from that of their own private interests. Some are insisting on us to buy certain arms because of vested interests." He defended the military establishments in regard to allegations of wide-spread kickbacks and illegal commissions. "This has become an exhausted issue that has no sympathy from the public. They claim to be having the evidence and we say they can send it to the prosecution. In fact, they are still demanding information from us," stressed the minister in reference to the Assembly's fact-finding panel. He revealed that MP Mubarak al-Duwaylah, one of the most outspoken critics of the ministry, has asked him to sack the chief of staff and undersecretary of the ministry because "they are thieves" as al-Duwaylah stressed. The minister refused. He also said that most of the Kuwaiti arms repatriated from Iraq have been repaired and used. On the Bedouns, stateless Arabs, the minister said that all those who fought to defend Kuwait should be considered Kuwaitis even if those happen to be Iraqis. He stressed such persons will not be dismissed from the Kuwaiti armed forces. Bedouns in the army are granted Kuwaiti passports to travel to certain countries. The current Peninsula Shield troops will be the nucleus for the proposed 100,000-strong Gulf Army. The troops will have three exercises by next year. Shaykh 'Ali also said the ministry will shortly submit a new law for conscription which may include increasing the duration for conscripts. Commenting on reports speculating a cabinet reshuffle, the minister said there has been some "thinking" about improving the whole administration including the cabinet. Soon after that the thinking changed and it was thought it would be better to leave the Cabinet as it is now. "But, the final decision is with the Crown Prince and Prime Minister", he stressed. Shaykh 'Ali announced that the Kuwaiti troops in Somalia have started pulling out despite the fact that the UN wants them to stay. The pull out of Kuwaiti troops coincides with pulling other troops.
