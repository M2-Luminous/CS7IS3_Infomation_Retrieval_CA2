After more than ten years' development, railway enterprises in the country have developed their business from the mere railway industry to a dozen of industries including commerce, trade, tourism, food and catering, storage and construction. The diversified business has not only offered an economic backing to the construction and development of railways in the country, but also streamlined staff and workers in the railway sector, creating relaxed conditions for the reform of railway enterprises. The diversified business of railway enterprises started in 1984 and by the end of last year, there were over 7,000 enterprises engaging in diversified business with employment of more than 380,000. Business income earned by them in 1993 made up nearly half of the total earned from railway shipment while their profits surpassed that from railway shipment. According to statistics, the diversified business income between 1986 and 1993 was RMB [renminbi] 75.7 billion and some 218,000 staff and workers originally engaging in railway shipment had been transferred to enterprises specializing in other businesses. The minister said that the goal set for the railway sector's diversified business in the next 6 years was to increase its business income and sales value as well as profits all by four times and streamline another hundreds of thousands of staff and workers from shipment enterprises to diversified business ones.
