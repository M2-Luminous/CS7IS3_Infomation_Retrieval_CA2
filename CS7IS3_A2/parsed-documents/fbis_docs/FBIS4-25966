A report in this newspaper today on Suzhou's good public security is one of those experiences -- one that is worth pondering by purposeful people. Public security is a widely discussed issue -- an issue that the masses are concerned about and the party and government have attached importance to. Many localities have taken comprehensive measures to manage public security and have achieved noticeable results. But, situations in other localities have not been very good -- leaders in these localities still lack a sense of urgency, have not addressed themselves to improving local public security, have not been persistent in doing the work, or have not considered the work to be important. Two kinds of one-sidedness in perceiving the issue are at work: "Poor public security is due to a backward economy. Public security will automatically improve once the economy is developed." People with this kind of thinking do not do things with both hands -- they use one hand while the other is idle. "Reform and opening up has invited an invasion by foreign cultures and many people have led a decayed life-style, therefore, social ills are inevitable. The profit-oriented market economic system has aroused people's greed, so committing offenses is beyond prevention." The conclusion from this theory is that nothing can be done about the problem. Hence, these people can never be taught to use the other hand. The Suzhou experience has emerged at the right time. Based on the facts, it is convincing criticism against the two aforementioned erroneous views. Maybe a backward economy truly has adverse effects on improving public security, but the theory that once the economy is developed public security will automatically improve is completely absurd. Good public security requires good management. Without good management, how can one expect good public security? Poor public security means a poor investment climate. With a poor investment climate, how can we expect the economy to develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner? If Suzhou followed this line, it would not be the "paradise" that it is today. It would have been a paradise for lawless elements. The second view is half correct, but the conclusion is completely wrong. I say it is half correct because it does touch on the new developments and problems in current public security work, which are much more complicated and difficult than before. But, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said as early as five years ago: "Reform and opening up will inevitably bring in some bad influences from the West -- we have never underestimated this." It is just for this reason that we need to particularly emphasize the need to grip tightly with two hands -- not any other way. Of course, we need a correct way to be tough -- that is, we need to take measures aimed at specific problems, think of new ways to deal with problems, set new standards, and develop new mechanisms. Suzhou has gained experience in these matters, which is worth studying by other localities. As long as leaders at all levels have a good understanding of their political responsibility, straighten out their ideological thinking, and enlist the help of the broad masses, they will be completely able to ensure good public security and maintain social peace by taking comprehensive management measures.
