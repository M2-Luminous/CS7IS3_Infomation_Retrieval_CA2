The MoD [Ministry of Defense] wants to replace the RAF's [Royal Air Force] ageing fleet of C130 Hercules transport aircraft and is looking favourably at an American option, an updated version of the C130J plane developed by Lockheed. However, the Ministry is under increasing pressure to re-examine a European alternative, the Future Large Aircraft. It is claimed that the plane, still on the drawingboard, will be able to carry twice as much tonnage per day as the Hercules. Yesterday the British firms involved in the seven-nation European aircraft accused the Ministry of unfair conduct by failing to subject the Hercules replacement programme to proper competition. The Government withdrew from the Future Large Aircraft project in 1989 and is considering two options: refurbishing the present Hercules fleet or replacing 30 of the RAF's C130 aircraft with the updated C130J model. Yesterday the principal British companies involved in the European project. The British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and Short Brothers, claimed that 7,500 jobs would be at stake if the Defence Ministry went for the American option. British Aerospace factories at Prestwick in Scotland and Filton in Bristol could be threatened. The Hercules replacement programme looks set to become the latest project to run into arguments over jobs and the relative merits of American and European aerospace technology. In 1986 it was decided to abandon the British-designed Nimrod airborne early warning aircraft after more than 900 million pounds had been spent, in favour of American AWACs. Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, said it was time the MoD looked more closely at the strategic implications of procurement policy. "This is too big a decision to be left to RAF and the procurement executive," he said. There was also concern that the Treasury would be against developing a new transport aircraft when there was an updated Hercules available to buy off the shelf. Yesterday the British companies said it would be more economic in the long term to give some of the present Hercules planes "minimum refurbishment" and stat replacing the whole fleet with the future Large Aircraft from 2002. Mr Evans said that the Future Large Aircraft was being designed as a tactical long-rang transport plane to meet the requirement of the 21st century and Britain could not afford to lose the opportunity of being involved in the programme. He predicted that world-wide sales of about 700 of the aircraft would earn Britain 12.8 billion pounds with a per cent stake in the overall programme. The countries currently committed to the Future Large Aircraft Programme are France, German, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. Although Britain withdrew, British Aerospace and other companies are still involved. British Aerospace said the Future Large Aircraft would be able to carry 20 per cent more types of equipment than the Hercules, including the Warrior armoured vehicle, the multiple launch rocket system, the FG70 155 millimeter gun and Chinook helicopter.
