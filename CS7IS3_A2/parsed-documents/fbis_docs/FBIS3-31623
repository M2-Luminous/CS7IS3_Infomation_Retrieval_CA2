Journalists sometimes ask me about the situation in these countries, and I assume from their questions that they are seeking analogies with the West. The history of Western capitalism is well known. Many volumes have been written on the subject, describing the path from feudalism to the first accumulation of capital. But not so much has been written describing the path from a socialist to a free-market economy, and on how to solve social problems along the way. This is a little-known topic. And yet we are dealing with this topic every day, we are adding chapters to this book every single day by means of our practical decisions, solutions, actions, and our society's reaction. This should be borne in mind by those who wish to understand our situation and avoid stereotypes. I would like to draw your attention to three matters. The first one is the result of the latest parliamentary elections in Poland, where the present government was formed by traditional parties which, though changed, have their roots in the previous system. It is very important to know that this choice, made by the majority of society, does not mean that the population voted for a return to communism. It merely means that society voted for the best possible path, permitting a linking of the reforms to sensitivity for human affairs and expectations. This was a politically mature choice. I think the new government's primary characteristic is that it is continuing the reforms. It has to do so. There is no other way for Poland, a country that has opted for democracy and democratic institutions, an efficient economy, and participation in European integration and the European security system. I think that these democratic elections (in Poland) were a clear sign that we are pursuing this path and that we are more mature and further ahead in this march than some of our critics make out. The Polish people approve of the main paths of the reforms and the changes that have occurred over the past five years. But society still needs to make sacrifices. That remains a key issue. The problem has to be viewed from three angles -- political, economic, and perhaps the most important one, psychological. From a political angle, the main problem is stability. This is essential for the political reforms, and we have a good chance of maintaining this stability over the next four years. That provides us with enough time to implement essential though sometimes unpopular decisions. I think the democratic system in Poland has to be steadily developed, and the elections have given us the chance to do so. The economic sphere contains greater complications. The problem here is finding a compromise between the need to expand the economy and society's expectations, in order to avoid frustration and disenchantment. After many long debates, we have reached the conclusion that right now the government's chief task should be to protect the positive trends that have appeared in the economy. This is not in pursuance of some social democratic principle, but the consequence of a pragmatic approach toward the economy. This is necessary if we are to concern ourselves with the future of the economy. So first of all it is necessary to maintain such positive trends as the increase in the GNP, and find the money with which to meet society's expectations half way and solve social problems. This is a question of social policy, for we cannot accept such high unemployment and the heavy, sometimes, tragic, living conditions that have become the lot of millions of Poles. In this sphere we must proceed gradually, because a rapid change in the situation is impossible. From the political point of view, this is a basic problem for the Polish left wing, i.e. for the social democrats, who comprise the largest party in the ruling coalition. Our stance is very clear -- the first priority is economic development, and we are prepared to use all available means to protect the economic growth and raise the output of Polish industry. Of course, our economic program must contain such basic issues as social security and general expenditures on social benefits. In every single postcommunist country, these problems are not just economic, but also political, and they occupy a prominent position in domestic policy. I think we have to be more energetic in our social policy, especially in combating unemployment, and I hope we will succeed in finding a fair compromise between the exigencies of economic development and the expectations of society over the next four years, which is when the present coalition will be still in power. The psychological aspect of the reforms is perhaps the most important one. Not just in Poland, but also in Russia and other East European countries, there is a problem of how to convert people's thoughts about the future into reality following these great revolutionary, or, if you prefer, evolutionary changes. Social enthusiasm and patience used to be an important factor. Today, there is virtually no enthusiasm left, and society's patience has run out. And the main problem is compelling people to take an active role in the changes. I do not think these issues are being correctly resolved in our countries. The problem is to encourage Poles to take an active part in democratic institutions, political structures at all levels, trade unions, and the country's economic life. A very important and positive fact is that literally thousands of people are taking an active part in privatization, stock exchange operations, and the acquisition and disposal of shares. This is essential if we want to have a society that is energetic and geared to a free market. Of course, Poland had and still has an advantage over its neighbors inasmuch as under the previous system it maintained a small but neverthleless real private sector in the economy. The main task at present is to convince people that further reforms possess a purpose and genuine justification, and that these further reforms are not being pursued just for the hell of it, nor have they been suggested by American advisers, the IMF, or our friends in Davos here. The reforms are of fundamental importance for every Polish family, because thanks to them we can proceed ahead to a better life. It is of vital importance that everyone understands this, and we must find good arguments to channel our educated society's energy potential into pursuing the reforms. The chief danger to the reforms in Poland, and probably in other central and East European countries, is not the coming into power of a left wing or right wing party, but society's frustration and disenchantment, which could spoil the progress of the reforms. We must eliminate this danger, and I think that in Poland we are managing to do so.
