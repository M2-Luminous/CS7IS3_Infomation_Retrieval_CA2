FR940513-0-00139 FR940513-0-00034 c. Light output in lumens. The terms ``lumens,'' ``lumen output,'' or ``lumen rating'' refer to a lamp product's light output. 74 This information is designed to permit the purchaser to determine whether a given lamp will provide sufficient light to meet the purchaser's requirements and to compare the relative light output of competing lamp products. Some retail purchasers may generally refer to this concept as ``brightness,'' but this term actually means something different from light output, according to accepted industry definitions. 75 In the NPR, the Commission proposed requiring that packaging disclose lumens (whether identified by that term, or another such as ``light output''). There was agreement among the participants in the proceeding that light output in lumens should be disclosed. 74 Under EPCA, the term ``lumen output'' means ``total luminous flux (power) of a lamp in lumens, as measured in accordance with applicable IES standards as determined by the Secretary [of DOE].'' 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(Q) (West Supp. 1993). For incandescent lamps, the Light Bulb Rule already requires that light output be disclosed in lumens. 75 Brightness is measured in candelas and means the intensity of the light, whereas light output, which is measured in lumens, means amount of flow of light. i. Emphasis on light output in disclosures. Although light output is the primary descriptor of whether a specific lamp will provide the necessary lighting to meet a particular need, it appears that residential purchasers, at least, often purchase lamps based on the product's rated wattage. 76 For these purchasers, different wattages are associated with various lighting needs. There are lamp products with substantially different wattage ratings, however, that can provide almost the same light output in lumens. Stated another way, by choosing lamps on the basis of light output, consumers could meet their lighting needs and use less energy by selecting a lamp of a lower wattage. 77 76 See Part IV.C.1.b, above. 77 For example, a general service incandescent halogen lamp can provide a greater light output in lumens than a standard general service incandescent lamp of the same wattage rating. In addition, a compact fluorescent lamp can provide the same or greater light output in lumens than a general service incandescent halogen lamp at a significantly lower wattage rating. Four comments agreed that a key element in getting consumers to purchase more energy efficient lamps is to encourage them to shop for light output in lumens, rather than for energy usage in watts, as they currently are more accustomed to do. 78 Several comments favored furthering this objective by making the disclosure of light output (in lumens) as prominent as or more prominent than the wattage disclosure on current packaging. 79 Some comments also suggested that, because residential consumers are often unfamiliar with the term ``lumen,'' the disclosure of lumens should be accompanied by a descriptive phrase that would be more familiar, such as ``light output'' or ``brightness.'' 80 There was, however, information presented at the Workshop indicating that lumens is not an unfamiliar concept to many consumers, even though wattage may be a more significant factor in making purchase decisions. 81 78 Angelo, G&hyph;1, 2, (Tr.), 182&hyph;183; Osram, G&hyph;4, 2; Philips, G&hyph;5, 2&hyph;3; GE, G&hyph;2, 7, (Tr.), 181&hyph;182. See Part IV.C.1.b, above. 79 Angelo (Tr.), 182&hyph;183 (``make lumens more prominent''); GE, G&hyph;2 (Ans.), 1 (``prominent''); Philips, G&hyph;5, 1&hyph;2 (``at least 50% that of the wattage''); MO DNR, GG&hyph;10, 3 (``more prominently''); WA SEO, GG&hyph;18, 1&hyph;2 (``of equal size and prominence''). But see GE (Tr.) 181&hyph;182 (the change in prominence should be gradual). 80 GE, G&hyph;2, (Ans.), 9 (``brightness (lumens)''); Philips, G&hyph;5, 2&hyph;3 (``light output''); ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 3 (``light output: XX Lumens''); MO DNR, GG&hyph;10, 3 (``brightness (lumens)''). But see OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 3 (``lumen disclosure should be in lumens, not ``brightness'' or ``light output''). 81 According to research conducted by Conway/Milliken & Associates for GE in July 1992, 55% of all consumers understand the meaning of lumens, even though they may purchase based on wattage. GE (Tr.), 109&hyph;10. See GE (Supp.), G&hyph;9, 1, Ex. A. But see Angelo (Tr.), 134&hyph;35 (disagrees and thinks that most consumers do not know watts are a measurement of energy as opposed to a measurement of light, because, up until now, they have purchased on the basis of watts). The Commission agrees that the labeling rules should assist purchasers in shopping for lamps on the basis of light output in lumens rather than watts. Because competing lamp products may provide the same lumen output at varying wattage ratings, purchasers can reduce their energy costs for lighting by purchasing lamp products that provide the lumens they need at the lowest wattage ratings. Current packaging generally highlights wattage, and purchasers may be accustomed to selecting lamp products based on wattage instead of lumens ( e.g. , they simply replace a burned out 100 watt lamp with a new 100 watt lamp). It is in the interest of energy efficiency, therefore, to design labeling information to highlight the importance of light output in lumens. Accordingly, the Commission is requiring that the lumens disclosure be identified primarily as one of ``light output,'' and that this light output disclosure be the first of the three basic performance disclosures appearing on the primary display panel. In addition, to remind consumers that wattage is not a measure of light output, the wattage disclosure will be identified primarily as ``energy used.'' 82 See ยง305.11(e)(1)(B) of the rule in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. Coupled with the educational information currently being provided by manufacturers, utility companies and others in the marketplace, this increased emphasis in labeling on light output and clarification of the meaning of wattage should help educate consumers to save energy costs by purchasing the lowest wattage lamp that provides the light output they need. 82 The Commission is not specifying type size for these disclosures because of the huge variety of packaging styles and sizes, and the need to vary type size according to the package.
