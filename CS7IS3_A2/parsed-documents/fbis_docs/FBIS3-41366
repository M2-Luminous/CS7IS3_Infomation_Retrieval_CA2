The customs officers at the airport discovered a quantity of hashish carefully wrapped in nylon bags and covered with linen cloth at the bottom of each of four tins of cheese. Three Lebanese citizens were immediately detained for questioning. One of them is a customs agent, the second is the owner of a travel agency, and the third is an employee of the travel agency's office in Beirut. Investigations have begun to determine the identity of three Saudis who asked the travel agency to send the tins by air to Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. [passage omitted]
