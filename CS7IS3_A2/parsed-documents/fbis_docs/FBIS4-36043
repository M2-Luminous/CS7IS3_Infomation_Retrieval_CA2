Meanwhile the Yemeni Government in Sanaa announced its acceptance of Security Council Resolution 924 calling for a cease-fire between northern and southern forces. [passage omitted] Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fierce fighting in Tawr al-Bahah, Lahij Governorate, is attributable to the attempt by four northern battalions to advance toward Aden through al-Hawtah, led by Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the 1st Tank Division and half-brother of the Yemeni president. So southern forces worked to encircle these units in a bid to capture 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, especially as reports had said that a number of northern commanders who are the Yemeni president's uncles were with him. These developments coincided with accusations exchanged between the northern and southern leaderships about the use of banned weapons. The accusations included a statement by Judge Hammud al-Hattar in Sanaa that southern forces are using napalm bombs in their attacks on northern units. He said that there "is irrefutable evidence of that." Meanwhile Southern Defense Minister Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir expressed his suspicions that northern forces are using chemical weapons. He added that "these suspicions are justifiable." Brig. Haytham said that "our suspicions are reinforced by the distinct and special relationship between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, who used these weapons against the Kurds in 1988." [passage omitted] High-ranking southern leaders have denied reports which have aroused alarm among some circles about an advance by northern forces toward the Dar Sa'd area. They told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone: "How can that happen, when Democratic Yemen formed its new government yesterday -- a proof that matters are stable," despite the ongoing fighting there. Southern officials said that some northern militias belonging to the Yemeni Reform Grouping have stormed Sabr prison in the Tawr al-Bahah area and freed some prisoners. They added that Aden forces clashed with them. They confirmed that conditions are now calm there. [passage omitted]
