It urged the United States to take such steps for detente as the cancellation of the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and a final stop to the Team Spirit joint manoeuvres and apply a fair nuclear nonproliferation standard to all the nations so that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the world may be promoted. Noting that the issue of "nuclear inspection" of the North must be treated as part of the plan for denuclearizing the whole of the Korean peninsula, the resolution contended that it must contain the verification of the withdrawal of the U.S. nuclear weapons from South Korea and the U.S. promise not to use regional or strategic nuclear weapons and not to threaten the use of such weapons against North Korea. The resolution stressed that the crisis of the Korean peninsula must be resolved only through diplomatic negotiation, not by threat, "sanctions" or force of arms.
