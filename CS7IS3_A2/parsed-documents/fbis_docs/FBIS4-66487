Plans to develop new diamond materials and eventually to establish its application technology are moving along steadily. Both industry and academic groups have active R&D programs both on substances already available, such as diamonds and DLC (diamond-like carbons), and on new substances such as nanotubes and fullerenes. They have even tried to operate transistors and fabricate several passive devices using those materials. But all of this is still in the initial stages of development. Therefore, a national-scale project is being promoted for a wide area of new diamond R&D that will cover areas from basic research to application in electronics and optics. Diamonds have high heat resistance. a high energy gap, high strength, as well as desirable optical and magnetic properties. In recent years, diamonds are being vigorously applied not only in wear-resistant products because of its extreme hardness. but also in electronics and optics. Under these circumstances, the `New Diamond Forum,' a new diamond R&D group, in December 1993 established the `New Diamond Technology Research Group' to study potential diamond applications for power electronics and disaster prevention systems. Abroad, meanwhile, the U.S, Department of Defense is funding studies of silicon carbide device application and research on diamond electronic devices, packaging and optical components. The European Community is also focusing research on new diamond development. Progress in new diamond development abroad has stimulated Japanese industry to demand promotion of a national project in Japan. Specifically, the project calls for application of diamonds in ultimate performance electronics materials through development of fabrication technology for new substances and new materials, property control, and development of evaluation technology. Possible applications include various environmentally durable electronic components, oil drilling tools, and new functional catalysts. They also will contribute to the safety of the global environment and provide solutions to energy problems.
