This means that no one can be a member of several political parties at the same time. The opposition claims that such a law would violate the Constitution and the Charter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. What is your view of this issue? [Klaus] I am not an exponent of the Constitution or of the Charter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. However, I have the feeling that many people in our country shield themselves by their reading and interpretation of these documents. They then reach certain conclusions from which it would appear that, on the one hand, everything is possible and that, on the other, nothing at all is possible. In my opinion, membership in two or more political parties is like a marriage with more than one spouse. This is simply a typical case of bigamy, and I do not believe it would make sense to introduce something like this into our legal code. [Krejci] You have visited Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. What impression has this visit made on you? Could you compare the reform process in our country and Chile? [Klaus] The strongest impression I have from this visit is one of enormous contrasts--both between the individual countries and within each state unit. We do not like it when someone views the postcommunist part of Europe as a monolithic mass. However, I must say to everyone who does not like this that we also have a priori a slightly simplified view of this part of the world. The sociopolitical sphere also made a strong impression on me. These countries are very dissimilar, and the political situation in each is different. Argentina has a distinct and strong government led by Menem and Cabal that is undoubtedly pushing this country forward. Chile is in the post-Pinochet phase, and something like our Civic Forum governs there. No obvious positive consensus has been reached yet on the way forward. Brazil, in the political sense, is in a very unstable situation, and you will not find personalities of the Argentinian or Chilean caliber there. As far as Chile is concerned, it is going through its own form of coming to terms with the past, which, for it, is still terribly close and within reach. While in our country the victims of communist despotism, which was far worse at the beginning, are in the 60-to-80-year-old age group, in Chile this happened 15 years ago. This means that the people affected are still young. Therefore, in this country the issue of coming to terms with the past is completely different from what it is in our country. My idea, often repeated in our country, of a rear-view mirror attracted a great deal of attention in Chile. This greatly inspired President Frey and, apparently, he will incorporate it into his speeches. General Pinochet is still commander of the Army and, therefore, is an important official. Nevertheless, in Chile they have decided to very quickly draw a thick line under the past and go on. Indeed, they have no major restitution-rehabilitation and screening problems there. The president of the Senate, who is a very affable fellow, said in this context that he was imprisoned twice under Pinochet, but this does not prevent him from going to dinner with him today. This is indeed a slightly different view from the one we have, and it is worth making the comparison. [Krejci] The post of education minister has become vacant. What is your stance on filling this position? [Klaus] Within the framework of the coalition, the Civic Democratic Party respects the fact that the Christian Democratic Party holds this post. As far as the candidate is concerned, I have to say that, so far, no talks have been held.
