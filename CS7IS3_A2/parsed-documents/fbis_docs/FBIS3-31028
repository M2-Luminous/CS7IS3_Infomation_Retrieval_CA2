This point of view is contained in a statement from the Czech Foreign Ministry issued yesterday by its Press Department. The Foreign Ministry is extremely alarmed by recent developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It considers the Saturday [5 February] massacre of the civilian population in Sarajevo to be an extreme manifestation of brutality. The UN Security Council, of which the Czech Republic is a nonpermanent member, has already adopted a resolution that makes it possible to use air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina in strictly specified cases. The tragedy in Sarajevo's market should finally induce all three warring factions to display a real political interest in resolving the conflict around the negotiating table, declares the Czech Foreign Ministry's statement.
