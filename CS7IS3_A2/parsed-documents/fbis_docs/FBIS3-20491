Should consultation fail, any one party may ask the local contract arbitration committee to arbitrate. Article 27 After it receives a written application for mediation or arbitration, the contract arbitration committee shall reply within 15 days. Before mediation or arbitration, the contract should continue to be executed. Where the contract arbitration committee succeeds in mediating the dispute, it shall prepare a written mediation agreement. When mediation fails, a case shall go to arbitration and an adjudication decision made. Both parties to a contract shall abide by the mediation agreement or adjudication decision. When a party to a contract refuses to accept the arbitration decision, it may file an appeal with the local county (municipal, district) people's court within 15 days after it receives the adjudication decision. If a party neither abides by the decision nor files an appeal, the other party may apply to the people's court for performance of contract.
