Of the 30 items surveyed, 25 fell in price from a year earlier, with 13 falling by double-digit percentages, a ministry official told reporters in releasing the monthly report. The dollar's value against the yen fell 10.9 percent in March from a year before to an average 105.04 yen, he said. Among the reasons that the average price decline was less than the increase in the yen's buying power, he said, was a number of imports contracted for in the Japanese currency and shifts in product preferences among certain categories. Among the large decliners was frozen octopus, with falling production prices pushing the import price down 24.6 percent. A switch to cheaper brands pushed European electric shaver prices down 39.5 percent and U.S. golf club prices down 19.9 percent, the official said. By contrast, import prices for British whiskey jumped 16.4 percent. The official cited a statistical reaction to a large fall a year earlier as well as a shift to more expensive malted whiskies. Strong U.S. demand for frozen shrimp and prawns pushed the Japanese import price up 1.0 percent and a switch to more expensive navel oranges pushed orange prices up 2.2 percent. Lemon and lime prices, however, fell 13.4 percent and grapefruit 6.1 percent due mainly to the yen's rise, the official said. Fresh and frozen beef prices fell 4.0 percent, with the effect of the high-yen dampened by rising production prices, he said.
