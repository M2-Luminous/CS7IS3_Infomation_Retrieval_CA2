However, the findings that have been obtained so far justify a positive balance sheet, the scientific leader of the project, Professor Sahm, stated on Thursday [24 March] in Bonn. Members of the German Agency for Space Matters (Dara) and of the German Research Institute for Aviation and Astronautics (DLR) announced the major results of the 10-day mission. Sahm reported about the surprise finding that biological cells do not develop the usual box-shape form in a state of weightlessness, but that they take on a roundish shape, develop thinner cell walls, and that their energy consumption and metabolism drop clearly. This unexpected behavior must be investigated further. The same applies to the measurement of so-called diffusion coefficients, that is physical quantities that are decisive for the mixing and separating of liquid substances. These characteristic values are indispensable for reliable computer simulations of such processes that make new developments possible. Yet new findings in the sphere of human medicine, including the discovery of a new kidney hormone, and new insights in the functioning of the lung have also contributed to the success of the D-2 mission.
