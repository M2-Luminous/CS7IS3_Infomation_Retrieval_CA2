In a Tuesday interview for Interfax he expressed the opinion that the State Duma can pass it as a law to be approved by the Council of the Federation and signed by the president. In Shakhray's opinion, initially the agreement on civic peace should be signed by parliamentary groups and leading political parties. He is also convinced that if the work on the document is done correctly, the process will be joined by all political forces. "Parties and movements refusing to sign it will remain outside the political process," the minister said. Shakhray sees the greatest danger in the possibility that several documents will appear. "If the right, left and center each write their own agreements and start a competition of documents, this can lead to a war of peace charters," he remarked. Shakhray assumed that after studying the draft agreement on accord the president will submit the document to the parliament and government. He did not rule out the possibility that the draft can be published for a public debate. In Shakhray's opinion, the agreement should set the rules of political activities for two years. "During this time we should concentrate on efforts to overcome the economic crisis," he said. Shakhray is the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord.
