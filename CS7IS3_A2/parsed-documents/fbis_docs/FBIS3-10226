The Armed Forces have managed Hondutel since its inception under the pretext that telecommunications is a national security matter; and therefore, they must not be in private hands. Discua Elvir discussed the thorny issue at a meeting with high-ranking officers and President Carlos Roberto Reina. At a news conference at the Government House, the number one man in the military institution said that the sale of Hondutel depends on a governmental political decision, because the State owns the enterprise. He said: "There must be national awareness, and there must be a political decision to do it. Hondutel is very profitable to the State. I think that the government will have the last word through a political decision." The military chief pointed out that the Armed Forces "do not have a positive or negative opinion" on the sale of Hondutel. Discua added that personally, however, he has always believed that the State must control telecommunications in any country, "because it is a State duty." He added that "the State always has the responsibility of controlling a country's telecommunications," regardless of who manages or owns them. However, "if the government makes a decision and has political willingness, I believe that such a decision will be the wisest decision," he added. Discua Elvir recalled that President Reina said that if this transaction materialized, it will be done in the clearest manner possible. The Armed Forces chief stressed that there would be "absolute honesty in this privatization process," but it must be a "well made" decision, because the enterprise is profitable. He added that the military does not control Hondutel, because its board of directors is made up of several governmental sectors, including the Ministries of Communications, Public Works and Transportation; Government and Justice; Defense; and Finance, and even the Comptroller General's Office. Discua said that Hondutel's manager, a career military official, only follows the board's decisions. The military chief added that no national economic group is able to buy Hondutel. However, he maintained that the Military Welfare Institute (IPM) is willing to "participate" in the purchase of Hondutel, in case it is privatized. He added that the sale will require an "immediate payment" so that the State will benefit from the transaction. Meanwhile, Gen. Discua Elvir denied that the Armed Forces are negotiating with President Reina a budget increase in exchange for their approval of voluntary military service. He said: "As commander in chief, I would be ashamed to make such a proposal to President Reina."
