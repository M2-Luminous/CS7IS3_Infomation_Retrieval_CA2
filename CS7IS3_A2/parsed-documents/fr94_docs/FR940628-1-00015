FR940628-1-00015 FR940628-1-00001 Summary APHIS estimates that the proposed rule changes for END would, short of a major END outbreak, have a negligible impact on the daily activities of domestic poultry and egg producers, and on domestic producers and importers of exotic birds. If a major outbreak occurred and an eradication program were initiated, the proposed rule changes would enable APHIS to effectively prevent the interstate spread of END and eradicate END. Modern diagnostic techniques would enable APHIS to determine which birds have been infected by the END virus. This would likely result in smaller quantities of euthanized birds and poultry in areas quarantined because of END. We believe that revisions to the END regulations are necessary to ensure that domestic poultry, egg, and exotic bird producers are protected against any potential END outbreak. APHIS believes that the proposed regulations would effectively deal with a disease outbreak, while at the same time imposing the minimum possible costs on affected entities.
