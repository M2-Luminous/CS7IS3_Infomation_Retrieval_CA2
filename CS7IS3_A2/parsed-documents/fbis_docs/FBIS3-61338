The president declared that the current extremely difficult situation left little room for optimism. But the situation would deteriorate even further unless the war in Karabakh were ended and the problem of the blockade resolved. According to the president, certain opportunities for the establishment of a long-term and firm armistice appeared at the end of the past year. Yerevan and Stepanakert agreed to the peacemaking initiatives of the CSCE and Russia. Azerbaijan rejected these initiatives, attempting to settle the problem militarily; nonetheless, the Armenian leader believes that before the end of the present year, Baku will have reached the conclusion of the futility of military pressure and of the need for compromise. According to Ter-Petrosyan, there is now hope that the year that has just begun will be one of peace. The president termed the adoption of a new constitution a most important factor of the preservation of domestic political stability, expressing the hope here that it would be possible to adopt the Basic Law this year also. Levon Ter-Petrosyan called the third task whose accomplishment in the very near future is inevitable the achievement of energy independence. The government is hoping for a resumption of the operation of the Armenian Nuclear Electric Power Station. As the president said, preliminary expert evaluations are promising, and there are all the prerequisites for the nuclear power station coming on stream as of the start of next winter. If all that was promised in Ter-Petrosyan's address to the nation really comes to pass, 1994 could be considered a success. But in reality, circumstances could shape up somewhat differently. The termination of Russian assistance and regional neighbors' abrupt obstruction on the question of a resumption of the operation of the nuclear power station could put back fulfillment of the dream of energy independence for an indefinitely long period of time. It would be extremely difficult under present conditions to cope in isolation with this technically very complex task, which requires, in addition, considerable foreign currency investments. The adoption of a new constitution could drag on also, inasmuch as parliament is not disposed to rush this matter--this would mean, after all, early parliamentary elections, about which a large part of the people's elect thinks with fear and trembling. It is possible that the hopes for peace could be realized, it is true, but not, most likely, thanks to the efforts of the international community of Russia or Iran, of which Armenia recently requested mediation in the conflict. The situation in Karabakh today is reminiscent of the situation that took shape following Abulfaz Elchibey's assumption of power. At that time the Azerbaijani leader succeeded, using Russian mercenaries, in breaking the resistance of the inadequately trained self-defense detachments and in occupying roughly half the territory of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. But the people of Karabakh held their ground and in time not only retrieved what they had lost, but also settled many questions of their security, pushing back the front a considerable distance from Stepanakert and other localities of their republic. Major defeats destabilized the situation in Baku and played a decisive part in Elchibey's departure from the political arena. Today Geydar Aliyev is continuing to increase the pressure on Karabakh. In two weeks of fighting, Azerbaijani formations reinforced by detachments of Russian mercenaries and Afghan mojahedin have already lost over 700 men killed and a considerable quantity of armor. But they have yet to accomplish a single tactical assignment in a single sector of the front. And this despite the vigorous activity of guard detachments composed mainly of Chechens executing retreating forces, both Azerbaijanis and Russian mercenaries. In addition, the savage pre-New Year's shelling in the border areas of Armenia have provoked the increased offensive activity of the Karabakh people themselves, and the situation has in places today once again begun to shape up to the disadvantage of the Azerbaijani Army, which again runs the risk of losing the strategic initiative. Such a development of events in the future could represent a great danger for Geydar Aliyev. An endeavor to escape the fate of his predecessor could force the present Azerbaijani leader to begin to move toward compromise. If this does happen, it will not, however, be before spring, when it will finally be clear that on this occasion also the blockade and the severe winter difficulties have not changed the situation in Armenia.
