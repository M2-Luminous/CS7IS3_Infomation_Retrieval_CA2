According to Javier Solana, relations between the European Union [EU] and the Maghreb are of fundamental importance. Javier Solana: [Begin Solana recording] The strategic importance of the region for the Community is obvious. But if I had to underline it further, I would highlight three aspects: It is its third trading partner, with 8 percent of all its trade. [sentence as heard] This fact should be remembered, I think. The area is vital for the Community's energy supply. And in third place, and to add another touch to this general picture, nearly 5 million of its citizens live on EC territory. There go three factors, so one can understand the strategic importance it has for us. Furthermore, as we all know, these countries face very serious problems, economic ones, political ones, high foreign debt, high trade deficit -- sadly very high -- increasing demographic pressure, environmental problems, fundamentalism, etc. All of this means that they are increasingly complex countries. The data I have just mentioned to you explains that Spain very forcefully wants the EU to review its Mediterranean relations in general, and EU-Maghreb relations in particular. We believe they should be higher on the EU agenda. We should manage to anchor their economies to Europe by increasing cooperation in all areas of development. [end recording]
