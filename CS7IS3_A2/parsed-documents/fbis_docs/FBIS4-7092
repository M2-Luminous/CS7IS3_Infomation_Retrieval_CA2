Hata will replace Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, whom the public had hoped would tear down collusion among politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen, but ended up resigning over "suspected dirty money" cases involving himself. Hata, whose selling point is his "clean" image, appears to have nothing to do with business circles at first glance. But "support groups" for him have been formed one after another since the beginning of the Heisei era [1989], and he is surrounded by business leaders as much as other powerful politicians are. The "biggest" support group for Hata is the "Uyu-kai," composed of members of metropolitan business circles. Representatives of this group are Ken Moroi, chairman of Chichibu Cement Corp.; Sho Nasu, chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Corp.; and Yoshihisa Tabuchi, adviser to Nomura Securities Corp. Among members of the group are Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor Corp. (next chairman of Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]); Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC Corp.; and top executives from Japan's 38 leading companies like Nissan Motor Corp., Toshiba Corp., Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Sumitomo Chemical Corp., Seiyu Corp., and IBM Japan. Since the first year of the Heisei era, the group has met two or three times a year. The "Shinshi-kai" is composed of about 30 members, including business leaders from Nagano Prefecture, Hata's home prefecture, and top executives from companies having close ties with Nagano. Representatives of this group are Yoshio Nakayama, honorary president of Cosmo Oil Corp.; Yoshio Maruta, chairman of Kao Corp.; Kaneo Fujimori, adviser to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank; and Shigenobu Yamamoto, adviser to Hino Motors Corp. There is no particular support group composed of graduates of Seijo University, Hata's alma mater. But Ryoichi Kito, who is the president of the machine tool maker Kito (head office in Yamanashi Prefecture) and was Hata's senior at Seijo High School, serves as a representative of the "Shisui-kai" which is made up of top executives from 15 firms of middle standing. What is noteworthy is that all of those support groups formed in the Heisei era. An official of Hata's office claimed: "This has happened only because Mr. Hata gained power and made a name for himself during his days in the Liberal Democratic Party." Many business leaders, meanwhile, said: "We were impressed by the stand of Mr. Hata who tackled the political reform issues seriously, risking his political life." Mitsuo Fukawa, who is president of Nisshin Oil Mills Corp. and a graduate of Seijo University, supported this view, saying: "Mr. Hata is a good-hearted man who carried though his resolve (in political reform and other major issues)." So far, Hata has not always had strong influence on business circles, however. A "Uyu-kai" member asked more of him, saying: "His connections with business circles are more extensive than those of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. I should say his connections are more extensive, but shallower. He presens a clean image on money matters, and there is nothing more to ask of his personality, but that is not good enough for a prime minister. He should learn to exert more leadership."
