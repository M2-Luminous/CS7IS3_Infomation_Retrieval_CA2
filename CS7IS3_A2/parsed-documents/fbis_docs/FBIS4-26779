The Post and Telecommunications Ministry's leading party group recently decided to promote the administration's experience and practices in providing quality services to the public and its customers in post and telecommunications departments throughout the country with a view to further promoting bureau-specific healthy practices in the nation's post and telecommunications sector. This was disclosed by Chang Yan, head of the discipline inspection group sent by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission to work at the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, at a news briefing held by the ministry's leading party group in Shanghai yesterday. In recent years, the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications Administration has provided quality services as part of its intensive efforts to remedy unhealthy practices. It has taken the initiative in serving the telecommunications market, tried its best to satisfy the public's needs, and pulled ahead of its counterparts in other parts of the country in redressing sector-wide unhealthy practices, in improving bureau-specific practices, and in providing quality services. While energetically developing postal and telecommunications services, the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications Administration has earnestly provided quality services and promoted industrious and honest practices. Since 1992, the administration has carried out activities to promote quality services "aimed at satisfying market demand and guaranteeing satisfaction to customers." It has provided services to solve problems of concern to the general public. To improve telephone services, for example, it has increased the number of public telephones, set up nighttime emergency and public telephone offices, made private telephones available for public use, and extended service hours, thus effectively relieving inadequate telephone services for local residents. It has provided special services for the old, weak, sick, and disabled; 355,000 people falling under this category are now enjoying these special services. Moreover, the administration has provided newspapers and mail home delivery services for more than 2,500 childless and widowed senior citizens in Shanghai. It has also provided "integrated" services, handled telephone and telecommunications services on behalf of other departments, and instituted measures such as those "creating a single window for receiving documents and introducing a single official seal for use in dealings with its customers." The Shanghai Post and Telecommunications Administration has set up a sound and effective administrative system, thereby institutionally suppressing the sources of unhealthy practices. For instance, the municipal telephone office has placed telephone numbers and telephone lines under centralized and unified management. It has also stepped up management, supervision, and control over work units, thereby effectively halting the unhealthy practice of abusing telephone numbers and telephone lines. Additionally, the administration has recruited 2,768 superintendents from among the public, carried out year-round education on occupational ethics, and selected advanced models on a timely basis. It has also incorporated service indicators, such as "user complaint and satisfaction rates," in unit- and job-based responsibility systems, and strictly meted out rewards and punishments. In the municipal telephone office alone, six people have been dismissed for violations of disciplinary rules.
