Wednesday, President Balaguer promised William Grey, U.S. special envoy to Haiti, and UN and OAS envoy Dante Caputo that the Dominican Republic would completely close its border with Haiti in accordance to UN Security Council Resolution 917. Nevertheless, Haitians buying fuel in the community of Marcher, located next to the Dominican township of Dajabon, pointed out that Haitians and Dominicans are still obtaining "significant gains" from the sale of crude oil along the border separating the two nations. Jackson Marcelin and Benoit Antuan, two Haitians who make their living by trading along the border, indicated to EFE that the sale of fuel in this area "is a lot better than before." They added that in the township of Marcher, a fuel distribution center located on the banks of the Masacre River, the military has posed no "problems, although it is necessary to give them something (money)." [passage omitted] Gerardo Gil, 30, a Haitian, agreed with his compatriots, stating, "business between Dominicans and Haitians is continuing as usual." Gil explained that on Monday, the Dominican (military and customs) authorities allowed "unrestricted entry" to those Haitians who normally cross the border every Monday and Friday to buy and sell in Dajabon. The so-called "gasoline market" extends for nearly 1 km along the Haitian side of the Masacre River in Marcher -- a region in which Haitians have set up small shops operating in Dominican territory. It is in this community where citizens from both nations distribute fuel which, according to Haitians interviewed, they then export to Port-au-Prince and other Haitian cities subject to the UN-imposed embargo. The objective of the embargo is to pressure the military leaders -- who, in September 1991, toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- into stepping down from power. According to those Haitians who spoke with EFE, the fuel is taken to Qanaminthe, where it is then accumulated "gallon by gallon" before being taken to the "wealthy and the military in Port-au-Prince." A gallon of gasoline (3.8 liters) that costs 20 pesos ($1.60) increases in value to more than 50 pesos ($4.00) once it crosses the border. Despite this, Haitians only receive between one-half and two and one-half pesos (between four and 20 cents in U.S. currency) from the entire transaction. In addition, Haitian sources said their profits tend to drop even more because they have to pay the Dominican military five pesos (40 cents) for each gallon that crosses from the Dominican Republic into Haiti. The same sources noted that last week fuel trafficking decreased because of the presence of "white men" -- a reference to UN observers. The presence of UN observers was also the reason why the military decided to prevent movement across the border. In addition to the sale of fuel in Marcher, Dominicans and Haitians also distribute rice, sugar, eggs, ice, and other items not found in Haiti in the wake of the total economic blockade that went into effect Sunday. These items increase in price by more than 300 percent once they cross the river separating the two nations that share the island of Hispaniola. Dominicans normally purchase plastic and other household goods sold in Haiti. Marcelin, Antuan, and Gil confirmed to EFE reports disclosed by other Haitians who chose not to identity themselves and who indicated that trade along the border "is greater now than before, because the other side (the Dominican Republic) is experiencing an election." Nevertheless, it has been possible to ascertain that "officially," military officials in both nations are limiting the movements of Dominicans as well as Haitians. Unsuccessful attempts were made to contact gasoline distributors in Dajabon in order to learn how the Dominicans and Haitians were distributing and selling fuel in Haiti, because gasoline stations were out of fuel and vehicle owners were being forced to stand in long lines, sometimes for as many as three days. Nevertheless, according to Haitian sources, the considerable quantity of fuel that has already reached the "market" has prompted a decline in fuel prices. Citizens from both nations selling their goods along the border acknowledged that they "have heard" something about the embargo, but they added that so far it is not noticeable in the region.
