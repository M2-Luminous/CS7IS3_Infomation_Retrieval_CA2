FR940216-0-00123 FR940216-0-00010 Carriers are presumed liable for violations arising from product under the control and/or custody of the carrier at the carrier's facility, and for violations at any facility where EPA demonstrates that the carrier caused the violation. Carriers who meet the definition of refiner or oxygenate blender have the same liabilities and defenses as any other refiner or oxygenate blender. The final rule also provides defenses against liability for each person presumed liable. These defenses are discussed below. For a more detailed discussion of the rationale for the liabilities and defenses established by this rule, see EPA's proposal at 57 FR 13470&hyph;13473 (April 16, 1992). One commenter stated that where gasoline in a storage tank is in violation of the regulations, EPA should either narrow the range of persons presumptively liable or expand the availability of affirmative defenses. The comment is based on the normal industry practice of commingling products in common storage tanks, the number of fuel manufacturers that would be involved, the likelihood of commingling, the absence of quantitative thresholds, and the absence of a requirement that individual parties exercise sufficient control over the contents of the tank. Another commenter queried what distinguishes this program from other fuels programs which did not impose such presumptive liability. EPA has had extensive experience in enforcing other motor vehicle fuel programs under 40 CFR part 80, including the unleaded gasoline and gasoline volatility programs and the recent diesel sulfur program. Each of these other fuels programs include presumptive liability schemes that are very similar to the presumptive liability scheme proposed for reformulated gasoline. The liability and defense provisions of this rule are structured similarly to those adopted by EPA in its prior motor vehicle fuel programs, including the controls on leaded and unleaded gasoline, gasoline volatility and diesel fuel desulfurization. For those programs, EPA's regulations identify various persons who are presumed liable when violations are detected at various points in the motor fuel distribution system. For example, 40 CFR 80.28 identifies those persons responsible for violations of the gasoline volatility regulations when a violation is detected at refiner or importer facilities (§80.28(a)), at carrier facilities (§80.28(b)), at branded distributor facilities, reseller facilities, or ethanol blending plants (§80.28(c)), at unbranded distributor facilities and ethanol blending plants (§80.28(d)), at branded retail outlets or wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities (§80.28(e)), and at unbranded retail outlets or wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities (§80.28(f)). In general, all persons who could have caused a violation at a facility are presumed to be liable for the violation detected at the facility. At branded facilities the refiner is also presumed liable based on their ability to exercise a degree of control at these facilities. Various affirmative defenses are afforded to persons presumed liable, and in all cases the presumptions of liability are rebuttable. 40 CFR 80.28(g). The affirmative defenses typically involve showing (1) that the person did not cause the violation, (2) that they either conducted tests showing the gasoline was in compliance when they transferred it to the next person in the distribution system, or that they received proper documentation when they received the gasoline and conducted a sufficient quality assurance sampling and testing program. Additional elements of an affirmative defense must be shown by refiners when a violation is detected at a branded outlet. A detailed discussion of the reasons for the gasoline volatility liability defense provisions can be found at 54 FR 11872 (March 22, 1989).
