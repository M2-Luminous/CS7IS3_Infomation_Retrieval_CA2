He sounded the warning in Mwanza town today while addressing commanders and servicemen of the defense forces in Mwanza region. Gen. Mboma said that if tribalism was allowed to infiltrate the Army it would create much havoc, as was currently the case in neighboring Rwanda where brother was fighting brother, each with the aim of eliminating the tribe of the other. He said the Tanzanian nation was built on a foundation of unity and our Army embraced all the tribes of Tanzania, so anyone attempting to incite tribalism in the Army must be condemned. Elaborating on the issue of tribalism, Gen. Mboma said that a good example was Ngara District which had a population of 170,000 people but had now been invaded by over 350,000 Rwandan refugees who had fled the ethnic fighting in their country. He said he had never witnessed people killing each other so mercilessly as was now happening in Rwanda.
