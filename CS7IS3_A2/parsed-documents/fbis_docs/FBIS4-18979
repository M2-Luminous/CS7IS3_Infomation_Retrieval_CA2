A historic event is taking place today. For the first time a delegation of the Bosnian parliament is going to be at the Council of Europe assembly, and the new Russian delegation will also be attending. Miguel Angel Martinez, president of the assembly of members of parliament of the Council of Europe, is on the line. Today is an important day for the assembly of members of parliament of the Council of Europe. The representatives of the Bosnian parliament will be at this assembly for the first time. [Martinez] Yes, with the president of the Bosnian parliament leading them, they are going to take their place for the first time as specially invited guests, that is, a candidate member country to affiliation to the Council of Europe. [Announcer] There is also more news. For example, Boris Yeltsin is in Spain. Russia, with these problems about the Black Sea Fleet, the complaints about not having been informed about NATO air strikes around Gorazde, and the new Russian delegation taking its place in the assembly of the Council of Europe. What do these two developments mean for this organization, the assembly of the Council of Europe? [Martinez] What this means is the new role of the Council of Europe and the new dimension of the European contruction -- which now far surpasses the narrow and almost subregional framework of the European Union, the EC, and Europe, now that the world divided into blocs is over -- is expanding to all the countries, interpreting their aspiration to live in freedom and democracy. I refer to the countries on the map of the continent. They identify that aspiration with participating in the construction of Europe, and here we have important countries such as Russia with which, obviously, the dimension of construction is growing in terms of countries, of people who are going to come under the blue starred flag, and, as you can imagine, the complexity of our work increases. [Announcer] There is another important bit of news which goes slightly beyond Europe's sphere and it is the participation, that presence, of Yasir 'Arafat, who is going to be at the Council of Europe shortly. Will the Council of Europe have much capacity to intervene or support the Middle East peace process? [Martinez] One of the responsibilities practically falling on us, without us having made any request, is to be Europe's voice in dialogue and, if you like, negotiation with the other big countries or other big blocs of countries with which, by necessity, Europe has to speak to construct the world order and, above all, to keep peace in the world. I have just returned from China as part of a very high-level delegation. Yesterday I saw the U.S. ambassador to France in my office; she was carrying a message from President Clinton. Today I am receiving a delegation of 15 Arab countries, and tomorrow Yasir 'Arafat is coming. Europe must speak, talk. It must be a partner with these others to create a world in peace, and naturally it would appear that the Council of Europe is the most representative instrument because we are all here.
