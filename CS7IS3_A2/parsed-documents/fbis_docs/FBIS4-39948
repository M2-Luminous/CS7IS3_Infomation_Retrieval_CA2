Kravchuk opens the meeting with a brief speech, thanking the correspondents for attending. Kravchuk then answers a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA question about a possible joint ownership of Crimea by Russia and Ukraine. Kravchuk replies: "This idea should be put forward by the party that wants it. If, for instance, the Crimea wants it, then it is not for us to tell the Crimea, look, we are going to own you on a joint basis. But there have been no such statements or intentions on the part of past or present Crimean leaders. The Crimean leaders have only expressed one opinion to date: First, they want to be granted a statehood as a transitional stage and then, to become part of Russia. This is a program, a goal of the party that is currently in the majority in the parliament. The Crimean president has the same program. All this time, especially lately, they have been distancing themselves from Ukraine in all possible ways except in the economic sphere, because they are fully aware Crimea is 93 percent dependent on Ukraine." He says the idea of a joint Russian-Ukrainian ownership of Crimea would be difficult to put into practice: "If the question of equal cultural, political, religious, ethnic, and other conditions for Russians and Ukrainians in the Crimea is raised, you will see at once that this problem cannot be resolved. This joint ownership will mean that 95 percent will be de facto owned by Russia and 5 percent, de jure, by Ukraine." Asked what way out he could propose, he said: "There is only one way out -- that the Crimean authorities should act in conformity with the Constitution, that's all." At 1034 GMT a LITERATURNAYA GAZETA correspondent asks Kravchuk if it could be guaranteed that he will refrain from the use of force in settling the Crimean issue. Kravchuk answers: "I can tell you with full certainty that under no circumstances will the leadership of Ukraine and I as its president use forcible methods in resolving the Crimean issue. I have said this at a Supreme Council session for all our people to hear, because we realize that however much this might hurt everyone, it would mean first and foremost a tragedy to us, and it is our people who would suffer most. I have accordingly called on the Crimean leadership to follow the same principle." He says the Moldova-Dniester region situation should not be allowed to evolve between Ukraine and Crimea and warned against any provocations, be it by Russian or Ukrainian forces, with regard to the Crimea. Halfway through the program a KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent asks whether Russia and Ukraine would be able to reach an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet. Kravchuk says: "Today the only issue is where the fleet will be stationed. The infrastructure, all land-based economy of the Navy and so on come later. What is the Russian stance today? That Ukraine must have one base in the Crimea, in Donuzlav. Everything else in the Crimea should belong to the Russian Black Sea Fleet -- not only Sevastopol. Sevastopol alone is 150 km. So, my question is: Is it that Sevastopol is the base of the Russian Navy or is it that the Russian Navy's base is in Sevastopol? This is not just an editorial change. If it is Sevastopol, this means 150 km. If the Russian Navy also takes hold of Feodosia, Kerch, they even have Yalta on the list -- one does not know why, it is not a military facility...(pauses) I will then ask a practical question I keep raising with the authorities, including Russian authorities. It so happens that 85 percent of all the infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet of the former Soviet Union -- I quote the figure from memory, so I may be wrong -- is concentrated in Sevastopol. All or most officers and junior ranks of the fleet live in Sevastopol. So, today Ukraine receives its 174 ships, let us say, and they tell us: move 160 km away from Sevastopol. We need -- just for these ships -- 2,500 officers and junior ranks. They live in Sevastopol, however. Are they prepared to move?" He goes on to say that he understands Russia's interests in the Black Sea: "Russia is interested in having its Navy in the Black Sea. It does not have any other options right now. It is the south frontier, interests must be protected and so on. I understand it, we are not children here. Russia uses other bases on the basis of a contract with Ukraine, through agreements. That's it. But one should accept that these are Ukraine's bases." He concludes by saying that the agreement should be reached following international principals: "There should be a lease agreement for Russia's main base in Sevastopol. This is a norm -- that is what other countries do, so we have not invented anything here. All other bases, which are there -- the Russian Navy needs them -- all these bases should be used by Russia through separate agreements." As he closes his meeting with the Russian correspondents, Kravchuk asks the journalists to help build relations between Russia and Ukraine with long-term prospects in mind. "We are living for today. Sometimes our relations are determined by mercenary considerations, by feelings such as we shall show them, we shall cut them off, we are not going to pay, they are bad because they want to be independent. This is not like us. For 340 years, we have not fought against one another. And today, when the question is asked if there will be war between Russia and Ukraine, I answer without hesitation: no, there won't be. This is like the Lord's Prayer to me. No, I say, this is simply inadmissible. If we fail to realize now that we have reached the point where our future, our children and grandchildren might be at risk -- that will be the most frightening thing imaginable."
