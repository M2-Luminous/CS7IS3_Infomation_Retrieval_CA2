Maryasov: "Good Seeds--the Foundation of the Harvest"] [Text] Recently the collegium of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food at its meeting considered the Russian Federation draft Law on Seeds. This question, as they say, is urgent. At the present time there are no legislative acts in the country regulating production, procurements, sale, and utilization of seeds and planting material. The experience of countries with a developed market economy shows that the creation of this kind of legal base is possible only on the basis of recognition of unified production principles, certification of seeds, and their introduction into commercial circulation. It is these principles that make up the foundation of the proposed draft. The law provides legal foundations for the activity of producers and consumers of seeds and protects their rights. The system for growing seeds of agricultural crops is formed from the production of original, elite, reproduction, and hybrid seeds. It is stipulated that the production and utilization of seeds of strains included in the register of selection achievements is done only by certified legal entities and individuals, in observance of the exclusive right of the patent holders. In order to deliver seeds to regions that do not produce them or have limited possibilities of producing them and to render assistance in cases of natural disasters the draft law envisions the creation of a federal branch seed supply. The draft law especially stipulates that the state client for the formation of the federal insurance supply of seeds is the Ministry of Agricultural and Food of the Russian Federation. For the purpose of stimulating procurements of seeds for the federal insurance supply there is to be advanced payment of 50 percent of the cost of the delivery volume contracted for and also compensation for the producers of the original seeds for 50 percent of the costs related to their production and all expenditures on the creation of insurance and carryover supplies of these seeds. A great deal of attention is devoted to control methods that contribute to improving the quality of seeds. According to the draft law all seed and planting material used for planting is subject to testing for grade and planting qualities with the issuance of the corresponding documents--a certificate (upon sale), and in other cases--a certification of the quality of the seeds. In order to monitor the observance of normative-technical and technological documentation in the production, procurement, storage, transportation, and utilization of seeds, the position of state inspector for seed control is being introduced with the assignment of the corresponding authority. At the same time liability for violation of the law has been determined.
