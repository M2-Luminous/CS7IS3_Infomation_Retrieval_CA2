FR940916-1-00137 FR940916-1-00016 §232.7 Waivers. (a) Any person may petition the Federal Railroad Administration for a waiver of compliance with any requirement prescribed in this part. (b) Each petition for a waiver under this section must be filed in the manner and contain the information required by part 211 of this chapter. (c) If the Administrator finds the waiver of compliance is in the public interest and is consistent with railroad safety, the Administrator may grant the waiver subject to any conditions the Administrator deems necessary. §232.9 Responsibility for compliance; recordkeeping requirements. (a) A railroad subject to this part shall not use, haul, permit to be used or hauled on its line, offer in interchange, or accept in interchange any train, railroad car, or locomotive with one or more conditions not in compliance with this part; however, a railroad shall not be liable for a civil penalty for such action if such action is in accordance with §232.17. For purposes of this part, a train, railroad car, or locomotive will be considered in use prior to departure but after it has received, or should have received, the inspection required for movement and is deemed ready for service. (b) Although many of the requirements of this part are stated in terms of the duties of a railroad, when any person performs any function required by this part, that person (whether or not a railroad) is required to perform that function in accordance with this part. (c) Whenever a railroad is required to perform a duty or task pursuant to this part, the railroad shall develop and implement written procedures covering the performance of those duties or tasks. (d) Whenever a railroad is required to develop and maintain written records or procedures pursuant to this part, the railroad shall make those written records or procedures available to FRA upon request. §232.11 Civil Penalties. Any person (including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor) who violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of at least $500, but not more than $10,000 per violation, except that: Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful violations, and, where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury to persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. Appendix A contains a schedule of civil penalty amounts used in connection with this part. §232.13 Preemptive effect. (a) Under 49 U.S.C. 20106, formerly contained in section 205 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 and codified at 45 U.S.C 434, issuance of this part preempts any State law, rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the same subject matter, except for a provision directed at a local safety hazard if that provision is consistent with this part and that does not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. (b) FRA does not intend by issuance of this part to preempt provisions of State criminal law that impose sanctions for reckless conduct that leads to actual loss of life, injury, or damage to property, whether such provisions apply specifically to railroad employees or generally to the public at large. §232.15 General requirements for all train brake systems. (a) A train brake system shall be capable of stopping the train with a service application from its maximum operating speed, under the worst case adhesion conditions, within the signal spacing existing on the track over which the train is operating. (b) If a train brake communication line uses other than solely pneumatic technology, the integrity of the train line shall be monitored by the brake control system. If the integrity of the communication line is broken, the train shall be stopped. (c) A train brake system shall respond as intended to signals from the train brake line. (d) Prior to departure from an initial terminal point or point of origin, a train shall have a 100 percent functional train brake system. (e) At points other than an initial terminal point, no train shall move if more than 15 percent of the cars in that train have brakes cut out. A car has its brakes cut out if the brakes on one or more axles of that car are cut out. (f) Each car in a train shall have its air brakes in effective operating condition unless the car is being moved for repairs in accordance with §232.17. A car's air brakes are not in effective operating condition if its brakes are cut out or inoperative or if the piston travel exceeds: (1) 101/2 inches for cars equipped with nominal 12-inch stroke brake cylinders; (2) The piston travel limits indicated on the badge plate for that brake cylinder; or
