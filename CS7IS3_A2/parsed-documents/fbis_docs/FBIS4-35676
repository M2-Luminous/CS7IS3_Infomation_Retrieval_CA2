The public relations office of the office of the president of the republic reports that at this meeting the report on the latest changes having to do with solving the problem of Iran's suspended debts and the successes achieved was given to the president of the republic. In view of the nation's foreign exchange reserves, the decision was made that to fight the corruption of the brokers in the foreign exchange market and to stabilize the foreign exchange rate, in addition to providing foreign exchange for goods that are obtained at the Foreign Exchange Bank's official rate, the banking system is also required to provide at a rate 50 rials [R] below the free market rate the foreign exchange needed by importers who have registered or are registering at the Ministry of Commerce to import in exchange for exports. Likewise, the banking system will buy foreign exchange obtained from exports at the same rate, should the exporters so desire. Following the decisions made at the meeting of the Foreign Exchange Market Regulation Committee, a statement was issued by the Central Bank. According to this statement, all importers of goods who have obtained authorization to import in exchange for exports by registering orders at the Ministry of Commerce may go to a foreign exchange branch of the nation's commercial banks and submit their request to demand a draft or to open a confirmed letter of credit in the interest of the sellers. When the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran receives the requests and their statistical registration, it will sell foreign exchange from the nation's banking system at R50 less than the going rates and will issue a draft or open a letter of credit. The rate of the foreign exchange for opening a confirmed letter of credit through the nation's banking system will remain fixed until the time of the exchange of shipping documents on the goods, and there will be no risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to the importers between the date of the opening of the letter of credit and the date of the exchange of the shipping documents for the goods. The above procedures are exclusively for imports in exchange for exports, and for other groups of goods the banks are required as before to allocate foreign exchange at the R1,750 rate. This statement was issued as a guideline to all banks and the banks are required to obtain the documents from applicants and to take the necessary steps. The decision by the Foreign Exchange Market Regulation Committee was also presented to the Council of Ministers and it was decided that if any government institution or institution affiliated with the government goes to the free market to obtain foreign exchange, this will be regarded as illegal and the managers involved will be prosecuted. Likewise, any kind of negligence or failure to perform by the banks during the process of allocating the foreign exchange will be regarded as cooperation with people who are undermining the nation's foreign exchange system. Based on a decision by the Council of Ministers, all the managers of the foreign exchange branches of the commercial banks are required to expedite foreign exchange allocations, and government institutions and companies are forbidden from entering the free market for foreign exchange. Nonbank Credit Institutions At the meeting of the Council of Ministers a report was also presented by the chief of the Central Bank on how to create nonbank credit institutions and the regulations appropriate for them. This report announced that the goal in creating these kinds of institutions is to complete the organization of the nation's financial system to make it more competent and to provide resources and allocate them for investment in various sectors.
