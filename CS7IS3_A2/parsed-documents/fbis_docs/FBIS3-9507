All this is done by some government bodies in collaboration with other forces from abroad. The more frequent one-sided and false presentation of PDP's activities and its political mechanism in part of the Macedonian media is just a part of such a propaganda. In order to completely clarify certain dilemmas about the involvement of some political figures in the so-called "arms affair," PDP will request from authorised international institutions to form an international committee to deal with the case.
