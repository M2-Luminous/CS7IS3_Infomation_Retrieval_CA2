The sources said they had no knowledge of such a visit. Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that Qaddumi stopped over on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning at Dubai international airport en route from Cairo to the Far East to visit a number of states there. They added that Qaddumi, who stopped over at Dubai airport for about an hour, made some telephone calls to some Palestinian embassy officials in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The sources expect Qaddumi to stop over at Dubai airport when he returns from east Asia. The sources stressed they had no knowledge of the possibility of his making an official visit to the United Arab Emirates [UAE] soon. Qaddumi's stopover at Dubai airport does not carry any political indications, as President Yasir 'Arafat too stopped over at Abu Dhabi international airport last year while en route from Jakarta and Turkey. Observers point out that official contacts between Abu Dhabi and the PLO were limited to the contacts with PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), who visited it on two occasions, the more recent of which was after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement in Washington on 13 September. During this visit he met with senior UAE officials, first and foremost Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the head of state.
