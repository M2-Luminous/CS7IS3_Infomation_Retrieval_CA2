They are overjoyed at the 13.4 percent increase in the GNP last year, which totalled 3 trillion yuan, but are worried about last year's 13 percent rise in retail prices, which are expected to go up again in January and February of this year. While pledging to maintain fairly rapid economic growth, the encouraging "Report on Government Work" has also urged keeping this year's price rise below 10 percent. All NPC and CPPCC deputies and members have agreed during the sessions that curbing inflation will be the focus of this year's macroeconomic control and regulation. An Imperative Matter Commodity prices are of great importance to the people's livelihood and to all sectors of our social life. Shaanxi deputy Pang Jiayu indicated that commodity prices are a sensitive issue. Liaoning deputy Bo Xilai believed that commodity prices are one of the major concerns to the masses. CPPCC member Shi Ningsun said: Curbing inflation has become a matter of prime importance in our current effort to maintain social stability and to ensure healthy national economic development. Though in different terms, they have all revealed the urgency of curbing inflation. The rapid rise in commodity prices reflects the relatively tight conditions of economic operation, and also contains a latent crisis of economic turbulence. CPPCC Member Shi Ningsun noted: Alarm has been sounded in China's economy, and failure in imposing macrocontrol and regulation will probably lead to runaway inflation and economic stagnation. Runaway inflation is harmful to the interests of the masses and will also give rise to social conflicts. This year is a vital year for reform, and there is a great need for a stable social environment. CPPCC member Zhao Changbai is correct when he says: No matter how good our system and policies are, we will find it difficult to push forward reform without a stable social environment. The general goal of the government's macroeconomic control and regulation is to maintain a balanced supply and demand, optimize the economic structure, guide the economy to attain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development, and bring about comprehensive social progress. Under this general goal, the focus and concrete targets of macroeconomic control and regulation will be different during each period in light of different foci of conflicts. We may stress growth during one period, and emphasize structural readjustment or curbing inflation during another. It is imperative to focus our efforts on curbing inflation at present, as the economy has kept growing for several years and the threats posed by runaway inflation are more alarming. Meeting Difficulties Head On It is no easy task to keep the price rise below 10 percent. CPPCC member Zhang Shirao considered it a formidable task. He cited several factors leading to price rises: Commodity prices began to rise since the end of last year; a number of new policies have been and will be put forward, such as readjustments in grain prices; unpredictable factors, for example rises in grain prices also cause rises in the prices of over 1,000 commodities; and spontaneous price rises. A train running at full speed will produce great inertia. CPPCC member Wang Shiying pointed out that 1993's newly added investment, new projects, and newly issued currencies will continue to cause price rises in 1994. CPPCC member Zhao Haikuan dwelled on the difficulty in terms of mechanisms: One, macroeconomically, credit funds are growing too fast, while microeconomically, firms are still hobbled by clogged mechanisms. As a result, everybody is lining up for loans, whether business operations are sound or not. Two, the change in government functions is yet to have any real effect. With local governments in charge of the economy, everybody wants to get ahead as quickly as possible, creating enormous inflationary pressure. Three, checks on consumption funds remain too soft, and governments and enterprises are still spending money as if it were from the "same big pot." In a certain sense, checks against inflation are a double-edged sword. Liaoning deputy Li Shaozhou said: Inflation comes with economic growth and can be said to be the price for economic development, and therefore, cannot be completely eradicated. If inflation is kept artificially low, economic growth will slow, the market will become weak, and there will be underemployment and more unemployment, all of which are equally bad for social stability. At present, one of the keys to curbing inflation is to identify the point of critical balance between curbing inflation and maintaining economic growth. The "Government Work Report" suggested a 9 percent economic growth rate for this year, while stabilizing the inflation rate at 10 percent. Some deputies and members agreed that the two objectives are reasonable and interconnected. A not-low economic growth rate and a not-high inflation rate -- it will be remarkable if the state can achieve that. A market economy requires macroregulation and control, which demands a great deal of expertise. It differs completely from the traditional planned economy and needs to be probed and tried. An explicit announcement of stabilizing price rises at the 10 percent level indicates government's confidence and competence to meet the difficulties head on. Ready With "Two Hands" Deputies and members were all confident in achieving the 10 percent target and offered their ideas. The rapid price increases were mainly caused by excessive investment and monetary supply. To curb inflation, it is necessary to plug this fountainhead, which means strict controls over the scale of investment, monetary supply, and credit scale. Some deputies and members suggested powerful economic means with discretionary administrative means with which to keep these three supplies under control. Macroregulation and controls for the market economy do not exclude necessary administrative measures, especially at a time of "changing rails," when the market mechanism is still unsound and a new macroregulatory and control system is not in place, occasioning the need for a larger dose of administrative measures. Only we must pay attention to the laws of the market and refrain from institutionalizing administrative measures. CPPCC member Fei Yuefeng said: The primary thing to do in curbing inflation is to control the volume of monetary supply, though the control must work through the laws of the market economy. There is no doubt that the present anti-inflationary measures still treat only the symptoms. To curb inflation at its root cause, we still have to rely on deepening reforms. The deep-seated factors responsible for excessive investment and monetary supply were caused by irrational investment, finance, taxation, banking, and firm structures, restraint-free microeconomic behavior, and unscientific macroeconomic behavior. Heilongjiang deputy Lin You believed that macroregulation and control must be aimed at both symptoms and underlying causes. The measures must be firm in treating symptoms and active in tackling underlying causes. The attacks on the symptoms and underlying causes must reinforce each other. When problems worsen, firm measures are called for to deal with the symptoms, which incidentally are creating conditions for solving underlying causes. We must take on the root causes when the symptoms diminish. Only thus can we enjoy long-term stability and prevent relapses. This year, the central authorities have not only proposed strengthening macroregulatory and control measures, but also those for structural reforms in finance, taxation, and banking. As long as we can insist on combining the treatment of symptoms with that of underlying causes, and economic means with administrative measures, there is great hope that we can achieve the objective of curbing inflation.
