He was in Kharkov today, speaking at a meeting of leaders of agricultural machine building enterprises. He said that first and foremost it is necessary to confirm the prime minister, who is to submit to the Supreme Soviet a list of cabinet ministers. The president said that he has held consultations and meetings with members of standing commissions, factions, and parliament. The meetings considered approaches to the way the Cabinet of Ministers is to be formed and proposed possible candidacies. Those invited to the meeting, apart from Leonid Kravchuk, were leaders of nearly 200 enterprises and more than 30 organizations involved in science and design. The most important issues concerning relations between enterprises and the state were raised. It was noted that these are now on the brink of crisis. Because of the disruption in economic links with countries of the CIS, shortage of resources and transport, some enterprises have been standing idle for several months a year, having no money to pay their workers. "State factories must be given the opportunity to use civilized methods to sell their goods," according to Valentin Boblik, director general of the Kharkov tractor works. "It is no longer possible to use barter deals exchanging tractors, combines, and sowers for rice, buckwheat, sugar, and gasoline." Speaking at the meeting, Leonid Kravchuk said that Ukraine has a rather well-developed production and scientific base to produce machinery. However, a critical situation has arisen, because of a number of instances of poor coordination, the stalling of economic reforms, and the disruption in economic links in most branches of industry and agriculture. He said that he has signed a decree on urgent measures to improve financial and credit provision, and to form state food resources for 1994-95. The president said he is happy with the position taken by some leaders of enterprises who said that they no longer need credits. This position is correct, he said. In their opinion, these resources must be urgently channelled into agriculture so as to enable collective and state farms to buy technology. Leonid Kravchuk said that the decree provides for precisely such mechanisms.
