Our special correspondent Ilya Kapelevich reports: The agreement defines the conditions and stages for the development of economic cooperation between Russia and greater Europe. Over a year and a half were needed to draw it up. The signing of the document was postponed twice. Now it looks as if partnership between Russia and the European Union is becoming a reality. What does it promise for our country? [Begin Yeltsin recording] We benefit from this agreement. We are entering free trade with Europe on equal terms without any of the discriminatory measures that existed in the past and which still exist in other countries outside Europe. Therefore, this is a wise and strong step by the European Community, all of its leaders and heads of states. I think that a historic step has been made today that will prevent an economic cold war. [end recording] The treaty encompasses not only various aspects of relations at inter-state level, but also opens up new possibilities for ordinary citizens and enterprises. In accordance with the treaty, the European Union countries will remove all the discriminatory measures against Russian citizens seeking employment in Europe. The procedure for getting visas for those who obtained work illegally will be simplified. Europeans in Russia will enjoy the same rights. Russian banks now have the full right to work in European countries, while the restrictions on the work of foreign banks in Russia will be preserved for the next two years. The point of the treaty protecting the activities of European entrepreneurs in Russia against unforseeable changes in legislation, which happens quite often in our country, is extremely important for European entrepreneurs. The newly introduced restrictions will not affect them for three years from the time they are brought into force. The agreement envisages the development of a political dialogue at all levels. This will enable the interested parties to maintain permanent contact and to consult on major problems regarding European security.
