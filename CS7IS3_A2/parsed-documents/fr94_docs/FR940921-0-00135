FR940921-0-00135 FR940921-0-00016 91. Section 86.1233&hyph;96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) to read as follows: §86.1233&hyph;96 Diurnal emission test. (a)(1) The diurnal emission test for gasoline-, methanol- and gaseous-fueled vehicles consists of three 24-hour test cycles following the hot soak test. Emissions are measured for each 24-hour cycle, with the highest emission level used to determine compliance with the standards specified in subpart A of this part. The Administrator may truncate a test after any 24-hour cycle without affecting the validity of the collected data. Sampling of emissions from the running loss and hot soak tests is not required as preparation for the diurnal emission test. The diurnal emission test may be conducted as part of either the three-diurnal test sequence or the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, as described in §86.1230&hyph;96. * * * * * (3) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal emission test outlined in paragraph (p) of this section follows the alternate hot soak test specified in §86.1238&hyph;96(k). This test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. * * * * * 92. Section 86.1234&hyph;96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.1234&hyph;96 Running loss test. (a) Overview. Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles are to be tested for running loss emissions during simulated high-temperature urban driving; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. During operation, tank temperatures are controlled according to a prescribed profile to simulate in-use conditions. If the vehicle is determined to have exceeded the standard before the end of the running loss test, the test may be terminated without invalidating the data. The test can be run either in a sealed enclosure or with the point-source method, as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. * * * * * 93. Section 86.1238&hyph;96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.1238&hyph;96 Hot soak test. (a)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. For gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles, the hot soak test shall be conducted immediately following the running loss test. However, sampling of emissions from the running loss test is not required as preparation for the hot soak test. (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. Since gaseous-fueled vehicles are not required to perform a running loss test, the hot soak test shall be conducted within five minutes of the hot start exhaust test. * * * * * 94. Section 86.1242&hyph;90 of subpart M is amended by adding new paragraphs (m) and (n) to read as follows: §86.1242&hyph;90 Records required. * * * * * (m) For natural gas-fueled vehicles. Composition, including all carbon containing compounds; e.g. CO 2 , of the natural gas-fuel used during the test. C 1 and C 2 compounds shall be individually reported. C 3 and heavier hydrocarbons, and C 6 and heavier hydrocarbons may be reported as a group. (n) For liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Composition of the liquefied petroleum gas-fuel used during the test. Each hydrocarbon compound present, through C 4 compounds, shall be individually reported. C 5 and heavier hydrocarbons may be reported as a group. 95. Section 86.1243&hyph;96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) to read as follows: §86.1243&hyph;90 Calculations; evaporative emissions. (a) The following equations are used to calculate the evaporative emissions from gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles, and for gaseous-fueled vehicles. (b) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (ii) *␣*␣* (B) C HC =FID hydrocarbon concentration as ppm carbon including FID response to methanol (or methane, as applicable) in the sample. * * * * *
