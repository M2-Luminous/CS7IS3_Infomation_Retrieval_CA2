"We may withdraw" the six ministers from Hosokawa's 21-member cabinet, Murayama told a hurriedly arranged news conference in the early hours of Thursday morning in response to a reporter's question on how the SDP would respond if Hosokawa did not change his mind. If the SDP quits the coalition, the Hosokawa cabinet may have to resign en bloc, political sources said. Murayama blasted Hosokawa for waging a disinformation campaign in order to implement what he said would amount to a virtual raise in the rate of the current 3 percent consumption tax. "Even if the prime minister says Japan needs the new tax to cope with an increased welfare outlay for our rapidly aging society, the proposed new tax is tantamount to a consumption tax hike in essence," he said. He made the statements over an hour after Hosokawa announced that his coalition government has decided to introduce the "national welfare tax" to offset revenue shortfalls stemming from a 6 trillion yen tax cut. Hosokawa told a news conference the government wants to introduce the new tax from April 1, 1997. "The new tax will be introduced to finance the large cost of building up the social infrastructure, improving the people's living environment and financing growing welfare expenditures," Hosokawa said. Murayama said the new indirect tax on sales of most goods and services might dampen consumer spending, saying, "judging from the current recession, it is not wise to introduce such a new tax." "I told the prime minister that his administration should include wording in the new tax legislation that would obligate the government to use all the revenue from the new tax for expenditures related to welfare," he said. "However, the premier turned a deaf ear to our party's request," he said. "With the introduction of the new tax, the administration would only have changed the name of the consumption tax and the revenue, in actuality, will end up being spent for the general account of the state budget," he said. The Japanese public will never accept the government's argument that the new tax is necessary unless it explains why it needs to introduce such a tax by stating concrete figures and the items of outlays related to welfare which the tax will finance, he said.
