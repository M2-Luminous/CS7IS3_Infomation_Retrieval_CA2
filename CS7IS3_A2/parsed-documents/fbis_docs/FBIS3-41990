However, there has been very little credible evidence and this has been the reason why the Croatian Army so far has not openly reported it, stresses Professor Dr. Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve general of the Croatian Army and the defense minister's adviser for research and military-technical development. Piskor: General, your lecture on the application of chemical welfare in the clashes in the former Yugoslavia, which was given at Croatian Defense Ministry last week, has perplexed the public. Why did you present it to the public in such a shocking way and why only now? Binenfeld: You see, I am a scientist and I always insist that each claim must be supported by the appropriate evidence. There had been no material evidence for the use of chemical agents in Croatia even though there was much talk about it. We have the evidence now and we are presenting it to the public. This involves an Oganj rocket filled with the CS [chlorobenzamalonitride] chemical agent, which landed near Pokupski a year and a half ago and a hand grenade filled with the same chemical agent that was recently found near Zadar. Shocking Information Piskor: You have stated that the former Yugoslav National Army has approximately 100 tonnes of CS at its disposal. How great a danger does this represent? Binenfeld: Before I give a specific answer, I must explain something. I have been studying the problems of protection from chemical agents for 42 years. I have lectured at the Military Medical Academy and the Military Technical Faculty in Zagreb, I was an adviser to the former Yugoslav Government on the Disarmament Committee in Geneva, and a participant and lecturer at numerous international conventions on the use of and protection from chemical agents. Despite this, I did not know what the Yugoslav National Army was manufacturing in Bijelo Polje near Mostar. I thought that that they were manufacturing quantities of chemical agents that were only sufficient for protection tests, but in fact they manufactured large quantities. General Tus, the commander of the air force of the former Yugoslav National Army in Mostar, was not informed either, and not even the omniscient CIA had any such notion. [passage omitted] Piskor: There is growing evidence that chemical agents are being used in the clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the Muslim forces are using it increasingly often against the Croats. What is your view? Binenfeld: This whole business about the use of chemical agents in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I consider the use of chlorine to be a chemical agent, started long ago with Silajdzic's statement that, if given no other choice, they would use chlorine as a weapon. He threatened to poison all Europe with chlorine and similar nonsense. Had he used the chlorine in Tuzla he would have killed his own people first, because a chemical agent kills unselectively, and especially pays no attention to ethnicity. But they really do have 500 tonnes of chlorine in Tuzla and now comes the most dangerous bit about it. They have threatened to use chlorine against the Serbs and the Serbs have accused them of actually doing so. However, this is not certain because UN experts have found smoke boxes and not bombs filled with chlorine. However, they have used chlorine against the Croats several times. When we started to receive the initial reports about the use of chlorine-filled bombs in Vitez and Busovaca, for a long time we would not allow this to be revealed to the public until we held what we considered evidence. Evidence means the name of a hospital, a date, the name and surname of the patient, date of birth, symptoms, a medical examination, therapy, and the seal and signature of the physician in charge. Unfortunately, there is plenty of such evidence published. We have not received a denial of a single one either from the Muslims, whom we were accusing, or from the UN Protection Force. [passage omitted] Piskor: Grenades filled with chemical agents are being manufactured in Tuzla. However, is Tuzla dangerous just because of this? Binenfeld: Precisely. The Sodaso factory in Tuzla is a real ecological bomb. I studied the Sodaso factory in autumn 1992. Bearing in mind that I obtained information about the exact quantities of chemicals that they possess from the factory itself, I informed all the important officials in the world about the danger. They have all acknowledged it but nobody has done a thing about it. I have informed the world that the approximately 60 tonnes of mercury in Tuzla presents a danger of contamination spreading via the Spreca River practically all the way to the Black Sea. The representative of Tuzla in Zagreb has openly threatened to do this. Bearing in mind that, apart from mercury, they have more than 150 tonnes of a chemical similar to the one in Bhopal, where a tenth of the quantity caused a huge ecological catastrophe and killed several thousands of people, it becomes clear why I have said that Sodaso is a real barrel of gunpowder. There is also a great quantity of hydrochloric acid and other acids. If an explosion occurred, lethal concentrations of acids would emerge. It is actually difficult to anticipate what would happen, how many people would perish, how many would be injured, and what the environment would be like afterward. It would be a catastrophe. I have proposed that these chemicals be transported somewhere safe, but, naturally, again without any success. [passage omitted]
