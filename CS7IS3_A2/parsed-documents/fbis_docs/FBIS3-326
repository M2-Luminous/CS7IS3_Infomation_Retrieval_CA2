Chadian Interior Minister Abderamane Izzo yesterday accused the CSNPD leader, Moise Kette, of being responsible for the failure of recent talks in Bangui. Moise Kette, in return, blames the failure of the Bangui talks on the government in an interview with Raphael Mbadinga. [Begin recording] [Kette] Ndjamena blames us for the failure of the roundtable negotiations. We categorically reject this, as we think that it is Ndjamena which is to blame for the failure. We raised the real problem which has been tearing Chad apart for over 30 years: the form of the state. Each time we raise this problem, the government delegation retreats behind the idea of sovereignty so that it will not have to discuss the issue, although it well knows that this is the problem which has been undermining the country for 34 years. [Mbadinga] Will the negotiations resume shortly? [Kette] I think the mediating parties are maintaining contacts with the two parties and each party has gone back to its base to receive fresh instructions before coming back to the negotiating table. As far as we are concerned, for the Chadian problem to be definitely resolved we would prefer that all other political- military forces -- political parties and civil associations -- take part in the second meeting so that we bury the hatchet once and for all.
