Such a decision would have to have been made in the wake of certain mediatory efforts of friendly countries -- Iran and China. Iran has assured the Pakistani authorities that it will continue to work to help stop human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. Apart from this, India has also agreed to allow a delegation comprising representatives of Muslim countries to visit Kashmir to assess and observe the situation on the ground and the human rights condition there. Pakistan's decision to defer the resolution by one year is certainly not an exemplary decision, because, in our opinion, the adoption of the resolution would have been the best thing. However, a situation had arisen at the Human Rights Commission, under which Pakistan had to yield to the pressures of Iran, China, and 15 other friendly countries. It had become clear many days ago that about 40 or more of the 53-member commission did not intend to vote on the resolution and hardly 10-12 members could have agreed to vote. It was expected that some seven to eight members would vote in favor of the resolution. Hence, even though the resolution would have been adopted with a slight majority, it would not have exerted much moral influence and pressure and India could have refused to respect it. Opinions may vary on the method now adopted by the friendly countries and it can be said that Pakistan should not have deferred the resolution under any circumstances. The chairman of the Kashmir Committee and several opposition leaders have stated the same thing. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had also said that the resolution was not a game of statistics but a matter of principle and even if we were left alone, we would not refrain from supporting the cause of the Kashmiris. The decision to defer the resolution, obviously, seems to be contrary to this commitment, but, if viewed closely, it would not be appropriate to jump to the above conclusion. Pakistan has once again declared its intention to continue to fight for the cause of the Kashmiris and the foreign minister has stated in no uncertain terms that Pakistan will raise its voice in support of the Kashmiris at all international forums. He has also said that our resolution will always hang like a sword over India's head and we will be able to present it again at the UN General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Commission session. Thus, to assume that by deferring the resolution Pakistan has withdrawn its support to the Kashmiris will be totally erroneous and incomprehensible logic. The foreign minister's assertion that by tabling the resolution Pakistan has realized many of its objectives is correct to a great extent. This was not a mean achievement, as the BBC has said that after a gap of 29 years Pakistan has raised the Kashmir issue at every international forum. It is also true that during the debate on the resolution, the Kashmir dispute had become the focus of the world's attention. The member-countries, which had decided to abstain from the voting, also condemned India's action in occupied Kashmir. By tabling the resolution, Pakistan has also belied the Indian claim that the Kashmir dispute is a bilateral problem and that the Simla agreement does not empower Pakistan to raise the issue at any international forum. Pakistan has proved this stand as being completely wrong. Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao had to admit that most of the world nations were not paying heed to India's stand and were paying greater attention to what he called "irrelevant issues" like the human rights. The Indian leader also admitted that Pakistan appears to be a champion of human rights, while India is standing in the dock as a criminal in the court of international opinion. Narasimha Rao's confessions make it clear that Pakistan has achieved considerable success in projecting the Kashmir issue at the international level. One of the main clauses of the formula, under which Pakistan has deferred its resolution, is that a delegation of the member-countries of the Islamic Conference Organization will be allowed to visit Kashmir. In addition, other agencies like the Amnesty International and Red Cross will also enjoy the right to send their delegations to Kashmir. Earlier, two major delegations have already toured occupied Kashmir and 10 India-based foreign ambassadors are currently visiting the territory. That shows that India has been forced to open up Kashmir to international observers, which, in fact, was one of the major objectives of Pakistan. India has also promised to certain friendly countries to reduce its troops in occupied Kashmir and to improve the human rights situation there. However, India's past record has not been encouraging, as rightly suggested by Pakistani delegate Ahmad Kamal that whenever India comes under pressure, it makes certain promises, but when that pressure is removed, it deviates from its commitments. Nonetheless, it would not be that easy for India now to breach its promises because the entire world is keeping an eye on the situation in Kashmir. Therefore, to construe that Pakistan has deferred its resolution without achieving anything would be incorrect. The Kashmiris themselves and the Pakistanis have to wage a prolonged struggle to liberate the Kashmiris from Indian subjugation. One of the stages of this long struggle was to table the resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission. It has yielded some results and much success has been achieved in making the international public realize the importance of the Kashmir problem. This holy war and the struggle are still continuing and will continue in future. Pakistan will continue its efforts to help the 12.5 million Kashmiris achieve their right to self-determination. The tabling of the resolution was a kind of war on the Kashmir front, but the war is still continuing and we will certainly be crowned with success, and the Kashmiri people will finally emerge victorious.
