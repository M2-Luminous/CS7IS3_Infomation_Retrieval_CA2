Raul congratulated the teachers and students for a rewarding cultural performance, which included scenes of contemporary relevance as well as epidoses from the wars of independence. Later on, Raul met with Emilia Betancourt, president of the Oriente Rebelde People's Council, who told Raul that the local economy depends primarily on milk production, two Basic Cooperative Production Units, two credit and service cooperatives, and one farming cooperative. She added that self-sufficiency in vegetable and meat production is being promoted. Raul mentioned that Fidel had visited the area in November. Betancourt also told Raul about efforts to expand domestic fish farming in minidams and water tanks. The tour included the Oriente Mill, the most well preserved in Cuba, which is being restored as a sugar industry museum. Raul also viewed the plaque marking two important historic moments: Ignacio Agramonte's uprising, and General Maximo Gomez' battle camp in 1896. Omar del Risco, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Sibanicu, gave Raul a detailed briefing on the potential of fish farming as a food resource and added that there are plans to attain 500 metric tons of fish in 1994. Raul also talked with fishing Vice Minister Enrique Oltuski, who pointed out that compliance with technical specifications will allow the region to produce large quantities of fish. Raul stressed the rationality of the minidam program because it produces higher yields within a smaller area and brings the food closer to the consumers. Politburo member Julian Rizo agreed with Raul, adding that 7,000 liters of milk are distributed within Camaguey without the need for long-distance transport. Raul concluded that he will follow up on the development of this program, which will undoubtedly contribute to increasing food supplies for the people. He noted that this experience should be made available to other municipalities in the country.
