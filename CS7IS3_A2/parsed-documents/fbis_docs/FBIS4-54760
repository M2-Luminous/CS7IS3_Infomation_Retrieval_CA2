It is the aspiration of the Albanian people on both sides of the border, and also in the interest of all the peoples of the region and in the interest of the peace in europe that this ray of light, appearing on the horizon of international politics, has its impact in the reopening of the Albanian file, the Albanian intellectuals say. Their demands are based on the December 1960 resolution of the UN General Assembly, which says that "subjugation of peoples to a slavery, foreign domination and exploitation is a denial of the fundamental human rights, which runs contrary to the UN Charter and makes a compromise with the cause of peace and the world cooperation." They also cite Article 2 of this resolution which says that "all the peoples have the right to determine their destiny freely... they freely define their political status...." The Kosova question, the intellectuals say, is one of the fundamental components of the Yugoslav crisis which is not at all "An inner Serbian question" and by all means calls for a re-examining and proper solution based on new democratic principles. Opposing the thesis that the Albanians of Kosova make up a minority in Serbia, the Albanian intellectuals say that the Kosova question, taking into account its proportions and complexity, makes up a typical case of the colonial regime. Unless the hand of the Serbian occupiers is not halted on time, the intellectuals warn, they will commit a real holocaust against the Albanian population of Kosova. The albanian intellectuals, "Separated by Borders," ask Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the question of the future of Kosova and of all the Albanians residing in the former republics of the disintegrated Yugoslav Federation -- in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], southeastern Serbia and Montenegro -- be treated as soon as possible in a special international conference under the protection of the universal organisation. Imperative for the entire Albanian nation today is the recognition of the republic of Kosova as an independent, sovereign and neutral state placing it under the observation and protection of international bodies the recognition of the right of the Albanians of Macedonia, who make up 40 percent of its population to be a substantial constitutive component of the state recognition and observation of national and human rights according to the final act of Helsinki and the Paris Charter to the Albanians in Montenegro and southeastern Serbia. On behalf of the Albanian people they solemnly pledge that they will strictly observe these rights for its ethnic minorities. By ending the appeal, Albanian intellectuals hope that the UN secretary general will act quickly as is demanded by this question which threatens to degenerate into a conflict without any outcome.
