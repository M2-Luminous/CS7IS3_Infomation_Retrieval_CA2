Novikov, a Russian Democratic Reform Movement leader, laboratory chief at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Chemical Physics Institute, and a well known specialist in chemical weapons, accidentally "straying" from the subject of elections, stunned invited journalists by saying that the latest register of chemical weapons subject to elimination (under the convention on banning chemical weapons, which was signed by Russia) lists only five tonnes of mustard gas. It also clearly indicates that these are Russia's entire mustard gas reserves as of today. If this is so, a chilling question arises: What happened to tens of thousands of tonnes of this deadly chemical substance? Professor Novikov knows for sure that according to all post-war "catalogues," the quantity of mustard gas operational with the Armed Forces and located on Russian territory was measured precisely in these figures and that it has never been exported, destroyed, or dumped.
