The department faced a complete audit of financially economic activities for a three-year period, said Arturs Berzins, head of the ministry's Control and Revision Commission. The department's wages fund was exceeded 5,479 lats in 1993. In addition, 14,872 lats were paid in bonuses and social benefits, the commission said. Then-Director Maris Plavnieks also ungroundedly spent budget resources on insurance of department's employees for more that 46,000 U.S. dollars. The money was transferred to the Austria-based Save-Invest firm, which lacked license to operate in Latvia. The insurance deal was one of the sidesteppings for which Plavnieks was fired Dec. 14, 1993. The department wired the money without concluding any contracts. The only documents to confirm the deal are insurance policies. The ministry will try to recover the money, if necessary, with a help by the Economic Court, said Interior Ministry's Janis Balins. In addition, the department lacks any form of internal control, like proper accounting and stock taking. Plavnieks told reporters that the wages fund was overdrafted to keep qualified employees from moving to better paid jobs. Speaking on the controversial insurance deal, Plavnieks said that Save-Invest was only a mediator firm but the insuring was done on highly favorable terms in the Fortuna firm, which is, in his words, one of the 12 largest insurance companies worldwide. Ints Zitars currently performs the duties of the department's acting director.
