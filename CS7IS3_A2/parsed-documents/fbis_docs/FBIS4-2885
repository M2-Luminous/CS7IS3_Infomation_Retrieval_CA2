While admitting that Beijing had yet to make a full study of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report released Wednesday, foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said an initial reading showed it to be factually incorrect and supportive of London's erroneous policies on Hong Kong. "This report, in total disregard of the facts, actually tries to defend the series of erroneous practises of the British government and (Hong Kong Governor) Chris Patten on the issue of Hong Kong," Shen said. It also "supports them to continue on their wrong way," he added. The highly critical 100-page report on Sino-British relations up to and after 1997, when the British colony reverts to Chinese rule, said the breakdown in negotiations between Beijing and London signalled "the probable end of the process envisaged in 1984 of a 'through train' to 1997 and beyond. The "through train" concept, built into the 1984 Basic Law and Joint Declaration on Hong Kong, assumed those elected to the colony's Legislative Council (Legco) in 1995 would continue to serve out their terms after the handover. However, says the report: "China has announced that the Legco elected in 1995 will be disbanded in 1997, and indeed, the Chinese may seek to undermine its authority before that date. A British government is powerless to prevent this from happening." Shen said the Chinese side would comment further on the report after making a full study of its contents.
