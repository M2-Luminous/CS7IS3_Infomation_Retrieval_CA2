This can be seen in the 1993 annual report by the Federal Debt Administration. The supreme federal authority for financial administration bases its information on the 1994 budget law as well as on the medium-term financial planning. Even though by 1997 new debts are supposed to be halved, compared with 1993, to DM38 billion, annual repayments will at least triple to DM215 billion because of the preceding high loans. The burden of interests will rise by DM22 billion to about DM69 billion. Measured by the overall budget expenditures, this means an increase in the interest burden from 10 to almost 14 percent. The long-term overview of the Federal Debt Administration shows that, over the past few years in particular, the liabilities of the Federal Government have been soaring to astronomical heights. During the 20 years from 1950 to 1970 they rose from DM6.1 billion to DM45.5 billion. During the following 10 years federal debts quintupled to DM230 billion. During the next 10 years (until 1990) liabilities rose clearly more moderately, but, with DM542 billion, they exceeded the limit of DM0.5 trillion for the first time. By the end of 1993 this amount rose to DM685 billion. At the same time, the year 1993 was the climax (so far) of annual gross borrowing with DM149 billion. The same goes for net borrowing (gross borrowing minus repayment): With DM78.5 billion, the Federal Government's new debts were about three times higher than in 1980. At the end of 1993 the Federal Debt Administration administered financial debts by the Federal Government and its special funds amounting to a total of DM943 billion. The overall debts of the public budgets (including railroads and post, plus laender and communities) is estimated at almost DM1.6 trillion. This would correspond to a 50-percent share in the overall (nominal) GNP in 1993. In 1980, for instance, this debt quota was 32 percent in western Germany, in 1970 only 19 percent. In 1970 the debt burden had a share in the GNP of not more than 17 percent. Thus, the debt quota has practically tripled within the past 30 years or so. In international comparison, too, Germany has deteriorated considerably. According to the Federal Debt Administration, the financial debts of the Federal Government's special funds reached DM309 billion last Year, which is almost twice as much as in 1990 and 11 times as much as in 1970. The largest chunks go to the Bundespost, the federal railroads, and the "German Unity" Fund. In addition, there are the liabilities of the European Recovery Program special fund, the Hard Coal Equalization Fund, the so-called Loan Repayment Fund, and the financial debts of the East German Railroads. The Federal Government holds about half of the overall debts of the public budgets, which amount to almost DM1.6 trillion; the special funds hold one-tenth, the laender (west and east) one-quarter, the communities, railroads, and post one-tenth. The Federal Debt Administration points out that, because of the railroad reform, in 1994 it has to take over the so far not administered railroad debts, which is 1,200 loans against notes of the federal railroads amounting to about DM26 billion. The Federal Government financed almost two-fifths of the gross borrowing of DM149 billion last year by issuing loans. About one-third were federal bonds, 12 percent federal treasury notes, and 9 percent each federal treasury letters and financial assets. Depending on their terms, about two-fifths each go to loans over nine years and to liabilities between two and five years. Approximately 10 percent of the loans each have terms of five to nine years or up to two years. Almost half of the portfolio of DM685 billion goes to loans, about one-fourth to federal bonds, and about 10 percent to federal treasury notes.
