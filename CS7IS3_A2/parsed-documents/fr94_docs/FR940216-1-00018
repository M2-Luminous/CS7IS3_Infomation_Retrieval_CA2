FR940216-1-00018 FR940216-1-00008 Paragraph (c) currently prohibits removing timber or other forest product except to a place designated for scaling. As some forest products are recorded by means other than scaling, a proposed revision to this paragraph would clarify that it is prohibited to remove such products except to a place designated for scaling or other means of recording by a forest officer. Paragraph (d) currently prohibits the marking of trees or other forest products to be cut or removed in a manner similar to that employed by Forest officers. This paragraph would be revised to prohibit the counterfeit marking of trees to be left uncut on a timber sale. During the past 2 years, at least one Forest Service region has encounter numerous markings of ``leave'' trees on timber sales that were never marked by Forest Service personnel. Investigation or later communication to the agency by the person(s) claiming responsibility revealed that these markings were made to hamper Forest Service timber sales efforts by trying to confuse timber sale purchasers as to which trees could be cut and which trees were to be left. Where this has occurred, Forest officers have had to re-mark portions of timber sales incurring additional agency costs. Paragraph (e), which prohibits the removal or hauling of timber or other forest products unless it is properly identified by the terms of a special use authorization or contract, would be revised for clarity by removing the word ``hauling'' and adding in its place the words ``transporting'' and ``possessing.'' The revision is needed to better define the offense and to make clear that possession of forest products without the proper identification as required by a special use authorization or timber sale contract is prohibited. A new paragraph (i) is proposed to prohibit ``altering, adding, moving, or removing any stamp, brand, paint, timber sale boundary marker or tag, or other identification on any tree *␣*␣* previously marked or surveyed by a Forest officer *␣*␣*.'' This addition is needed due to the increasing number of cases where legitimate brands, paint, and timber sale boundary markers have been altered, moved, or removed. In pursuing such cases, the agency has discovered that the current rules do not adequately address this practice. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.7␣Livestock Paragraph (a) currently prohibits ``placing or allowing unauthorized livestock to enter or to be in the National Forest System *␣*␣*.'' In a recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case ( United States v. Semenza , 835 F.3d 223 (9th Cir. 1987)), the court stated that the inclusion of the words ``placing'' and ``allowing'' required the government to prove that the livestock owner meant to violate this rule intentionally. This interpretation is not consistent with the agency's intent; therefore paragraph (a) would be revised by removing the words ``placing'' or ``allowing'' to make clear that unauthorized livestock are prohibited without regard to whether a person intended to place or allow such livestock on National Forest System lands. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.8␣Fish and Wildlife Paragraph (a) currently prohibits the ``hunting, trapping, fishing, catching, molesting, killing, or having in possession any kind of wild animal, birds, or fish'' to the extent that Federal or State laws are violated. Under the proposed rule, this paragraph would be expanded to include the words ``transporting, buying, selling, bartering, or offering to buy'' wild animals, birds, or fish to cover additional activities prohibited by State or Federal laws which Forest officers routinely encounter in the field. The revision would also add ``shellfish'' to the existing rule, as there are several large shellfish beds on the National Forest System in Washington State, and these are not protected under the current rule. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.9␣Property The heading of this section would be revised to read ``Property administered by the Forest Service'' to clarify that the prohibitions apply to United States Government property rather than to the personal property of a forest visitor. In addition, the introduction to the section would be revised to state: ``Except as provided by special use authorization, contract, approved plan of operations, or Federal law or regulation, the following are prohibited *␣*␣*.'' This revision is proposed so these authorizing documents only have to be stated once in the section, rather than in each paragraph. Existing paragraph (a) would be revised and combined with existing paragraph (b) and expanded to prohibit ``disturbing, damaging, excavating, diggings, removing, transporting, possessing, buying, selling, bartering, or offering to buy, sell, or barter any natural feature or other property of the United States.'' By incorporating this change into part 261, the agency will be able to cite persons for property violations as misdemeanors rather than as felonies under the United States Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 641 and 1361) when appropriate.
