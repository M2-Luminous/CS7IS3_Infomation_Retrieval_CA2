"We wish to open domestic treasury bonds to foreign investors as soon as possible," said Gao Jian, vice-director of the Ministry of Finance's Department of State Debt Administration. Gao said that a timetable has not yet been set but that it seems sure no action will be taken this year. He said the ministry has specified several issues for consideration while planning how to offer treasury bonds to foreigners. Firstly, the bonds opened to foreign investors should be the same as those available to domestic investors. That means they must carry the same coupon rates for the same terms of maturity to ensure the market's integrity. Secondly, the bonds should be denominated in renminbi so the government will not bear foreign exchange risks. Thirdly, the bonds should have longer terms of maturity to diversify the structure of bonds. This is reinforced by the preference American institutional investors have for longer maturities, Gao said. In fact, Gao said, his department was very close to coming up with a programme to open the government securities market to foreign investors in the first half of 1993, when authorities had great difficulty selling treasury bonds. The government eventually sold out all the bonds so the programme was suspended, then finally scrapped. The plan was to sell some of the five-year treasury bonds to foreign investors. The maturity and annual coupon rate were the same as those for primary dealers. Foreign investors would have had to convert their foreign currencies into renminbi before buying the treasury bonds. The proposal also specified the financial status of foreign securities firms, allowing them to subscribe treasury bonds on the primary market and trade them on the secondary market. Gao said foreign participation would not only broaden the capital base for bonds but would also heighten competitiveness in the bond market. Opening the market is an important measure to be taken next year to help build up a market-oriented bond-trading system. "We anticipate a market-oriented government securities framework to be underway two years from now," he said. If that is the case, Gao said, lots of things need to be done next year. For example, he said, the primary dealer system must be more fully developed. The Ministry of Finance is reviewing applications from banks and financial institutions that want to be primary dealers. Meanwhile, the feeling is growing that the country should also develop short-term treasury bonds. "We strongly suggest that six-month bonds should be renewed," Gao said. "Maturity should be diversified into three months and nine months."
