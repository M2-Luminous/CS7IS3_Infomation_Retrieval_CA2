FR940630-1-00026 FR940630-1-00007 40 CFR Part 55 [FRL&hyph;5005&hyph;7] Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations; Consistency Update for California AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPR''); consistency update. . SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to update a portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations. Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa Barbara County APCD), the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated COAs. The OCS requirements for the above Districts, contained in the Technical Support Document, are proposed to be incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations and are listed in the appendix to the OCS air regulations. Proposed changes to the existing requirements are discussed below. DATES: Comments on the proposed update must be received on or before August 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments must be mailed (in duplicate if possible) to: EPA Air Docket (A&hyph;5), Attn: Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;16 Section V, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and Toxics Division, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, CA 94105. Docket: Supporting information used in developing the proposed notice and copies of the documents EPA is proposing to incorporate by reference are contained in Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;16 (Section V). This docket is available for public inspection and copying Monday&hyph;Friday during regular business hours at the following locations: EPA Air Docket (A&hyph;5), Attn: Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;16 Section V, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and Toxics Division, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, CA 94105.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christine Vineyard, Air and Toxics Division (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), U.S. EPA Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. (415) 744&hyph;1197. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 4, 1992, EPA promulgated 40 CFR part 55 1 , which established requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources in order to attain and maintain federal and state ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. Part 55 applies to all OCS sources offshore of the States except those located in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87.5 degrees longitude. Section 328 of the Act requires that for such sources located within 25 miles of a state's seaward boundary, the requirements shall be the same as would be applicable if the sources were located in the COA. Because the OCS requirements are based on onshore requirements, and onshore requirements may change, section 328(a)(1) requires that EPA update the OCS requirements as necessary to maintain consistency with onshore requirements. 1 The reader may refer to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, December 5, 1991 (56 FR 63774), and the preamble to the final rule promulgated September 4, 1992 (57 FR 40792) for further background and information on the OCS regulations. Pursuant to §55.12 of the OCS rule, consistency reviews will occur (1) at least annually; (2) upon receipt of a Notice of Intent (NOI) under §55.4; and (3) when a state or local agency submits a rule to EPA to be considered for incorporation by reference in part 55. This NPR is being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules by three local air pollution control agencies. Public comments received in writing within 30 days of publication of this notice will be considered by EPA before promulgation of the final updated rule. Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. This limits EPA's flexibility in deciding which requirements will be incorporated into part 55 and prevents EPA from making substantive changes to the requirements it incorporates. As a result, EPA may be incorporating rules into part 55 that do not conform to all of EPA's state implementation plan (SIP) guidance or certain requirements of the Act. Consistency updates may result in the inclusion of state or local rules or regulations into part 55, even though the same rules may ultimately be disapproved for inclusion as part of the SIP. Inclusion in the OCS rule does not imply that a rule meets the requirements of the Act for SIP approval, nor does it imply that the rule will be approved by EPA for inclusion in the SIP. EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action In updating 40 CFR part 55, EPA reviewed the state and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 to ensure that they are rationally related to the attainment or maintenance of federal or state ambient air quality standards or part C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure they are not arbitrary or capricious. 40 CFR 55.12 (e). In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules. 2 2 Upon delegation the onshore area will use its administrative and procedural rules as onshore. In those instances where EPA does not delegate authority to implement and enforce part 55, EPA will use its own administrative and procedural requirements to implement the substantive requirements. 40 CFR 55.14 (c)(4). A. After review of the rules submitted by the Santa Barbara County APCD against the criteria set forth above and in 40 CFR part 55, EPA is proposing to make the following rules applicable to OCS sources for which the Santa Barbara County APCD is designated as the COA. None of the existing OCS requirements were deleted. The following new rules were submitted by the District to be added: Rule 316␣Storage and Transfer of Gasoline (Adopted 12/14/93) Rule 325␣Crude Oil Production and Separation (Adopted 1/25/94) Rule 326␣Storage of Reactive Organic Liquid Compounds (Adopted 12/14/93)
