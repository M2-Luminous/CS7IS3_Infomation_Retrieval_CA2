FR940110-1-00021 FR940110-1-00002 Additionally, an individual dairy farmer who supplies producer milk to Land-O-Sun filed a comment in support of the suspension. He stated that if Land-O-Sun paid him a lesser price for his milk he would have to sell to another handler. Coburg Dairy, a Carolina order handler located in Charleston, South Carolina, filed a comment opposing the suspension. Coburg competes with the Kingsport plant for Class I sales in the Carolina market. The handler argued that the regulation of the Kingsport plant under the Tennessee Valley order would give the plant a competitive advantage in the Carolina market since it has a lower Class I price and because it presumably would not have to pay over-order prices to its producers. The North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation, a general farm organization, also objected to the proposed suspension on the grounds that regulation of the Kingsport plant under Order 11 would jeopardize the over-order prices in the Carolina market. The Federation indicated that eroding Class I premiums and lower Class I utilization were threatening the health of the dairy industry in North Carolina. In response to the Armour Food request, a notice of proposed suspension of the net shipment provision of Order 46 was issued on September 22, 1993 (DA&hyph;93&hyph;26) (58 FR 50526). Three comments were submitted. Southern Belle supported the suspension, indicating that Armour was supplying it with milk and could encounter problems of assembly and transportation if the plant became subject to the provisions of Order 46 because of a shift in regulation of the Southern Belle plant from Order 11 to Order 46. Milk Marketing, Inc., a cooperative association with 688 dairy farmers under Order 46, and The Kroger Company, a handler operating Winchester Farms Dairy at Winchester, Kentucky, filed comments opposing the proposed suspension of the net shipment provision. MMI argued that if the net shipment provision is suspended, the intent of the order would not be carried out appropriately and that the needs of the order would not be met in an efficient manner. Kroger stated that there was not an abundant amount of milk available for fluid use under Order 46 and that the net shipment provision was needed to help assure that distributing plants have sufficient supplies of milk to meet their fluid requirements. It contends that there is no justification to relax the performance provisions of the order during the season when milk availability is reduced and Class I sales increase simply because there is a ``possibility'' that a distributing plant may switch regulation from Order 11 to Order 46. No final action has been taken on Armour's request to suspend the net shipment provision. However, since that issue would become moot under the proposed suspension being considered herein, final action on the Armour proposal is being held in abeyance pending the outcome of the current proposal.
