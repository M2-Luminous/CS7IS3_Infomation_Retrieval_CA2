[passage omitted] In the first sermon we will continue the discussion on social justice. [passage omitted] In last year's sermons I spoke about resources; but less was said about expenditures last year. So in the first sermon this year we spoke about it. I think I should list a few more in the next few sermons. In the last sermon I referred to subsidies as one of the areas of realizing justice in the distribution of the treasury and the government's financial resources. Briefly, what I meant was that there were unjust subsidies left from the distant past, that some injustices have been eradicated, and there are important areas left. I referred to fuel and bread and some other items [subsidies] which are still unfair. Of course, I explained then that since they are very important and have a great effect on life, one cannot take instantaneous decisions about them. It needs planning, and problems arising in conjunction with removing subsidies should be considered. Therefore, we will keep them until our plan is ready. In the second five-year plan there are certain indications for this to happen in five years, but in our view even five years are not enough. It needs at least 10 years for us to remove the inequities which exist in fuel and bread consumption in the society. But then, some media rushed in and said that speech smelled of new price rises. It is not so. I stressed then that it will be done with planning. God willing, part of those plans are in the Majles and other parts will be prepared later. Our people should not worry about rash and quick measures in these sensitive times. We will act cautiously. I said then that some actions would arouse resentment against the government because they might put severe pressure on the people. Therefore, such tasks will be carried out with prudence.
