According to specialists, it was a success and to some extent will enable Russian enterprises engaged in producing small arms and hand-held artillery to improve their economic position. Not at once, it is true. It will take quite some time for the new models of weapons, military gear, and optics which were exhibited -- and most of which are unparalleled in the world -- to find rich buyers. Although representatives of over 30 foreign firms, governments, ministries of defense, and other departments visited the exhibition, experience of similar events in the past shows that business offers should be expected later, when foreign businessmen and experts have analyzed all the information obtained. Our arms manufacturers are preparing to work in new conditions: The government's May decree gives manufacturing enterprises the right to engage in autonomous foreign economic activity. But will this accelerate sales of output which has accumulated in plants? Will the autonomy that has been granted not remain imaginary? Are the producers themselves ready for such free floating? Here are the views of professionals, which I have heard. Nikolay Kovalchuk, general director of the "Zavod imeni V. Degtyareva" Joint-Stock Company, city of Kovrov: "Since we will be permitted to obtain a license and to trade in weapons, then, technologically, we must have our own pricing specialists, market analysts, and traveling salesmen. "Quite a long time will pass while they are making the acquaintance of potential buyers and finding out who is behind whom and with which grouping or which shaykh it makes sense to talk and with which it does not. But what will be the good of a sale several years later? Maybe, while earning dollars today, tomorrow we will start losing them -- in hundreds and thousands? I believe that the process might drag on. Therefore we must use structures which have experience of the arms trade and with which we have long-standing ties." Vladimir Pankov, leading engineer of a machine-building design bureau, city of Kolomna: "While you are agreeing all the parameters of contracts with many official organs, the client simply loses patience. The time it takes to register jobs is approximately doubled. Frequently there is also unjustified interference in prices. "There is a fear that, just as we `ate our way' through petrodollars in the past, so now we might lose dollars from sales of at least that section of weapons in which we are permitted to trade. They will be 'eaten' precisely by the intermediate structures." Yuriy Sergeyev, chief of a department of Tula Instrument Making Design Bureau: "There was, is, and will be a monopoly of the arms trade. If the `Rosvooruzheniye' State Company conducts talks with our participation, we will not be selling too cheaply, as the saying goes. But if it does so without us, then the features of our output are not always correctly highlighted. It happens that a single model of a weapon is sold, and not at a high price either. It turns out that it has been sold for cognitive-intelligence purposes. We lose our potential and give up our product for nothing. "We are not adversaries or rivals of the `Rosvooruzheniye' State Company. We must work alongside it in studying world experience of the arms trade and engage in marketing research so as to get a result." Mikhail Zakharov, vice president of the "Spetsialnoye Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya" Joint-Stock Company and in the recent past deputy minister of the defense industry, who now tackles questions of the arms trade: "In the past the people of Tula were granted autonomy, and nothing came of that. The decree elicited in me a dual feeling. What was the point of it, if it ran counter to previously issued documents, particularly the president's edict on setting up the `Rosvooruzheniye' State Company as a monopoly organization? It essentially does not give enterprises sufficient rights for autonomous trade in weapons. In addition, very many competing organizations from Russia will appear on the market -- which will not produce positive results. It is said that they do not let us onto the market. But we ourselves have not yet learned how to trade." The position of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company itself was presented by Aleksandr Semenov, deputy chief of the regional policy administration. In his opinion, the decree's publication certainly does not mean that tomorrow all enterprises will run to conquer the foreign market with their output. The right to participate in military-technical cooperation with foreign countries is granted them only if certain conditions are observed. It is necessary, among other things, to undergo two-level certification and registration. The commission on foreign economic cooperation, which will be headed by First Vice Premier O. Soskovets, will have the final say. Thus, the question of whether there is a monopoly of the arms trade in Russia remains open.
