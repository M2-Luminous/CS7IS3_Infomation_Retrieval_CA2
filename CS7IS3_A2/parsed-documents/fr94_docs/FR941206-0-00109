Section 73.3555 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) and (e)(1)(i) to read as follows: (a)␣*␣*␣* (3)␣*␣*␣* (iii) A station's ``audience share'' is the average number of persons age 12 or older on an average quarter-hour basis, Monday&hyph;Sunday, 6 a.m.&hyph;midnight, who listen to the station expressed as a percentage of the average number of persons listening to AM and FM stations in that radio metro market or a recognized equivalent, in which a majority of the overlap between the same service stations involved in the transaction takes place. The ``combined audience share'' is the total audience share of all AM or FM stations that would be under common ownership or control following a proposed acquisition. In situations where the majority of the overlap between the same service stations does not lie in a single metro market, the relevant audience share data is the data for all counties that are within the principal community contours of the mutually overlapping stations proposed for common ownership, in whole or in part, weighted based on the listening population, age 12 and older, and totalled to determine the average audience share. Audience share shall be calculated by using the most recent published audience share data available at the time that the application is filed, unless an alternative showing is submitted pursuant to the Note following 47 CFR 73.3555(a)(1)(ii). * * * * * (e)␣*␣*␣* (1)␣*␣*␣* (i) more than 20 AM or more than 20 FM stations, provided, however, that minority controlled entities may acquire an additional five stations per service above the national limit, and that multiple owners that are not minority controlled may hold an attributable, but not controlling, interest in five additional stations per service above the national limit that are minority controlled or small business controlled; * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29941 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
