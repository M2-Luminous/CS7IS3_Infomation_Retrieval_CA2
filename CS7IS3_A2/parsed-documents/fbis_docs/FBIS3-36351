The United States pledges to send Latvia internationally recognized experts to monitor the agreement's implementation, said Saeima (parliament) Foreign Committee head Alexander Kirsteins. Latvia's Way's Andrejs Pantelejevs underlined that Latvian security was important not only to his country but also to American and European security, judging by the results of this week's meetings in Washington. The U.S. Government confirmed its interestedness in the conclusion of a formal agreement between Latvia and Russia on the withdrawal of the Russian troops and the dismantling of the Skrunda radar station. The Russian Government promised the United States to get the remaining troops out of Latvia until the end of August on condition Latvia allows it retain the Skrunda radar for four years and 18 months. If Latvia rejects the term and follows its own way to reach an accord with Russia, the United States declines to extend any subsequent security guarantees. Latvia, however, will accept the proposal only if the new building of the Skrunda early-warning antimissile installation will be pulled down immediately, said Pantelejevs. The United States supports Latvia's signature to NATO's Partnership for Peace program and will help Latvia with technical provisions, Kirsteins said. The Latvian delegation met with President Bill Clinton, State Secretary Warren Christopher, Deputy State Secretary Strobe Talbott and Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry.
