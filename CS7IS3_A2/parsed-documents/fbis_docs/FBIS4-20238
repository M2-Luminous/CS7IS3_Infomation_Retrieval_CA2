Both candidates, who are still formally undeclared, are firm but pragmatic federalists and would want to push ahead further and faster with Maastricht-style integration. Dehaene has pulled ahead of his Dutch rival in the race to win the top job in Brussels and represent Europe on the world stage thanks to tokens of support from France and Germany. Senior sources in Copenhagen have revealed to THE EUROPEAN that Denmark is also throwing its weight behind the Belgian. Meanwhile Britain, apparently fearful that it could end up backing a loser, now appears to be ready to swing behind Dehaene in spite of his strongly federalist views. Although London believes that Sir Leon Brittan, its senior European Commissioner, has the vision to acquit himself well in the job, the government has begun to recognise that as a former member of the Thatcher cabinet he is unlikely to win sufficient backing from Britain's European partners. "We don't want to be seen to be vetoing Dehaene. He is becoming unstoppable," said one top British diplomat. Even so, such an endorsement will embarrass the British prime minister, who crossed swords with Dehaene recently in the row over the blocking minority in the Council of Ministers. Conservative MPs in Westminster are already angry that Delors' successor seems certain to share his enthusiasm for extending Brussels' powers. Until recently Lubbers, 54, the Netherlands' longest serving prime minister and chairman of the European Summit which approved the Maastricht Treaty, had been seen as Delors' natural heir. But he has refused to throw his hat in the ring until the Dutch go to the polls on 3 May. He will then step down after 12 years as the head of the government and leave the domestic political scene. Lubbers' critics say he has lost Chancellor Kohl's support partly because he bent over backwards at Maastricht to placate the UK on the planned European social legislation and partly because he was hesitant in endorsing German reunification. But Lubbers cohorts have not yet thrown in the towel. "Dehaene was only contacted by Kohl and President Mitterrand to ensure they had a second candidate in case Lubbers dropped out," predicted one Dutch commentator. "Lubbers cannot speak out now and will have to wait until after the election." In the meantime Dehaene has been making the running. Variously nicknamed, the "bulldozer" or the "bomb disposal expert," he has reportedly told senior party colleagues: "If I am invited to become Commission president I will certainly not decline the offer." The director general of GATT, Irishman Peter Sutherland, has announced that he will leave Geneva at the end of his current term of office in December, but he is seen very much as an outsider. In some European capitals, including London and Madrid, there is dismay that so few eligible candidates exist for the coveted role. "You would think that there might be some real choice but in the end only a couple of people stand a chance, and they have a virtually identical outlook," said a British diplomat. Despite this, both Britain and Spain have been reassured by the background of Dehaene. He has a reputation of being a pragmatic federalist who wants to strengthen the EU [European Union]. But as a Christian Democrat used to surviving in coalition governments, he is seen as a conciliator. Dehaene is also a far more clubbable individual than Lubbers, according to observers. As Commission presidents their styles would be different: the tenacious, table-thumping Dehaene compared with the more urbane Lubbers. Above all, neither man is seen as such a powerful visionary as Delors, something that has made the Frenchman seem doubly dangerous in the eyes of Eurosceptics. Nonetheless the selection of the ninth Commission president comes at a crucial time for the Union. First, the new man has to smooth the arrival of Austria and three Scandinavian countries into the EU. Even more perilous will be steering the EU through the minefield of the next phase of treaty reform in 1996, a process which risks reopening the scars of the Maastricht Treaty debate. This threatens to expose gaping wounds in the Union: two camps are already emerging between those like Germany and France who want a fresh dose of federalism and those like Britain who want to put the entire process into reverse. The debate must be conducted not just with the groundswell of popular opposition Brussels apparently growing, but with Spain, Italy and Britain beginning to ask themselves against the use qualified majority voting which streamlines EU decision-making [sentence as published]. Heads of government must come to a final choice on who is to follow Delors at the June Summit on Corfu. But if they are to avoid an almighty row, the decision will effectively be stitched up behind closed doors well before then. After 10 years with a Socialist from a large country at the helm, the pendulum dictates that Delors' successor should be a Christian Democrat, even though only four EU members -- Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands -- have Christian Democrats in power. But in the complex three-dimensional chess of EU politics, the favourite does not always grab the prize. Ten years ago, the odds-on contender to become Commission president was the former European Commission French foreign minister and Anglophile Claude Cheysson. Britain's then prime minister Margaret Thatcher, vetoed him and gave her approval to the second choice, compromise candidate, Jacques Delors. The rest is history.
