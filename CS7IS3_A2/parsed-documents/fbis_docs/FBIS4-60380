In an article today, the paper, the mouthpiece of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says: Regardless of this renewal and continuation of the embargo, Washington knows well that Iraq is not an easy prey and that Iraq will continue to be a thorn that bleeds the enemies' soft spot, deprives them of sleep, and obstructs their plans. The paper says that despite all the conspiracies concocted against its principles, Iraq will continue to adhere to its leadership and to care for its unity. Iraq is capable of foiling all the evil greed by further patience, steadiness, and perseverance. AL-THAWRAH continues: We do not pin much hope on lifting the unfair embargo through a Security Council resolution. Instead, we wager on Iraq's continued patience and perseverance in order to fragment and terminate the embargo. The paper stresses that all signs confirm that [word indistinct] is with us and that what appears on the surface in terms of conspiracies and renewed embargo are only futile attempts.
