Thus, he clearly stated that as long as there is no progress in South-North relations, including the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, he has no intention of proposing the summit. During the news conference on the first anniversary of his inauguration in February, President Kim had said: "I will hold the South-North summit talks if it is necessary to solve the nuclear issue." However, when asked why he is expressing a different opinion now, he said: "This is because of the considerable change in the situation compared with that time." He also added: "North Korea ruptured the talks itself when it threatened us during the working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys in March with the remark of turning the South into a `sea of fire.'"
