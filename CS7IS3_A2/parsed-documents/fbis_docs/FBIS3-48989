The PSDR delegation consisted of Messrs. Sergiu Cunescu, Constantin Avramescu, Radu Gheciu, Radu Dumitrescu, and Emil Putin. Today's meeting was also attended by Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, presidential adviser and spokesman of the presidency, and Mr. Paul Dobrescu, presidential adviser. After the meeting, PSDR President Sergiu Cunescu made the following statement: [Begin Cunescu recording] We presented our viewpoint on this declared desire to conclude a political pact. We said that a political pact can only be achieved between political forces that are sincerely interested in moving along the road of reform. We did not discuss issues related to the formation of a new government but only to putting together a new parliamentary majority. This parliamentary majority should only consist of the groups from the Democratic Convention [CDR] and the parliamentary group of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Since these two alone cannot put together a sufficiently broad and stable majority, which should not be at the mercy of several deputies who may occasionally decide to change sides, we believe that another important parliamentary group should also participate in this effort, namely the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)], which one can count on as a reformist group. We cannot rely on other groups if we want to achieve this kind of stability; maybe one could take into consideration certain individuals from the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR]. Therefore, if this new parliamentary majority is put together, we could proceed -- with this majority and the respective parties -- to negotiate a political pact that contains the principles and main actions for a more stable political activity in the future. If such a pact can be eventually achieved, then a second part should follow, namely negotiations on a social pact with the important social factors in our country, particularly the trade unions, students, and other social sectors. Therefore, we are talking about two documents: a political one, to be concluded among parties, and a social one, to be concluded with the trade unions. There are possibilities for reaching this goal, if the current majority party shows the political will to move along these lines. In order for this to happen, the majority party must accept certain new things and other attitudes than the ones it is practicing today. The discussions also focused on the statements made yesterday by PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase, who outlined his conditions for such a pact. He raised the issue of the observance of the Constitution. We agree with his point and have always said that -- although we did not vote in favor of the Constitution for various reasons -- we will observe it, literally. As you know, we are in favor of a parliamentary republic. The second condition he raised was the need to observe the republican form of state. Again, we have no objection to that, since we are republicans -- that is, we are in favor of a parliamentary republic. Third, he raised the astounding issue of the return of the nationalized houses to their owners. He should not have raised this issue, but since he did, we also discussed it and stressed that we will support a law on restoring the nationalized houses to their owners, but that this law will not be able to solve all cases from the very beginning, just the most blatant cases. The situation should be further dealt with gradually by successively promulgating new laws that ensure that the tenants are never at a disadvantage and are secure in their homes. All instances should be dealt with individually in keeping with the justification and strength of each case. We also discussed various other political issues. We stated that we plan to stand by our overall principles and will remain faithful to the CDR, since we believe in it and actually initiated it. From the various notes the president took of our conversation, we hope that he retained many of our ideas and that the two aforementioned pacts can be achieved. We did not raise the issue of the government, which can be an outcome of later endeavors. The main thing is to put together a new parliamentary majority. [end recording]
