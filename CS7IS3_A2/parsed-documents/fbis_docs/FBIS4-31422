Mijusko Tomic reports. [Begin recording] [Tomic] Despite the sanctions that have been imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Army does not lag behind other countries and armies, while its combat readiness is significantly higher and stronger than that of any other neighboring country, said General Perisic. It is founded on the best traditions of the Serbian and Montenegrin people, and it is ready to defend the independence and territorial integrity of our country, said Chief of General Staff Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic, and stressed: [Perisic] I am saying that there is no direct or immediate danger of war. A danger of war exists because the enemy -- the creator of the new world order -- has embarked on destroying the state of the Serbs and Montenegrins. Once he destroys their state, then we will behave in the manner of stateless people, and you know what stateless peoples are like. [sentence as heard] Better any kind of state than no state at all. Therefore, there is a great danger of war breaking out, great [danger], but I am saying that currently there is no immediate [danger], precisely because of the people's heroic resistance whom the Yugoslav People's Army [as heard] first trained, then armed, and lastly, organized and gave them the initial impulse to defend and succeed in defending what it has accomplished so far. I might also add the following: militarily speaking, more could not have been accomplished, of course, in areas where the people embraced this army as their own. [sentence as heard] [Tomic] Members of the Yugoslav Army are satisfied with journalists' approach regarding the presentation of the comprehensive combat readiness and ability of the Yugoslav Army. It is necessary for a journalist to spread the truth about the army, rather than lies, which is what some journalists are doing, said Chief of General Staff Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic.
