FR940506-2-00048 FR940506-2-00029 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;379&hyph;000] Northwest Pipeline Corp.; Request Under Blanket Authorization May 2, 1994. Take notice that on April 26, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;379&hyph;000 a request pursuant to ยง157.205 of the Commission's Regulations to partially abandon existing facilities and to construct and operate replacement facilities at the Genesee Meter Station in Whitman County, Washington to maintain the ability to accommodate its existing firm maximum daily delivery obligations (MDDO) to The Washington Water Power Company (Water Power), a local distribution company, under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;433&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Northwest proposes to replace a two-inch positive displacement meter at the Genesee Meter Station in Whitman County, Washington with a two-inch Roots meter which will decrease the maximum design delivery capacity of the station from 350 dth per day to approximately 185 dth per day at 150 psig. Northwest states that the smaller design capacity would be adequate to deliver the current MDDO of 128 dth per day at this point. Northwest states that the estimated cost of replacing the facilities at the Genesee Meter Station is $30,440, including the $2,622 cost of removing the retired facilities. Northwest indicates that since it initiated this project to replace obsolete equipment, Northwest would not require any cost reimbursement from Water Power. Further, Northwest states that no significant impact on Northwest's peak day or annual deliveries is projected from the proposed facility replacement. Northwest's tariff does not prohibit the modification of delivery point facilities and any volumes delivered to the Genesee delivery point would be within the authorized entitlements of any shipper. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to ยง157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If not protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
