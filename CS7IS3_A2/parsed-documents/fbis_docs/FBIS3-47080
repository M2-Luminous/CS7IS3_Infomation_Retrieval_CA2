The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will start working on the package as early as Monday, the sources said. The pump-priming package is expected to feature, among other things, an additional 3 trillion to 4 trillion yen in spending on public works implemented by the central and local governments. The government will also raise the ceilings on housing loans extended by the governmental Housing Loan Corp. and on loans supplied by Japan Finance Corp. for small businesses to promote restructuring of smaller firms, the sources said. These measures will be incorporated into a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 that ends March 31. In addition, in the national budget for fiscal 1994, the government intends to ease tax burdens to reactivate real estate deals which have remained lackluster due to the bursting of bubble economy of the late 1980s. Moreover, it will take steps to promote house purchases by consumers, they said. On tax cuts, the sources said the government is considering implementing income and residential tax cuts of 6 trillion to 7 trillion yen retroactively from January. The government is coordinating views with the ruling parties over ways to finance the planned tax cuts, bearing in mind the possibility of raising the 3 percent consumption tax in the future. Late last year, Prime Minister Hosokawa came up with a six-point proposal to rev up the stagnant economy, calling for deregulation of government controls, the drafting of a 15-month budget -- made up of a third supplementary budget and the fiscal 1994 budget -- and taking measures to help smaller businesses and farmers. He also proposed safeguarding jobs, adding liquidity to land transactions and reducing the income tax. On the third supplementary budget, the government is planning to boost the central government's spending on public works by 2 to 3 trillion yen and local governments' projects by 1 trillion yen, the sources said. In the fiscal 1994 budget, the government intends to put emphasis on ways to improve the quality of life and promote scientific research. In order to expand public works projects, it will also study the possibility of revising upward a 10-year public investment plan which calls for spending 430 trillion yen over 10 years from fiscal 1991, the sources said. Moreover, the government will set aside an additional 500 billion to 1 trillion yen for the acquisition of land for public use and consider extending interest subsidies to local housing supply corporations to help them acquire land lots. Other stimulative measures now being considered by the government and ruling parties include an easing of tax burdens on land acquisitions for commercial and cultural facilities, and replacements of houses. The government is also expected to lower the consumption tax on motor vehicles from the present 4.5 percent to 3 percent in response to strong requests from the auto industry, the sources said. In addition, it is likely to remove a special tax on business corporations and allow businesses to buy their own stock in a bid to stimulate the faltering securities market, they said.
