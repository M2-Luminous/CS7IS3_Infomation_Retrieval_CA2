According to him, the murders were perpetrated over the past two weeks, taking place in several cities throughout the country, and were not interrelated. The man, who wished to remain unnamed for fear for his family which still lives in Tunisia, said that after the Hebron massacre, large demonstrations were staged in Tunisia. The demonstrators carried signs in which Jews were warned not to leave their houses. "We will kill anyone who leaves his house," some of the signs read. Others read: "No Jew will come out alive from Tunisia." The source further said that many Jews dress up as Arabs in order to go shopping. "They do not want this story published; it could make their situation even worse," he said. According to him, Jews may have also been murdered in Libya, but the Jewish community there is not interested in making this story public. Jewish sources in Tunisia denied the report that Jews were murdered altogether. Leon Matzliah, the secretary general of the supreme religious body of the French Jewry, spoke with Jewish residents of Tunis last night. "I checked this story with senior members of the Jewish community in Tunis," he said, "and they said that they do not know that any harm was caused to Jews in that country. They were absolutely calm." An Arab source in Tunis told MA'ARIV that this story is "hostile propaganda." "Such mass murder could never be kept secret," he said.
