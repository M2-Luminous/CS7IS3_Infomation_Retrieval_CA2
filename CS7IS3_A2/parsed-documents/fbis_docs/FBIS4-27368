FBIS4-27368 "dreas105_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 South Korea IAEA Suggests Fuel Rod Surveillance Methods IAEA Suggests Fuel Rod Surveillance Methods SK0106005294 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0000 GMT 1 Jun 94 SK0106005294 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [YONHAP from Berlin] [Text] In order to confirm the operational history of the reactor in Yongbyon, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on 31 May suggested technological methods to the North Korean side, but the North Korean side pointed out that it is already storing fuel rods taken from the reactor in Yongbyon according to its own standards in a bid to prepare for later measurement by the IAEA. The IAEA revealed that confirmation of the location of fuel rods required for later measurement is impossible with the North Korean side's method of storing fuel rods, and suggested technological methods that would enable confirmation of whether nuclear material was converted or not. To this, Yun Ho-chin, councilor in the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, suggested that North Korea will continue replacing fuel rods. However, he stressed that North Korea did not mix the fuel rods after taking them out at random [mujakchong], but that the locations and serial numbers of fuel rods have been clearly recorded before a surveillance camera and the fuel rods have been kept in a covered [chapye] water tank. Meanwhile, Hans Meyer, a spokesman of the IAEA, said that in the event that North Korea continues the replacement of fuel rods, in a few days, the IAEA will come to a point where it will not be able to analyze the history of operation of Yongbyon reactor
