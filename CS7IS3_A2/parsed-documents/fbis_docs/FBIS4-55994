FBIS4-55994 "dreeu101_s_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-101 Daily Report 10 May 1994 SLOVENIA 1994 Budget Adopted; Amendments Detailed 1994 Budget Adopted; Amendments Detailed 94BA0274A Ljubljana SLOVENEC in Slovene 10 May 94 p 3 94BA0274A Ljubljana SLOVENEC Slovene CSO [Article by Vida Kocjan: "How Will This Year's Budget Pie Be Divided?"; all figures as published] [Text] On 6 May the State Assembly adopted the state budget, precisely according to the provisions of the rules of procedure, since they provide for it to be adopted within three days. In discussing the 130 amendments, the most important innovation is that the deputies adopted an amendment from the committee for infrastructure and thus provided for a 1.3-billion-tolar [T] increase in the state treasury. The planned deficit thus increased from T11.8 billion to somewhat more than T12.8 billion, which means about 0.8 percent of the social product. The additional T1.3 billion will be used for maintaining regional and local roads. The budget's framework is: --T394.8 billion in revenues; --T07.9 billion in expenditures; --a deficit of T12.8 billion. Through a government amendment the deputies allowed an increase in the State Council's material costs, increasing them by more than T8.5 million, and also increased other working expenditures by a little more than T4 million. This year the State Council will receive almost T138 million of the state pie. At the government's suggestion, they added another T25 million for the guardian of human rights, so that this job will now cost citizens more than T2.715 billion. They took T200 million from the item on material costs for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and transferred it to the Ministry of Culture, which will use it for the Triglav National Park and other regional parks. Instead of T19.094 billion, the Interior Ministry will only cost us 18.995 billion, and T9.5748 billion will now be spent on the Ministry of Culture. For the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the deputies, within the framework of T4.2395 billion, transferred 40 million from the promotion item to financing Slovene minorities abroad. The overall amount remained unchanged. For the Ministry of Defense, they increased material costs by T220 million and reduced by that amount the item on machinery and other equipment, capital maintenance of military equipment and weapons, and maintenance of material-technical resources. The deputies allocated more money for training the Territorial Defense reserves (by more than T68 million), financing the increase from other items for that ministry. They increased by T240 million the amount for feeding soldiers performing military service, obtaining that amount by redistributing items within the defense budget. This year's final amount for that ministry therefore remains the same -- T24.6545 billion. At the government's suggestion, T87 million allocated for a research shaft for the underground storage of gas was taken away from the Ministry of Economic Activities and transferred to a new item for geothermal energy. There was a T163-million reduction in funds allocated for restructuring and preserving jobs. This year that ministry will receive somewhat less than T7.691 billion in state money (instead of the initially planned T7.8536 billion). The Ministry of Agriculture received a T140-million increase in funds for the public forestry service, and likewise an additional 15 million for the comprehensive management of the countryside and the rebuilding of villages. Another T15 million was also added for winery roads, and almost as much for agricultural infrastructure. As a result, there was a T25-million reduction in the amount planned for the reclamation of Lendava-Crnec. This year T10.700 billion is expected to be allocated for that economic activity. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications received the most. Because of new investments in regional and local roads, the public debt was increased by T1.3 billion. This year about T27.575 billion will be allocated by that ministry. The deputies also adopted almost all the proposed amendments to the items for the Ministry of Labor. They increased subsidies for student food by T150.6 million, but reduced republic entitlements by T10 million and transferred them to preschool education for young Gypsies. For constructing new housing communities for the disabled (in Ljubljana and in Maribor), they added a new item in the amount of T32 million. That amount, however, was reduced by subsidies in the Ministry of Economic Relations and Development. This year that ministry will be allocated approximately T86.700 billion. The Ministry of Education and Sport was allocated T1.4 million for athletic scholarships, and that amount will increase the deficit further. This year the deputies allocated T62.148 billion to that ministry. From the state reserve funds, the Ministry of Finance was allocated T35 million to build a secondary school in Izola. This year that ministry will receive T115.6203 billion. There were no major discussions about the other ministries. We can only single out the discussion about the items for the Ministry of Culture, in which the deputies rejected most of the proposed amendments. We cannot overlook the fact that in the very first draft budget for this year, the president of the Republic of Slovenia, the State Assembly, and the Constitutional Court were given exactly as much money as they requested (T202.3 million, T2.0694 billion, and T496.1 million, respectively). Consequently there was no discussion about the items for these three big consumers, and likewise they did not submit additional amendments.
