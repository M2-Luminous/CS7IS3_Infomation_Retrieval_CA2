(Rayburn Electric), tendered for filing proposed changes to its FERC Electric Service Tariff, Rate Schedule WP&hyph;S. Rayburn Electric proposes to replace its current Rate Schedule WP&hyph;S with a new Rate Schedule WP&hyph;2 for the purpose of implementing a uniform, system-wide rate for sales to its members, both under the jurisdiction of the FERC and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT). 1 The proposed rate changes are projected to increase revenues from jurisdictional sales and service by $413,672 (or 3.18 percent) from the existing FERC rate and decrease revenues by $7,223 (or 0.01 percent) from the existing PUCT rate based upon the 12 month period ending December 31, 1994. 1 Rayburn Electric filed the same Rate Schedule WP&hyph;2 with the Public Utility Commission of Texas on May 16, 1994. The purpose of the proposed rate change is to permit Rayburn Electric to charge a common, blended rate for service to all of its distribution members, thereby avoiding a disparity of rates and spreading savings resulting from a transaction with the Southwestern Electric Power Company among all of its members. Copies of the filing were served upon Rayburn Electric's customers and the PUCT. Comment date: June 10, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice. 8.
