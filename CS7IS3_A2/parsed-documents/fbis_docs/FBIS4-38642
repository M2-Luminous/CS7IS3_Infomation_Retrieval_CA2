"I believe that the State Duma should support the statement of President Yeltsin to the effect that the use of force, in any form, to settle the conflict is inadmissible." He said he was afraid that the forthcoming presidential elections in Ukraine could negatively affect the situation in the Crimea, as presidential candidates might attempt to play the Crimean card to prove their patriotism. It would be best to freeze the situation until the elections, and to encourage Kiev and Simferopol to hold talks and refrain from "war-mongering."
