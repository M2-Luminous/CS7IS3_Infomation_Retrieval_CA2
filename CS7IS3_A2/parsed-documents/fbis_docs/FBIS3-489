All 159 passengers were allowed to leave the plane, an Airbus, after it landed around 4:30 A.M. (0130 GMT) and only two crew members remained on board, the captain and his co-pilot, the spokesman said. The passengers, almost of whom were Ethiopian, were safe, he said. There were thought to be three or four hijackers, according to the spokesman. He said airport officials were negotiating with the hijackers, but gave no official details on their demands. But an unofficial source at Jomo Kenyatta Airport said the hijackers were demanding to fly to Italy and told airport officials to re-fuel the plan. The Saudi ambassador to Nairobi had rushed to the scene, the Saudi Embassy here said, but gave no other information.
