Couve ratified the government's support for Chilean fishmeal producers by explaining that commercial sanctions imposed by Mexico, although the conflict only involves private companies, will affect the entire Chilean fishmeal industry. According to Couve, the Mexican Fishmeal Industry Chamber has charged four Chilean companies -- Coloso, Eperba, Iquique, and Indo -- of dumping, that is, of selling fishmeal in Mexico at prices below those they would sell in Chile. However, the compensatory fees these enterprises will have to pay will be extended to all other Chilean fishing companies. This information was confirmed by Chilean Ambassador to Mexico Julio de la Fuente. [recorded passage indistinct] We are going to grant our full support to the Chilean fishing companies because our objective is that the Mexican sanctions be lifted, stated Andres Couve, who said the compensatory fees established by Mexico almost ban Chilean fishmeal from entering the Mexican market. He recalled that fishmeal exports are the ones that have increased most among Chilean exports to Mexico. He added that this situation benefits Peru, which has grown and is now competing with very low prices in markets that were supplied exclusively by Chile until recently.
