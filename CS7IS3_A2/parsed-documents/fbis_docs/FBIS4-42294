Martino arrived in Paris Wednesday evening [25 May] as the press agencies carried excerpts from the French president's interview with LA REPUBBLICA and four other European newspapers. He arrived in France for the first time in his capacity as Italian foreign minister, without the list of appointments that would be normal for someone representing a new government in a friendly and allied country. There was no bilateral meeting with his French counterpart, Alain Juppe. "Too little time," the diplomats explained. But there was enough time for him to say, 24 hours later, just before leaving, that the French chief of state's remarks were "unacceptable." We cannot remember a time when relations between Rome and Paris were so tense, ever since the two capitals have shared the same Europeanist ideals. It is worth starting the story at the end. When Martino -- having declined an invitation to the Elysee presidential palace for a reception for all the participants at the conference on stability in Europe (though according to diplomats, "he declined some time ago because there was not enough time") -- summoned reporters to a room in the UNESCO building. There were plenty of journalists there waiting to hear what had happened. The questions came thick and fast. [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you discuss Mitterrand's remarks with Juppe? [Martino] I thought about doing so, but I met with Juppe together with my counterparts from several other countries. And I did not want to embarrass him. In any case, he cannot consider himself responsible for statements made by Mitterrand. [LA REPUBBLICA] So was there no official reply to Mitterrand? [Martino] I think that the best answer to give to Mitterrand is that which he himself gave in 1981 when he decried as "unacceptable" the criticisms made of him over the presence of Communist ministers in the government that he had just appointed. So the remarks made by Mitterrand to a number of European newspapers are unacceptable to us. [LA REPUBBLICA] So do you consider the presence of Communist and neo-fascist ministers in a European government equivalent? [Martino] It is not a matter of equivalence. I am just saying that a chief of state of a friendly and allied country should refrain from commenting on the independent vote of another friendly and allied country. [LA REPUBBLICA] Has any official step been taken vis-a-vis the Elysee Palace? [Martino] Definitely not. After the Palazzo Chigi note, that would mean attributing greater importance to Mitterrand's statements. Which, by the way, are very strange. [LA REPUBBLICA] But Mitterrand's remarks are not the only ones. Other countries have expressed suspicion of the new Italian Government. [Martino] That is true of the press in several countries. But as far as governments are concerned, Mitterrand is an isolated instance. No other chief of state has made any such remark. [LA REPUBLICAN] The Palazzo Chigi communique says that those remarks are attributable to French domestic political problems. Do you agree? [Martino] I do not consider it scandalous to say that these remarks are a result of the pre-election climate in France. If we consider the distribution of the various critical statements made in France in our regard, most of them come from the Socialists, who are now having difficulties. They are easier to interpret from this viewpoint. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you not consider [National Alliance member] Mirko Tremaglia's election as head of the lower house foreign affairs committee a provocation to those abroad who have expressed fears about the presence of neo-Fascists in our government? [Martino] No comment. I did not take part in the vote. [passage omitted]
