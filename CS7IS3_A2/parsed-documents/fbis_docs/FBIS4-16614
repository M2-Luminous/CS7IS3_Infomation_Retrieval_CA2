Some field commanders from the antigovernment opposition and the Islamic Rebirth Movement plan to attack border installations and plant field mines in Tajikistan along the border with Afghanistan. As the Tajik Foreign Ministry's Spokesman Zafar Saidov disclosed at a briefing in Dushanbe on Saturday, the foreign department had received from the Afghan Embassy in Russia a note, which says that the Afghan Defence Ministry is ready to take the situation in the Imam-Sakhi (the Kunduz province) under control. It was from that area that Tajik militants shelled a border check point at Nizhny Pyanj on 11 April. The Afghan Defence Ministry pledged to do all it can to prevent such actions, Saidov said. He also reported that the Afghan authorities had asked the Tajik leadership to step up joint actions and stabilize the situation on the border.
