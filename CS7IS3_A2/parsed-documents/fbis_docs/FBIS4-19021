The names of the First Republic "mandarins" destined to climb into the tumbril leading to the scaffold are typed in bold. This, however, is not an edict, but a newspaper item whose title is "How Many Heads Must Roll." The list was scrupulously compiled by ITALIA SETTIMANALE (chief editor: Marcello Veneziani; leading commentator: Gustavo Selva) which claims to be the semiofficial mouthpiece of the new triumphant Right, and openly supports the government pact between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Fini, and [League Secretary] Bossi. A sort of "Who's Who" for the new era. In fact, following the era of power-sharing deals -- the weekly magazine claimed -- the beheading era is now to begin. Who, then, will ride in the tumbril? Quite a few of the "powerful" risk losing their heads. A few judges, to begin with, such as Caselli, Cordova, Casson, Borrelli, and D'Ambrosio, "who are unlikely to continue their RAI3 [third TV network] careers in politics and justice, or follow the judiciary road to socialism." There are, then, the "anti-Mafia professionals," thus defined in a short article under the concisely effective, albeit somewhat sinister title of "Decollated Gowns," such as Luciano Violante, Antonino Caponnetto, and Giuseppe Ayala. These people must "retire early" from all institutional posts, and "less TV time must be made available" to them. The judges mentioned were in the front line in the war against Cosa Nostra and bribe city crimes and misdeeds. In the past -- so concern was being voiced yesterday in various public prosecutors' offices -- isolating those who were in the front line had negative, if not tragic, consequences, and we would be well advised not to forget this. The metaphorical "executioner" also seems to have quite a huge job on his hands at the RAI [state broadcasting company]. The "new course" is said to have already arranged its basket to collect some outstanding "heads": Away with RAI1 Chairman Nadio Delai, away with TG1 Director Demetrio Volcic, away with RAI2 Chairman Giovanni Minoli! On the scaffold are also TG2 Director Paolo Garimberti, RAI3 Chairman Angelo Guglielmi, newscast director Livio Zanetti, and radio broadcast programing director Aldo Grasso. ITALIA SETTIMANALE did not forget to mention also other predetermined (i.e., disliked by the winning coalition) victims among journalists. Thus, it was pushing Lilli Gruber and Corradino Mineo, Michele Santoro and Roberto Morrione, Italo Moretti and Giulio Borrelli -- all of whom are labeled "left" -- into the tumbril. A good cleanup is also to take place in the entertainment industry. Gillo Pontecorvo, Luca Ronconi, Giorgio Strehler, and Lina Wertmuller will not escape. Among the boyards to be purged, there are "many officials who are often more powerful than ministers." These are the names: Treasury "number one" Mario Draghi, economic programing general secretary Corrado Fiaccavento, and Antitrust Commission Chairman Franco Saja. The detailed list suggested that the heads of Federcalcio [soccer federation] Chairman Antonio Matarrese, and former minister Marco Carraro would also end up in the basket. Even the sins of someone like Volleyball League Chairman Carlo Fracanzani were deemed to be unpardonable. The list (drawn up by Tuccio Risi and Lorenzo Stella) ended with a touch of malice reserved for police chief Parisi, who would also be waiting for the final verdict: "Will he save himself by becoming one of Fini's allies?"
