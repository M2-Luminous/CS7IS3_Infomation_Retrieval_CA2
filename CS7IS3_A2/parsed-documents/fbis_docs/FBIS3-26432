Of these, 19 were granted reductions in sentences or released on parole. They were discharged immediately following the meeting. It is reported that during their sentences, some of these prisoners who were given such awards exemplarily obeyed various prison rules; some worked diligently to study production and labor skills and brought considerable economic wealth to the prison and the state; and some bravely fought against other criminals' harmful behaviors. The reduction of these prisoners' sentences is to fully display the aim of our state's law for integrating punishment with reform. Based on the same principle, another 119 prisoners who behaved well in the first reform-though-labor detachment were given material rewards.
