Throughout the year, a scientific and technological personnel of 132 persons was hard at work here at the forefront of rural work, conducting various experiments, as also demonstrating and disseminating superior varieties, and helping in the training of technical personnel from among the peasants. The area over which such promotion has taken place this year has been 3.772 million mu, resulting in 194 million kg of additional grain, with an additional output value of 107.7 million yuan. In 1993, the dissemination, within the province and outside of the province, of several excellent varieties developed by the provincial agricultural academy has been greatly accelerated. Growing the "Long Ya No 7" type "huma" [5170 7802] flax was promoted over an area of 2.5 million mu; growing the new "long mi No 4" type of "mizi" [4745 1311] millet was promoted over an area of 1.22 million mu; spring wheat of the "long chun 8139" type was promoted over an area of 1.17 million mu; and winter wheat of the "long jian 196" type was promoted over an area of 1.34 million mu. Altogether these promotions exceeded one million mu of varieties and resulted last year in an additional output value of 168 million yuan and an additional net income of 141 million yuan. Similar achievements of increased production and increased income had been accomplished in contractual S&T projects undertaken by the provincial agricultural academy in 1993. The project "Demonstration of Techniques for High Yield Grain Production on 760,000 Mu of Arid Land in Eastern and Southern Gansu" has resulted, during its four years, in the additional grain production of 219 million kg of grain and a net income of 156 million yuan. The "Engineering Project for a Good Harvest of Grain, Edible Oil, Medicinal Herbs in High-Elevation, Shady, and Marshy Areas" had contracted for 2.07 million mu for the growing of grain, edible oil, and medicinal herbs and indeed achieved a bumper harvest over the whole area. In the area where the "Experimental Research of Vegetable Growing Techniques in High Efficiency, Energy Saving, Sunlit Green Houses" had been promoted, the average per mu yield was almost 5,000 kg, and the income over 10,000 yuan. The project "Promoting a Comprehensive Technique for the Improvement of the `Mao Xing' Apricots in Eastern Gansu" had prepared a demonstration field of 610 mu to produce a superior variety, and this has led to the setting up of an orchard of 18,000 mu, which was one way of showing the people in the old liberated area to escape poverty and attain prosperity.
