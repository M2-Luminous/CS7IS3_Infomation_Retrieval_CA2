FR940930-0-00021 FR940930-0-00005 Southwest further states that in a 1990 internal DOT memorandum, RSPA expressed concern with the IG's suggestion that mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations should be collected with a suppression code to enable DOT to continue excluding those flights from the monthly consumer report. RSPA commented that collecting data on mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations would duplicate FAA's collection and would be counter to DOT's current policy. RSPA also questioned whether the data on mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations could be protected under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA). In response to Southwest's contention that the NPRM did not reveal any need for eliminating the mechanical exclusion, other than the IG's recommendation, RSPA notes that the NPRM specifically stated, ``The improved modifications in the reporting system would result in improved consumer information .␣.␣.'' (57 FR 58756). As asserted by Southwest, the Department did not conduct a follow-up audit on the exclusion of flights impacted by mechanical problems. Southwest, therefore, concludes there is no evidence as to carrier reporting compliance after RSPA issued its accounting and reporting directive to clarify the reporting instructions. However, the Department's decision to propose eliminating the mechanical exclusion rendered a follow-up unnecessary. Southwest also states that RSPA even had concerns about collecting data on mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations, as the collection would duplicate an existing FAA collection and be counter to Departmental policy. While RSPA did express concerns about the suggestion to collect mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations and suppress that information in the data base, RSPA's concerns were with its ability to withhold the mechanical data from public release. RSPA believed it would be required to release the mechanical data under the FOIA even if a suppression code were used. Also, RSPA questioned whether the reporting of specific mechanical data to RSPA and the FAA was duplicate reporting, which would be counter to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). This concern has been addressed because carriers would not, under this rule, report specific mechanical data to the Department. All flights would be reported, with no distinction between flights impacted by mechanical delays and those flights impacted by other delays. America West requests the present exclusions for mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations be retained. The carrier believes DOT would be ill-advised to make any changes in the existing regulations, unless DOT can assure the change will not cause ``one employee at one airline on one occasion to send out an aircraft in order to avoid having a `late' flight and that an incident or accident occurs.''
