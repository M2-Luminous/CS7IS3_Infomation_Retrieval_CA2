Last night a small group of the Burundian military tried to overthrow the government, but their coup reportedly failed. Yet calm has not returned completely. Shooting in the northern district of Kamenge is still being heard and the Army has given the civilians until 1800 [1500 GMT] to hand in their weapons. Here is a report by our correspondent Robert Esselinckx: [Begin recording] [Esselinckx] As far as we can gauge, the violence remains restricted to Kamenge and Kinama on the outskirts of Bujumbura. The Tutsi-dominated Army has tried for days to disarm Hutu civilians and much fighting is continuing. [Unidentified person] Every 10 minutes we hear shooting, either machine guns or other firearms. The ultimatum to the Kamenge inhabitants to hand in their weapons by 1800 on 24 April expired and has been extended another 24 hours. [Esselinckx] What about the white people, the Belgians? Are they in danger? [Person] No, not at all. [Esselinckx] Apart from that, a small group of the military attempted a coup last night, which reportedly failed. Several ministers who had gone into hiding have returned and taken up their posts again. Everything is normal in many places in Bujumbura. Moreover, Sabena will maintain its three scheduled flights for this week. In the meantime, 350 Belgian paratroopers are still in Nairobi waiting to return to Belgium, unless, off course, the Belgian Government decides to have them help in the evacuation of our citizens from Burundi. But the Council of Ministers must make a decision on that first. Incidentally, one of the two military Boeings 727 had an engine breakdown in Nairobi. [end recording] [De Sloovere] We now have our reporter Faroek Ozgunes on the line from Bujumbura for the latest developments. Faroek, have you noticed anything at all of this failed coup? [Ozgunes] The leadership of the Burundian Army actually is putting the events in perspective and is not talking about a coup, but rather of a small uprising within the Army. I have spoken with the Burundian Army chief of staff, who told me that 10 soldiers had left their barracks without permission. They tried to involve others in their mutiny but without success, and they have been arrested. Also, two officers have been arrested and are being questioned at this very moment. [De Sloovere] Did you hear any shooting? [Ozgunes] No. To hear shooting one must travel to Kamenge, which everyone is being advised against doing. We tried yesterday, but were chased away. Kamenge is blocked off and it is impossible to gain access. [De Sloovere] Are there any troops or tanks in the streets? [Ozgunes] Light armored personnel carriers are driving on the streets, not in the center of Bujumbura itself, but more on the outskirts and the gendarmerie have erected checkpoints everywhere in the city. Anybody who wants to pass is being searched thoroughly, and especially for weapons. [De Sloovere] Yet it is clear that just one spark can make the violence flare up. [Ozgunes] That is correct. Right now the center of Bujumbura is quiet, but there is a lot of movement, especially in the adjoining areas. Hundreds of Hutus have fled Kamenge District. One of them told me: There is no place for us to go anymore. Kamenge is the only remaining Hutu stronghold in Bujumbura. According to these refugees, the Army entered Kamenge yesterday and started shooting at random. It is unknown how many victims there are. The Burundian Army actually is ready to march into that neighborhood to disarm the Hutus. [De Sloovere] How about the security of the Belgians? Have they been advised to remain inside? [Ozgunes] The Belgians are in no, repeat no, danger. Yet they have been advised by the Belgian Embassy to stay off the streets after 1800. This is more a precautionary measure: many criminals are using the current chaos to rob people on the streets. There was an emergency meeting at the Belgian Embassy yesterday afternoon to discuss the situation of our citizens, but there are no confirmed plans so far to have Belgians leave Burundi. [De Sloovere] Thank you, Faroek. We will hear you again in our next newscast.
