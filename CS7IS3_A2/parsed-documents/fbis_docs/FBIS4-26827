The five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs, [equality and mutual benefit] and peaceful coexistence, were jointly promoted by China, India and Myanmar in June 1954. Indian Ambassador to China Das Gupta told XINHUA that India and Myanmar were the first two countries outside the socialist camp to establish diplomatic relations with China, following the birth of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In April 1954, India and China signed an agreement on trade and intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India. The five principles came to be formulated by the two sides during discussions on this agreement and they were incorporated in the preamble of the agreement as guiding principles in India-China relations, he said. The leaders of the two countries believed that the principles also had a wider application. They were relevant not only to bilateral ties but as guiding principles for international relations generally. This was the message of the joint statement of the prime ministers of India and China in New Delhi on June 28, 1954, he said. "We are deeply convinced that these principles remain as relevant today as they were in 1954," said the Indian ambassador. They provide a peaceful, just and cooperative international order in which countries may cooperate with others but not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, he stressed. Recalling the five principles enshrined in the Myanmar-China joint statement on June 29, 1954, Myanmar ambassador to China U Set said that the early 1950s was a time when the whole world faced insecurity and instability with the threat of nuclear war. Having gone through a period of foreign domination, Myanmar and China shared similar perceptions on the desire for peace, for preservation of newly-won independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for the right to choose and shape our own destiny, U Set said. Both countries believed that if these principles were observed by all nations in the world, peace, security and mutual trust and confidence would be restored and the fears of aggression and interference in internal affairs could be avoided, he noted. In the past 40 years since the annunciation of the principles, U Set continued, Myanmar and China have stuck to them and developed a brotherly friendship based on these principles. These principles remain as valid as they were 40 years ago, he stressed. Though the Cold War has ended, the Myanmar ambassador pointed out, the current world remains marked with disputes and armed conflicts, with religious and ethnic conflicts, with inequalities and injustice. And political, economic, and social problems still abound in the world today. The world still faces many instances of resorting to force rather than trying to seek peaceful solutions. Direct or indirect attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries still exist, he added. On the other hand, in this increasingly interdependent world, there is a growing need for nations to unite and cooperate with each other to achieved progress and development, he said. It therefore becomes imperative that all nations should try to strictly adhere to the five principles that are essential for the creation of a peaceful, just and equitable international order, the ambassador concluded.
