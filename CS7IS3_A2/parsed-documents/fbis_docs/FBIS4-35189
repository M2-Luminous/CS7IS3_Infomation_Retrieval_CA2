The Palestinian Statistics Center Preamble Palestinian Authority is established today on the liberated Palestinian soil in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, declaring the end of long years of suffering and pain experienced by the Palestinian people as a result of occupation and displacement and long years of coercion inside the homeland and alienation in exile. Despite occupation and displacement, this great people have not surrendered or relinquished their rights. They resisted and struggled one generation after another for their freedom, independence, and repatriation to their homeland. They offered thousands of martyrs such as ['Izz-al-Din] al-Qassam, Hasan Salamah, and the prince of martyrs Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir], and thousands of prisoners and wounded to regain their usurped rights. Throughout the years of struggle, this people have adhered to their national unity under occupation and in the diaspora. This struggle and its various tools -- armed struggle, political struggle, and brave intifadah -- as well as this firm national unity constituted the real lever to regain the people's rights. This struggle led to recognizing our people, their leadership, and political framework, the PLO, the representative of the Palestinian people, whose cause has become the cause of the age. Consequently, world countries and organizations recognized the legitimacy of this people's struggle and right to independence and repatriation. Our people have always believed in regaining their rights through a just peace that can achieve security and peace for all people in the region. In 1939, a nonsectarian democratic state plan was proposed; in 1974, a independent Palestinian state plan was proposed; and the Palestinian peace plan was presented on 15 November 1988. However, others rejected the participation of our people and their legitimate representative. When the opportunity arose, our people and their leadership did not hesitate to join the Madrid peace process that produced the principles signed in Washington 13 September, 1993. Now that the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- the first executive agreement of the Declaration of Principles -- has been signed, the first step toward the implementation of the peace project begins by implementing the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and the establishment of the Palestinian authority on this dear part of Palestine. We thus confirm the return of Palestine to the political map of our region and the world and the beginning of the process of regaining the rights of the Palestinian people on their land. The Palestinian authority will work toward the step-by-step realization of the legitimate Palestinian aims -- independence, freedom, equality, and repatriation -- through negotiation and the peace process. This will be realized through a commitment to the full implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord and its development by entering the second phase as quickly as possible, beginning by settling what has not been decided in the agreement regarding the Jericho area and some areas of the Gaza Strip and by the early empowerment of the Palestinian Authority on the Palestinian territory in the West bank and then by convening the four-side committee in order to open the door for the return of those who were displaced after June, 1967 and for completing the interim period agreement that would bring about a total Israeli withdrawal from all the cities, villages, and camps of the West Bank, and electing the legislative council, and finally opening negotiations on the final status within the shortest possible period, as called for by the Declaration of Principles. Our stand at the latest negotiations was absolutely clear. For us, these negotiations were the right way to bring about the full withdrawal from the territories conquered by Israel in 1967, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital, and the termination of settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza as it was ended in Egypt's Sinai in implementation of UN resolutions, especially Resolutions 242 and 338, and to find a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem in accordance with UN Resolution 194. Until all that is accomplished through negotiation and in phases, we stick to the territorial integrity of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. We will also not allow any tampering with the status of the integrity of this Palestinian territory. We will also reject any interpretation of the postponement of the final status of Jerusalem that would allow the occupation authorities to change the physical or demographic status through illegal settlement activities or the continuing development and isolation of the Arab city of Jerusalem and its people. We emphasize the Arab and Palestinian identity of Jerusalem as an integral part of the West Bank in line with UN resolutions and the stands of all the nations of the world that refuse to recognize the illegal annexation of Jerusalem by the state of Israel. The Palestinian authority will work to realize that principle in all its work plans, until the final status of Jerusalem is negotiated in the coming stage. We understand the letter and spirit of the Declaration of Principles agreement and the Gaza-Jericho agreement in light of the Israeli policy known to us; namely, that settlement activity is to be frozen during the interim period and that settlers will not be permitted to muscle their way into Palestinian land carrying their weapons to duplicate the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and other such atrocities. We also understand settlement activity founded on occupation and the confiscation of land to be a racist phenomenon that will be phased out ahead of its complete elimination through peaceful means. We understand clearly that the agreement that has been signed creates new conditions in which the Israeli occupation will never return to our liberated land. We also understand that this is an irreversible march and that this march should continue to move forward. We also understand the agreement to be the road to real peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, and to full security for both peoples. It is also the means for realizing justice, prosperity, and welfare for all countries of the region, and is a prelude to Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, and to a just and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts. As we ask the Israeli Government to commit itself to continue its implementation of the agreement as soon as possible and to go ahead in its withdrawal and dismantling of settlements, we are also fully committed to what the PLO -- the representative of all of the Palestinian people -- committed itself in this agreement, the Declaration of Principles, the messages of mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel, and all commitments emanating from these agreements. We are also committed to anything that achieves peace and security for the Palestinian and Israeli people, and to resolving all our current and future conflicts through peaceful means as long as Israel is committed to this. We understand this agreement also as a tool to change the situation of our people from occupation, constant oppression, injustice, and impoverishment to quick economic development, prosperity, dignity, and justice for all Palestinian citizens, and to an effective and honest government, and safeguarding their human rights. In spite of all our expectations of a brilliant future for our people, we are aware of the great responsibility we shoulder. This agreement is a transitional and partial agreement, and is a limited initial step that does not at all represent the peak of our ambitions and aspirations of our people. The implementation of this agreement will face several difficulties. The occupation ruled militant Gaza Strip for 27 years, and left it in a very difficult situation. It has usurped land, water, and resources. It has destroyed its economy, establishments, and facilities. The Palestinian Authority will shoulder the responsibility in a difficult Arab and international situation in which aid diminished and the burden increased. The building of the Palestinian Authority is a laborious endeavor. We should depend only on ourselves and the creative capabilities of our people and their readiness to offer endless sacrifices. We should remind that construction after struggle requires sacrifices and efforts, and that dangers facing our march require the participation of all sons of our people in shouldering the responsibility and leading the Palestinian ship to safe shores. This requires further national unity, rallying behind the PLO, and ensuring the participation of the Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and abroad regardless of their current nationalities or present location. The Palestinian Authority is aware that it should be a model in its actions, based on democratic principles, the rule of law, respect for rights and basic liberties, including the freedom to worship, political and ideological pluralism, and equality between man and woman. The Palestinian Authority should follow an open and responsible system, and carry out its task under popular supervision. It should commit itself to the principle of effective participation, mobilization of qualified cadres, building of establishments, human development based on an integrated system that guarantees honesty, efficiency and work development. Our confidence in our people is limitless and is the foundation on which the Palestine of tomorrow will be built. Our people can give to their homeland Palestine under freedom and independence the same amount of effective contribution in construction and development they have given, together with their Arab brothers, in all countries. The Palestinian Authority also stresses the Arab and Palestinian identity of our people in the Galilee, the Triangle, and the Negev. It views their steadfastness on their land and insistence on their right to citizenship and full equity and adherence to the homeland a bridge that links them to their people under the canopy of peace which we are now starting to implement between Palestine and Israel. Our Palestinian people will never forget the virtuous martyrs of the Arab nation who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Palestine. Nor will it forget the suffering of the neighboring Arab states that resulted from the Israeli occupation and the Arab nation's fostering of Palestine and its people during their diaspora and suffering under occupation. The Palestinian Authority underlines its commitment to the Arab nature of Palestine and its affiliation to the Arab nation, the Arab-Islamic culture, and the varied heritage of the heavenly messages, which consider Palestine a sacred land. It pledges to protect the freedom of worship and the exercise of faith and religious rites for all without any discrimination. The new Palestine under the Palestinian Authority will proceed from its civilization, religious, and cultural roots. It will be open to this world and committed to its charters, chief of which are the UN Charter, the Arab League Charter, and the conventions on human rights. As long as occupation remains on part of our territory, the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Treaty should apply since they are the tools of the international law to protect the peoples under occupation. The international legitimacy, and particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, will remain the basis for all future negotiations. The special relations between Palestine and the neighboring Arab states, particularly Jordan and Egypt, require a special policy which will be translated by the Palestinian Authority into political and economic cooperation agreements to embody and strengthen these special relations. In implementation of this declared policy, the Palestinian Authority is hereby declaring to the masses of our Palestinian people its working program for the future phase to win their support, backing, and participation in implementing these objectives in this important phase of our people's life.
