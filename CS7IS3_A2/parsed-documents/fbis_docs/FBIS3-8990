Under the UN-sponsored agreement, Sarajevo will be linked by road to central Bosnia-Herzegovina via the Moslem majority town of Visoko (25 kilometres, or 15 miles) to the west, UN special envoy Sergio Vieria de Mello stated. Other road corridors will be opened to link Sarajevo's Serb-held suburbs of Ilidza and Lukavica, on the one hand, and the Moslem suburbs of Butmir and Dobrinja on the other. A bridge between the Serb-held Grbavica district in downtown Sarajevo and the rest of the capital will also be opened under the accord signed at Sarajevo airport. The agreement, whose signing was twice postponed will take effect from Tuesday and concerns the resumption of civilian traffic for humanitarian and business purposes. The text was signed in Vieira de Mello's presence by Hasan Muratovic, the Bosnian minister responsible for relations with the United Nations, and the main Bosnian Serb negotiator Momcilo Krajisnik. When it takes effect, Sarajevo will be connected with the outside world, though only partially, for the first time in almost two years of siege by the Bosnian Serbs. The UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) is responsible for organising and monitoring implementation of the accord. Civilians wishing to use the reopened roads will be able to do so, by bus, to the extent of one return trip per day, after notifying UNPROFOR personnel 24 hours in advance. The UN force would then notify competent authorities representing the warring parties of the lists of passengers.
