And while its representatives have responded to critics in the press and among IAF constituency, the front has yet to outline its position towards the affairs. Some analysts believe that the IAF has been unable to make up its mind over support of Dr. Malhas if only because a large percentage of its constituency is pharmacists and food traders whose interests have been targeted by Dr. Malhas's criticism. On the other hand, the IAF does not want to appear to be siding with the government especially since it was Dr. 'Abd al-Salam al- Majali's government that was perceived to be targeting the Islamists by the change in the Election Law to a one-person, one- vote system. Other analysts believe that the IAF cannot be called upon to have a unified party line on this issue because the issue is "non-partisan" and is not political in nature. These analysts believe that the IAF has within its ranks the same split in opinion over the minister's statements as the one that has appeared in society at large. The IAF's position may become clearer when its spokesperson in parliament, Hamzah Mansur, takes the floor today. But in the meantime, the front has attempted to ward off criticism by other deputies and political forces in the country. It has, nevertheless, worded its response carefully to avoid committing itself to any particular position. In fact, on Wednesday, the first day of parliamentary discussion of the Malhas allegations, the IAF deputies who are usually at the fore of those signing up to speak against the government did not take the podium and left it instead to the deputies who lashed out at the minister. Critics of the powerful Islamic party maintain that the movement failed to give adequate attention to Dr. Malhas' charges of corruption among businessmen and importers and within the bureaucracy of the ministry itself. Two weeks ago, a weekly Arabic newspaper quoted Dr. Malhas as saying that a good quantity of food and medicine that reaches the market does not meet international standards and specifications. He pointed the finger at what he described as "whales" in the business sector who, he maintained, have exercised pressure and intimidated food and drug control employees in his ministry. The minister's statements created panic in the Kingdom, especially since Dr. Malhas directly connected the increased percentage of cancer cases in the country with the quality of imported food and drugs. The Lower House of Parliament immediately called for a session to discuss the charges of the minister and initiate investigations into the minister's claims. The House gave the government three days to present a report substantiating the minister's statements. But in what appeared to be an isolated incident, the IAF's deputies in the Lower House were seen as the only organised bloc in the House which accepted the government's request to delay discussion of what has been titled by the local press as "Malhas gate." Other "opposition" deputies had demanded that the government stick to the deadline of last Sunday but they failed to gain the support of the IAF deputies except al-Zarqa' Deputy Bassam al-'Moush, who seconded the government' motion for delay saying that they also needed time to "collect information." Criticism of the IAF's position grew when the president of the Pharmacists Association, Husam Musmar, who was elected on an Islamist platform, published a letter dismissing Dr. Malhas' call for upgrading and enforcing legislation which would provide for tighter control over the quality of food and medicine in the Kingdom. At the same time Mr. Musmar published his letter in local Arabic papers, AL-SABIL, an Islamist weekly believed to be the mouthpiece of the IAF which also marginalised the importance of Dr. Malhas's statements much to the chagrin of its Islamist readers. In this week's edition, AL-SABIL's editor in chief, Hilmi al-Asmar, sought to ward off criticism that the Islamists were in support of business interests at the expense of the health of the people. In a long column he also sought to dispel charges that the Islamists' dismissal of the charges made by Dr. Malhas was because he was a well-known critic of Islamist calls for stricter social laws, especially in regard to segregation of men and women. Before assuming his post as minister of health, Dr. Malhas wrote a weekly column in AL-RA'Y Arabic daily in which he often lashed out at fundamentalist social demands and called for progressive and liberal policies. "We understand the criticism of our brothers who love us and are loved by us, because we did not give the food and medicine case its due in our earlier edition of AL-SABIL," Mr. al-Asmar said in his column. "But it was not because we do not want to point to the cases of corruption in our society and not because we are enemies of any particular individual," he added. Mr. al-Asmar asserted since other Arabic language papers had dedicated enough space to the case "AL-SABIL did not feel the need to repeat what was already published." He was responding to a letter the weekly received from al-Tafilah and which was signed by 23 IAF supporters. In that letter, which AL-SABIL published on the inside page, the signatories said: "There was great disappointment among the youth of the Islamic movement when your paper was published without investigating or saying a word of support for this important national issue." The signatories were especially critical of a column by Mr. al-Asmar which the letter said "was weak and denied the existence of corruption but instead took the opposite view." "If there is animosity towards some newspapers, then this should not stop you as Muslims, as a movement and newspaper, to say that is right," the letter added. The signatories also pointed out that "Islamists were the first to open the files of corruption in the last Parliament, and the Islamists have based on their election campaign on putting an end to financial and administrative corruption." AL-SABIL also carried two items signed by the "editorial staff" in which it said that they were happy to receive "an unending number of telephone calls" and that they were not above criticism. "We stress that we are completely on the side of the citizen... and by deduction in support of the minister of health against the whales of corruption," one of the pieces said. The criticism of the IAF movement's position was also apparent in other papers, including the evening daily AKHIR KHABAR, which accused the movement of siding with the rich against the poor. "We were hoping that the IAF would take this opportunity to stand by the minister at this crucial moment because it is the poor people who give the Islamic movement its political base and its parliamentary seats, and not the large businesses even if they cloak themselves in Islam," it said in an article signed by Nahid Hattar. "I worry about the movement, which appears torn between the power of the people and the force of those with interests, tilting towards the side that we cannot accept," Mr. Hattar added. Mr. Hattar's column appeared side by side with a letter from the official spokesperson of the IAF deputies, Hamzah Mansur, who was replying to a similar charge made by Mr. Hattar a day earlier. "I was surprised, as were my brothers the IAF deputies, by what appeared in Mr. Nahid Hattar's article in which he categorised the deputies into two groups: one with the poor people and the other which stands with the whales," Mr. Mansur said. "We reject the notion that our society should be divided into rich and poor for wealth is not a crime... Citizens, both rich and poor, are our brothers and family," Dr. Mansur added.
