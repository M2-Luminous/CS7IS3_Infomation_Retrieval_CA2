The techniques can help meet the government's 1994 target of 3.5 percent growth in agricultural output, the Ministry of Agriculture said. The techniques involve applying fertilizers to the subsoil, improving crop seeds, controlling bollworms and preventing diseases among prawn and livestock, and processing feed with straw and stalks. Vice-Minister Hong Fuzen said the ministry is expecting foreign investors to bring advanced management skills and equipment to help spread this technology. Hong said that at least two new generations of crop seeds should be developed during the rest of this century to push up farm production. By the year 2000, he said, better seeds should account for at least 40 percent of the annual increases in agricultural output. In the use of fertilizer, the central government will strive toward three major targets during the next five years: --By 1998, subsoil fertilizer should be used on 66 million hectares of farmland, or 60 percent of China's grain acreage. Hong said that only 12 million hectares are now fertilized by machine, adding that the figure is expected to rise to 46.7 million hectares by 1998. --The technology for applying nitrogenous fertilizer should spread across the countryside, and 40 percent of fertilized farmland is to be treated in this way. --By effectively using fertilizer, the per hectare yield of wheat is expected to increase by 300 kilograms; of maize, by 375 kilograms; of soybean, by 225 kilograms; and cotton, by 225 kilograms. With advanced technology, farmers are also expected to reduce their use of fertilizer by 180 kilograms per hectare by 1998, Hong said. He reiterated that another crucial task is the vigorous development of pesticides to prevent animal and shrimp diseases and wipe out bollworms, both of which brought disaster to farmers last year. In three to five years, Hong said, another 141 model counties will be designated to play leading roles in the development of feed-processing technology using straw and stalks, providing a stimulus to animal husbandry. At present, the country has 59 model counties.
