Your candidate, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, did not make it. Nevertheless, Mr. Kinkel, are you satisfied with the results? [Kinkel] Yes. First of all, we are proud of Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. In two ballots, she achieved results that were far beyond the number of votes that we had; this is a great achievement. I advised her not to run in the third ballot. This was also approved by the vote in the FDP group. We also voted for Mr. Herzog and, thus, we made this decision possible -- that is, the FDP was the linchpin. [Gerhardt] Why did you vote for Roman Herzog? What were the reasons? [Kinkel] Personally, I told the FDP group that, following the coalition statement, it was correct, in my view, to decide as we did. We need a clear, reliable course. We want to continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. I do not think the voters would have understood a different decision, with all respect to the other candidates -- especially Johannes Rau, whom I like personally very much and appreciate greatly for his work. [Gerhardt] Johannes Rau received a number of votes from the FDP. Was the party facing an acid test? [Kinkel] No, never. We had a very clear result of our vote in the group. We always act in a very democratic way. I was happy that the majority of the deputies voted in the way that I had asked them to, which means that after the vote in the group, they cast their votes for Mr. Herzog in the third ballot. [Gerhardt] Thank you very much, Mr. Kinkel.
