Here, the necessary condition for the rapid development of the national economy is the maintenance of a high investment rate over a long period and the full condition for the healthy development of the national economy is that the high investment rate is supported by a corresponding high savings rate. Only when the savings rate and the investment rate are kept balanced can there be sustained development of the national economy. To put it in a nutshell, balancing savings and investment is the key to the implementation of the general principle. In China, investment demand is always brisk so an effective way to mobilize savings or the establishment of a highly efficient capital market is of greater significance. In the traditional structure, there was basically no capital market in our country. In those years, under the centralized financial system, savings in the whole society were mainly concentrated in the hands of the government and were then distributed to various enterprises for the purpose of investment in the form of financial appropriation. This form of raising and using funds can be regarded as a special form of internal financing [nei yuan rong zi 0355 3293 5816 6357]. Since the beginning of the economic structural reform, with the readjustment of the elementary distribution structure of the national income, the government savings in the gross social savings have been gradually decreasing (and the net savings have now become negative), while the savings kept by enterprises and individuals have been gradually increasing. Being supported by such a savings structure, external financing [wai yuan rong zi 1120 3293 5816 6357] has gradually come to prevail in our country. According to statistics, external financing accounts for about 70 percent of the current sources of enterprise investment funds. This is reflected in the fact that in the "cake" of state investment, bank loans and the funds raised by the enterprises on their own are the main financial sources. The rate of external financing in our country is rather high as compared with the between 30 and 50 percent rate in the countries with developed market economies. The abovementioned change has caused the monetary policy to hold a decisive position in our macroeconomic control and regulation system. Signs of such change appeared in the early stage of reform and people could obviously see it after the three-year economic rectification. However, the reform of the financial control system did not keep pace with such change. This was mainly reflected in the following facts. First, we still maintained the traditional means of credit distribution to exercise financial management and it was increasingly difficult to effectively control the gross quantity of credit and money supply in the whole society by this means. Moreover, the distribution and circulation of credit funds in the economy became far distant from the subjective wishes of financial authorities. Second, we still used the method of managing credit funds to deal with the issuing of various securities by imposing quantitative limits on such issues. Third, we still lacked an effective means of managing the fund-raising activities launched by enterprises on their own beyond the direct financing under the state's control. All this brought about a disorderly situation in the financial field during the last few years. It is indeed important to rectify the financial order. Behind various disorder phenomena there exist various types of misconduct and the inertial effects of the old system but there also exist sprouts of the new financial system. We can even say that many of the current financial problems are in fact a type of spontaneous reaction from the market economic forces against the ossified financial system. If we do not properly analyze various factors, we cannot achieve the expected results in our rectification efforts and China's further economic growth may encounter other obstacles. As we have noticed, since the beginning of the economic reform, major changes have occurred in China's economic growth mechanisms. The country's economic growth in the past more than 10 years was mainly attributed to the rapid development of the nonstate-owned enterprises, the expansion of the tertiary industry, and the high-speed growth in the coastal areas. However, such economic entities and industries, which made major contributions to the economic growth, did not hold any significant position in the state's credit plan; and what was actually gained by the economically developed areas was obviously insufficient as compared with the demand. This brought about a profound contradiction. On the one hand, economic development had to rely heavily on the nonstate-owned enterprises and the tertiary industry and on the economic growth in the coastal areas; on the other hand, the financial demand in such enterprises, trades, and areas could not be satisfied by the state's official credit plan. As a result, funds were "loaned" from the state-run banks to nonstate-owned banks, nonbanking financial institutions, nonstate-owned enterprises, trades in the tertiary industry, and economically developed areas and this became an inevitable trend. Because the derived financial demand was not aimed at adjusting the monetary position, "daily loans" were inevitably changed into "monthly loans," "quarterly loans," or "yearly loans." Because most of such loans were not allowed by the state, there naturally existed instances of violating financial discipline and funds were offered at much higher costs. Similar problems also occurred in the field of direct financing. Because many new investment projects could not obtain funds through official channels, it was rather common that they raised funds on their own in various ways without the approval of the administrative authorities. Can we then improve the situation by means of "perfecting" the fund distribution method? In our opinion, this should not, and also cannot, be done. First, if social funds are distributed by the monetary authorities, this is a typical practice in the planned economy and logically comes into line with the across-the-board planned management and distribution of materials and funds. Such practice has now lost the necessary economic conditions. Second, smooth funds distribution still needs certain institutional conditions in the financial system: 1) The financial institution must be large and highly centralized (as we had only one bank in society in the past) so that funds do not move in and out of the financial system on a large scale. 2) Social expenditure is made by entities bearing the same character (as in the past, the state-owned enterprises assumed an overwhelming proportion and their revenue and expenditure were totally controlled by the government). Thus, funds will not move between different economic elements. 3) There should only be one single financial product (as in the past, there were only simple deposits and loans in society) so that there will be no replacement between different financial products and no consequent transfer of funds. 4) The national economy should be closed (as we laid lopsided stress on self-reliance in the past) so that changes in international reserve and in foreign exchange rates do not produce any unexpected impact on domestic money supply. Obviously, all such conditions no longer exist in China. As the foundation and the conditions no longer exist, it is impossible to "improve" the system being established on such foundations and under such conditions. More importantly, when the market-oriented reform has been carried out in depth today, credit planning can less and less satisfy the increasingly active needs in economic development and has become increasingly a huge "rent-seeking" hotbed [xun zu yuan sou 1416 4436 3220 5674]. So, it should be terminated as soon as possible and replaced with a new mechanism for indirect control of the money supply. Under the new system, the monetary authorities should apply indirect regulatory means to control and adjust the gross quantity of money supply and market interest rates. The movement of social funds should mainly be directed by the profit- oriented financial institutions and by the securities market according to market signals. In the new pattern of monetary regulation and control, the establishment of an effective capital market is an important task. In the field of indirect financing, it is of course very important to organize and establish some policy-oriented banks [zheng ce xing yin hang 2398 4595 1840 6892 5887] but they can only meet the financial needs of a small number of key trades with a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is definitely necessary to transform the existing specialized banks but, if long-term funds are mainly provided by the commercial bank, the financial demand in society still cannot be satisfied and the situation may become rather dangerous in a certain sense. This is because the funds of the commercial banks mainly come from the savings of individuals and enterprises and the mobility of such funds is rather high. Their liabilities constitute the main part of the money supply. If such financial sources are used to make long-term investments, a financial crisis can easily arise. This is the reason why the monetary authorities must require the commercial banks to keep reserve funds and provisions, lay down a strict requirement on the rate of their own capital, and exercise strict control over the operation of their assets. In the countries mainly practicing the market economy, the long-term funds supplied through some indirect financing channels mainly come from nonbanking financial institutions, which mainly refer to various insurance companies, pension funds, trust and investment companies, common funds, savings and loans associations, and financial companies. A common characteristic of these financial institutions is that they all have long-term and stable funds sources. It is precisely under such a liabilities structure that they can play a major role in the capital market. If our financial institutions are still not well developed, then our nonbanking financial institutions are just at the starting stage. Therefore, in order to establish an effective capital market, it is necessary to greatly develop nonbanking financial institutions and make them one of the key points in our new financial system. In the field of direct financing, we should mainly substantially develop the standardized stock and corporate bond markets. We should be soberly aware that exercising scale management over the issuing of securities will inevitably hinder the ongoing process of adopting the corporate system in the reorganization of the existing enterprises and this is a management method which goes against the principle of the market economy. Only by abolishing such scale management can the securities market and the market economy as a whole develop healthily. With regard to stocks, some concepts should be clarified. The adoption of the corporate system in the reorganization of the existing enterprises certainly requires that existing assets be turned into a certain quantity of shares. However, first, this does not mean that the enterprise, while turning its assets into shares should at the same time increase its assets and shares. It is absolutely necessary to prevent them from trying to increase investment and neglecting the adjustment of the property rights structure. Second, while an enterprise is reorganized into a joint-stock company, this does not mean that its stocks must be negotiable in the market; even if the stocks can be traded, it does not necessarily mean that they should be listed on a stock exchange. After the joint-stock company becomes the main enterprise form in our country, the stocks of most enterprises should be negotiable in the counter market [gui tai shi chang 2681 0669 1579 1034]. That is to say, we can adopt certain steady steps for listing stocks in the exchange but it is certain that we should promote the development of stocks counter trade [gu piao de gui tai jiao yi 5140 4384 4104 2681 0669 0074 2496]. We hold that any enterprises, as long as they meet the requirements for issuing securities, should be allowed to raise funds through the market. Limiting the scale of securities issuance will only lead to the spread of irregular fundraising activities. In view of the abnormal situation in which the rate of liabilities in the enterprises of our country is too high, it is necessary to change the enterprise capital structure in order to thoroughly change this situation. To achieve this purpose, we must substantially develop the stock market and the corporate-bond market. To sum up, we should make efforts to create a relaxed, free, diverse, and competitive financial system through carrying out financial reform. Only on the basis of such a financial system can the central bank hold a detached position to play a role as a referee in the competition. On the contrary, if there are only a small number of financial institutions and a small number of financial tools in the economy, they will become too cumbersome and will not be able to play an effective role; neither can the central bank play an effective role in exercising macrocontrol.
