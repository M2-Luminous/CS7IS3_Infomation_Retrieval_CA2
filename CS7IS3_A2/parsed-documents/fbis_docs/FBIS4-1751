The move, which is to take place over three days, is the first such offering by the capital. Li Junhua, Director of the Beijing Municipal Commission for Economic Restructuring, said the listing is an important step in improving management and the shareholding system at State-owned enterprises. It is expected to raise more than 1 billion yuan ($114 million) for the Beijing Department Store (Group) Company Limited, the Beiren Printing Machinery Company Limited, the Beijing Light Bus Company Limited and the Beijing Town County Trade Centre Company Limited. The four companies are expected to be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. But the date of the listing has not yet been announced. Those who want to buy shares must deposit money for half-year terms in banks in Beijing. The receipts they receive will then be entered in a lottery to decide who can buy shares. The Beiren company, China's biggest printing machinery producer, plans to float 35 million shares. Money collected from the issuance will be invested in buying advanced technology, developing new products and building new plants, company representatives said. Beiren earned 133.56 million yuan ($15.35 million) in profits last year and floated 100 million shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last July. The Beijing Light Bus Company Limited, which is expected to issue 40 million shares, is one of China's top auto-makers. It registered a profit of 22.32 million yuan ($2.57 million) last year and makes 17 percent of the country's light buses. And it expects to make 37.5 million yuan ($4.31 million) in profits this year. Funds raised through the issuance are set for technical renovation, buildlng a branch factory and importing foreign technology. The Beijing Department Store, built in 1955 and the second largest retailer in the capital, chalked up a sales volume of 1.11 billion yuan ($127.59 million) last year. It is ready to float 50 million shares. Beijing Town and County Trade Centre, a rising star in the capital's commercial industry made 52 million yuan ($5.9 million) in profits last year. It plans to issue 50 million shares. Li said the time is ripe for Beijing to issue shares since the city has made substantial achievements in recent years. As of March 10, Beijing had 204 shareholding companies. The number of securities companies has also grown rapidly. By the end of last year, 34 financial institutions in the city opened securities businesses and 114 securities trading outlets opened, Li said. Moreover, more than 40,000 Beijing residents own stocks, he said. Meanwhile, rising bank savings have helped with listing shares, Li said. By February, the city's individual savings deposits had reached 63.2 billion yuan ($7.26 billion). In addition, he said the country's efforts at drafting laws and regulations in the securities industry have improved the environment for listing shares. Beijing has two companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. But Tianlong and Tianqiao, a waste recycling company and a retailer, did not follow standard practice and float their shares first.
