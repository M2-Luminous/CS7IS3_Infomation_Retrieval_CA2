The meeting comes while the world is watching the developments of the Middle East, which sees calm at times and tension at others. Since the convening of the Madrid conference, movements toward peace in the Middle East have taken on new dimensions that finally resulted in the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which was signed at the White House amid international welcome, U.S. support, and Arab backing. All Arab countries showed an eagerness for a just and lasting peace based on a land-for-peace exchange and recognition of the legitimate Palestinian rights as stated in the successive UN resolutions. That President Clinton fixed his meeting with President al-Asad after contacts and consultations by the U.S. secretary of state in the Syrian capital means that there are far more points of agreement between Washington and Damascus over Middle East issues than differences. If that was not the case, what would the meeting and the talks be for? Through its contacts and watch of the region's developments, the United States realizes that peace in the region cannot be achieved without Egypt and Syria. Now that things have settled down between Egypt and Israel since the signing of the Camp David agreement, and the two sides have seen the positive economic, political, and even social results of the peace process, this successful experiment can be repeated on the Syrian front. But the Israelis need to realize that the continuation of the current situation will have serious implications. The opponents of peace agreements with Israel use this situation to support their rejectionist positions, and any delay in reaching a genuine peace between the Arabs and Israel would encourage the Israeli parties and individuals that reject peace agreements with the Arabs, especially since a state of anxiety and tension still prevails in Israel due to the violence and counterviolence between Jewish settlers and Palestinians. The upcoming meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton may prompt a serious call for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Among his cards at the talks, the Syrian president carries unlimited Arab support for reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the region. He also has Saudi support and blessings for reaching a just solution to the Jerusalem problem. And above all, Syria has special relations with Lebanon, which in turn enjoys special relations with the West and the United States, especially since Lebanon has never been involved in any hostile acts against any of its neighbors. We stress that the U.S. Administration, out of its eagerness to promote the Middle East peace process and to achieve security, stability, and peace in the region, will give these factors due consideration and, consequently, push the Syrian-Israeli track toward serious negotiations to achieve this peace, which all peoples of the region, including the Israeli people, aspire to. The Israeli people reject isolation and demand normalization of relations and the lifting of the trade boycott. These are vital matters for the Israelis, but as the Arab League has announced, they are linked to a full Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 border and to exchanging land for peace.
