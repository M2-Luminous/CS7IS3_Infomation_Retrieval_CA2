FR941007-0-00076 FR941007-0-00023 The domestic fishery for halibut in and off of Alaska is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention) and the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act). The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the Council to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in conflict with, regulations adopted by the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council may develop, for approval by NMFS, limited-access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery in Convention waters in and off of Alaska. The Council acted under these authorities in recommending changes to the IFQ program for the halibut and sablefish fisheries. The Council, through these changes, intends to promote the conservation and management of the sablefish and halibut fisheries, and to further the objectives of the Magnuson Act and the Halibut Act. QS Block Proposals Concern over the potential for excessive consolidation of fishing privileges under the IFQ program was the impetus for the Modified Block Proposal. The Modified Block Proposal provides that (1) initial allocations of QS that represent less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation year will be issued as a block, (2) QS that represent 20,000 lb (9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year will be ``unblocked'' QS, and (3) QS in a block cannot be separated and will have to be transferred as a block. For each species in each IFQ regulatory area, a person who does not hold any unblocked QS can hold up to two QS blocks for that area, but the sum of the two QS blocks cannot exceed use limits in 50 CFR 676.22 (e) and (f). A person who holds unblocked QS for an IFQ regulatory area can hold only one QS block for that area, provided that the total QS held, blocked and unblocked, for that IFQ regulatory area does not exceed use limits referenced above. The Modified Block Proposal also provides that QS blocks resulting in less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut, or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish, in the implementation year can be combined. The QS block resulting from this combination cannot exceed 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) for halibut or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish. This ``sweeping-up'' provision will allow very small QS allocations to be combined into ``fishable'' amounts. The Modified Block Proposal is intended to reduce the maximum potential consolidation relative to the current IFQ program. The Analysis indicated that, if actual consolidation is proportional to the estimates of maximum potential consolidation, more QS holders are likely to remain in the halibut and sablefish fisheries under the Modified Block Proposal than under the current IFQ program. The Modified Block Proposal will not interfere with the opportunities currently available under the IFQ program for larger operations, because QS allocations for an IFQ regulatory area that represent 20,000 lb (9 mt) or more of IFQ in 1994 will remain unblocked. The Council decided that the Modified Block Proposal would protect small producers, part-time participants, and entry-level participants_who may tend to disappear because of excessive consolidation under the current IFQ program_without compromising the flexibility and the economic efficiency of the IFQ program as a whole. Whether QS is blocked or unblocked will be determined by the QS pools for each IFQ regulatory area as they exist on October 17, 1994. Using a specific date to calculate whether to block QS ensures that all persons are treated in a similar manner, regardless of when their QS is issued. October 17, 1994, was chosen as the date to calculate QS because it was long enough after the application period, which ended July 15, 1994, to allow the QS pools to achieve QS amounts reflective of their eventual range, but long enough before the 1995 fishing season to allow for transfers of QS for that fishing season. Transfer of QS Blocks Blocked and unblocked QS will be transferable subject to the approval of the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), and compliance with the transfer regulations found in 50 CFR part 676. Changes are made to the transfer procedure in 50 CFR part 676 to accommodate the Modified Block Proposal, and to clarify further the transfer process. Further information on the rationale for these changes, and on the Modified Block Proposal, can be found in the proposed rule published in the Federal Register on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33272).
