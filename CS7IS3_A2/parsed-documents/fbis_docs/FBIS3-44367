Experts call the phenomenon a "tide of rural laborers migration" or a "great historical migration." At first, most of the migrants came from relatively backward or over-populated areas, such as Sichuan, Zhejiang, Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces. However, the impact has now spread to northeast China. More and more farmers in the area, who used to be reluctant to leave their fertile black farmland, have left their land to work in cities, other provinces or even abroad. Xinsheng, a Korean autonomous village in Changbai Mountains in Jilin Province, has a population of 970 in 232 households. Now, 83 households with 353 people have gone to work and live in the cities. Statistics show that 8,921 households or 17.4 percent of rural households in Huinan County of Jilin Province have left the county. Among the population having left, 12,949 are labourers, accounting for 12.2 percent of the county's total rural labourers. Three hundred and eleven of the labourers have gone to work abroad and 2,819 are working outside Jilin Province, while 3,273 are working in other counties. Experts estimate that at least one tenth of the rural labourers in Jilin Province have migrated. This means that over 730,000 labourers in the province have migrated so far. According to sources from the Public Security Bureau of Changchun city, capital of Jilin Province, more than 90,000 farmers registered for transient residence in the city in October this year alone. Most of the migrated farmers resettle around the urban area or near the trading markets of farm produce. In some markets, 60 percent of booths are taken by migrant farmers. At first, most of the migrants from the countryside worked as nurses, construction workers or peddlers. However, they can now be found in nearly all trades, such as building, transport, telecommunications, commerce, services and manufacturing. Some migrant farmers even invested capital in setting up shops or high-tech enterprises in urban areas. Eight farmers from Shulan County of Jilin Province established a water supply equipment company in Changchun city with 90,000 yuan (15,000 U.S. dollars). With help from higher education colleges and research institutes, products of the company have squeezed into the market of 29 cities in five provinces. Now, the company has fixed assets of 1.1 million yuan (nearly 200,000 U.S. dollars). Its annual output value has hit seven million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars). Last year, the company was listed as a high-tech enterprise by the Changchun city government. Most local governments adopt policies to encourage the migration of farmers, saying it benefits all sides. First, many migrant farmers engage in hard jobs in building, transport and service trades, which urban workers are unwilling to do, providing the urban residents with great conveniences. Second, some migrant farmers set up restaurants or other businesses, providing urban residents with more job opportunities. Third, migrant farmers have helped promote the economic development of both the urban and the rural areas. Yangzishao town of Huinan County in Jilin Province has accepted 1,120 rural people in the past three years, who set up various kinds of enterprises in the service industries. As a result, the town became prosperous. Last year, the town's revenue from the service trade alone reached 6.6 million yuan, which accounted for 22 percent of the town's total output value. Yang Li, a farmer in Changcongshao village in Huinan County, left home to work in a pipe factory in Xian city, capital of Shaanxi Province, in 1985. He returned home in 1988, bringing back information, new ideas and technology. He established a pipe factory with an annual output value of 200,000 yuan in his home village. His fellow villagers followed his example and have set up 24 other enterprises, whose products sell well in a dozen provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. "A farmer leaving as a student will return as a skilled teacher," the local people say. On the other hand, migrant farmers have brought great pressure on the cities. They have become rivals of urban residents for employment, escalating unemployment crisis. They have also added more burdens to the already strained water supply, power supply, transport and post and telecommunications in big cities. Nevertheless, most experts are optimistic about the present migrant tide. They said that from a long-term point of view, the pressure can be turned into motive for the development of cities. Experts suggest that several measures should be taken now to bring the migrant tide under control. These measures include adjusting the resident registration policy and allowing farmers to settle down in the urban areas, setting up a unified labor market to provide migrant farmers with more job opportunities, and speeding up the construction of small towns to absorb more surplus rural labor.
