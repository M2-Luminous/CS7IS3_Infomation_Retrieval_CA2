Regarding the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which ended in failure, he indicated an intention to take quick action to study possible measures to promote market opening with the aim of reducing Japan's trade surplus and work out own plans. After finishing his summit talks with U.S. President Clinton in Washington, Prime Minister Hosokawa arrived at the Haneda Airport around 1800 [0900 GMT] today. From tomorrow, he will be busy dealing with immediate tasks, such as the final compilation of the government's budget plan for fiscal 1994 which will be decided on 15 February, Diet deliberations on the fiscal budget, and reviewing problems of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain deadlocked. As for the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Prime Minister Hosokawa, speaking with reporters, said: Since a trade agreement was 80 to 90 percent complete, I asked the President at the summit talks to conclude the talks. But President Clinton proposed not to conclude the talks in that way. Asked how to deal with the results of the talks, Prime Minister Hosokawa said: Immediately after returning home, we will review the problems. We have to use our brains, and Japan will carry out what it can do. In this way, he said the government will start studying possible measures to promote market opening which will help reduce Japan's trade surplus. Touching on his diplomatic schedule, Prime Minister Hosokawa disclosed that it is difficult to materialize his scheduled visit to China in March. He expressed his hope to visit foreign nations during the consecutive holidays in May. He then said that European nations and Vietnam are potential countries to visit.
