The snow thickness varied from four to eight metres and local residents said nothing of the kind had occurred at least during the last ten years. The snow delayed the launch of the Progress-22 cargo space craft by three days and the blast off which took place on Tuesday became possible thanks to two snow-cleaning trains dispatched to the Baykonur Cosmodrome by the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations. The snow storm hit the launching site on March 4 and two self-propelled railway cars with military personnel were "imprisoned" by it for 24 hours. Available snow cleaning equipment failed to cope with the task and servicemen at the cosmodrome had to use ordinary spades to clean railway tracks. Besides, a fire ruined on March 7 a part of the premises situated close to the testing ground where the "Progress" was, however the blaze was not the reason for the delay in the blast off.
