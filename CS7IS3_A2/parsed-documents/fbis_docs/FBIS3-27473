He said that Zhuhai has followed a course featuring a high starting point and a high level and has taken into account both long-term and immediate developments in city planning and economic construction, adding that Zhuhai has rosy prospects. Accompanied by Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Politburo member and Guangdong CPC Committee secretary; Liang Guangda, Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee Standing Committee member, Zhuhai City CPC Committee secretary, and Zhuhai mayor; and others, Chairman Li visited the terminal which can handle 20,000 tonnes of cargo at Zhuhai port in western Zhuhai; a coal terminal under construction, which can handle 100,000 tonnes of coal; Zhuhai airport; Doumen County; and the construction site of the Qiao bridge, which is the advance project of the Lingdingyang bridge. He also toured the city. While at Zhuhai port, after listening to a report on development of the port, Chairman Li inquired in detail about the plan and construction of support facilities for the port. Standing in Gaolan Island and looking at the natural haven hemmed in by mountains on three sides, he said happily: You built a port and turned a deserted beach into a treasured place, killing two birds with one stone. At the Zhuhai airport, after listening to an account of the development of the airport, Chairman Li was concerned about the support facilities at the airport and asked whether aviation and ground management could meet the demands of emergency take off and landing. Xie Fei added: The construction of the Zhuhai airport provided new experiences in many respects. Guangzhou will follow the example of Zhuhai if it decides to build more airports. At the construction site of the Qiao bridge, Mayor Liang Guangda briefed Chairman Li on the planning and preparations for the building of the bridge spanning the sea and on the social benefits and experiences which will be created from real estate development following the completion of the bridge. While in Zhuhai, Chairman Li also heard reports on work done by the city party committee and government. He fully affirmed the unusual courage displayed by Zhuhai in carrying out the reform and opening policy and in making experiments as well as the achievements made by Zhuhai in city planning, economic development, environmental protection, and birth control. Based on thorough investigations, the chairman said: Zhuhai has acquitted itself splendidly and has a broad vision in planning. Zhuhai not only took into account its own development, but also put itself in economic relationships with South China and even Southeast Asia, so it could forge far-sighted plans for its city construction. It really deserves praise for its excellent performance. Major projects in coordination with the city construction, such as Zhuhai port, Zhuhai airport, and the Zhuhai bridge have got under way in succession and the patterns of a major port and large-scale industry have been outlined. In a few years' time, Zhuhai's development will make it difficult for other cities in the country to bear comparison. Chairman Li was very appreciative of the way land had been developed, used, and managed in Zhuhai. He said: Since the reform and open policy were introduced, many cities in the country have been exploring means of land development, but Zhuhai's experiments have proven most successful. Zhuhai displayed boldness in making huge investments in infrastructural development with the result that land values have been raised. The government has made money through land development and has in turn used the money to expand construction, thus enabling economic growth to follow a steady upward course. In addition, the government formulated a complete set of laws and regulations for management. Zhuhai's experience is worth learning from. Chairman Li fully affirmed a course featuring a high starting point and a high level followed by Zhuhai in economic development. He said: Zhuhai's policy-makers had their eyes on the next 10 or 20 years rather than on setting up an additional one or two enterprises in planning economic development, so their major construction projects had high starting points and were of a fundamental nature. This allowed Zhuhai to catch its rivals at an advantage in future competition. He also maintained: Economic development should be promoted in line with local conditions. Given necessary conditions, some places should press ahead faster. We must not impose rigid uniformity.
