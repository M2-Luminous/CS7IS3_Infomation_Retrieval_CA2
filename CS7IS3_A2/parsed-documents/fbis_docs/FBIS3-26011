A revitalized science and technological structure is gradually taking shape, which will benefit basic research and economic development. In 1994, organizational reform in science and technology research institutions will be further carried out in depth, with structural readjustment and the flow of talent as the main tasks. Through readjustment, the contingent of science and technology workers, who are either engaged in basic scientific research, high-tech research, or tackling major science and technology problems and developing research projects for social benefits, will become more highly trained and the structure will become more reasonable. The internal structures of various science and technology research institutions will be further readjusted and new and more competitive management and operational systems will be adopted. The duplicated organizations will be merged and streamlined and the excess personnel will be allowed to flow and enter the market. Large numbers of technological development and technology service organizations will march toward the market at a faster pace. They will establish enterprises or be changed into science and technology enterprises or enterprise groups. At present, there are already dozens of high science and technology enterprises in China, which were established by science and technology research institutions. They receive an income of some ten million yuan or even a hundred million yuan a year. The civilian-run science and technology enterprises will develop at a higher speed. China now has a total of 40,000 civilian-run science and technology enterprises, of which more than 10,000 were established last year. Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces have made decisions on speeding up development of civilian-run enterprises in the name of the provincial party committee and government and have worked out some new measures. The number of newly established civilian-run enterprises will be much higher this year than last year. Development of the technological market has entered a new historical stage. According to calculations, the turnover of technological transactiona reached more than 18 billion yuan in 1993. The figure was just a little higher than 10 billion yuan the previous year. All kinds of technological transaction activities have been frequently and dynamically carried out in various localities and at various levels. Intermediary organizations, such as invisible assets assessment offices and science and technology agents' offices, have emerged everywhere in the country. Experiments in selected areas on a permanent technological market have also been carried out smoothly. Barriers between the various regions and departments have been smashed and an open and unified nationwide technological market system has begun to take shape. Legal construction for science and technology has been developing steadily. With the promulgation and implementation of the "Law on Science and Technology Progress," science and technology work has been brought onto a track of operating in accordance with the legal system. The task of working out and implementing relevant laws and regulations on protecting intellectual property rights will be continued this year. The establishment of special court of science and technology and court of intellectual rights in Beijing and other areas has provided an effective guarantee for fighting against the illegal practices of violating intellectual property rights and plagiarizing and forging achievements of science and technology research and for protecting the legitimate rights of science and technology institutions and personnel. The number of such courts can increase this year. In 1994, the management method of science and technology management departments at all levels will be further improved and geared to the needs of the market. The 21st century will be one of science and technology. The Chinese people are still faced with a grim reality. According to the latest statistics, China ranks 12th in the world in the number of science and technology treatises published, rising three places from last year, but it is 17th in the treatises on basic research, dropping two. The ultimate purposes of China's reform of the science and technology structure are: First, to combine science and technology with economic development more closely and second, to promote the development of science and technology, especially basic research. Whether China's reform of the science and technology structure is successful or not will chiefly be reflected by the achievements in these two fields.
