Molusi] [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- The Freedom Front [FF] said on Thursday [24 March] it was ironic that the National Party [NP] was suddenly concerned about the number of communists on the African National Congress' [ANC] election candidates list. Reacting to Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha's statement that more than half of the people in the top 50 of the ANC's list were communists, the Freedom Front said it was the NP that had declared communism dead when it unbanned the SA [South African] Communist Party [SACP] in 1990. Mr Botha was responding to a challenge by SACP official Jeremy Cronin that the NP should prove the SACP had more than 16 members on the ANC list. Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said his party remained consistent in its opposition to communism, and urged voters to support the FF to effectively combat the communist threat.
