FBIS3-8389 "dreeu046__a94004" FBIS-EEU-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria `Hijacked' Barges Unload Oil at Serbian Port AU0603204694 Sofia BTA in English 1940 GMT 6 Mar 94 AU0603204694 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Vidin, March 6 (BTA correspondent) -- The Bulgarian ship Khan Koubrat towing six barges loaded with 6,000 tonnes of oil left Bulgarian territorial waters at 3 a.m. on Sunday, BTA learned from the State Shipping Inspectorate. It was followed by two patrol boats of the Western European Union (WEU) and a patrol boat of the Bulgarian border troops upstream to kilometre 845 at the Timok River. The ship disobeyed orders to stop. Official sources who declined to be named said that today at noon the ship called at the Serb port of Prahovo where the unloading of the fuel began. This is the first armed hijacking of a ship in the history of Bulgarian river shipping, according to reliable sources, provided it is not a sham. As the ship passed Vidin yesterday, two persons could be seen on deck pointing a gun and a pistol at seven crew members who held their hands up. All papers of the ship were left behind at the port of Somovit and the regional prosecutor's office in Nikopol, which was expected to rule on a document crime consisting in the entry of a new discharge port in the shipping documents. The fate of the crew is unknown. If kidnapped at gun point, they should be let free to return to Bulgaria. This morning Vidin customs representatives met WEU monitors in Calafat (Romania) to discuss the incident. Customs Chief Nedyalko Yolov declined to give official information. The Council of Ministers today said the Khan Koubrat had crossed Bulgaria's western border with its cargo, entering the Serb section of the Danube. After intensive talks it was decided not to use force to free the hostages and stop the ship so as to avoid the risk of bloodshed and pollution of the Danube by a possible explosion, the government's press office also said. Vesselin Blagoev, chief secretary of the Council of Ministers, said the competent authorities are working on the case. The Khan Koubrat and six barges carrying 6,000 tonnes of oil were detained by WEU monitors near Calafat on January 31 on suspicion of sanctions-busting. Pending a ruling by the Nikopol regional prosecutor's office, the ship was held under customs control at the port of Somovit. On the night of March 3, it sailed undocumented westward to Romanian and Yugoslav territorial waters, apparently hijacked according to eyewitness accounts of representatives of the Vidin customs and the State Shipping Inspectorate and of BTA's local correspondent. The possibility of a sham hijacking cannot be ruled out. Later on the Foreign Ministry's press office said the ministry had been assigned to inform the UN Sanctions Committee of the incident, to take the necessary steps to repatriate the crew, ship and cargo, and to have the hijackers handed over by the country where they will seek refuge. According to the border troops and WEU mission leaders, armed persons aboard the ship had forced the crew to steer to Bulgaria's western border, the Foreign Ministry's press release says. The information by the WEU mission leaders that there might be foreign nationals among the hijackers has not been confirmed so far by the investigation launched by the competent Bulgarian authorities, according to the Foreign Ministry. The Bulgarian authorities took steps to stop the ship as soon as the violation of the customs ban was established. They were assisted by the Romanian authorities, monitors of the WEU mission and the Sanctions Assistance Mission, the Foreign Ministry said. All attempts to stop the train of vessels were unsuccessful.
