In the view of Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who is visiting Finland, Israel is not displaying a true spirit of negotiation when it--at the same time--increases its settlements, continues military operations in Lebanon, and does not free political prisoners. The PLO and Israel are currently negotiating in Taba, Egypt about border control in the self-rule areas, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the borders of Jericho. These issues are important in themselves, but the PLO leadership knows that peace cannot be achieved if the settlement issue is not solved, 'Abd-al-Shafi says. [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] Now these are important, we concede they are important issues, and I certainly do not condone the position of Israel with respect to this. But all the same, we look at these issues as being irrelevant in the face of the ongoing settlement process and I think Chairman 'Arafat is aware of it. [end recording] [Announcer] Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi resigned from the PLO's negotiation delegation in the summer after the secret negotiations in Oslo between Yasir 'Arafat and Israel became public. 'Abd-al-Shafi is paying an unofficial visit to Finland.
