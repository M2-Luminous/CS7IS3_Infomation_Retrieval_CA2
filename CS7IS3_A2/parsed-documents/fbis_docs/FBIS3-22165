Rep. Yi Pok-chin of the Democratic Party told the Assembly interpellation session that much of the sewage from the U.S. military facilities here has been flowing into their neighboring rivers without undergoing proper treatment. Rep. Yim cited a Seoul government report in March last year that about 1,600 tons of 5,000 tons of untreated waste water from the U.S. Air Force K-55 base in Songtan, Kyonggi Province, was streaming into nearby rivers every day. ``According to a state-run environmental research lab, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in the areas surrounding the K-55 base turned out to be 122 ppm [parts per million], much higher than the internationally permissible level of 60 ppm, last August,'' the lawmaker said. ``Through the water and environmental pollution around the U.S. bases has been growing more serious, the Seoul government has been barred by the U.S.-Korean bilateral treaty, SOFA, from cracking down on the contamination,'' Yim insisted. Rep. Yim, who retired as an Army major-general in 1991, also charged that about 1,000 tons of the nonconductor PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl), which is widely known as cancer-causing materials, have been discarded around U.S. radar bases in Korea. ``I have been told that the U.S. authorities have ignored the Seoul government's repeated order to stop their environmental misconduct,'' he said. Yim then asked whether it is true that the U.S. Forces have once asked the Korean Government to finance their purification facilities. Meanwhile, a ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] lawmaker insisted during the same parliamentary interpellation session that the U.S. Forces have operated commercial facilities inside their bases against the SOFA regulations. ``The ten-story Dragon Hill hotel located in the U.S. Yongsan base has been used for business purposes rather than being used by servicemen. It is an obvious violation of the SOFA,'' said Rep. Kwak Yong-tal of the DLP. Rep. Kwak, a former Air Force lieutenant-general, also asked whether the government is willing to take over the ownership of the Seoul House in downtown Seoul from the U.S. military, saying that the American facility has rarely been used by U.S. military personnel.
