The People's Mandate Party was formed in the city of Enugu last week as an offshoot of the Eastern Mandate Union (EMU) grouping prominent politicians from seven states in the region, the reports said. In a statement, the group demanded that Abacha relinquish power by June 30 to make way for a sovereign national conference on Nigeria's political future, and said it was "agreeable" to the possible validation of the outcome of a presidential election annulled by a previous military regime last June. That poll, said by international observers to be free and fair, was generally held to have been won by millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola, but then junta chief General Ibrahim Babangida alleged there had been irregularities. The EMU said it could embark on the organisation of a sovereign national conference and the establishment of a government of national unity with like-minded political organisations elsewhere in the country. It was not clear whether the new group was affiliated to the recently-formed National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a pro-democracy movement comprising prominent politicians, retired military officers and ex-political office holders from states in the southwest, southeast and middle belt of the country. NADECO masterminded a boycott Monday in much of Nigeria of the first round of elections to a constitutional conference which the regime plans to organise at the end of June, as part of a plan it has presented to restore civilian rule. [passage omitted] The EMU, led by former presidential candidate Patrick Dele Cole, also revived old charges that the east of the country has been marginalised within the military and proposed the establishment of regional commands to decentralise the Armed Forces. In 1967-70, Nigeria was wracked by a civil war that ended the secessionist aspirations of the mainly Ibo-peopled east, which tried to form the separate state of Biafra.
