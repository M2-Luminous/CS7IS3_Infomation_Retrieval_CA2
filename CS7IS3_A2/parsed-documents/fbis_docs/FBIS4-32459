The two countries' soldiers are positioned only few hundred meters away from each other. There are no incidents and the region is regularly flown over by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helicopters. The anxiety of the local population loosens, but farmers are prevented from cultivating their land as it is on the territory presently usurped by Serbian troops.
