The measure will not benefit either public employees or retired workers. The bonus proposal, which will be presented next week to President Itamar Franco, was the solution the government found to improve the minimum wage without causing impacts on the social security system and the accounts of states and municipalities. With this proposal the government expects to convince Congress not to establish a $100 minimum wage. Ricupero disclosed that he accepts negotiating Provisional Measure [MP] No. 457 as long as it does not affect the budget balance and not change the conversion of salaries based on the peak exchange rate variation [of the previous four months]. According to Ricupero, the economic team is negotiating with Congress the article of PM No. 457 that forbids the readjustments of contracts established in URV's [Real Value Unit] for periods shorter than a year. The idea, Ricupero said, is to find a midpoint between the current strict rule and the stability the economic team seeks for the economic plan. The minister still is concerned about the foreign debt renegotiation agreement, which will be signed 15 April. Ricupero said the government still faces difficulties in convincing the Dart family, which holds $1.4 billion of Brazilian foreign debt titles, to accept the renegotiation terms approved by the creditor banks' steering committee. Ricupero disclosed that he will not travel to the United States on 15 April to sign the agreements. Central Bank President Pedro Malan will go in his place. "I cannot leave the battlefield right now without being certain of our triumph," Minister Ricupero said. The minister reasserted his strategy to give absolute priority to the approval of MP No. 457. He wants it to be approved before the end of the month. He asked for some credit from Congress, workers, and business people, and more consideration for the stabilization plan. "It would be incomprehensible that the other economic plans, which were authoritarian, should have been approved and that this one, the first democratic economic plan, be distorted before proving its merits," he said.
