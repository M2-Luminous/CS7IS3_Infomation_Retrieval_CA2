Professional associations should be set up to represent a high proportion of volunteers alongside professional soldiers, Ruehe said in Hamburg this evening. He referred to Denmark, where brigades with 5,000 volunteers were already in existence for international missions. Ruehe stressed that the Bundeswehr had to become more "differentiated" to be deployed in a more versatile way. Belief in an army that carries out only one mission is outmoded in view of the changed international situation. Ruehe said it was "nonsense" to talk of the danger of a two-class army. Every section of the armed forces must receive the equipment and structure needed for its task. The defense of Germany and the Alliance would however remain the main mission of the Bundeswehr. Ruehe spoke in favor of entering into a dialogue with Russia and the other CIS states on nuclear security and the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons as soon as possible. He was confident that there would be an enlarged membership of NATO within the framework of the Partnership for Peace by the year 2000.
