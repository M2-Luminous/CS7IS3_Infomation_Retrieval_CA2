Tossed about by political battles which go way beyond it, this modest institution has so far not had much luck. For three years, France, although it initiated the project, blocked any decision on the agency's headquarters while the future of the European Parliament in Strasbourg was threatened. The affair was settled last year and resulted in the selection of Copenhagen as the final headquarters. This new Community body, modest in size, corresponds to an extremely ambitious objective: To finally give the European Union the means of pursuing a real environment policy. "In the absence of any reliable statistics, we cannot say anything about the state of the environment and respect for the directives in the different countries of the Union," Ioannis Paleokrassas, current commissioner for the environment in the European Commission, admitted. It is still impossible to compare the quantity of waste consumed, air pollution, or the quality of water between two Union countries. Indeed, Brussels' aim is to have a reliable and indisputable tool which enables it both to prepare future directives on the environment more efficiently and to monitor their effectiveness on the ground. Independence but Modest Budget "The original idea was also to combat ecological inequalities by preventing the transfer of polluting activities to less demanding countries," Jacques Varet, director of research at the Environment Ministry and first chief of the French Environment Institute (IFEN), explained. The aim now is to gather, check, and process data coming from the whole European Union in order to make them available to Brussels but also to the member states and the public (associations or enterprises). To carry out its task effectively, the agency will have around 40 people an a budget of around 10 million ECU's [European Currency Units] (ECU 9.5 million this year, almost ECU 13 million when fully operational). These are limited means which force it to work through a network. Correspondents in each country, called "focal points" in Community jargon, will have the task of collecting these data. In Germany, the focal point will simply be the big Federal Environment Agency, whereas France has set up a body especially devoted to this work -- the IFEN. It is for the European Agency to harmonize the methods, to compile and interpret the results. In addition, for specific requests, the agency will use thematic centers (which may or may not be focal points) on specific subjects such as air, water, noise, waste, or land use. Political Role At first, the agency will mainly work on air and water quality, natural habitats, and waste. These priorities were all defined in the Fifth EU Framework Program. Every three years it will publish a report on the environment, a vast compendium including all the data harmonized at European level. Meanwhile, it will design specific studies, for instance on acid rain, waste transportation, or the greenhouse effect. The director of the agency should be appointed in April. A work program covering several years will then be drawn up before the summer. Officially, this institution will work completely independently. This is demonstrated by the fact that its 18-member administrative council will comprise in particular two Commission members, two others appointed by the European Parliament, one representative per member state, a representative from Eurostat (the European statistical body), and one from the Joint Research Centers. This independence could ultimately engender tension. Although all states agree on the need to have a data collection tool, many are worried about seeing this institution transformed into a censor with the task of pointing out the good and bad students (which are not necessarily those you would expect...) in the European Union in the sphere of the environment and the implementation of EU directives. This is a "political" role which it is so far being refused but which Brussels would like to see it playing. If it is simply a question of compiling and harmonizing statistics, was there any need to create a new body when a powerful tool in this sphere already exists with Eurostat? In addition, the web-like organization of the network, with focal points intersected by thematic centers, raises the fear of an escalation of bureaucracy, for which Brussels is already all too often criticized. The agency, because of this "battle of headquarters," comes rather late, at a time when many of the European directives have already been adopted or are "in the pipeline" and especially at a time when the environment no longer has the same influence as before within the Commission and in the member states. It will therefore quickly have to prove that, despite its late arrival, it is still an observation post which is more vital than ever.
