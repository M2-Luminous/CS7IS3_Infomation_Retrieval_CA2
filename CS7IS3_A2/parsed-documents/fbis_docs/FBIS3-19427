By joining the EU [European Union], Finland would enter the era of nuclear arms strategy, but this should not be the sole reason for voting against membership, writes Markku Salomaa. The writer has a doctorate in political science and is a researcher with the Academy of Finland. With the common defense of the EU, Finland would also receive the protection of the nuclear umbrella of the West. But at the same time, Finland would end up as a target for the opposing side. Although Finland would not have interests that would require a nuclear deterrent, such interests would develop for Europe, the superpower. Should Finland become a member of the EU, its security policy will face greater changes than at any time since the country became independent if the EU chooses to integrate its defense. A common strategy will provide a strong push toward a nuclear arms strategy. The Union expects from its members total commitment to all aspects of its development plans, and it will not permit neutrality or "nonalliance," as expressed in the Commission's Report as early as 25 May 1992. No one can enjoy the benefits of the Union without being (totally) committed oneself. The defense political development of the Union can only mean the building of common security based on nuclear arms, as they already provide the core of French and British defense. Conventional military might only complements the nuclear deterrents. Conventional forces could be kept fairly small -- as long as their quality is high -- in order to be able to handle smaller scale regional operations Nuclear Powers Not Content With Conventional Weapons The current nuclear powers are not willing, under any circumstances, to relinquish the core of their defense. They are unwilling to take the risk of establishing nuclear-free zones and having to rely on conventional weapons. That would become even more expensive than nuclear weapons. These are the realities we have to face if Finland is a member of the Union in 1996, and a debate commences regarding security and defense policies, as well as the decisions involved in such. Although defense policy decisions by the Council of Ministers would require consensus, the remaining question is, what authority do the different bodies of the Union exert on the use of nuclear weapons by the member countries. Ultimately the decision to use nuclear weapons has previously been, and is now, made by each country's military leadership. The French nuclear arms doctrine is based on just this tenet. Thus the doctrine of the Union will probably resemble the one held by NATO. Finland's options regarding nuclear arms and foreign forces would only apply during peacetime. In addition, the new doctrine espoused by NATO, the United States, and also Russia, openly expresses a preparedness to use nuclear arms for a first strike. The real nuclear strike threshold has been high and is now even higher. The threat of a first strike is necessary for the establishment of a nuclear deterrent effect. Although Russia, in its military doctrine made public last November, expressed the commitment not to use nuclear weapons against nations who are signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and who have no nuclear arsenals of their own, this promise also has some exceptions. A country that has no nuclear weapons can also become a target if it has an alliance with a nuclear power. This doctrine would put all members of the Union in the same basket, without any special exceptions. The Russian doctrine lists as potential threats, which would entitle the country to launch military operations across its borders, the expansion of "military blocks and alliances" in a manner that would constitute a threat to the military and security interests of the Russian Federation. This would include the establishment of foreign troops and weapons systems in a neighboring country, where they have not been located before. Among the threat scenarios is also listed "the suppression abroad of the benefits, freedoms, and lawful rights of citizens of the Russian Federation." This item does not only apply to the Baltic states. The continued uncertainty in Russia's internal affairs is apt to keep familiar doubts alive in all areas bordering on Russia. The impending Russian presidential election brings its own sources of doubts. The exceptional power wielded by the Russian president's office may constitute a problem. Russia's Military Tenets Also Carried Out in Reality For many of these reasons, NATO has maintained its basic level of preparedness on essentially the same level as before, and the organization has not agreed to let the United States withdraw all its troops. Russia is also slowing down the reductions in military personnel, and is, on the contrary, increasing the size of its Armed Forces. The new Russian military doctrine is not simply a piece of paper; the country has started to implement all facets of it. Finnish military policy decisions should be based on strategic considerations and not imagined views. The issue is complicated and difficult because it is so heavily charged with emotion. Membership in the Union should not be rejected for this reason alone, but one should be familiar with all the scenarios involved. One of the realities is also the fact that no sacrifices made by us towards conventional military forces would provide as effective a deterrent as nuclear arms. In addition, if a convential war were to erupt, our country would immediately be on the frontline. And finally, in spite of all doubts, a European nuclear umbrella would benefit Finland. Therefore, it is time for us to objectively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a nuclear armament policy.
