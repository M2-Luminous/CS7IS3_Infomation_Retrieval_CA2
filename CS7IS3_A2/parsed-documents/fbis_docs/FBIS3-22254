The scheme, to be funded by a levy of one penny on every 10 pounds worth of supermarket goods, was presented to Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, by 28 leading companies yesterday. It should enable Britain to recycle 58 percent of its packaging waste by the end of the century and is intended to fulfill Britain's commitments under a new EC packaging directive. The voluntary scheme will be run by a new industry body called VALPAK and will cost nearly 200 million pounds a year. That is less than a tenth of a much criticised 2 billion pounds a year recycling scheme in Germany which Britain has accused of swamping Europe with German refuse. Mr. Gummer called on leading businesses such as Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury's, Coca Cola, Tesco and Procter and Gamble to draw up a scheme last year. Yesterday he repeated his threat that legislation would have to be introduced if the plan did not work. The industry plan, published yesterday, aims to extend doorstep collection and ``high-density'' bottle and can bank schemes to three million homes by 1996. Mr. Mike Clasper, managing director of Procter and Gamble and head of the Producer Responsibility Industry Committee steering group which thought up the British scheme, said the voluntary plan offered ``real benefits for the environment at little cost to consumers.'' Mr. Gummer said that Britain was obliged to meet EC targets which require the recovery of 50-65 percent of packaging within five years. ``I made clear when we invited the packaging industries to produce a plan last year that the alternative to an industry-led scheme would be Government action, which was likely to be more costly, more onerous and less to the liking of industry,'' he said. ``I repeat that message today -- `doing nothing' is not an option. I therefore urge all companies who make, use or sell packaging to participate in discussions on the plan during the next two months.'' ``As I said last July, we are quite prepared to move towards a legislative approach if need be, though we prefer the voluntary route.'' As Mr. Gummer welcomed the plan, industry sources reported that furious disagreements broke out between the 28 firms involved in a last-minute meeting on Friday. Procter and Gamble and Coca Cola are understood to favour more collecting from doorsteps, as they have done at a pilot scheme at Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex, while other companies favour concentrating on bottle banks and paper igloos. One industry source said: ``This scheme is a mess. We are now at five minutes past midnight and we're still all over the place.'' A press conference at which the Producer Responsibility Industry Committee report was due to be presented to the public yesterday was mysteriously cancelled. Incpen, the 20-year old Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment, issued a strong statement immediately criticising the voluntary approach adopted by Mr. Gummer, which it said would not compel all industries to participate . Mr. Peter Davies, chief executive, said: ``We support the concept of this scheme but it must be followed immediately by legislation to ensure compliance.'' The environmental group Friends of the Earth said that Britain appeared to be doing only the minimum necessary to comply with EC law. Mr. Benedict Southworth, recycling campaigner, said: ``Industry has been unable to agree among themselves, let alone agree on a plan.''
