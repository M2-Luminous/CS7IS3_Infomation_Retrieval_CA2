FBIS4-2166 "drchi067_b_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 United States & Canada Trade Minister on Detaching MFN from `Unrelated Issues' Trade Minister on Detaching MFN from `Unrelated Issues' HK0604145294 Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in Chinese 1244 GMT 6 Apr 94 HK0604145294 Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE Chinese BFN [By correspondent Xu Hong (1776 3126) ] [Text] Beijing, 6 April (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- In an interview with a correspondent of this news agency, Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, pointed out today that properly solving the issue of most-favored-nation [MFN] status is a key premise for developing Sino-U.S. trade and economic cooperation. China hopes that bilateral trade and economic cooperation can cast off the shadow of the MFN status issue and achieve greater development. The female minister, who will shortly head a delegation to the United States, said that MFN status is only a trade issue and trade should not be linked with other unrelated issues. Wu Yi believes that the revocation of China's MFN status would work against the interests of all parties concerned. China would suffer certain damage, but the United States would also be hurt, and the extent of this, moreover, would not be smaller than for China. According to data released by a relevant international organization, if China's MFN status is revoked, about 200,000 people in the United States would lose their jobs; many American firms specializing in trade with China, especially small and medium-sized firms, would likely be closed down, and American consumers would spend $18 billion more each year buying substitutes for Chinese products. Wu Yi said: In this way, the United States would lose China, a market with enormous potential. Middlemen in Hong Kong and foreign- invested firms engaged in the processing industry in China, including U.S.-invested firms, would be hit. The female minister believes that the Chinese and U.S. governments should rise above the MFN issue and should pay more attention to common economic benefits. She said: China's economy is developing in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, and the market is continuously expanding. In the next seven years, China's total import value will reach $1,000 billion [figure as received]. Transport, telecommunications, and energy -- all of them key development sectors in China -- are precisely where the strengths of the United States lie. U.S. economic sectors are facing a historic opportunity for developing trade and economic cooperation with China.
