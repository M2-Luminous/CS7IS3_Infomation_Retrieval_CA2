The petition is addressed to the UN Security Council and will go via the British Government. The petition begins as follows: The NEW DAWN [WAAGA CUSUB] newspaper has been asked to campaign for this petition, which is the wish of Somali National Alliance [SNA] supporters in particular and the Somali people in general. It asks the UN Security Council for UN Forces to leave their country and release the officials and supporters who were illegally arrested and taken from their homes, and who are still in UN Operation in Somalia jails. The objective is to let the UN Security Council and the international community know the true feelings of the Somali people. [passage omitted] [Paris AFP in English at 1146 GMT on 30 December in a Mogadishu-datelined item adds: "The petition signed by Aidid's supporters in Mogadishu accuses the United Nations of human rights abuses, including the detention of Osman Hassan Ali, known as `Ato', Aidid's chief financier who was arrested on September 21. Two other senior Aidid aides, Omar Salad Elmi and Mohamed Hassan Awale, have been held since October 3. The petition reiterates Aidid's assertion that the United Nations wants trying to colonize Somalia and accuses the world body of "creating a hostile atmosphere" by attacks against Aidid's faction, causing "the death and injury of an estimated 11,000 Somali civilians." An Aidid supporter, Abdi Abshir Kahiye, said the SNA hoped to hand the petition to UN special envoy to Somalia, Jonathan Howe, with more than 50,000 signatures by the end of January."]
