Mr Kamm, who met senior officials from the judiciary and other departments this week, said the authorities now acknowledged that Bao, who has served nearly five years of a seven-year sentence, was ill, though they insist his life is not threatened. Formerly, officials did not admit that Bao, 60, was sick, despite reports that his health had suffered after his arrest on May 28, 1989. By conceding that Bao is ill, the authorities are opening the possibility of an early release from jail on medical grounds. The officials said Bao was being given special nourishment and medical treatment, but there was no suggestion that Bao's condition was stabilising under the care of the prison doctor. The authorities made their remarks in the context of a discussion on the possibility of prisoners being released on medical parole. When asked point-blank whether Bao would be released, the officials refused to answer directly. "What I'm hoping is that if we can highlight the fact they acknowledge he's sick, we can perhaps increase the pressure for some sort of parole," Mr Kamm said. "They're telling us they're considering releasing people, and that Bao Tong is ill. They say he's getting special treatment. They are not saying that he has stabilised. If anyone is qualified for parole, he is qualified," he said. Bao's son Bao Pu, who has been studying in the United States, said he saw his father for the first time in more than four years on February 17, and again visited him in the Qincheng prison about two weeks ago. "I was shocked," said Mr Bao. "His face was puffy and swollen." He said his father was wearing a padded blue jacket that had not been washed in years. Bao, convicted of "leaking state secrets" and of counter-revolutionary activity in early 1989, is being kept in solitary confinement. Though his cell faces south, there is no window. His cell provides him with enough room to practise taijiquan [traditional Chinese shadow boxing]. He is allowed to shower once a week and is also permitted to watch television at certain hours. Since entering Qincheng, Bao has had 17 polyps removed in six separate operations. The authorities say the polyps have so far been benign. His white blood cell count is well below normal and he has thyroid tumours and suffers from salivary gland atrophy. "He was fine, in spirit, and still as sharp as I remember," Mr Bao said of his father. He added that on his second visit, his father appeared to be a bit better, though his face was still swollen.
