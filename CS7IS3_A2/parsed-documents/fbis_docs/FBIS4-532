In a statement on Monday, the CBM said all outstanding matters regarding international mediation had been successfully resolved at an IFP/ANC joint working group meeting on Sunday. "It is possible therefore now to announce and confirm that seven prominent... international mediators will arrive in South Africa tomorrow Tuesday 12 April to mediate between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party on outstanding constitutional matters," it said. The venue for the mediation was not disclosed. The mediation team is: - Mr Justice H. K. Bhagwati, India; - Lord David Carrington, United Kingdom; - Mr Justice A. Leon Higginbotham, United States of America; - Prof Paul Kevenhorster, Germany; - Dr Henry Kissinger, U.S.; - Mr Justice Antonio la Pergola, Italy; and, - Prof Jean Antonie Laponce, Canada. Three special advisors to the mediators and two constitutional advisors to both parties will also be present, said the CBM, which has been appointed secretariat to the mediation. Some analysts have said that before the mediation gets to "outstanding constitutional matters" the mediation will first have to address the deadlock between the two parties on the election date. The ANC has said the April 27 deadline is "sacrosanct"; the IFP has said constitutional compromises mean little if it has no time to prepare itself for an election focused on those compromises.
