The meeting was held at the Congress of Deputies. In the opinion of Yeltsin, intensive bilateral contacts are very important as they enable Russia to learn the unique Spanish experience of peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. That transition required profound changes in political, social and spiritual life of Spain, it was "a painful but wholesome process of revival of the Spanish dignity," said the president. The current Russian processes are somewhat similar, he noted. "Practically every citizen of our state feels how tenacious is the past and vices. Russia has covered the first, most difficult part of this path," said Yeltsin. When elaborating the new Russian constitution that was adopted in universal voting, the Spanish Constitution and its experience of the 1970s in the achievement of national reconciliation and accord were attentively studied, said the president. The Moncloa pact enabled Spain to avoid a collapse, create an atmosphere of civilized interaction between major political forces and become the basis of stabilization and consolidation of civic peace. "Russia needs this as well. We are working to achieve interaction between state bodies, political parties and movements, public organizations, all influential forces of Russia," said Yeltsin. The president stressed the need to develop Russian-Spanish inter-parliamentary relations. In his opinion, it should be not only exchange of high-ranking parliamentary delegations but also contacts of deputies, members of committees and commissions and experts. The Russian foreign policy and the Russian approach to cooperation with Spain are based on sound patriotism, said Yeltsin. "It will do good for the countries and their peoples. There is another important aspect -- unification of our efforts to solve uneasy problems of modern world," said the president. These are, primarily, joint initiatives to settle conflicts that alarm Europe and the whole world. In his turn, President of the Spanish Congress of Deputies Felix Pons Irazazabal [name as received] said Spain is watching with great interest political, social and economic transformations in Russia and formation of Russian democratic structures and market economy. He expressed the assurance the reforms carried out by President Boris Yeltsin will result in stability, consolidated democracy and economic improvement. He called for consolidation of Spanish-Russian relations and close contacts between the two parliaments.
