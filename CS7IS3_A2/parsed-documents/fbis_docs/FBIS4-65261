But to what end? And with what cards in his hand? Did Alain Juppe have any chance of persuading his interlocutors on the other side of the Atlantic to abandon their cautious reserve simply by threatening to withraw our blue helmets? Of course, France is entitled to speak loud and clear, because it can legitimately invoke the argument that we have done more than others: We break the record for the number of men in UN uniform in the former Yugoslavia, and also that of the number of men killed and wounded. But who asked us to do this? We wanted to set a good example. We were not really followed by our allies, aside from the British, to a very relative degree. We are now pretending to be determined to "pull out," as our military say, if they continue to "abandon us." But are we credible? At a time when [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur is telling the National Assembly that "the time for decisions is approaching," Alain Juppe merely says in Washington that "the withdrawal of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops may be inevitable," and that, in any case, "it is not possible to spend another winter in Bosnia." The time for decisions is therefore not as close as all that. And this is understandable. Why, after having invested so much -- rightly or wrongly -- withdraw at the very time when a settlement seems conceivable, however dreadful it might seem? The Serbs have virtually achieved all their objectives. The Russians, French, British, and other so-called "Europeans" are thoroughly humiliated and are prepared to accept the fait accompli, to turn a blind eye to everything they have condemned, provided there is a piece of paper, carrying God knows whose signatures, which makes it possible to forget the nightmare for a moment. The problem is that Bill Clinton and his advisers, who have taken care not to venture into the Balkan hornet's nest, do not agree with this kind of arrangement. The Americans are portraying themselves, at little cost for the time being, as the defenders of the Bosnian Muslims. They want the arms embargo to be lifted in their favor and they will not consider easing the sanctions imposed on Belgrade in any way. The United States did not fight the Gulf War for nothing. It is the new defender of the Arab world; and it is in this role that the U.S. secretary of state will take his seat in Geneva today. Mr. Juppe was right to sound the alarm in Washington. America certainly hears it ringing but usually with earplugs in its ears.
