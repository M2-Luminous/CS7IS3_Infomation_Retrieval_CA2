The report shows that the employment structure in rural areas further improved last year with the scale of township enterprises further enlarged and eight million farmers being transferred into non-agricultural industries. The newly increased working force in the rural areas for the year was, however, still put at over seven million resulting in the agricultural sector still being overcrowded with 340 million labourers involved in it. On how to solve the problem of transferring the surplus labour in rural areas to non-agricultural industries, experts in this field held that in the coming ten years, China must speed up the development of fine-quality and high-efficiency agriculture, tertiary industry and the agricultural product processing industry as well as the process of urbanization in rural areas, realizing the goal of large-scale and consistent reduction of surplus labour in rural areas starting from 2010.
