FR940817-0-00027 FR940817-0-00013 40 CFR Part 82 [FRL&hyph;5040&hyph;7] Protection of Stratospheric Ozone AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of partial stay and reconsideration. SUMMARY: This action announces a three-month stay of certain federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofit of appliances containing ozone-depleting substances contained in the regulations implementing the National Recycling Program. The effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), as they apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment only, including the applicable compliance dates, is stayed for three months pending reconsideration. EPA is issuing this stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration. In the proposed rules section of today's Federal Register , EPA proposes, under Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), to temporarily stay the effectiveness of these rules and applicable compliance dates beyond the three months expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B), but only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules in question. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials supporting this rulemaking are The PRESIDING OFFICER. contained in Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;01, Waterside Mall (Ground Floor) Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 in room M&hyph;1500.

Background On July 13, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) sent to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a petition for reconsideration of the Refrigerant Recycling Rule, promulgated May 14, 1993, (58 FR 28660), particularly the leak repair provisions under 40 CFR 82.156(i) as they concern industrial process refrigeration equipment 1 . On that same date, CMA filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking review of this Refrigerant Recycling Rule ( Chemical Manufacturers Association v. Browner, et. al., D.C. Cir. Docket 93&hyph;1444.) As part of a settlement agreement signed by EPA and the CMA on May 20, 1994, EPA agreed to propose changes to the appropriate sections of the rules. A 113(g) notice of the settlment agreement was published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30584). 1 Industrial process refrigeration is defined in ยง82.152(g) of the final regulations (58 FR 28713). The definition states that `` industrial process refrigeration means, for the purposes of ยง82.156(i), complex customized appliances used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, petrochemical and manufacturing industries. This sector also includes industrial ice machines and ice rinks.'' The settlement agreement set a tight deadline for the completion of rulemaking, requiring EPA to propose changes by September 1, 1994, and to promulgate amended regulations by June 1, 1995. By this action, EPA is convening a proceeding for reconsideration. II. Rules To Be Stayed and Reconsidered
