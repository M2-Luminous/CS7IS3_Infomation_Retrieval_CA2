Its fundamental premise is that the height of the rate of inflation is basically dependent upon the amount of money in an economy. For this reason it is the aim of the Bundesbank to control the amount of money in circulation that is used to pay for goods and services, called the money supply. What is included in this, however, is a matter of discretion. The M3 money supply, the amount selected to be used as a guide, comprises note and coin circulation as well as sight deposits held by domestic firms and private individuals at domestic banks and savings institutions, time deposits with up to a four-year notice, and savings deposits subject to a three-month withdrawal notice. The criticism of the Bundesbank's monetary policy goes so far as to call for the abandonment of current money supply policy altogether. It is also being considered, however, whether changes in money supply policy will suffice. 1. Change in the Definition of Money Supply One radical move would be to replace the M3 money supply. The new money supply would be augmented by the amount of German mark deposits held in foreign markets ("Euromarkets"), because monies held outside the country can be transferred into the country and used for payments at no significant delay or cost. This new money supply would have the advantage over M3 that short-term movements of money in and out of the country would have no influence on the estimation of the growth in the money supply. For quite some time now the Bundesbank has done calculations for such a money supply, which it calls the "M3 extended" money supply. However, it seldom quotes this growth rate. Differentiated models present another concept. Here the separate components of the money supply would be weighted with an interest rate; for example, time deposits would be weighted with a money market interest rate. This would give those components like time deposits, which are used not for payments but as investments, a lower weighting. The result of this would be that capital investment transactions such as rearrangements of time deposits and securities would disturb the money supply less than before. However, differentiated money stocks are also disputed. Estimates show that their relationship to the price level is often not as close as the relationship of M3 to the price level. In addition, the Bundesbank has already changed the money supply once, from the central bank money stock to M3 in 1988. To the surprise of many banking experts, the chairman of the board of experts, Herbert Hax, recently expressed his support for the old concept. In comparison with the M3 money supply, with the central bank money stock the note and coin circulation was weighted relatively heavily as compared with M3, which, in the event of fluctuations in demand for note and coin currency, seriously distorted the rate of growth of the money supply. 2. Change in Method of Estimation A different method of estimation could be more promising for M3 than a change in the money supply limits. Up to now the Bundesbank has used a method of annualization, that is, it has calculated an annual rate from monthly rates. A growth rate of 21.2 percent for January does not mean an increase in the money supply of 21.2 percent between the fourth quarter of 1993 and January of 1994. The money supply actually grew much more slowly. The rate of 21.2 percent results from the assumption that the growth rate that occurred between the fourth quarter of 1993 and January of 1994 will continue over the entire course of the year. For, what is of interest to the Bundesbank is not the January figure but the growth rate for the fourth quarter of 1994 as compared with the fourth quarter of 1993. The method of annualization becomes problematic at the beginning of the year. Why should the rate of expansion of the money supply observed over two months automatically continue over many months? This method is questionable particularly when the figure for January becomes distorted by extraordinary factors, as has occurred here. One alternative would be to calculate averages. In this way, developments in the money supply over a six-month period could be compared with developments during the corresponding time period in the previous year. During a six-month period of observation, if one month's figures are inflated as a result of extraordinary factors, they do not have such a strong effect on the overall figure. BHF Bank recently proposed a completely different method. Although they are basically in favor of retaining the method of annualization, they have proposed that a different type of calculation be used for the first three months of the year in hopes of neutralizing extraordinary factors, at least in part. Although the Bundesbank is aware of the difficulties with the money supply, there may actually be little readiness to discuss the problem. It has been said that they are waiting for quieter times before discussing alternative concepts. If the Bundesbank were to alter its policy now it would be said: "If they are not satisfied with the figures, they simply change their concept." They do not want to create this impression.
