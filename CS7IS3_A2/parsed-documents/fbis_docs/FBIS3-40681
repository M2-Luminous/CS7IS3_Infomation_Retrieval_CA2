She is also the general secretary of the ruling party, the AIADMK [All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]. In a statement issued on behalf of AIADMK she has said: "Declaring that India may not adopt the Dunkel proposal on international trade, will affect Indian economy and its export-import trade. "Since certain clauses of these proposals are not favorable to Indian conditions, in my opinion, we should negotiate with the countries concerned, and work the differences out. "We have been using foreign inventions, and production methods extensively in our industries. The new agreement regulates such use and will eventually necessitate paying more tariffs on such products. This may affect our agricultural and other sectors. "We must study the ways in which we can alleviate any undue burdens this might cause us since we are producing these items, even if with foreign assistance. We must aim at keeping prices under control." REQUEST TO DELHI: "Adopting these proposals has caused the central government to rescind several grants that it was previously giving. There is the likelihood of facing inflationary prices in fertilizers and genetically-improved seeds. The central government should devise ways to keep up the grants and make the new system work for the multitudes of indigent Indian farmers. "In the area of pharmaceuticals, it is going to be mandated that a considerable sum of royalties be paid to foreign countries, if their inventions and discoveries resulted in the original manufacture. This is because of revised patent and copyright laws and review of intellectual property rights world-wide. "Some life-saving drugs sell for very high price in foreign countries. We will have to sell them at comparable prices, should we import them. Thus either way drug prices are going to go up in India. The central government will have to come up with recommendations to control this situation. "In a changing world economy, when all the countries cooperate to come up with a general agreement, it is not prudent for India to stay aloof, since it will affect our economy. At the same time, we have a responsibility to our citizens and absolutely have to study how to really adopt these rules to our indigenous conditions and requirements. "We have to live in harmony with the world, and safeguard our special interest as well. I hope that the central government will take all the necessary steps to do the same."
