The pilots will soon be serving over Bosnia. During the exercises, the pilots will drop a total of 30 500- pound bombs. Beginning on 1 April the pilots will be flying out of the Villafranca base in Italy for missions over Bosnia. The NATO operation over Bosnia is intended to maintain the no- fly zone over the war zone by giving air support to the UN ground troops and, perhaps, by carrying out air strikes. These kinds of offensive actions will be the subject of in-depth talks today and Wednesday within NATO as a means of breaking the siege of Sarajevo. Regular exercises with real bombs are very controversial for the population of the islands of Vlieland and Texel due to the noise and damage to the environment and houses. For that reason, the Defense Ministry has decided that the exercises will be restricted to just half an hour twice a day and not at all on the weekends. On both islands there are measuring posts for establishing the noise and vibrations caused by the explosions. If there is demonstrable damage then the exercise is suspended. The same also happens if weather conditions are unfavorable.
