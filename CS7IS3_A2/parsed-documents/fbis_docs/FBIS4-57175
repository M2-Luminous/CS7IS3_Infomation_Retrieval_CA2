Heavy rains have been disrupting the progress of the harvest in this part of the nation and were the main reason for the poor results achieved in the last 10 days. [Torres] "The order is clear: We are to continue fighting and have to grind the very last cane to extract the maximum sugar." In Guantanamo, Torres chaired the 10-day progress meeting in the southeastern region, where the host province surpassed the neighboring provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Granma. Torres acknowledged that the sugar harvest is the most difficult task within the sugarcane production program. Cuba's goal is to exceed by several hundred tons last year's harvest, which failed to produce approximately $450 million of income to Cuba. The persistent rains have now added to the known difficulties in the southeastern region. [Torres] "We can no longer ask for the same results as those that were expected in other times; but we can look for the maximum, the variants, to grind with the most efficiency possible." In this 10-day harvest progress meeting, Havana Province cane harvesters were praised for reaching their sugar production goal. Also stressed at the meeting was the necessity to maintain an elevated planting rate to ensure increased production in the next harvest. Guantanamo Province announced that, by the end of May, it will be the first to reach its spring planting program of 180 caballerias.
