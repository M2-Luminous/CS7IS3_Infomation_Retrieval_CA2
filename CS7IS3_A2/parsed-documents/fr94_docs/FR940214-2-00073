ACTION: Notice of Renewal of the Nuclear Safety Research Review Committee. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Safety Research Review Committee was established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a Federal Advisory Committee in February 1988 to provide advice to the Director, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, on matters relating to NRC's nuclear safety research programs. The committee is composed of experts capable of providing a wide variety of technical and managerial viewpoints drawn from industrial national laboratory, university and not-for-profit research organizations.
