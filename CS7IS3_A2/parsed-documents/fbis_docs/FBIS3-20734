Nedeljkovic: "Appeals"] [Text] The management of the Serbian Electric Power Industry has found itself in a no-win situation. By appealing to consumers to conserve and rationally consume electricity, it has to destroy an age-old myth of Serbian might. In the former Yugoslavia, and especially during its disintegration, residents of Serbia were made to believe that the Serbian power industry is strong, that it can satisfy domestic needs and the needs of other consumers, and even export a surplus to European countries. Only France was held up as an example of a country in a better position and able to export more power than Serbia. Since the media, together with the highest political and state representatives, participated in the creation of this myth, it is not surprising that it became rooted in the people's consciousness. Everybody thought that without Serbian energy, Slovenes, Croats, and Macedonians would be left in darkness, that their countries will not be able to survive. Nowadays, however, as soon as the weather turns colder, the Electric Power Industry appeals to consumers to conserve energy and then institutes cut-offs. Most people suspect the utility companies of some sort of a plot to cover up their exporting electricity and leaving consumers without power or simply a plot by enemies or saboteurs. All explanations by the experts, data, and appeals are at no avail -- people obstinately believe that there is plenty of electricity, even a surplus. Facing the truth is painful. It obviously takes time to destroy a myth. However, the truth is that the Electric Power Industry of Serbia is incapable of meeting consumers' needs the moment there is a failure in the power system or a substantial increase in demand, which happens regularly when it gets colder. The experts say that the system can deliver 110 million kWh per day maximum. But consumption reached record levels last November, December, and January. A few days ago, consumption climbed to 114 million kWh and it will probably continue to increase. It is also true that we import power, be it from our neighbors or from former republics, whenever there is an upsurge in demand. It is also an unpleasant truth that power cannot reach consumers because the distribution system lacks the needed capacity. Around New Year's Day, 35 transformer stations and 10 kilometers of long-distance power lines burned out, causing 3 million German marks' worth of damage. Additional problems are caused by the lack of equipment and spare parts as well as the lack of funds. Why the electric power industry became impoverished and why electricity consumption increased 60-70 percent is another question. Without speculating, it is worthwhile mentioning that in the opinion of experts the government deliberately "preserved social peace with low electricity rates." If this thesis is correct, the bill for such a policy will be too high. It must be remembered that although industry is virtually at a standstill -- hence not consuming much power -- this free-fall of industrial production will have to bottom out some day, since the crisis cannot last forever. But how to spur the economy if there is no power? The electricity rates are probably the main culprit for the present situation, although prices are not the sole cause. Due to the low rates, the electric power industry cannot even use barter to pay its bills; a sawmill can pay its monthly bill with a board four meters long and a cement factory with a few sacks of cement. It does not pay for a utility company to read a meter and send a bill since the paper costs more than the amount due. This is absurd. Hope lies in the stabilization program. This year, the electric power industry expects an average price of four cents [as published], not realizing that nobody will be able to pay it.
