Jelicic expresses concern that the stable dinar, which is pegged to the German mark and is a key element of the program, may not survive the inflationary pressures of the second phase of the economic recovery program and its plans for state support for key industries. (The stable dinar is nicknamed "Avram" after Bank Governor Dragoslav Avramovic, author of the stabilization program.) In addition, Jelicic charges that the Serbian Government's plan to establish coordinating groups for economic recovery which will be responsible to a Central Coordinating Team (CKT) is reminiscent of the central-planning, command economy of the post World War II era. Inflationary Pressures In the 2 May article, titled "The Conception of Inflation," Jelicic argues that the contents of the second phase of the Program for the Recovery of the Yugoslav Economy introduced in early May make it possible to predict "more or less accurately" whether the dinar will remain stable or whether its "quiet erosion" will begin. Jelicic recalls that there was disagreement within the government over adoption of the "Avramovic Program" in late 1993: The word of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was decisive in adopting the stability program, Jelicic writes, while most of those involved in the decision, including Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic and the majority of economists in Serbia, viewed hyperinflation as unavoidable as long as the war and sanctions lasted and favored a solution that would provide state "support for the most important sectors, from the army to medicine." Since January, however, the success of the Avramovic program and the stable dinar policy -- the disappearance of "any inflation whatsoever" on 24 January, maintenance of the dinar-mark parity for the most part, and increase of the state's hard currency reserves by 299 million marks -- and the resulting "rapid influx of money into empty state coffers," Jelicic writes, has "choked off disagreements on basic concepts" and shifted discussion to the "second phase of the economic stabliization program, `economic revival.'" Judging from what has "leaked" to the public so far, Jelicic concludes, what the Federal Government has prepared points toward increased state spending. "Stimulus measures and more stimulus measures" have been announced for those producers "in which a state interest is ackowledged" and once again the economy is being divided into "essential and nonessential parts." Moreover, elements of a "policy of controlled prices" are beginning to appear, not only for individual products or services but for production factors (the cost of capital and labor), and commercial banks are being "leaned on to secure `necessary' means for clients," again for the "sake of reviving production, and so forth." Jelicic contrasts recent statements by key officials on the government's approach. A recent Avramovic statement that a "healthy national currency is the best basis for economic expansion," Jelicic says, means that economic expansion is possible "only where there is no `revival' of monetary emissions without backing." Nevertheless, Jelicic points out, two vice presidents responsible for coordinating implementation of the recovery program -- Dragan Tomic of the Serbian Government (who is also minister without portfolio in the Federal Government) and Nikola Sainovic of the Federal Government -- were cited in daily newspapers as advocating increased state support during a recent visit to the Serbian industrial city of Kragujevac. Tomic reportedly stated that the government was "in a major offensive to stoke up the economy" and that "it goes without saying that we will support those who produce." Sainovic, saying that he "supported monetary stability," at the same time added: "We are in favor of the spirit of free market competition under the conditions of the sanctions, with special reference to those collectives in which the sanctions have caused especially negative consequences." Jelicic also cites newspaper reports that the Federal Government will draft a "special program" to increase the use of "`special-purpose' (weapons) production capacities." Jelicic implies that the Zastava firm in Kragujevac is a potential candidate, since its civilian sector will probably produce only 20,000 automobiles this year, thus operating at only 10 percent of its capacity. Jelicic cites other evidence of pressure for state intervention, pointing out that Tomic -- longtime director of the Simpo firm in Vranje, a major manufacturer and distributor of furniture and other household products, and a member of the board of governors of the National Bank of Yugoslavia -- has been best known for organizing regular weekly roundtables on state television that bring together representatives of various economic sectors to uncover ways to revive production "through mutual aid, but also with government aid." In one such discussion, Jelicic adds, an enterprise director said "with complete candor" that he was looking forward to the completion of the state budgets because "this would make possible more money and more work for his company." In short, Jelicic observes, the picture is very reminiscent of the early post-World War II era when Edvard Kardelj was in charge of economic policy or, "more precisely, of all times when, under various names, an economy without a sound currency was created." Role of Coordinating Teams In his 9 May article, titled "The CKT as the CK [Central Committee]," Jelicic focuses on the proposed organizational structure of the recovery program -- drafted in the office of Dragan Tomic -- and warns that under this plan, the Serbian economy will find itself under an administration reminiscent of the state administrative-operational leaderships (AOR) of the central- planning, command-economy era of the late 1940's and early 1950's. The only differences, he says, would be in the name -- at that time the AOR's and today the SKT's (special coordinating teams) -- and in the fact that the SKT's, unlike the AOR's, are not subordinated to a ministry, but to the CKT, the "organizational center" for implementing the recovery program. Describing the structure of the Operational Program, Jelicic presents an organizational diagram "drawn up by Dragan Tomic" which shows that the CKT is responsible directly to the Serbian Government and that SKT's for "branches of production" are subordinate to the CKT. The diagram explains everything, Jelicic states, warning that "one should not examine it superficially or interpret it lightly." The "center of centers," he says, is Dragan Tomic, the Serbian minister "responsible for coordinating the implementation of the Avramovic economic stabilization plan." Next in the hierarchy, within the CKT, are the "magnificent seven," identified by the plan as "the most competent specialists," who are ready to provide the prerequisites for the successful implementation of the recovery program. Other economic players in the republic -- regional and local governments, commercial banks, unions, scientific institutes, and production enterprises (companies) -- are also subordinate to the CKT, either directly or through the SKT's. Jelicic observes that enterprises are found at the bottom of the organizational diagram, several layers removed from the CKT, and that "judging by the diagram," the Serbian Government went as far as possible to "humiliate enterprises and businessmen." The "main task" of the CKT, Jelicic writes, is to form specialized teams in production, trade, and the banking system and to establish a specialized bank or consortium of banks that will provide "indispensable financial support to carry out concrete plans of the economic recovery program." The basic task of the SKT's is to "implement the general policy and directives of the central team," and, within this framework, to draft and carry out their own operating plans. Another major duty of the SKT's, according to the plan, is to inform the public once a month "via special television programs and other means of information about the results of the recovery of production in various economic sectors on the basis of benchmarks for the successful implementation of the program (volume of production, number of enterprises rehabilitated, number of productive new employees, and so forth), as well as about planned measures and activities." Subordinate to the SKT's are management teams, Jelicic says, noting that "their task is easier" because they do not have to report to the public, but only to those to whom they are subordinate, and "managers have been promised that they will be given special awards for their work in the form of various types of incentives." A footnote in the organizational diagram states that members of the management teams are drawn from specialists from "successful enterprises, chambers, institutes, faculties, and elsewhere." The management teams oversee "enterprises that are being given direct assistance to improve production." Avramovic Defends Organizational Plan According to statements made in an interview aired 11 May on the Belgrade RTB Television Network, Dragoslav Avramovic apparently does not share Jelicic's apprehension about the fate of the currency nicknamed for him. Asked to comment on Tomic's plan to form coordinating groups for the recovery of the economy, Avramovic replied: "Well, this is an extraordinary initiative. We have been thinking about it, but not in terms of such concentrated and extensive efforts as he has undertaken. We expect all the best from it, as the key to our future recovery lies in the reconstruction of our production systems and big companies. There could not have been a better initiative than the creation of these coordinating groups, which will take care of the revival of production, further investments, and the resolution of all problems that some of our companies face."
