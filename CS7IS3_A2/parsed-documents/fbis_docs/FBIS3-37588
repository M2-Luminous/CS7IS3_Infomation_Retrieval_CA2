It was devoted mainly to the results of the Crimean president's six-day visit to Moscow. The president noted that he is "more than satisfied" with the meetings and negotiations in Moscow. According to Yuriy Meshkov, some tangible steps have been made toward merging the economies of Russia and the Republic of Crimea. The president said that by the start of the summer vacation season the peninsula will be in the ruble zone. Yuriy Meshkov assured that "we shall feel the results of this in the very near future." According to the president, "all the important decisions have been made on energy deliveries and other problems, in spite of the rather complicated situation in Russia itself." It was specially noted that "the Republic of Crimea enjoys the most favored nation regime with Russia." The president did not say whom he met in Moscow, saying only that negotiations were held at the highest level. "Above that level is only God." [passage omitted] Talking about his visit to Kiev prior to his trip to Moscow, Meshkov stressed repeatedly that this visit was of a working character. "In Kiev, questions of the Crimean economy were discussed." Meshkov noted, however, that "the negotiations there were conducted in a friendly but rather tense situation. There is no way they can compare with the talks in Moscow. It is like apples and oranges." The president confirmed reports that Russia has allocated 50 billion rubles to ensure the return of the people deported from Crimea. Sharp comments were made with respect to persons implicated in misappropriating the resources earlier granted to the Crimean Tatars by Ukraine. "Some Crimean Tatars live in dugouts while some are building four-story mansions for themselves. I ordered my ministers to straighten that out." The president stated that his first edict will be on interethnic relations. Responding to the question of weather he has advised Kravchuk about his trip to Russia, Yuriy Meshkov said, "I do not report to the Ukrainian president on my work." [passage omitted] Journalists at the press conference assessed Meshkov's phrase "I consider it abnormal when state structures are used to promote the (journalists') views" as an encroachment on glasnost. The president believes that the journalist's duty is to "convey information," not express his opinion or select people who share it. "It is wrong to use one's official position to express one's personal views."
