Meanwhile, government forces have begun bombing the western town of Pailin heralding another major assault on the Khmer Rouge stronghold, according to Khmer Rouge sources tonight. Cambodian television has broadcast messages from the co-ministers of interior affairs Sar Kheng and You Kockry who said that the people of Phnom Penh are "indignant" over the failure of the round-table meeting on June 15-16, and indicated they would retaliate against the representative office. The government has warned it can no longer guarantee the safety of the Khmer Rouge staff in Phnom Penh and recommended them to leave before June 19. But it will ensure their safety to the airport if they advise a departure timetable at least one day before leaving. However, the government stressed that if any staff miss the deadline, anything could happen and it will not protect them if they are attacked. A spokesman also read out a strongly-worded statement on television tonight, denouncing the Khmer Rouge for rejecting a ceasefire proposal by King Sihanouk and thus rejecting the will of the nation and the people.
