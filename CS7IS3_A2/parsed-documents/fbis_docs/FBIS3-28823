The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] positively supports this plan and is moving to call on the international community to "let China join it at an early date." This is because the MOFA has judged that "incorporating China into the framework of a market economy will eventually promote its reform." Japan also plans to take the initiative in holding bilateral tariff talks with China, which are preliminary steps to joining GATT, and appeal for "speeding up the procedures for China's admission" at the GATT's Uruguay Round ministerial conference to be held in Marrakech, Morocco, in April for signing the accord. The current situation indicates that the World Trade Organization (WTO) will likely be inaugurated six months ahead of the original schedule. An accord was reached at the Uruguay Round talks that GATT will be changed into WTO in July 1995. It is with this background that Japan has started assisting China's early admission. If China should fail to obtain GATT membership within this year, it will also fail to become a founding WTO member. Then, China will have to once again start its application for the WTO membership after its inauguration. In this case, it is most likely that China's participation will be further delayed. A senior MOFA official expressed his concern, and said: "If China is kept out of the WTO, the multinational rules in world trade will not be perfect." Moreover, the MOFA aims at indirectly checking the United States by having China admitted into the WTO system. In a bid to win the membership before the year ends, China has been engaged in improving its trade conditions at home. For example, the dual exchange rates for the yuan were unified into one early this year. In March, GATT will hold working-level panel meetings on China's participation. However, in connection with the issue of renewal of the most-favored-nation status for China, the United Stated has indicated a cautious stance on China's GATT admission. Thus, if the current state is left unchanged, China may face a delicate situation regarding its GATT participation within this year.
