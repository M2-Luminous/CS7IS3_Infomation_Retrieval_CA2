FR940713-2-00062 FR940713-2-00040 The mission of ASTCDPD is to provide State and national leadership to develop programs for the control and prevention of chronic disease conditions and to prevent the development of behaviors that contribute to the development of chronic disease conditions. ASTCDPD is uniquely capable of analyzing, advising, and fulfilling liaison responsibilities for comprehensive chronic disease prevention and control activities among such broad-based specialties as Health Education/Risk Reduction, Diabetes, Physical Activity and Fitness, Heart Disease and Stroke, Cancer, Nutrition, and Tobacco. ASTCDPD has served as a policy development and capacity-building organization in public health matters since 1988 and has as one of its major objectives the sharing of information within and between State health departments. In collaboration with other national organizations, ASTCDPD accomplishes its mission by disseminating information on chronic disease program needs and services, recommending and advocating improved policies and programs. ASTCDPD also provides consultation and guidance to State programs in the establishment of statewide systems of coordinated, community-based prevention and individual care for persons with chronic or disabling conditions, and for persons with limited access to services. All of these activities are accomplished through cooperation and collaboration with national, State, and local partners in the public and private sectors. Although other organizations may possess some of these abilities and/or perform some of these roles, no other organization has ASTCDPD's unique characteristics. ASTCDPD is comprised of State chronic disease program directors, who are necessary to effectively carry out the activities entailed in this program.
