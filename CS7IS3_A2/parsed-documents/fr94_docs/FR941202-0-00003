FR941202-0-00003 FR941202-0-00001 B. The petitioners requested that the NRC recognize the practice of nuclear pharmacy and the certification of nuclear pharmacists by the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties. Specifically, the petitioners requested that nuclear pharmacists be permitted to: (1) Compound radiopharmaceuticals as allowed by State or FDA regulations; (2) Compound radiopharmaceuticals whose manufacture and distribution are not regulated by the State or FDA; (3) Prepare radiopharmaceuticals using radionuclide generators and reagent kits in a manner other than in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; (4) Produce reagent kits; and (5) Dispense radiopharmaceuticals that are not regulated by the FDA. C. Additionally, the petitioners requested that the NRC: (1) Permit categories of research using radioactive drugs that do not require an IND, such as research approved by a Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC); (2) Permit the use of radiolabeled biologics for which the FDA has issued a license in response to a product license application (PLA); and (3) Clarify its regulations pertaining to specific licenses of broad scope. Earlier NRC Efforts In response to the Federal Register notice that announced the receipt of the petition, 466 comment letters were received. About 99 percent of the commenters supported and agreed with the petition. After consideration of the public comment letters and consultation with the FDA staff, the Commission determined that some issues should be addressed promptly. On August 23, 1990 (55 FR 34513), the Commission published an Interim Final Rule to allow, for a period of 3 years, the use of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for indications not listed in the package insert and to allow departures from the manufacturer's instructions for preparing diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals using radionuclide generators and reagent kits. On July 22, 1993, the Commission extended the expiration date of the Interim Final Rule from August 23, 1993, to December 31, 1994. The action allows licensees to continue to use byproduct material under the provisions of the Interim Final Rule until the Commission completes this final rule. In a parallel effort, the NRC continued to work on the remaining issues in the ACNP&hyph;SNM petition. On August 7, 1991, the NRC conducted a public workshop in Rosemont, Illinois, to present ``strawman'' language on the training and experience criteria for authorized nuclear pharmacists to representatives of the following organizations: Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties, American Board of Science in Nuclear Medicine, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, Committee on Radionuclides and Radiopharmaceuticals of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, American Pharmaceutical Association, American Society of Hospital Pharmacists, and three graduate schools of pharmacy. Subsequently, the NRC also discussed the proposed resolution of these issues in meetings with the FDA, the NRC's Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes (ACMUI), and the Agreement States. This rulemaking is the evolutionary result of numerous meetings with the aforementioned groups. NRC's Policy In a policy statement published on February 9, 1979 (44 FR 8242), entitled ``Regulation of the Medical Uses of Radioisotopes; Statement of General Policy,'' the NRC stated: 1. The NRC will continue to regulate the medical uses of radioisotopes as necessary to provide for the radiation safety of workers and the general public.
