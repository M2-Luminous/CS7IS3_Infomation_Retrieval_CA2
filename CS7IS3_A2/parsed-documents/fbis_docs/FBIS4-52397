FBIS4-52397 "dreas090__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-090-A Daily Report 7 May 1994 ANNEX Japan ODA `New Frontier' Targets Southern Africa ODA `New Frontier' Targets Southern Africa OW0905085394 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 May 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0905085394 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The government decided on 6 May to give top priority to providing official development assistance (ODA) to southern African nations, including Botswana, Mozambique, and the Republic of South Africa [RSA], in which an administration led by black citizens will be established. This policy, called the "New Frontier Program," aims to provide comprehensive assistance to southern African nations, which are attracting much global interest, so as to improve the economic situation of the whole region on the occasion of RSA's achieving the historical change from white domination to multiracial coexistence. Japan especially aims to stress the expanded range of its international contribution, which tends to be regarded as "Asian-oriented." Providing ODA to the RSA has been allowed since 1990 only for the purpose of helping black citizens to become self-reliant. However, by the end of 1992, Japan had only provided about 100 million yen in small-scale grants and technical cooperation. Following the new administration's inauguration, it is expected that larger assistance will be needed in the future. Therefore, Japan wants to positively extend cooperation in the form of loans and other aid on the premise that the OECD's Development Assistance Committee will designate RSA as a qualified recipient of assistance. With regard to Mozambique, Japan has already decided to provide it with full-fledged ODA in the form of bilateral assistance, while also participating in UN Peacekeeping Operations. Japan is now studying details of the plan. Moreover, in light of the establishment of the new administration in the RSA, Japan will expand its assistance program to cover Botswana, where the Southern African Development Community's secretariat is located, so that Japan can carry out comprehensive assistance. Japan provided Mozambique with about $200 million in bilateral assistance from 1988 to 1992, and Botswana with about $5 million from 1987 to 1992.
