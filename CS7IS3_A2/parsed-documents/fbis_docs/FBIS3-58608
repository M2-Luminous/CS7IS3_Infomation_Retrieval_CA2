France has given its agreement to this decision which aims to restore the right conditions for lasting economic growth by enabling the resumption of international funding. This decision will consolidate the recovery efforts in which many countries in the franc zone are already involved. France, which is in the front rank of the international financial community, will not fail to show its solidarity with its partners. To this end, it will closely follow and participate in the implementation of the necessary accompaying measures, particularly those intended to support the most underprivileged populations. France will step up its effort to promote economic and social development. New measures to cancel and reduce the debt have also been decided in continuation of the action taken in this sphere by President Francois Mitterrand. These different measures bear witness to France's resolute and tangible support for the franc zone and to the preferential ties it maintains with its partners."
