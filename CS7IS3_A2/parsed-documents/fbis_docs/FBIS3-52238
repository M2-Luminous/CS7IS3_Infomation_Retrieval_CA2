"The recognition reflects allegiance by the Christian spiritual leadership to zionist hegemony," the front said in a statement received by AFP. "It also reflects the zionist movement's success in Judaizing the western church and exploiting its leadership to achieve zionist objectives," it said. Israeli and Vatican officials said the agreement, which was signed in Jerusalem on Thursday, avoided the status of East Jerusalem which has yet to be determined in Israeli-PLO negotiations.
