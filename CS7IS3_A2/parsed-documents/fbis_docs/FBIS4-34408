When speaking of the results of the summit, Fujimori said that "the most important thing is that concrete measures were adopted and this represents considerable progress toward regional integration." "This time the rhetoric was left aside and it was obvious that each country was making an effort to form a Latin American trade bloc to counterbalance the other blocs that exist in the world," Fujimori said. The Peruvian president said that the economic section of the final document issued in Cartagena contains several proposals "which were planned based on the experience and modernization process of the Peruvian economy." As for the political content of the declaration of the Ibero-American chiefs of state and governments, Fujimori said that the document "insists on the need for the democratic system to work efficiently." He also mentioned that "it has been agreed that it is necessary to combat all kinds of corruption which, just like terrorism, is one of the scourges that hinders development and the efficiency of democracy." Fujimori expressed satisfaction over the result of his meetings in Cartagena with Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. He and Duran-Ballen discussed several plans that would integrate the two countries, such as highways and agricultural projects, while he and Sanchez de Lozada spoke about giving Bolivia an outlet to the sea through the southern Peruvian coast.
