Mr. Bogoev sees two possible ways to resolve the scandal. One way is to invoke the effective legislation and above all the Constitution. To this end, at least one-quarter of the total number of MP's should move to impeach the president. To be carried, such a motion requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the national representatives. The Constitutional Court will then be asked to rule whether the head of state had violated the Constitution, the presidential adviser noted. The second way is to resolve the current conflict by the "fade-out method," of which there is a strong probability, Mr. Bogoev said. If the National Assembly Committee on National Security takes up the matter, things will by all means take a fade-out course because the committee does not have the competence of the Constitutional Court and will wait for the scandal to subside. This is convenient because, without a settlement in substance, the matter could always be brought up again, the president's adviser observed. He explained that Dr. Zhelev's decree regulated the internal rules of procedure of the office of the president.
