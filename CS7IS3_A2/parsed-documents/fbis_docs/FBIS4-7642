FBIS4-7642 "dreeu064_i_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serb Attack on Gorazde, Mostar Continues Serb Attack on Gorazde, Mostar Continues Serbs Caution Against More Observers AU0404140294 Paris AFP in English 1329 GMT 4 Apr 94 AU0404140294 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Sarajevo, April 4 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leaders warned the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] on Monday [4 April] against sending more military observers to Gorazde as Sarajevo radio reported "bitter fighting" around the besieged Moslem-held enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Spokesman Rob Annink said the Serbs had advised UNPROFOR to put off the dispatch of a team of UN military observers (UNMO) to Gorazde because of what they described as a Bosnian army offensive carried out from Gorazde both towards Zepa to the north and towards Sarajevo, further west. Sarajevo radio said fighting was continuing around Gorazde for the seventh straight day. Since besieging Serb forces launched shelling attacks on the enclave last Tuesday, according to the Bosnian authorities, 47 civilians have been killed with 207 others wounded. The radio said around 30 troop transporters had arrived bringing reinforcements to the Serb side. Sarajevo has called on the international community to take action to protect the enclave, designated by the United Nations last year as a "safe area." Only four UNMO members are currently stationed in the enclave, so that UNPROFOR is able to obtain only limited information about the situation there. Annink moreover said a convoy of three light armoured vehicles, three tanks, three trucks and three mortars had been seen crossing the military exclusion zone, travelling towards Gorazde, in clear violation of the February ceasefire accord between Bosnians and Serb separatists. The Serb authorities in Pale, the separatist stronghold, have refused to allow a convoy of aid provided by the UH High Commissioner for Refugees to make its way to Gorazde, giving no reason, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said. Meanwhile the situation in Prijedor in western Bosnia, where last week 18 Moslems and two Croats were murdered by local Serbs, was calm Monday as Red Cross spokeswoman Vanya Kewley said talks were beginning at Pale to organise the evacuation of up to 6,000 people from the region. Janowski, citing a UNHCR official in Prijedor, said there were no Serb police patrolling the streets of the town. The police chief in the town, Bogdan Delic, had asked Moslems to stay, offering them security guarantees. However this had not been enough to reassure the Moslem population, Janowksi said. Kewley said Andreas Kuhn, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation in Zagreb, was to meet the Bosnian Serb authorities to work out details of the operation, which would be the largest organised movement of civilians since the fighting began in April 1992. The operation to be carried out by ICRC and UN personnel is to begin on Tuesday. Bosnian authorities have given their assent to the operation after the killing of the 20 non-Serbs heightened the insecurity of Moslems and Croats remaining in the area around Banja Luka, a Serb-controlled territory. UN and ICRC officials have denied that this is tantamount to aiding the Serbs in their campaign of ethnic cleansing.
