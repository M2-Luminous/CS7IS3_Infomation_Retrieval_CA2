In view of the endorsement, the publication of the newspaper has been suspended for 15 days. Meanwhile, the endorsement also confirmed the sentences that were passed on Chief Editor Seyh Davut Karadag and OZGUR GUNDEM's former proprietor Yasar Kaya. Kaya was fined 124 million Turkish lira. Seyh Davut Karadag will be sent to prison for five months and pay 62 million Turkish lira as a fine. The Second State Security Court in Istanbul decided to suspend OZGUR GUNDEM's publication for 15 days for publishing an interview with Kurdish Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan entitled "The Turkish Left Wing and Unity" and an article by Abdulkadir Konuk entitled "Solidarity Platform" on 2 and 3 May 1993. The Second Court of Appeals endorsed the State Security Court's sentences against Yasar Kaya and Seyh Davut Karadag, which were in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of the Antiterrorism Law in Turkey. The newspaper's officials were informed of the court's decision yesterday. The publication of a daily newspaper will be suspended in accordance with the Antiterrorism Law for the first time in the country. OZGUR GUNDEM's publication will be suspended until 30 April starting today. The Istanbul branch of the Contemporary Journalists' Association has criticized the decision to suspend OZGUR GUNDEM's publication. Arguing that OZGUR GUNDEM has been silenced after the newspapers FREE FUTURE and BANNER OF TOIL were closed down in the past, it described the suspension of the newspaper for publishing many reports that were also carried by other media as a double-standard policy. Saying that opinions cannot be removed by the use of force, the branch called for the lifting of restrictions on the press.
