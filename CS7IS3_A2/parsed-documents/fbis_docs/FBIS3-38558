As Dasa announced in Munich today, the Mitsui and Co. Ltd. corporation in Tokyo is to safeguard the space interests of the largest German enterprises specializing in aerospace and defense technology in Japan. The already signed agreement represents an expansion of the treaty concluded in 1981 between the Dasa enterprise Erno Raumfahrttechnik GmbH (Bremen) and the Japanese trading company on noncommercial aerospace projects. Under the leadership of Dasa, a reusable space capsule procured by the German Aerospace Agency (Dara) from Russia is being equipped with German-Japanese pay loads and components under the project name "Express." The capsule is scheduled to be launched in the autumn of 1994 from the Kagoshima space center on board a Japanese carrier rocket. This project is being promoted by the German Research Ministry and the Japanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry.
