A KAZTAG correspondent interviewed Bakhyt Ospanov, chairman of the state republican committee for land and land tenure. [passage omitted] The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic has approved the average assessed value on the right to use or lease land. In Almaty, for example, one square meter is estimated at 50 tenge, in Karaganda -- 13.4, in settlements -- 1.3, in farms -- 0.7 tenge per square meter. In Almaty Oblast the estimated value of one square meter of land comprises half of its cost in the capital. The territorial branches (regional and city committees) of the state committee for land and land tenure are allowed to increase or lower (maximum by a factor of two) the estimated value on the right to use or lease land depending on the infrastructure. The committee is also invested with the power of specifying and (?changing) if need be the estimated value depending on the data on a quarterly index of prices, provided by the state committee for state statistics. The president's first decree establishes that citizens which fall under clause 16 of the law "On Citizenship in the Republic of Kazakhstan" have the right to obtain an allotment for lifelong inherited possession irrespective of the duration of their residence on the territory of Kazakhstan. [Correspondent] Are you talking here about those Kazakhstanis who have special merits before the Republic and those people who have been forced to leave the Republic for political reasons as well as their descendants, who decided to come back to their historic motherland for permanent residence? [Ospanov] Yes, the president considered it necessary to lift the earlier temporary ban and give the right to those citizens of Kazakhstan who have spent not less than five years in the republic to acquire an allotment for lifelong inherited possession. There are 3.2 million landowners with the right to a lifelong inherited possession in the Republic, including 16,000 farms. [passage omitted].
