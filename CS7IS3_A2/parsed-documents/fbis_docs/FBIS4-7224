Contrary to common belief and reports, Son Sen, who was relieved of his duties in May 1992 after losing a high-level dispute over whether the Khmer Rouge should pull out of the UN-organized peace plan, is very much in control within the Khmer Rouge. According to senior government intelligence sources, Son Sen is in control of the Khmer Rouge rank and file and its political platform. He is also said to be directing the military effort against the currently victorious Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF). The source said that Son Sen is now directing the counter-attacks against the RCAF forces at Pailin from a stronghold at Phum Malai mountains, one of the last remaining Khmer Rouge military bastions. He is also reportedly responsible for the Khmer Rouge's successful counter-attack at Anlung Veng. They said that the fact that Khmer Rouge leaders like Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan and commanders like Ta Mok were reportedly no longer in the country but have sought sanctuary in a neighbouring country, has fuelled claims that the Khmer Rouge leadership is now in quiet disarray with the military losses, especially that of Pailin. Meanwhile, Pailin has reportedly come under heavy shelling in recent days and the Khmer Rouge were said to be operating in groups of not more than eight members who were involved in hit-and-run tactics as well as harassment of RCAF personnel and commanders. Military sources said that the capture of Phnum Malai from the Khmer Rouge was the best way of ensuring peace, Pailin and Battambang as it will relieve Khmer Rouge pressure from these two areas.
