FR940428-1-00050 FR940428-1-00009 §222.51 Grazing fees in the West. (a) A grazing fee shall be established annually under paragraph (b) of this section for livestock grazing on National Forest Systems lands in the Western States. (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (i) of this section, the annual fee for livestock grazing under paragraph (a) above is determined by a base value of $3.96 which is multiplied by the forage value index (FVI) or grazing fee = base value × FVI. The FVI is the change in private grazing land lease rate (PGLLR) of the 17 Western States weighted average AUM price in each state. The PGLLR estimate is prepared annually by USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service. (c) The base value shall be $3.96. (d) The base year used for computing the FVI shall be 1996. (e) The grazing fee shall be phased in over a three-year period, computed as follows: (1) The fee for 1995 will be ($2.75). (2) The fee for 1996 will be ($3.50). (f) Starting with the year 1997 and, thereafter, the annual fee shall be computed, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, using $3.96 times the FVI. (g) Any annual increase or decrease in the grazing fee occurring in the year after 1997, and thereafter, shall be limited to not more than 25 percent from the fee charged the previous year. (h) Starting with the year 1996, permittees will be eligible for an incentive-based grazing fee that would reduce fees by 30 percent of the value specified in paragraph (c) of this section based on a demonstrated compliance with certain qualification criteria. The incentive-based grazing fee for 1996 = $3.96 × 0.70. The incentive-based grazing fee for 1997 and thereafter = $3.96 × FVI × 0.70. (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the base value in 1997 and, thereafter, will be $3.50 until such time as qualification criteria for the incentive-based grazing fee are established. (j) Qualification criteria. [Reserved] §222.52 National Grasslands fee adjustments for conservation practices. Grazing fees for National Grasslands may be credited up to 50 percent for conservation practices and administrative costs as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. (a) Credit for Conservation Practices. In order to receive credit, requirements for permittee construction or development of conservation practices must be incorporated into term grazing permits, including grazing agreements, with a provision that credits for such improvements shall be applied toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits are allowed only for the following conservation practices: (1) Where the Forest Service requires the permittee to construct or develop the conservation practices to meet management direction contained in relevant forest land and resource management plans, related projects decisions, and the term grazing permit or grazing agreement. (2) Where the conservation practices are necessary to achieve or maintain desired vegetation conditions for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed and wetland values, wildlife and fisheries habitat, and other related values.
