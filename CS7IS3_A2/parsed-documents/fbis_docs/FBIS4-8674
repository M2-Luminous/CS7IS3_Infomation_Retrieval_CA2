It is also obvious that the coalition had known from the very beginning that its initiative will cause precisely these kinds of consequences since Walesa announced a long time ago that he will respond to attempts to limit his powers by dissolving parliament. So why did the coalition decide to take the step? There is no simple answer to the question and that is mainly because for the first time, the coalition took a joint position and that is enough to cause major amazement. Ever since it was established, the coalition had to deal with various degrees of disputes and for the last three months, it has been in a state of permanent crisis. So what could the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] gain by striking at the Belvedere together? In SLD's case, the issue is simple. It has become obvious for the winner in the 19 September elections, that Poland is just not big enough for SLD aspiring to be the first player, and Walesa who is getting ready to be reelected. All of the SLD's political measures were directly or indirectly torpedoed by the Belvedere. Such was the case with the introduction of deputy ministers into presidential ministries (recently, the Belvedere has made a particularly malicious mockery of the SLD's candidate to the Defense Ministry); it was the same case with pushing through the electoral law to gmina [small administrative units] councils, and also with the neo- popiwek [wage-controlling] legislation. Blocking Dariusz Rosati's nomination was the most spectacular strike by the Belvedere. After that decision, SLD leaders made a decision that they cannot conduct a common game with Walesa, and they decided to give up trying to come up with another candidate. They decided a war with Walesa must take place and that they will wage it under the banner of Rosati, no less. At any rate, for a few months now the SLD leadership has deliberated on what front to wage this war to prevent society from perceiving it as a battle for posts. In the end, the leadership made a decision that a campaign for the entry of a professional into the government will be socially successful. "What are we to do, if the president interferes with our day-to-day ruling of the country?" -- this is the kind of argument which society must like. This kind of war will surely be supported by the SLD's anti-Walesa electorate. What is more, the war will strengthen the electorate which is seriously bitter over the lack of implementation of the election program. At the same time, the SLD is exposing an enemy who is making it impossible to implement the promises soon. The coalition's war with the Belvedere is extremely beneficial to the SLD also for the reason that it throws Pawlak once and for all into the arms of his coalition partner. After all, it is thanks to a joint game with the Belvedere that Pawlak was successful in marginalizing the SLD's political influence. A breaking apart of the Pawlak-Belvedere alliance is -- from the SLD's perspective -- not just a guarantee of the coalition's durability, but also a prospect for dominating the PSL which in the future will be left entirely on its own. There is also a personal element in the fight. It is no accident that it was precisely Kwasniewski (along with Cimoszewicz) who was trying to push through a constitutional amendment during a meeting of the coalition. It is precisely Kwasniewski who is the main victim of the Pawlak-Walesa alliance. By breaking the arrangement apart, Kwasniewski can hope for a reconstruction of his political authority and also for delivering a blow to his main political rivals in the presidential campaign -- Walesa first of all, and second Pawlak, who is condemned to cooperation with the SLD. All this leads to just one thing -- the cards will finally go into the hands of the SLD, which for the last few months has been watching state politics more than shaping them. And if one can defeat Walesa in the war, then the SLD's triumph will be complete. Once Walesa is defeated, it will be easy to push him out of the political scene. But Pawlak himself must be aware of these motives of the SLD leaders. Despite that -- and to the leaders' surprise -- the prime minister agreed to a war being waged against Walesa. Perhaps Pawlak himself got scared of being too dependent on the Belvedere and he came to understand that support for the SLD initiative is a precondition for maintaining the coalition's coherency. But that still does not explain why he spoke so clearly in the SLD's favor. It was not so long ago that he himself explained to PSL Sejm deputies that he wants to avoid situations where he would be a side in an SLD-Walesa dispute. He knows very well that once Walesa turns against him, he will be condemned to cooperation with the SLD which is stronger in parliament than he is. But it is quite possible that Pawlak's consent is not final yet. If it turns out that Walesa regards the attempt to limit his powers not as a dispute but as a war, then Pawlak may distance himself from the plan to amend the Small Constitution. It is no accident that it is a draft coming from Sejm deputies, and not from the coalition. So it is possible that SLD will be finally left alone in its fight with the president. It is also possible that Pawlak felt offended by the rejection of Rosati's candidacy. After all, from a certain point in time, Rosati was not just the SLD's candidate but the entire coalition's. All society could see, was that the prime minister went to the Belvedere with a motion to have Rosati nominated, and Walesa refused. The threat to veto the budget must not have been to Pawlak's liking, either. After all, it was his government that had prepared the budget, and the possibility of vetoing it would be a strike primarily against Pawlak himself. It turned out that Walesa likes to keep people in suspense and to deliver affronts not just to the SLD. It seems that apart from the above, there are just two explanations for Pawlak's decision. The first one -- and the least likely -- is that Pawlak became convinced that in order to win the presidential elections, one must destroy Walesa as soon as possible. And since Walesa is a difficult opponent, one must begin fighting him now. The other explanation is that Pawlak and the SLD have not declared a war yet but they have set an ultimatum. So Pawlak is not delivering a strike at Walesa but he is just putting on a show intended to be a show of force. If Walesa nominates Rosati and if he stops blocking the introduction of coalition deputy ministers into the presidential ministries, then the coalition will reject the Sejm deputies' draft. Then a war will not take place, and all the parties will be able to present their decisions as a victory. Pawlak will prove that he is a real prime minister who does not allow either the SLD or the president to interfere with his prerogatives. The SLD will demonstrate that it is not an opponent that anyone can mistreat. And Walesa will demonstrate that he places responsibility for the country over personal ambitions. But if all it is, is just an ultimatum, then it will have a major flaw from the president's standpoint -- he has no guarantee that the coalition will not take it as a sign of his weakness, and that it will not think of ruling the country without Lech Walesa. So if all Pawlak meant was an ultimatum, he managed to wage a war, anyway.
