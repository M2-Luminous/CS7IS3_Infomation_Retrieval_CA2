But the manmade danger is just one part of the problem. People talk and write much less frequently, more quietly and less clearly about the other part -- the fact that natural sources of ionizing radiation account for approximately 70 percent of the total radiation to which people are exposed. That comparisons between Chernobyl and the radioactive effects of natural radiation sources are not exaggerated is demonstrated by the fact that the collective radiation to which Russia's population is exposed from natural sources is 300 times greater than radiation exposure resulting from the Chernobyl accident. The greatest ``contribution'' is made by radon and products of its decay found in the air inside buildings. According to a preliminary estimate, approximately 1.5 million Russians are exposed to 0.6-1.2 rems per year. That means that the bulk of expected medical effects from radiation among the public does in fact stem from natural sources. The annual death rate from this factor may be as high as 25,000. There is no way that this issue can be viewed either as unexpected or as a recent discovery. In 1970, almost a quarter of a century ago, a major series of studies was completed on the presence of naturally-occurring radionuclides in building materials, resulting in the establishment of appropriate construction standards. True, studies of the radiation level at non-uranium mines and in miners' settlements were conducted irregularly and unsystematically. It was during this period that Kazakhstan discovered a unique miners' settlement -- a ``radon city'' -- where 90 percent of the housing showed dangerous levels of radon. Out of a total of 150 non-uranium mines, more than 100 had dangerous radon levels, and radiation exposure at those enterprises sometimes exceeded levels permissible for uranium mines. It was also discovered that employees of enterprises that refine minerals are also exposed to radiation from natural sources. The radiation level in oil- and gas-producing areas was also far above normal. For example, in Stavropol Kray a study of a drilling pipe warehouse indicated a radiation level there of up to 200 microroentgens per hour. The culprit was accumulation of radium salts inside the pipe. In short, experts have long understood the significance of this problem. Particularly since they had before them examples of successful solutions to the problem in the West, where jobs of this nature have been performed in compliance with national and governmental programs since the mid-1970's. For example, in 1984 the United States allocated $13 million from the federal budget and $600 million from state budgets for research in this area. Our program, which has been repeatedly discussed at every level since 1987, both by the government and by parliament, was clearly born under an unlucky star. Nothing seemed to help, neither the five government directives signed by vice-prime ministers nor support from the Supreme Ecological Council. But the height of misfortune came with the two attempts to bring the program up for discussion, first in the USSR Supreme Soviet and then in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. The first attempt was made in late August 1991, the second in October 1993. One would have to believe that the Radon Program is truly jinxed. It was only recently that a session of the government's commission on the environment and natural resource use approved the program, which will soon be submitted to the government for confirmation. Bearing the past in mind, one should not jump to any conclusions and predict a rosy future for the program. But neither should it be said that it would be all that difficult to implement. In any event, its cost -- R4.0 billion [rubles] in 1992 prices -- is two orders of magnitude lower than the error made in calculating the Russian State Budget. The first part of the Radon Program envisions selective radon safety studies of radiation levels in various regions of Russia and identification of high-risk groups. The problem is that radon levels in buildings are not constant. Therefore long-term measurements must be taken in each building. It would take thousands of years to study all the housing in Russia. Detailed and comprehensive studies are planned only for regions where radon presents a threat. According to preliminary estimates, 40 percent of populated areas could have dangerously high radon levels. A radiation-based, geological and chemical classification of Russia's territory by degree of potential hazard from naturally-occurring radionuclides will make it possible to identify areas with varying degrees of hazard and choose priority areas for accelerated environmental radiation studies. The program's designers envision that by 1995 Russia will have a map showing regions of increased radon hazard and will have developed the formulas and technologies for the manufacture and use of insulating building materials as well as a system of radiation monitoring for use during construction, will have taken steps to reduce radionuclide emissions by coal-burning heat-and-electric-power stations and reduce irradiation of mine workers, and will have obtained data on lung cancer rates among the populations of areas with increased radon hazard levels (according to UN data approximately 20 percent of all lung cancer is caused by the effects of radon and products of its decay). This is precisely what places like Vyborg, Krasnokamensk and Pyatigorsk need to end this quiet, invisible but equally terrible natural Chernobyl.
