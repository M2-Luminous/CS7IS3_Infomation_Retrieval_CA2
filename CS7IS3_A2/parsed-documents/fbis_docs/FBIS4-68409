The further regulation of interethnic relations and a comprehensive study of the problems and the shaping of a precise nationality policy in this sphere are, as a whole, a most essential factor conditioning the durability of the statehood of democratic Azerbaijan, national unity, and the civic solidarity of the peoples, national minorities, and ethnic groups that reside on its territory. The course of the workshop, in which scientists, specialists, social anthropologists, and political scientists representing all the national formations that reside in Azerbaijan took part, showed convincingly once again that all peoples, regardless of their size and religious or national affiliation, are equally responsible for the fate of the fatherland--the Azerbaijan Republic--the liberation of our land from the Armenian aggressors, and the country's membership of the ranks of civilized states and sincerely approve the single-minded activity that you, esteemed president, are pursuing in this direction. All these problems were the subject of wide-ranging discussion at the workshop. Well-known political scientists, sociologists, theologians, and representatives of individual parties and cultural centers operating in the republic took part in the speeches and the debates, and extraordinarily interesting and topical proposals connected with the present state of interethnic relations, the role of this factor in the process of the building of a democratic, secular state, the establishment of ties to compatriots living overseas, the reasons for national conflicts and their solution by civilized methods based on the rules of international law, the establishment of stability in the country, and so forth were advanced. We believe that these proposals will be taken into consideration in the realization of the nationality policy of the Azerbaijani state and that efficient use will continue to be made of the research potential of our scholars working in the sphere of national relations. Azerbaijan is a unitary state, and we call on all citizens of Azerbaijan, regardless of religious, linguistic, national, or political affiliation, for close cohesion around this idea. We assure you that the scientific community of the republic at large condemns provocative actions sowing discord between the peoples and thereby adding fuel to the fire of the enemy, will fight such phenomena and mobilize all efforts for the establishment of stability in Azerbaijan and an end to the attempts to embroil the peoples, and will make a substantial contribution to the building of a society of national solidarity and free brotherhood. Esteemed President! It was with a feeling of profound emotion and gratitude that we received your 12 April 1994 appeal on television and radio to our people and the world. The present social and political situation in Azerbaijan, the internal and external political atmosphere, and the historical realities that we have encountered were studied and explained to the world in this historic appeal with profound political expertise and wise responsibility. We wholly support your consistent and intensive activity and the policy you are pursuing in the name of the defense and preservation of the state independence and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and call on the whole Azerbaijani people to render you the utmost assistance in this sacred cause and to rally beneath the banner raised against Armenian fascism. Our salvation lies in unity! Baku, 19 April 1994
