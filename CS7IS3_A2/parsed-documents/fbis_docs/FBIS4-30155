Earlier today, President Ramos commissioned VRP [Vessel of the Republic of the Philippines] Dagupan City, another logistics support vessel donated by the United States, and four fast patrol crafts bought from South Korea. The commissioning coincided with the celebration of the 96th anniversary of the Navy. The president said that the time has come to replace the old vessels which date to World War II.

But as admirable as our efforts are to extend the life of even the old ships of the fleet, we can only go so far. We cannot escape the fact that we really need to upgrade our ships through new acquisitions and this I assure you we are trying our best to accomplish. [end of recording]
