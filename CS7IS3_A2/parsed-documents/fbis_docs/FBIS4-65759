The KPLA Press Office confirmed the air attack, and said there were no casualties in the camp. However, the Turkish General Staff Press and Public Relations Office stated that the air operation took place from 1200 to 1220. It said that 19 aircraft took part in the attack on Zalakh camp and that the aircraft returned to their bases after destroying their targets. The Zalakh camp was bombed for the first time on 28 January, after the government's move to devalue the Turkish lira. A statement made at the time said all of the targets were destroyed.
