They have been used to create planetary models in the form of harmonic coefficients of geopotential and in the form of a system of point masses. The harmonic coefficients of the GPZ-90 model (i.e., Earth's Gravitational Field for 1990) were determined with long-range radio, laser, and doppler measurements from ground stations; radio-altimeter measurements by Geo-IK; and measurement information from the ground complex for controlling the GLONASS navigation system; and average gravity anomalies for a 5� x 5� frame. The result was the GPZ.200 model, which enables determination of geoidal rise to with an rms error of about 1.5 m. References 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.
