'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, the association's head in Cairo, told reporters that national bar association chief Ahmad al-Khawajah was informed of the medical report's contents by the state prosecutor. Muhammad said the report into the death of Islamic lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani mentioned "17 injury marks on various parts of the victim's body," without giving more details. The lawyers' association launched a protest campaign after Madani's death in police custody on April 17, charging that he died under torture. The interior ministry said an asthma attack was to blame. According to the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights a total of 37 lawyers were arrested during the campaign, which included a rally brutally stopped by police on May 17. Some 28 out of the 37 have been freed up to now, the group said. A group of 33 lawyers decided last week to go on hunger strike demanding the release of the lawyers and the publication of the findings into Madani's death. Muhammad said 27 of the hunger strikers had now ended their protest deeming that the authorities had "met their demands." But some of their colleagues had accused them of giving in.
