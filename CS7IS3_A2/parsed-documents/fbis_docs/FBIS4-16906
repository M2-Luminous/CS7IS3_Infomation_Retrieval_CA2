The Ukrainian minister is currently on an official visit to India. "The major aim of our policy is consolidation of Ukrainian-Russian relations. The immediate elaboration of a comprehensive bilateral treaty on friendship and cooperation as it was agreed by the Commonwealth state and government heads will help this consolidation," he said. "Work on the document has been done since 1993. Unfortunately, there was a delay in finalization of the agreement on reasons not depending on Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and me were instructed by our presidents to boost the document's elaboration. The treaty is expected to reflect new realities in the Ukrainian-Russian relations and outline a way for the solution of the current problems. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk invited Boris Yeltsin to come to Kiev on an official visit to sign the document," said the foreign minister. "Permanent negotiations with Russia enable solution of any problems in bilateral relations. We are satisfied with Yeltsin's readiness to help remove obstacles on the way of development of our friendship and cooperation and his statement saying Russia respects territorial integrity of Ukraine, inviolability of its borders and sovereignty. ``As for the division of the Black Sea Fleet, Kiev and Moscow are progressing step by step to the solution of this problem. A new agreement on the Black Sea Fleet that is being elaborated will focus on separate bases of the Russian and Ukrainian navies,'' said Zlenko. However, this, in his opinion, will not help to eliminate all problems related to the Black Sea Fleet's future. Experts are still to analyze the division parameters. Ukraine is ready to have 15-20 per cent of the ships it received under the Moscow agreement signed in September 1993, said the foreign minister. The rest of the fleet will be passed over to Russia. The new document will give a fresh impetus to the work on remaining problems of the Black Sea Fleet, said Zlenko.
