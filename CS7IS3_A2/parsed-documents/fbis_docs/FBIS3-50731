It was meant to be and that is what we are working for. Changes in agriculture are the most appropriate adaptation, the adaptation most suited to the circumstances in which the country finds itself, but those changes are only now becoming apparent. In this initial article, BOHEMIA takes a look at a number of aspects relating to the formation and operation of the Basic Cooperative Production Units (UBPC), but does not exhaust the subject. In future issues, we shall focus on problems with collection, the important participation of the Youth Labor Army (EJT), and volunteer mobilizations. This look at the UBPC is based on statements, questions, and answers that explain what they are, the purpose for which they are being created, who the fundamental participants are, the task being assigned to science, and the role that will be played by the combined study-work program. The Cuban Ministry of Agriculture is hard at work developing the UBPC because they must bear fruit in the near future and help remedy the shortage of resources. It is a secret to no one that, compared with previous years, the early months of 1993 were marked by a sharp drop in all types of farm production. As a result, various measures are being adopted in order to make the most of the productive reserves of farm workers. Minister of Agriculture Alfredo Jordan is optimistic: "There is one cardinal element that makes us feel confident and it is that our farm workers are highly motivated, satisfied with what they are now doing. The outlook has to be good." In addition to being a realistic measure, turning the land over to those who work it is unquestionably a strong incentive for men in rural areas, but that is not all. According to various experts, when an individual feels that he is the owner of the means of production and thus of the product of his work, he can face the challenge of producing more even though fuel, lubricants, fertilizer, chemical products, and other resources are in short supply. Because what is his is truly his, he will take extra care to see that his crops are weeded, that no land lies fallow, and that he has the right number of plants in his furrows. He will plant and harvest at the right time because, in addition to being responsible, he will be the direct beneficiary of his work. Deputy Minister Oscar Basulto, the Agricultural Ministry's man in La Habana, explains: "We have always said that under socialism, we were all owners, but to tell the truth, that was just talk. We have never had the real owner in the field. With the UBPC, the same man who formerly worked on the farm will stand guard, machete in hand, making sure that no one riding by on a bicycle will snatch a single one of the yucca cuttings that he planted because they no longer belong to the enterprise. Rather, they belong to him and his cooperative. I am sure that millions of ways to save on transportation, fertilizer, and fuel will emerge. The farmer will be much happier to get his shoes muddy!" Another argument wielded by those ordering the changes is the feeling of autonomy they give to producers. It is a feeling growing out of the very creation of the Basic Cooperative Production Units because the regulation gives the cooperative complete freedom to decide how many members will band together, elect or replace the board, and dismiss poor workers without any other organ having any voice in the matter. It establishes work rules, defines how much workers are to be paid in advance, distributes profits, and approves production plans. The new element is that these plans are not designed "from above"; rather, they are drafted by the rank and file in response to the voice of experience of producers, the recommendations of experts in the unit and the enterprise, and paying heed to government agencies that are responsible for meeting the nation's needs. The single production plan is not a "strait jacket," but may be adjusted. However, it does establish production discipline based on the people's consumer needs. In addition, we would like to address the subject of something frequently heard concerning a change in thinking in rural areas. I believe it is premature to use the phrase, particularly when one realizes that it is impossible to remove from the minds of those who for years were involved in administrative centralism their poor use of resources, their failure to make the most of work done in the fields, and other forms of agricultural blight. We must not forget that the current changes are being made using the same men. However, we must also recognize that many persons are beginning to take a serious look at problems in Cuban agriculture motivated by a sincere desire to do something about them. For example, incorporation into the UBCP means that team members once irritated by the lack of management of countless activities will now have an opportunity to participate in the solutions directly. Like every child that is born, these structures must be raised in a healthy manner, far removed from strong and inherently harmful temptations. A few reflections are therefore called for. Taking for granted the need to meet man's needs as a top priority so that he will feel well and therefore produce more, a number of dangers nevertheless lie in wait: excessive gloating, commitments to take on more than one can accomplish, the use of language and tones by the enterprise and the UBPC not likely to achieve understanding, and excessive advance payments that will not force the farm worker to better performances in search of greater final earnings, thus compromising in the end financial resources of the unit that would be better put to other uses. Other viruses harmful to the health of the UBPC might include the failure to adequately estimate the requirements of planting or the use of assigned resources, as well as not being alert to the possible diversion of products for individual gain. A far more harmful element affecting the collection process would be a lack of punctuality in picking up products or discouragingly low prices like those still paid for certain products. Problems spotted in time have solutions. We desperately hope that this new idea succeed because our kitchens depend on it. [Box, p 32] Basic Questions 1--What are they? The UBPC are a new form of organization of farm work. They emerged from a process of gradual adjustments being made on farms, ranches, and state-owned enterprises aimed at achieving a closer connection between man and the specific area where he works. The experience of outstanding CPA's [Agricultural-Livestock Cooperative] was also taken into account. 2--Where are they being set up? Wherever farm work exhibits suitable conditions in terms of crop features, land, and infrastructure to be transferred to the unit's jurisdiction. Land areas must not be too large or too small to operate efficiently. 3--How are they being set up? On a voluntary basis, meaning that anyone, whether it be a farm worker, crew member, housewife, or worker from some other branch of activity may join a UBPC. The cooperative community decides who will belong to the unit and chooses its president from among the members. Although there is no surplus labor force, the new units are to reduce their staffs as a way to achieve efficiency and profitability. 4--What is their goal? To increase food production. This task goes hand-in-hand with a series of measures aimed at ensuring the stability of the labor force and reversing the exodus from rural areas to our cities. 5--Who will benefit from these changes? Cooperative workers receive the land and housing for their use free of charge. In exchange for their efforts, they are guaranteed of products for themselves and their families and, in addition to receiving advance payment periodically for their work, they participate in the final distribution of profits. Those achieving the best results will benefit the most. All of this will result in increased productivity and in the end, the prime beneficiary will be the recipient of this farm production: the people.
