[passage omitted] Meanwhile, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez has said that Robaina will make an unofficial visit to Paraguay in the next few days. Ramirez added that Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will not be able to receive Robaina because he is traveling in Europe, and that he himself, Ramirez, will not be able to receive Robaina either, because he is leaving today for Morocco to participate in the signing of the agreement on the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Diplomatic relations between Havana and Asuncion do not exist at the present time, but Robaina's presence in Paraguay is considered the first reflection of the intention toward rapprochement between Paraguay and Cuba.
