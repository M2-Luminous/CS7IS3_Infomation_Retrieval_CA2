FR941205-2-00170 FR941205-2-00074 Priority 2_Training Rehabilitation and Mental Health Personnel to Provide Improved Rehabilitation Services to Individuals With Mental Illness Background High turnover rates and inadequate academic preparation of service staff are continuing problems among programs providing rehabilitation services to individuals with severe mental illness (Pratt and Gill, ``Developing Interagency In-Service Training,'' Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal, Vol. 16, No. 1, July, 1992). Ongoing research has documented the need for competency-based training to promote the recruitment, career development, and retention of personnel who provide support and rehabilitation services to persons with mental illness (``A Comprehensive Study of Human Resource Development Issues_Present and Future_for Personnel Providing Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services,'' Project No. H133G10072, awarded July 1, 1991, by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research to the International Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services). Provision of rehabilitation services to persons with severe mental illness is complicated by the need for staff to interact frequently with professionals in other agencies and disciplines. Cross-training of counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, evaluators, and other professionals is essential to effective interagency cooperation. Rehabilitation and related staff must be knowledgeable about key legislation such as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Social Security Act. Increasingly, rehabilitation services involve persons with severe mental illness making their own choices and family members having a role in rehabilitation programs. Staff require training to be effective in consumer-directed rehabilitation. The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months. Priority Projects must_ •Develop training to improve the skills and knowledge of existing personnel in providing mental health and vocational rehabilitation services to persons with severe mental illness; •Disseminate training materials on organizational coordination, resources, and organizational linkages, including findings from RSA-supported demonstration projects, that will enhance employment outcomes of individuals with mental illness served by the programs of vocational rehabilitation, supported employment, and independent living; •Improve the skills of rehabilitation counselors, administrators, and related professionals, such as psychologists, evaluators, and psychiatrists, in working with persons with mental illness disabilities in the development and implementation of Individualized Written Rehabilitation Programs and vocational placements; •Develop instructional techniques for working with consumers and family members on problem-solving and decisionmaking skills that will enhance employment outcomes; •Include information in curriculum materials on provisions of Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act that are related to work incentives for individuals with disabilities and on employment-related provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act; •Provide training through special seminars, institutes, workshops, and other short-term courses in technical matters relating to the delivery of rehabilitation services to individuals with severe mental illness; •Provide training for three or more States; and •Demonstrate potential for replication based on project outcomes through the dissemination of training materials and protocols. Priority 3_Training Members of American Indian Tribes, State Vocational Rehabilitation Agency Staff, and Rehabilitation Educators on Services for American Indians With Disabilities Background The Act has a number of provisions that relate to the needs of American Indians with disabilities. Under section 101(a)(20), States are required, as appropriate, to actively consult in the development of the State plan for vocational services with American Indian tribes and tribal organizations and Native Hawaiian organizations.
