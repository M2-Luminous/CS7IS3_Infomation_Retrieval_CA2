Among the most important results of this session was the creation of a local committee at the regional level for coordination and follow up in the sphere of economic development. [Begin recording] [Ra'uf Sa'id, member of Egyptian delegation] Among the most important results achieved in this meetings was that a decision was made for the first time on giving a principal role to the countries of the region, to the countries of the Middle East itself, to decide among themselves and by themselves the priorities which concern them on cooperation in the region, the ways for coordinating between these activities which take place in these spheres, and at the same ensuring the complete support of the international community. Among the important results which have also been achieved is that there are important projects which would come closer to the implementation phases, i.e., transport projects in the Middle East, be it by road, railway, sea, or air.

[Begin recording] [Samir Halili, member of Palestinian delegation] All sides were determined to make this meeting successful, and determination for the existence and continuation of the international support for the Middle East peace process, and for the regional cooperation process. Everyone had the intention and determination to find a mechanism to support the multilateral talks and make it a vital and practical feature as soon as possible. Morocco has had for a long time a principal role in the mediation and contacting between Israel, on the one hand, and the other Arab parties, on the other, especially Morocco's principal role in the issue of the Jerusalem committee, and also Morocco's principal role at the Arab Maghreb level. In my view, the holding of the economic talks for the first time in the Arab World here in Morocco has great significance. According to what we have heard and according to our assessment, there would be a greater role for Morocco in the next phase in forming the peace process in the region, and in forming regional cooperation in the region.
