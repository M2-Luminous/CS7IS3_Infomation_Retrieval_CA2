This would, in short, be the description of the tragic events in Gorazde yesterday and this morning," correspondent Enes Musovic reports from this town. "The chetniks are charging on all defense lines around Gorazde increasingly more intensively and (?frantically). The UN Security Council resolution by which Gorazde was proclaimed a safe haven is truly tragicomic." Instead of pity and "moral support of the international community," as Musovic continues, "Gorazde needs immediate and concrete help now to stop the chetniks in their onslaught on Gorazde." He says that "the latest reports suggest that 21 people have died while 62 civilians have been injured in Gorazde in the last 24 hours alone. Last night and this morning, the situation has been extremely difficult in (?Zabina), which is being pounded by the chetniks from Cajnice from all available arms." Hamiz Deronjic, correspondent from "the Brcko free territory," reports that "fierce offensive of Karadzic's Serbs on the free Brcko territory continues. Ferocious tank-infantry attacks, supported by all types of artillery arms, at the positions of the 108th Motorized Brigade and 108th Infantry Brigade have lasted until late last night. The biggest battles were fought on Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca-[place-name indistinct] line." He reports that the fighters of the 108th Motorized Brigade at 1830 last night destroyed another aggressor's T-34 tank with its crew in the region of Omerbegovaca." As he says, "parallel to the attacks on the first defense lines, the artillery of the Serbian aggressor has been shelling the civilian targets on the free Brcko territory. Despite the fact that he is suffering enormous losses in manpower and military hardware, the enemy is intensifying the offensive against the free territory." Deronjic also reports the arrival of fresh Serbian forces and military hardware and their concentration along the front lines. "Fierce attacks of the Chetnik infantry, tanks, and artillery in the area of (?Boderiste) have been underway since 0700," Deronjic says, "and at the moment of sending this dispatch the attacks of the chetnik forces are spreading to the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line." As Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac, "through private radio Velkaton, the members of Abdic's war headquarters have announced another offensive against the free territory of the Bihac district, which they have been [words indistinct] carrying our together with the chetniks and [words indistinct] of the Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina."
