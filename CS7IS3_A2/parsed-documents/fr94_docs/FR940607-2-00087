FR940607-2-00087 FR940607-2-00061 Rule 24, Section 19 (redesignated as Section 18) requires a party requesting an adjournment to deposit a fee, not to exceed $1,000, upon making the request. If granted, the arbitrators may waive the deposit or, in their award, return the deposit. 10 10 Section 18(b) is proposed to be amended to state that a party requesting an adjournment after arbitrators have been appointed shall, if an adjournment is granted, deposit a fee, equal to the initial deposit of forum fees for the first adjournment and twice the initial deposit of forum fees, not to exceed $1,000, for a second or subsequent adjournment requested by that party. The arbitrators may waive the deposit of this fee or in their awards may direct the return of the adjournment fee. Rule 24, Section 24 (redesignated as Section 22) clarifies that arbitrators are empowered to take appropriate action, which can include the assessment of fees or costs, preclusion of documents or witnesses, and making disciplinary referrals in order to obtain compliance with all rulings by the arbitrators. 11 11 Proposed Section 22 to Rule 24 provides: ``The arbitrator(s) shall be empowered to interpret and determine the applicability of all provisions under this Rule and to take appropriate action to obtain compliance with any ruling by the arbitrator(s). Such interpretations and actions to obtain compliance shall be final and binding upon the parties.'' Rule 24, Section 28 (redesignated as Section 26) requires parties filing amended pleadings to serve such different pleading on all other parties. This change relieves the Director of Arbitration from the requirement to serve such pleading. 12 12 Amended Rule 24, Section 26 is proposed to state, in part, that the party filing a new or different pleading shall serve on all other parties, a copy of the new or different pleading in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 13(b). The other parties may, within ten business days from the receipt of service, file a response with all other parties and the Director of Arbitration in accordance with Section 13(b). Rule 24, Section 30 (redesignated as Section 28) sets forth the requirement that all monetary awards be paid within 30 days of receipt unless a motion to vacate has been filed with the court. Additionally, the section mandates that interest accrue from the date of the award, until paid, if the award is not paid within 30 days, or the motion to vacate is unsuccessful, or as specified by the arbitrators. Interest shall be assessed at the prevailing legal rate in the state where the award is rendered or at a rate set by the arbitrator(s). This change will encourage the prompt payment of awards. 13 13 Rule 24, Section 28 is proposed to be amended to include Paragraphs (f) and (g). Rule 24, Section 28(f) is proposed to state that the awards shall be made publicly available, provided however, that the name of the customer party to the arbitration will not be publicly available if he or she so requests in writing. Rule 24, Section 32 (redesignated as Section 30) amends the current fee schedule in place at the CHX and conforms its fee schedule to those at the other SROs. The CHX proposes to adopt the following Schedule of Fees: 14 14 With respect to the following schedule, italicizing indicates new material.
