Therefore, the decisions issued by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are regarded as a clear and blatant violation of the Constitution because they were not issued in accordance with the rigorous provisions made by the Constitution of the Yemeni Republic. In a statement issued yesterday, the parliamentary bloc emphasized that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's declaration of the state of emergency is regarded as null and illegal because such a declaration requires the existence of a special law that regulates and explains the declaration of the state of emergency and its circumstances on the basis of Article 94, paragraph 17 and Article 97 of the Constitution. The parliamentary bloc of the YSP condemned the spiteful raids against the YSP's centers and the pursuit and detention of YSP and other political parties and organizations' leaders and members, currently being carried out by state bodies controlled by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his secessionist executive military family. The YSP parliamentary bloc called on the Arab League and all brothers and friends to exert their generous efforts to stop the war immediately and rescue the homeland from destruction to which it is currently exposed. It stated that there is in the YSP initiative a truly correct and appropriate solution to save the homeland and preserve the unity of the territory and its people.
