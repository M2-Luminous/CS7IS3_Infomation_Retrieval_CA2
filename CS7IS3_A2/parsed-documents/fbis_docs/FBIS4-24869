Clinton arrived here Thursday [2 June] to start his week-long visit to Europe, which takes in France and Britain, linked to the commemoration activities for the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Europe during the Second World War. In the talks, the leaders exchanged views on bilateral relations and ways of reducing mass unemployment. They also examined the preparations for the summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to be held in Italy next month. Clinton praised Italy for its support for the operation of the Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Bosnia. Referring to the proposed increase of permanent seats in the U.N. Security Council, Clinton told Berlusconi that the United States supported the efforts by Japan and Germany to seek a permanent seat each in the Council. He also said that he would not rule out the idea of extending membership to more countries. Between the meeting with Scalfaro and talks with Berlusconi, Clinton went to the Vatican and met Pope John Paul. Clinton acknowledged at the news conference that there were "genuine differences" with the pope on abortion and contraception, which the Catholic Church forbids. The main theme of the talks, according to Vatican sources, was the procedure for a U.N. population conference due to be held in Cairo in September. The Vatican fears the conference, which is drawing up a 20-year-plan to stabilize world population, will back abortion and contraception.
