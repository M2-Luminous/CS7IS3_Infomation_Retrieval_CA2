This morning Lamb had a one-hour meeting with President Glavkos Kliridhis. Lamb described the meeting with Kliridhis as a very useful one during which they discussed details related to the current phase of the talks. Asked whether he brings new ideas, Lamb said that the United Nations is working hard to make sure that the interests of both sides are protected. I do not think, he said, that there is a need for new ideas at the present stage. The U.S. special coordinator said that he repeated to President Kliridhis the US conviction that the confidence-building measures are positive and useful and create the opportunity for progress. Replying to other questions, Lamb said that during this current phase the two sides will voice their doubts on how the issues of Famagusta and Nicosia Airport will work out. He described the reservations expressed as logical. He said that the process is difficult but very important. Lamb also stressed that there is a lot of skepticism on both sides as to whether the other side is willing to proceed. However, he added, the leadership of both sides have enough perception to be able to see that these efforts can lead to an acceptable final settlement.
