At his meeting with Lacalle, Kalvoda mainly discussed economy and trade. Lacalle said that Uruguay counted on commercial and political aid by the Czech Republic, Stanislav Hlavacek, Czech Ambassador to Uruguay, told CTK after the meeting. He said that Lacalle had expressed his hope that the signing of a Czech-Uruguayan trade agreement, scheduled for this summer, might contribute to the development of relations between the two countries. The signing of a cultural agreement is also expected, Hlavacek said. Torello informed Kalvoda on principles of the independent Uruguayan justice system introduced after the abolition of the Justice Ministry at the beginning of the 1980s. He said the former ministry was strongly influenced by the executive power, while the present Court of Justice is fully independent of both the president and parliament, Hlavacek said. He said that the discussion between Kalvoda and Ramirez focused on the Uruguayan Constitution. Today Kalvoda and other members of the Czech delegation are to attend the inauguration ceremony of Irena Mayer, honorary consul of the Czech Republic in Maldonado.
