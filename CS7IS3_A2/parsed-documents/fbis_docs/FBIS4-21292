He explained that Federal Judicial Police agents under orders from the force's deputy commissioner, Fernando Asiain Diaz Barriga, have spent several months investigating the possible drug dealing case. At 1400 today, they arrested Jose Luis Acosta Morales, as he was attempting to transport the drug in his pickup truck. He noted that the cocaine was contained in 25 burlap bags, camouflaged in cardboard boxes labeled "Sandals and Playsuits." Acosta Morales was caught while leaving his residence in the Veracruz municipality of Casitas. He was attempting to board his panel type Dodge vehicle with license plates SA 38347, of Puebla, his native state. Gonzalez Baez Cardoso added that the preliminary investigation for crimes against health has already been opened, and that Acosta Morales, with the drugs and the vehicle, have been sent to the state office's facilities located in this city. The police official concluded by indicating that this shipment of 810 kg and 600 grams of cocaine had considerable market value, because each kg is worth between 30,000 and 40,000 new pesos. Since these were drugs in a pure state, 6,000 doses could have been obtained from each kg.
