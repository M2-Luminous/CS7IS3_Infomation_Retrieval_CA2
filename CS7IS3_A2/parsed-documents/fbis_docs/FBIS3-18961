The leaders of a majority of Denmark's 700 largest firms have undergone a striking change in attitude. Not since the "unbelievably" good years in the mid-1980's when Prime Minister Poul Schluter (Conservative) was at the helm have industrial leaders believed as strongly as they do today that they will both employ more workers and increase investments. BERLINGSKE TIDENDE asked Jyske Bank to analyze a survey of the industrial situation that the Danish Bureau of Statistics published yesterday. The results can be seen in two of the graphs below [not reproduced here]. It is less than a year since a large majority of industrial leaders anticipated layoffs and no investments. "The shift is quite striking. It is very, very fine," said economist Jorgen Damgaard of Jyske Bank, who analyzed the survey. Positive View of Own Possibilities "When industrial leaders are asked to give their opinion about the possibilities of the general national development with respect to creating more jobs, they are still negative. But when it comes to their own firms most have finally become positive," Damgaard noted. The 700 industrial leaders, whose firms account for a good 60 percent of the jobs in Danish industry, answer questions from the Danish Bureau of Statistics each quarter. The assessments in the new edition of the survey apply to the first three months of the year. When the answers are corrected for the size of the firm and the traditional annually recurring pessimism here before spring arrives, they show that a majority of 12 percent of the firms anticipate hiring more workers in the first quarter of the year. More Will Invest And an equally strong shift has occurred with respect to investment plans. A majority of 12 percent of the firms are also considering concrete investment plans. If these figures are more or less borne out -- and they usually are -- it is only a question of time before surveys of what has actually happened also document progress. It is also worth noting in relation to industry's situation that inventories are at their lowest point in several years. At the same time export orders have now risen to such an extent that they are back to normal. Marked Change in Attitude If the new indications from industrial leaders are viewed in light of the fact that private consumers are also optimistic now -- as shown by a poll conducted by the Danish Bureau of Statistics at the beginning of January -- there has been a real change in people's attitudes. According to the poll, people think Denmark's economic situation is already better than it was a year ago, and they also believe that things will be even better a year from now. A good 12-percent majority of those questioned also believe that the family's economic situation will improve within the next year. Less Anxiety About Unemployment At the same time, people's anxiety that unemployment will rise further is receding very quickly. All in all the so-called consumer confidence index has risen from minus three to plus three in a single month. Economy Minister Marianne Jelved (Radical Liberal) said: "People have begun to believe that it is true that there will be an upswing. And then there is a positive spiral. When expectations are positive, people also behave differently. I do not believe we will have total lack of restraint and overheating. However, loan conversions and tax reform have really put more money in people's pockets. The extra available cash that families have has increased in a way that they can really feel. At the same time unemployment has stopped rising."
