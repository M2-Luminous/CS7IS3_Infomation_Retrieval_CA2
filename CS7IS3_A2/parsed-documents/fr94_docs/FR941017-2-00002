FR941017-2-00002 FR941017-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Commodity Credit Corporation Sugar and Crystalline Fructose Marketing Allotments AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice affirms the announcement made on September 29, 1994 by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) that marketing allotments have been established for sugar and crystalline fructose for fiscal year 1995. The overall allotment quantity for sugar is 7,889 thousand short tons (TST). The beet sugar allotment is 4,355.5 TST (55.2 percent), and the cane sugar allotment is 3,533.5 TST (44.8 percent). State cane sugar allotments and individual sugar beet and sugarcane processor allocations are provided in this notice. The marketing allotment for crystalline fructose is 159,757 short tons. DATES: The allotments apply to marketings from October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995, unless subsequently suspended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert D.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Throughout its history the United States has been a net importer of sugar. In order to support the domestic production of sugar beets and sugarcane, Congress has mandated, continuously since 1981, that the CCC provide price support for domestically produced sugar beets and sugarcane. CCC has provided such price support by making nonrecourse loans available, at minimum levels prescribed by Congress, to sugar beet and sugarcane processors in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (the ``1949 Act'') ( See 7 U.S.C. ยง1446g). In order to receive a price-support loan, an eligible processor must agree to pay not less than the minimum price-support levels specified by the CCC to all producers who deliver sugar beets or sugarcane to such processor for processing. During fiscal year 1994, three sugar beet processors declined to participate in the price-support loan program, in part to avoid the minimum grower payment requirements, and two other sugar beet processors defaulted on price-support loans, resulting in 13,950 short tons of sugar pledged as loan collateral being forfeited to the CCC. The national average loan rates for the 1994 crop year (i.e., July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995) have not yet been published but are expected to be the minimum rates allowed by statute. The loan rate for raw cane sugar is expected to remain at 18 cents per pound, and the loan rate for refined beet sugar is expected to increase, under the statutory formula, by up to 40 points from the 23.62 cents per pound loan rate for the 1993 crop year. The increase of the beet sugar loan rate means that market prices will have to increase correspondingly in order to avoid risks of price-support loan defaults and the forfeiture of sugar collateral in fiscal year 1995. Since the minimum grower payments are a function of the loan rate, an increase in the loan rate also increases pro rata the minimum grower payment levels. Without an increase of refined sugar prices, more sugar beet processors may elect not to participate in the price-support program, thereby undermining the purpose of the program to support the prices received by sugar beet growers. Section 902(a) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (the ``1985 Act'') requires that the President ``use all authorities available to the President as is necessary to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to operate the sugar program established under section 206 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 at no cost to the Federal government by preventing the accumulation of sugar acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation.'' Since the price-support levels mandated by Congress generally are substantially above world market prices, import restrictions have been primarily relied upon to maintain the domestic price-support program at no cost to the Federal government. Currently, additional U.S. note 3(a) to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to determine the total amount of sugars, syrups, and molasses that may be entered at the low tier of tariffs under an import tariff-rate quota which effectively limits sugar imports. Prior to enactment of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (the ``1990 Farm Act''), the only mechanism available to the Secretary to regulate the domestic price of sugar was the tariff-rate quota. But the continued use of a restrictive quota had a devastating effect on U.S. cane sugar refiners and the economies of exporting countries. To alleviate these negative effects, the 1990 Farm Act provided the Secretary of Agriculture with authority to establish domestic marketing allotments in order to maintain the price of domestic sugar without reducing imports below the minimum level_1.25 million short tons, raw value_deemed needed to allow refineries to continue efficient operations. On August 6, 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture modified the existing tariff-rate quota period for imports, from the period October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 to the period October 1, 1992 through July 31, 1994, and announced a new quota period from August 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995 and a total quota amount of 1,322,978 metric tons, raw value (1,458,333 short tons). Effectively, this action means a monthly average of quota imports that will total 1.25 million short tons in FY 1995.
