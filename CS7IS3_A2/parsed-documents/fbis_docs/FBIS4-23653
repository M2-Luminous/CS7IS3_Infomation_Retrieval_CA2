FBIS4-23653 "drafr113_c_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 11-12 Jun South African Press Review for 11-12 Jun MB1206152294 MB1206152294 BFN [Editorial Report] WEEKEND STAR Better, Not Distorted, Public Service -- The Minister of Public Service has "tackled the task of revamping the public servce" by targeting "under-represented groups" for "immediate employment," an editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 11-12 June on page 8 notes. However, increasing a service "already viewed as bloated by most people -- with another 1,000 posts" does not make "his reassurances that budgetary will not be exceeded" convincing. His statement that "while the new posts are aimed at under-presented groups, persons from `other groups' are welcome to apply...smacks of reverse discrimination....There is a real danger that the programme, unless carefully handled, will compound inefficiencies and lead to harmful discontent." RAPPORT Affirmative Action Program -- "One of the worst forms of apartheid, race classification, has made its reappearance in an ironic manner, less than two years after the ANC-dominated government came into power. A comprehensive affirmative action system will be applied to the advantage of blacks in both the private and public sectors," begins a page-14 editorial in the Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 12 June. "So-called `monitoring mechanisms,' taking race and gender into account, will be put in place to ensure that the civil service reflects the composition of the population. This means the appointment of `race police' who will also peep over the shoulders of the financial institutions. They will have to ensure, for example, that black businesses and clients receive loans. Businesses who do not tackle `socially acceptable' projects will be forced to do so....The ANC government is impatient. Within six years, for example, the entire civil service must reflect the composition of the population. In certain cases this will happen within two years....This is a recipe for disaster. Equally disconcerting is the ANC's once hidden socialist program, which is suddenly becoming more visible. Its intention to interfere with the operation of financial institutions is a deliberate attempt to manipulate the laws governing the free market....This new type of discrimination is not just a case of two wrongs not making a right, it is clearly playing with fire." SUNDAY TIMES Truth Commission -- "No matter what the Minister of Justice, Mr Dullah Omar, does about his truth commission, the search for the truth about the crimes of appartheid will go on," states an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 12 June on page 20. "The question is not whether the truth must be made known, but how it must be made known, or if it becomes another mechanism (of the many!) to suppress the truth....Most recently, the luckless Defense Minister, Mr Joe Modise, was persuaded by the generals to try, by interdict and press gag, to prevent the publication of information that might cast light on the time of `dirty tricks.'...The first two waves of indemnity, which occurred in secrecy and amid the great confusion," released ordinary criminals and "cast no light on the past." There is a "suspicion" casting "a shadow over the question of reconciliation," whether some National Party or Cabinet members "had complicity" in crimes carried out by "instruments of apartheid repression." Two principles must guide the process of dealing with these suspicions: disclosure of the crime, but not a "Nuremberg trial" or "McCarthy-ite inquisition." "Those who seek indemnity must be assured of forgiveness if they specify their crimes; those who think they can conceal their past must run the risk that they will be exposed, sooner ot later, by the wider search for truth." ILANGA Why not Ulundi -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 9-11 June in a page-6 editorial notes: "The issue of where the capital for KwaZulu/Natal should be seems to be generating a lot of heat under the collar among those who are opposed to Ulundi as a possibility....Our question is, what's so wrong with Ulundi, anyway? Isn't the ANC in the North-West Province working from the offices of the former government of Bophuthatswana? Isn't the ANC in the Eastern Cape Province is working from the offices of the former Ciskei government, with the province's premier, Mr. Raymond Mhlaba, even living in the same house occupied by former President Sebe and later by Brigadier Gqozo? When is the ANC going to stop speaking with a forked tongue?"
