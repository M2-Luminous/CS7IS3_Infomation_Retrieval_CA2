The secret of this success is not just that this newspaper is full of content and variety and sells at half the price--5 tomans--of the rest of Tehran's newspapers. Nor is its success due only to the fact that it has a professional and experienced staff. Sociologists and media experts emphasize two other factors in this regard: One is the fact that it is very appealing as a four-color newspaper with a more attractive and orderly layout in a land where the revolution has eliminated all colors other than black and white. The other factor is that HAMSHAHRI is basically a "nonpolitical" newspaper, in the sense that in reading and looking at it one concludes that it does not insist on showing itself as a staunch defender of the government and the revolution. Informed observers say HAMSHAHRI has chosen all these methods and procedures according to a calculated plan. Whatever the truth may be, it is clear that two newspapers, one of them KEYHAN of Tehran and the other the heavyweight JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, make most of their attacks against HAMSHAHRI, with such things as their criticism of the mayor for spending the "public treasury" to publish a newspaper to make propaganda for himself. Despite all this, no one knows whether this newspaper has revenues and income or whether it really gets help from the municipal government. If the opponents of the mayor and the monthly HAMSHAHRI could do so, they would stop its publication, but it seems that their power has not yet reached the newspaper, even though one of the regime's most powerful clerics, Ayatollah Khaz'ali, has said concerning the mayor that he is one step away from a religious decree that he should be killed.
