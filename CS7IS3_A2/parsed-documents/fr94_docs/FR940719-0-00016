FR940719-0-00016 FR940719-0-00004 Other commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to allow alternative approaches, in lieu of the modification, to address the identified unsafe condition. The commenters state that the cost of the specific proposed modification is an unnecessary burden on operators, and consider that improved maintenance procedures are all that are necessary to ensure safety of the system. For the reasons previously described in this preamble, the FAA does concur with these commenters' specific suggestions for ``alternative approaches.'' At this time, based on all available data to date, the FAA has determined that the modification required by the AD is the only action that will prevent in-flight deployments of the thrust reverser caused by blockage of the DCV vent. No maintenance action or acceptable alternative modification has yet been presented to the FAA that will prevent a deployment caused by this single modification. However, under the provisions of paragraph (c) of the final rule, operators may request approval of the use of alternative methods of compliance, provided that sufficient data is presented to the FAA to justify the request. Numerous commenters request that the economic impact information presented in the preamble to the notice be revised to provide updated costs. These commenters state that the costs indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule were greatly underestimated. The FAA concurs. The estimated modification costs that were presented in the preamble to the proposal were based on information provided by the airplane manufacturer at the time the proposed rule was being developed. The manufacturer has now provided updated costs for the parts and labor necessary to modify affected airplanes, and the economic impact information, below, has been revised accordingly. The economic impact information has also been revised to update the current number of airplanes that will be affected by this AD. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 221 Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, and &hyph;300 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 124 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 128 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $75,356 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $10,217,104, or $82,396 per airplane. The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the modification required by this AD were to be conducted as a ``stand alone'' action. However, the 36-month compliance time specified in paragraph (a) of this AD allows ample time for the modification to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would be redundant and unnecessary. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.
