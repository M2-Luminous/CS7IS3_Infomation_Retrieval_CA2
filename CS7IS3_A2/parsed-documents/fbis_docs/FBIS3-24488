The laser structures were prepared using the method of liquid phase epitaxy on a InAs substrate, oriented in the (100) plane. The narrowband region contained InAs[.sup]0.96[/]Sb[.sub]0.04[/], so that at the temperature of 77K, the width of the prohibited zone was E[.sup]g[/]=0.383 eV, and the reflection index was n[.sup]0[/]=3.54. This type lasers were employed at temperatures from 77 up to 160K for a high resolution molecular spectroscopy. The most important spectroscopic properties of the lasers were obtained from the absorption spectra of methane and ethylene molecules. Figures 5, references 7: 4 Russian, 3 Western.
