After the meeting, Gen. Ortega said various issues had been discussed, including the country's pacification, security for the Nicaraguan people, and the military organization law. Addressing local and international reporters, Gen. Ortega reiterated that he will not step down under pressure from the United States or because of anyone's whim. Gen. Ortega Saavedra said: [Begin Ortega recording] The problem is not whether Humberto Ortega leaves the Army. That is not Nicaragua's problem. The problem is whether I am capable of bequeathing to Nicaragua the Army it has never traditionally had. The problem is that Humberto Ortega will not leave the Army because of what happened on (?2) September, which resulted from pressure from the United States and from whimsy. Neither Humberto Ortega nor anyone else will ever leave this Army within that context. The problem is not whether Humberto Ortega leaves but how he leaves. We are capable of providing the country with a military law that will consolidate this Army as the nation's Army, an Army with a pledge to defend national sovereignty and safeguard the security of all Nicaraguans regardless of their race, religious creed, or political affiliation. To this end, I believe that to insist that the problem is whether or not Humberto Ortega steps down this year would be to view the issue quite superficially. I must state clearly that I will never leave this Army, nor will the Army allow it -- it is a matter of dignity and principles -- under the conditions that were raised on 2 September. I will never retire under such conditions. This not mean that I am trying to enthrone myself or that I want to remain here forever. That is not the case. My departure should not result from pressures; it should be the result of a decision among Nicaraguans regarding what is the most advantageous thing to do within the framework of the law and the framework of dignity; it must not be the result of pressure, let alone pressure from foreigners.
