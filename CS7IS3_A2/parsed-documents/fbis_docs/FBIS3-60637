Statement by the spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry: Recently, unusual moves are appearing in the United States that are creating a grave barrier in resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. At a meeting to announce the result of the so-called U.S.-South Korea summit talks recently, U.S. President Clinton made a violent remark by finding fault with us, saying that if someone attacks us it will have to pay a dear price. Officials in the United States are also inciting us greatly and are making violent remarks running counter to dialogue. It might be that these words and behavior stem from the purpose of having great influence over the South Korean person in authority, but we cannot but deal with this matter in a very prudent way because such words and behavior was made at a time when the issue of holding the three-stage DPRK-U.S. talks was put on the agenda. This can only be viewed as is a violent violation on the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and an act of betrayal on the other side of dialogue. We put forth the package deal method out of the desire to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a fundamental way from an equal and fair basis. Our package deal method is a fair method wholly coinciding with the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. The United States had assessed this positively at one time. If the United States accepts the package deal method which we put forth, all issues related to the nuclear issue will be resolved including the issue of implementing the safeguards accord, and there is no need to take a lot of time here. However, currently, as the ringleader of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the United States is neglecting the responsibility and position that they are entrusted with. Also, it seems that while having no political principle, they are moving toward the policy of pressuring and crushing [apsal] us by even dragging in a perpetrator. Predictions are prevalent within and without the Korean peninsula that a war may break out during the current South Korean person in authority's term of office. This is related to the fact that the South Korean authorities are working in every way to interfere in the smooth resolution of the nuclear issue by driving a wedge in the DPRK-U.S. talks, and that they are also continuously moving toward aggravating the situation. The South Korean authorities are pretending to have some kind of interest in the implementation of the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization. However in reality, they are only abusing this as a damping device to interfere in the DPRK-U.S. talks. For the U.S. authorities to secretly scheme with these kind of fellows shows that they are working to use South Korea as a shock brigade in their policy toward Korea and in carrying out their strategy in Asia by soothing the South Korean authorities who are currently oversensitive and to save their face. When viewing this, we do not know whether the United States truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue, or whether it is pursuing the policy of acting hostile and crushing [apsal] Korea in the same old way. If the United States tries to crush [apsal] us by forcing their unjust demands through pressure toward us, the dialogue counterpart, the consequences arising therefrom will be truly dangerous. If the United States thinks that pressure can work on us, it is a miscalculation. It seems that the United States does not yet know very well about its dialogue counterpart. Our people and the People's Army will never yield to anybody's pressure. When we declared our decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], we were prepared for all possible circumstances, and we are fully prepared to safeguard the sovereignty of the country even if the worst event such as sanctions or war is imposed on us. If the United States truly wants to resolve the nuclear issue, it must sincerely accede to the talks even now rather than resorting to the method of pressure such as sanctions and so on by running off the track of dialogue. The South Korean authorities must realize that interfering in the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks will only achieve ahead of schedule their self-destruction. They must correctly find ways to survive. We want a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue. However, if the United States makes a blank paper out of the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and refuses to hold the talks, there will be no need for us to uncomfortably suspend any longer the effectuation of our withdrawal from the NPT [urinun taehwarultonghan haengmunjeui pyonghwajok haegyolul paragoitta. kurona migugi kkutnae chomigongdongsongmyongui wonchigul paekjihwahago hoedamul kumandugettamyon urido choyak taltoeui hyoryok palsaengul toisang pulpyonhage chongjisikyonoko issul piryoga opkedoelgossida]. Dialogue is not a gift from one side to the other side, and we have no intention to hold dialogue by receiving pressure. The success or failure of the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue wholly lies on whether the United States has the will to give up its policy of crushing [apsal] Korea.
