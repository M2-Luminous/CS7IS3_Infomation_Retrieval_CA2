K. Han and Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] welcomes the U.S. Senate resolution supporting its bid to join the United Nations and other international organizations, the Ministry of Foreign affairs said Wednesday [15 June]. "We are grateful for the U.S. Senate support and hope the U.S. executive branch can implement the resolution," said a ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The resolution, introduced by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and unanimously passed by the Senate by voice vote on June 10, says the U.S. President, acting through the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, should encourage the UN to permit Taiwan to participate fully in the activities of the UN and its specialized agencies. The resolution, printed in the congressional record, also says that cabinet-level exchanges between Taiwan and the United States should take place in the interests of both nations. The Foreign Ministry official said the resolution is not expected to have a strong binding force on the U.S. administration at the moment. "Nevertheless, we still hope more similar calls will mount in the U.S. in the future to support our UN bid and high-level Taipei- Washington exchanges," the official said. "If we can win the support of the U.S. media and public, we believe the U.S. Government will weigh their opinions while dealing with Taiwan-related issues." The preamble of the resolution notes that the U.S. has had a long histroy of friendship with the Republic of China, that Taiwan is now a strong, vibrant economy having the largest foreign exchange reserves of any nation, and that Taiwan respects human rights and routinely holds free and fair elections in a multiparty political system. The preamble further says that Taiwan has much to contribute to the work and funding of the UN, and that it is in the interest of the U.S. and the UN to maintain good relations with a government and an economy as significant as that of Taiwan.
