"A new milestone in the long history of communications has now been reached." And the business director of Telekom, the German Post Office Department's commercial affiliate, exlaimed that "a new age for reckoning time has begun, namely, `before ISDN' and after ISDN.'" The reason for Gellert's glowing words was clear. Network users in 20 European countries celebrated the official introduction of the European Standard for ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) with a communications party. While up to this point the digital networks in Europe had operated on the basis of interim national standards, the bits and bytes now race through the copper wires and light waveguides on the basis of the European Unified Norm (abbreviated E-DSS1). Network operators and the communications industry hope to receive the same effect from the Euro-ISDN that was received from the GSM-Standard--the technical regulatory structure for digital radiotelephony. The simple formula for success lies in the fact that a unified Euro-Standard creates a large sales market for end products, while the high volume of items pushes the prices down, which in turn attracts additional users. As Gellert effusively puts it: "With this development, the old world takes its place at the top of an advanced technology par excellence and can now harvest the economic uses from it." But the Telekom-man will have to be a bit patient. In the short term, Euro-ISDN is highly unlikely to find the same dynamically growing demand for its products as was realized in the mobile radio business. Volker Fink, Telekom's technical director responsible, among other things, for ISDN marketing, states soberly: "It will take a year before the effects of the common Standard will be noticed in the market." Fink's evaluation is totally realistic for the simple reason that all the essential elements in the ISDN picture blend together very slowly. Only the beginnings of a large end product market now exist. To date, digital communications connections have only been properly marketed in Germany, where Telekom has expanded the ISDN network, at least in the former FRG, and has sold more than 300,000 so-called ISDN bases and about 20,000 primary multiplex connections for linking up large communications facilities. The trend is for further strong increases. Fink notes: "The other net operators have yet to trigger a similar development." At any rate, the communications companies are working toward that end. "The European network operators are determined to move the Euro ISDN forward," Eckhard Oberfrank, ISDN specialist in the Dortmund office of the ExperTeam Telecom consulting firm, observes. Still, not all the obstacles have as yet been removed. "One of the bottlenecks," Oberfrank laments, "is the fact that the producers in each European country still need their own country's approval to have their products, like Fax machines and modems, connected to computers." This is not only time-consuming, but it is expensive as well because of the necessary approval fees. The tedious approval procedures have had a definite effect on product price, especially in the case of simple Euro ISDN telephones. As one specialist in the industry notes: "In the case of the telephones, every additional cost added affects the price the consumer must pay." Such adversities do not dampen the enthusiasm of the Euro ISDN champions however. "The Standard has triggered an avalanche that continues to gain momentum," Martin Storp, marketing director at Philips Communications Industry AG in Nuremberg, is pleased to report. He believes that the producers of equipment for digital communications are "finally on the way to profitable mass production with the concomitant favorable effect on end product prices." Industry specialists estimate that in four to five years, an adapter card for the PC will cost only 80 German marks [DM]. Storp observes further that "each PC will then be able to participate in telecommunications." At least DM500 would have to be invested today in order to be able to use this additional capability. Despite the Euro Norm, however, no further large price reductions can be expected for medium and large communications facilities. The sharp competition, which companies like Siemens, Philips, Alcatel SEL, and Telenorma have brought to this market segment in recent years, has already pushed the prices for large systems well below the profitable level. "There is no more room for maneuver in that regard," Storp laments. But the situation vis a vis small Euro ISDN systems is quite different. Telekom's Volker Fink recognizes that "there is a considerable need for action in the matter of small businesses and the self-employed." Although not connected to large production figures, the price spiral downwards continues markedly for smaller systems. With the Eumex minisystem, which manages up to eight extensions, Telekom brings to the market a Euro ISDN switching system at the competitive price of less than DM1000. Pleased by this Telekom development, consultant Oberfrank notes that "previously a terminal adapter, which could only connect a single analog telephone to the digital network, had cost that much." And developments in other companies are also brightening the scene. Software giant Microsoft, for example, has now designed its successful 'windows for workgroups' program with a software module for access to the ISDN network. Oberfrank is convinced that this would never had happened if purely national ISDN standards still prevailed. Despite these promising business prospects, the high spirits prevailing among the suppliers of ISDN circuit boards for personal computers, like AVM GmbH of Berlin, mbp Software & Systems GmbH of Dortmund, and ITK GmbH of Dortmund, are clouded. Regardless of the unified regulatory system, industrial policy 'trench warfare' threatens this lucrative market segment. It is being fought out at the technical level. With the so-called CAPI (Common Application Programmable Interface), almost all the producers of ISDN PC cards and communications software are now able to combine the hardware and the application programs of the various suppliers. A Euro ISDN version of this industry standard is already available. However, mainly because of massive French influence and insistence, another, clearly technically inferior solution is being pushed along at the European standardization institute ETSI in Nizza. "Now that we finally have the European ISDN Standard, the French have nothing better to do than block the open market and try to protect its own industry. The ISDN boom in Germany is clearly indicated by the number of base connections sold yearly. In 1991, 59,071 such connections were sold, in 1992, it was 138,831, in 1993, 281,254, in 1994, the number is expected to be 480,000, and in 1995, 800,000.
