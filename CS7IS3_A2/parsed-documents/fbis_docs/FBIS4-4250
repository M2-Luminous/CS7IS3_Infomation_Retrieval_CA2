First Step in Agricultural Products Price Reform Is To Reform Their Formation Mechanism and Change From Setting Prices By Administration to the Market Price System The success of microeconomic structural reform in China's rural areas greatly promotes them in changing from the self-sufficient and semi-self-sufficient economy to the commodity economy and the dominant role of market mechanism over the behavior of contractors is increasingly strengthened. The peasants are paying increased attention to weighing and comparing the high and low amounts of interests. With such a background, the growth in the market for agricultural products and the improvement of their market mechanism will inevitably become principal contradictions which must be overcome. The microeconomic structural reform in China's rural areas has enabled the peasants to obtain the right of operation and use of land that belongs to the collective but it takes as prerequisites the identity of land ownership by the collective and the guarantee of land ownership in achieving economically residual recourse; moreover, it must also identify itself with the governmental privilege of compulsory fixed quota purchases of agricultural products at low cost. Under such an economic operational mechanism, the peasant families cannot always accept regulation by market price signals but must also accept, on many occasions, regulation by quantity signals transmitted by the government to the lower levels. This makes the reform of the traditional purchasing and marketing system and pricing system for agricultural products the central link in building a normal socialist market economy system and in improving the market mechanism. The agricultural products price reform carried out by China for more than 10 years was aimed at reforming the pricing system, i.e., changing the pricing structure, which was originally seriously twisted, into a rational pricing structure which truly reflects values and supply and demand relations and to build price parity and price difference relations which have and economic basis, so that various trades and industries can get more or less the same level of profit rate from funds. On the other hand, it was also aimed at reforming the pricing formation mechanism, achieving the transition from setting prices by administration to a market price system, and letting prices give play to their functions under an open, unified, and competitive market system. In reforms in these two aspects, the reform of the latter aspect is the more important and essential. Only by reforming the price formation mechanism, and by letting prices build up by themselves in market exchanges, can prices truly reflect the extent of deficiency of resources and the market supply and demand relations, to make relative price changes beneficial to the rationalization of the pricing structure. The basic functions of prices are mainly manifested in two respects, resources allocation and exchanges. Under the state monopoly for purchasing and marketing agricultural products and the old microeconomic organization, compulsory purchase (or monopoly imposed purchase) added the functions of regulating income and distribution into the prices of agricultural products, which mixed up the functions of income and distribution with those of exchanges. The functions of resources allocation were completely replaced by mandatory plans, which led to the twisting of price functions and seriously inhibited the growth of the agricultural products market. The starting point for price setting and price regulation of agricultural products by administration lay in carrying out the functions of income and distribution and in stimulating the initiatives of the producers of agricultural products by raising their purchasing prices which had remained low over a long period of time. When purchasing prices were raised and selling prices remained unchanged, financial burdens increased. Price subsidies which the state spent on domestic purchases and sales of agricultural products and on the purchases and sales of imported products rose from 6.995 billion yuan in 1978 to 36.262 billion yuan in 1984, an annual average progressive increase of 31.5 percent, greatly exceeding the rate of annual progressive increase of 4.6 percent in total revenue during this period. The proportion of revenue it accounted for also rose from 6.24 percent in 1978 to 24.8 percent in 1984. The accumulative total spent on these subsidies in six years reached 167.439 billion yuan, equivalent to 24.3 percent of the revenue during the corresponding period. It was inevitable that it would bring about a serious imbalance between revenue and expenditure. In the traditional purchases and sales system for agricultural products, which was linked with prices regulation by administration, there were no equal market relations between purchases and sales. Because of low prices, purchases had partly the nature of paying taxes and, because of low prices, sales had partly the nature of welfare. Administrative price regulations linking income and distribution with product exchanges could only acquire supply prosperity by increases in hidden subsidies without fundamentally solving the problem of the price formation mechanism. Practical experience in China's rural reforms shows that certain conditions are required to completely restore the resources allocation and exchange functions which prices should have, enable the product market to grow fully, and to finally achieve the transformation from the system of setting prices by the state to the market price system. These functions require that both exchanging parties should be built on the basis of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and true equality. The income and distribution functions embodied in such prices would be separate from exchange functions. On that basis, the functions of resources allocation by prices can be truly brought into play by the producers' reorientation of production and promotion of the flow of productive factors. After the mid-1980's, China released, by stages and in groups, the purchases and sales as well as the prices of agricultural products, thus bringing essential changes in the generating mechanism for agricultural products prices. More than 10 years have elapsed since the first step in China's agricultural prices reform which started in 1979 and has lasted up till now and the guiding position of market prices in the sphere of agricultural products has been basically established, with market mechanism playing a dominant role in price formation. II. The Second Step in Agricultural Products Prices Reform Is To Achieve Merchandization and Marketization of the Productive Factors Practical experience tells us that: To enable the peasants to achieve the goal of increasing income through increased production, we must release the purchases and sales, as well as the prices of agricultural products, and let supply and demand, production, and sales meet face to face, so that the peasants can produce more products with a large market demand and whose prices are expected to rise according to the information of changes in social demand structure. However, the readjustment of rural industries or product mix with the market as guidance presupposes changes in factor structure. It thus requires that various productive factors should be allowed to flow freely among various peasant households and, therefore a flexible and developed factor market is the basic guarantee for the industries or product mix to make rapid readjustment according to market demand. The essence of the reform of factor prices lies in a developed factor market. Viewed from the angle of economic development, this is more important than a developed product market because: 1) without resources allocation of the factor market, only the relative comparative superiority of the allocation subject, that is, each individual peasant household itself can be brought into play but the relative comparative superiority among peasant households and between various areas cannot be used, nor can the factor compensation rate be raised with the aid of factor flow. The extent of optimization of such resources allocation mechanism is extremely limited; 2) By re-composition of land, labor, funds, and technology between areas, a developed factor market can help the economy of developed areas to promote the economic development of backward areas, thus gradually minimizing the gap in the economic development level between areas. The purchases and sales, as well as the agricultural product prices, in China at present have been basically released and the agricultural products market has developed on a preliminary basis. However, the market prices of labor, funds, land, and other factors are still far from being built up and, therefore, greatly restrict the market from bringing its role of resources allocation into full play. This is an extremely important reason why the second stage reform (reform of the circulation system and the industrial structure) in China's rural areas, which started in 1985, could not achieve a fundamental essential breakthrough. It should be fully realized that the difficulties and risks in agricultural factors price reform are far greater than those in agricultural products price reforms. First, this reform is incompatible with traditional theories and concepts. If the market and prices of agricultural products remain incompatible with traditional theories and concepts, then the market and prices of agricultural productive factors (such as funds, labor, land, etc.) will seriously deviate from the standards and criteria of traditional theories and concepts. Secondly, before China's economic structural reform, there was neither a market nor prices of agricultural productive factors. Therefore, after economic structural reform in the rural areas, the growth of the market for agricultural productive factors was extremely slow, and the phenomena of the absence of their prices, were quite serious, not to mention the possibility of building up their normal supply and demand relations. The allocation of agricultural productive factors is generally first expressed in the allocation of funds. The readjustment of the agricultural production structure, in the final analysis, is the readjustment of the structure of funds. This requires opening up the fund market to meet the needs of the merchandization and marketization of the rural economy. Essentially speaking, it is aimed at developing various kinds of financial activities according to the requirements of the law of market economy. Besides relying on its own slow accumulation of funds, China's agriculture also relies on indirect merging of funds as its major source. Unitary banking assets and shortage of bank funds inevitably require breaking the unitary finance channel and building many kinds of optional credit forms and finance channels to solve the problems of fund shortages for production and construction. To develop fund markets in the rural areas, we should attach importance to developing nonsystematized banking, that is, borrowing among the people. However, its limitations are enormous and requires further developing transregional systematized banking. Fund prices are the outcome of the marketization of funds. The development of fund market will inevitably be followed by corresponding reforms in fund prices, that is, in the interest rate system. China's traditional interest rate system was the outcome of the planned economy and its major problem was to inhibit, or even repel, the marketization of fund prices, making the price of funds as deficient resources excessively low. This requires changing the current interest rate system, readjusting the irrational interest rate structure, and gradually building a floating interest rate system with the central bank's loan interest rates as hte standards, to bring into play the regulatory role of the interest rate lever over the supply and demand of funds. Once the conditions are ripe for building the market economy system, interest rates will then immediately follow up and become marketized and compete freely. China's agricultural labor factor is quite abundant and in the rural areas there is no such thing as a labor employment system, with state responsibility and overall assignment as in cities, which is favorable to promoting the building of rural labor market and reducing the difficulty in reform of prices of rural labor. Under the circumstances of the unlimited supply of labor in China's rural areas at present, labor market and the prices of labor related to it can only grow gradually in the course of economic development. The method is to readjust the rural employment structure and increase the number of jobs in the course of speeding up rural industrialization and promoting urbanization. When the market economy in the rural areas develops, it will inevitably open up new economic spheres, provide ever-developing employment opportunities, and create conditions for the building of labor market prices. The building of a land market in China's rural areas was a fairly difficult process. The initial growth started from the contract- based land management responsibility system carried out in the late 1970's and early 1980's. For the nearly 30 years before that, because land ownership and the right of operation of land were highly centralized, a land market had always been strictly prohibited by the government. However, after land was operated on a contract basis by peasant households, land transfer and subcontracting exchanges between peasant households increased daily. As regards government policies, in 1984 it was clearly put forward that it was necessary to encourage the transfer and concentration of farmland in good farming hands; in 1985 peasant households were allowed to transfer and subcontract land with pay and a contract- based system of land with pay was encouraged; in 1987 subcontracting of land in legal forms was allowed; and in 1988 legal provisions on prohibiting buying and selling, leasing, or transferring land were revised by the government. These were favorable to the building and growth of the rural land market and land prices. The major problems hindering the growth of China's land market and land prices at present are: 1) in the great majority of areas, land contracts are still based on low compensation or even gratis. In economically developed areas, there is still the situation wherein subsidies are given to the peasants for growing grain and sugar cane instead of putting into effect the use of land for payment. Land ceases to be a commodity and actually becomes pure welfare with no value at all; 2) land has not yet truly become a commodity and is still prohibited by law from entering the circulation market. In particular, it is still impossible for land ownership to be bought and sold through the market and to flow rationally. For example, in requisitioning collective land for use, the state generally compensates for agricultural loss alone without recognizing that land has value. However, after land requisition, the unit that uses the land changes hands and sells it, reaping staggering profits from the real estate operation and making the value of collective land flow in large amounts into the unit engaged in real estate operation. In light of the abovementioned problems, it is necessary to recognize, in theory and practice and even in law, that land is a commodity (a special kind of commodity), and that collective land should be allowed to enter the market to be bought, sold, transferred, mortgaged, and leased under leadership and in a planned way under strict supervision and management by various levels of state land departments and within the scope of the use and plan for land. Of course, to prevent privatization of land, it must be clearly stipulated that the buying, selling, and transferral of land ownership can only be conducted between units of public ownership. As for leasing, buying, and selling the rights to use land within a given period of time, these should not be subject to this kind of restriction. Whether land market operations are normal or not, the key lies in the rationality of land prices. If land prices can accurately reflect the supply and demand situation for land, they will stimulate and guide the flow and use of land in conformity with demand. No particular system has yet been set up as to how to decide the prices in China's rural land market at present; there is no standardization and scientific methods are lacking. Such a situation must be changed. Scientific price setting should be based on land appraisal and land market forecasts. The fixing of land prices should include land contract fees, transferral fees, and buying and selling prices. We should gradually accomplish regulated land prices and rent by the market competition mechanism and the transparency of market transactions should be improved. When a state unit requisitions collective land, both parties should discuss and negotiate a price according to the local market situation and must not adopt the method of requisition at low cost or without pay. With the development of the commodity economy and the secondary and tertiary industries in the rural areas, it is necessary to introduce a market competition mechanism gradually into the land contract-based system and recognize the merchandization and valuation of land, to gradually build up a land resources allocation system regulated by the market mechanism. III. The Third Step in Agricultural Products Price Reform Will Be To Build a Mechanism Which Fits in With the Requirements of the Development of Market Economy and Avoids the Risks of Price Fluctuation At present, transactions for most agricultural products are made in a primitive markets of a primary nature and those done in wholesale markets are extremely limited. Due to the lack of a unified market system, the markets which have been built are not just separate in space, the problems of regional blockades and departmental monopolies have not yet been overcome, let alone the possibility of building a mechanism for macroeconomic regulation and control which effectively avoids the risks of price fluctuation. Under such an undeveloped and constrained market system, when there are crop failures or when prices are expected to rise, individual, collective, or state-run businesses will all try to force up prices and rush to make purchases; conversely, there will be less purchases or no purchases. There is now difficulty in selling, then in buying; sometimes there appears to be a steep fall in market prices, sometimes soaring prices appear and such a posture is often expressed in a relationship of cause and effect emerging alternately. The extent ofthe risks in circulation and prices of agricultural products is extremely high, causing the producers and consumers of agricultural products to suffer serious losses. What requires pointing out especially is that, in the industrial replacement of the national economy, agriculture belongs to an industry with a weak nature and bears the characteristics of low price elasticity in supply, low income, and low price elasticity in demand, making the problem extremely conspicuous. In view of the above, the building a unified domestic market for agricultural products on the basis of full market development is needed That is, a market in which agricultural products can flow freely on a nationwide basis and in which the state can intervene by means of macroeconomic regulation and control, thus placing the trade of major agricultural products throughout China under government supervision, guidance, and control. In a modern market economy there are two main methods of avoiding the risks of price fluctuation: One is that the government bears a part or all of the price risks. For important agricultural products, the government carries out a price guarantee or a price support system. At present, to prevent agricultural products producers from suffering huge economic losses due to steep falls in price, and to prevent having a negative impact on the national economy, it is a basic policy in most countries to carry out a general price protection policy or price support policy for purchasing important agricultural products. The grain purchase and price policy implemented by the Chinese Government in 1990 meant that, in essence, the government bore all the risks in grain prices. The grain protection prices or support prices formulated by the state that year was generally 20 percent higher than market prices. Under such circumstances, the grain peasants vied with each other to sell grain to the state and were unwilling to sell it through the grain trade market, thus abruptly depressing grain market transactions. The result was that the problem whereby the peasants had difficulty selling grain could in no way be fundamentally overcome due to the extremely limited amount of funds, bad circulation facilities, and insufficient storage capacity on the part of the state. The government then worked out guide or target prices and price risks (minor risks), within a certain range, were borne by the producers and operators of agricultural products, and price risks (major risks) beyond the ceiling and lower limit of guide or target prices were borne by the government. Whether or not the government bears all or a part of the abovementioned risks in the prices of agricultural products, it requires the setting up of equalization funds at the levels of the central authorities and provinces (municipalities), to regulate the market and to play the role of storage ponds. It should be clearly pointed out that such regulation comes under government behavior and the greater part of the equalization funds should be included in the central and provincial financial budgets. Of course, the income built up by using the equalization funds in the course of buying and selling agricultural products and in curbing market prices should also serve as supplementary sources of equalization funds. It is obvious from the above that it is impractical and impossible for the Chinese Government to bear all the price risks of agricultural products because government financial resources in China up to the present stage have always been quite tense. Moreover, such a way of doing things would be unfavorable to the growth and maturity of the market economy in China. Therefore, we should have our eyes on another method to reform the mechanism for avoiding the risk of price fluctuations in agricultural products, i.e., with the aid of self-regulation, compensation, and balance functions peculiar to the market economy, we should break down and shift the price risks of agricultural products and let them be borne by risk investors. Such a method meets the objective requirements for the development of market economy and is an intrinsic mechanism and function which is developing and improving in the modern market economy. Its role is realized by a modern futures market. The so-called modern futures market refers to one in which special transactions of standardized futures contracts are made and which has the special functions of index-linked arbitrage futures and of avoiding the risks of price fluctuation. The futures and spot markets complement each other and together constitute a complete modern market system. A modern futures market is an indispensable part of a modern market economy and has the following two most basic and important functions: The first function is that a modern futures market can avoid the risks of price fluctuation. That is, the risks of price fluctuation which appear on the spot market can be effectively broken down and transferred by index-linked arbitrage futures onto the futures market. The forms of futures transactions for agricultural products are many and varied but can be divided into two types according to the purpose of the transactions: One is a transaction involving index-linked arbitrage futures with the purpose of shifting the price risks of agricultural products; the other is a speculative transaction with the purpose of making profits. Under such circumstances, the bearers of price fluctuation of agricultural products are the investors seeking risk profits or risk income on the futures market and it is unnecessary for the production operators and consumers of agricultural products to pay the price. For those engaged in index-linked arbitage futures, it is for the purpose of avoiding the risks of prices of agricultural products by giving up possible maximum profits. As for the risk investors, they dare to bear the greatest risks for the purpose of possibly gaining the greatest profits. The second function is that a modern futures market can provide quite correct and stable price signals, which is favorable to reducing blindness in action and the short-term nature of resources allocation. As the futures market of agricultural products makes long-term transactions, the supply and demand relations they reflect are also long-term and the prices built up are relatively stable. Moreover, the building of futures prices of agricultural products is the outcome of full competition among the numerous market participants, representing the expectations of all market participants for future prices and can therefore, quite correctly, reflect the supply and demand relations of the market in the future. Thus, the prices of futures transactions of agricultural products are not only of a stronger expected nature than spot transaction prices but also of a stronger expected nature than forward contract transaction prices. On this basis, the rationality of decisionmaking in production and operation by producers and operators of agricultural products can also be strengthened. This explains why the futures market and futures prices of agricultural products are the highest forms of operation of market mechanism of agricultural products. It thus decides that the third step of the reform of China's agricultural prices should be one of building a mechanism which avoids the risks of price fluctuation of agricultural products. It should be carried out around the center of building and developing a socialist futures market, to make full use of and bring into full play the intrinsic self-regulation and balance functions of the market economy itself and to enable price signals to play their proper role to the maximum in agricultural resources allocation.
