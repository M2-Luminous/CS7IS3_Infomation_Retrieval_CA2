FBIS4-39769 "drsov112_c_94006" FBIS-SOV-94-112 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Federal Assembly Presidential Expert on Duma's Passage of Budget Presidential Expert on Duma's Passage of Budget LD0906161594 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1449 GMT 9 Jun 94 LD0906161594 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 110 (600): Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] The leader of the team of experts under the president Alexander Lifshits believes that the bill on the federal budget for 1994 which was approved on Wednesday in the second reading reflects the maximum possibilities of the State Duma. It is better to have this version of the budget than none at all, he said. IF Note: The State Duma approved on June 8 in the second reading the bill of a federal budget for 1994 without any changes into the past of revenue and of expenditures and its deficit. The deputies approved proposals of the budget committee of the lower house abut more expenditures for defense purposes (from 37.1 trillion to 40.6 trillion rubles) at the expense of the internal redistribution of means in the budget. The Duma Defense Committee insisted on more money for defense purposes (up to 55 trillion rubles). Lifshits stated that the problem was still topical. He believes there is a need to search for mechanisms to resolve the issue on additional financing of the defense order and other needs of the "power" structures. The proposals for the use for this purpose of part of the privatization campaign should, believes Lifshits, be formed as a concrete legal act. This spells serious restrictions for the process of post-voucher privatization, he believes. According to the leader of the group of experts, now is the time to start thinking on the ideology of the budget for 1995, which should be principally different from the present one. Lifshits believes that the process should be built from above, not from below. First determined should be the principles of the structural policies, the concept or the strategy of the budget and later it should be considered by the Finance Ministry. Meanwhile, the speaker of the upper house of parliament Vladimir Shumeyko criticized the budget approved on Wednesday by the State Duma. The Federation Council will not agree to such a budget, at least me, said Shumeyko on Thursday speaking with journalists in Moscow. He believes the budget has no political orientation. It seems that the Duma believes like this: The worse the better. The Duma creates grounds for the change of power, said Shumeyko. The current budget indicates that the country has no budget policy. He favored the need for greater expenditures for defense purposes. In an exclusive interview for Interfax, the Duma speaker Rybkin expressed concern over the fact that the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, may not approve the budget. He warned that if someone in the Federation Council takes an attempt to destroy the budget, he was prepared to make a public speech to tell the people of Russia who they were earlier and why they destroyed the budget for four years. IF Note: If the upper house does not approve the federal budget, it will be returned to the Duma which should collect two-thirds of votes for the second approval. If the Duma fails to collect the necessary number of votes, the document will have to voted again at all levels. According to the chairman of the Duma Budget Committee, Mikhail Zadornov, there will be needed 2-3 weeks for coordination of new budget version. If so, the parliament will consider the budget of the 3-4 quarters of the year, said Zadornov.
