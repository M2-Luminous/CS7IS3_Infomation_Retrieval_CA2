ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Idaho for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. In the Final Rules Section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to Montel Livingston, Environmental Protection Specialist (AT&hyph;082), Air Programs Section, at the EPA Regional Office listed below.
