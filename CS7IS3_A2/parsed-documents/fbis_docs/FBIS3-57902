Cetin was replying to an off agenda speech delivered by Baki Durmaz, True Path Party deputy from Afyon, at the Turkish Grand National Assembly that met under Yasin Hatipoglu today. He said: [Begin Cetin recording] While our workers employed in Europe are deprived of the right of free movement, certain countries grant the right of free circulation to terror organizations. This stand, of course, has begun to disrupt the public order in the countries concerned. Some 200 militants arriving from Germany caused the recent incidents in Brussels. Following these incidents, the Foreign Ministry has taken all the necessary steps, be they at headquarters or in Brussels, and has shown the necessary reaction and interest. In a bid to contain the incidents, all the personnel at our embassy and our consulate general as well as all the religious personnel and teachers in the region have tried to soften and ease the situation. Certain Belgian press organs or officials are trying to give the impression that the incidents occurred between ethnic groups. The issue is not a Turkish-Kurdish clash. The issue is not a clash among our citizens. It is an incident that occurred between a terror organization and our citizens. [end recording] Referring to the phone conversation he held with the Belgian foreign minister yesterday, Cetin recalled that he told the minister that if measures are not taken the incidents might spread to other European cities as well. He added that the issue will be brought up again at the NATO member countries meeting to be held on Sunday [9 January].
