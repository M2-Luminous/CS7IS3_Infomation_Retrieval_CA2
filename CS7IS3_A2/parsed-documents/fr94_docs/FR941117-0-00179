FR941117-0-00179 FR941117-0-00012 Changes: No change was made to the text of this paragraph, but, since the proposed §75.564(e) has been deleted, this paragraph has been redesignated as §75.564(e) in these final regulations. Section 76.560␣General indirect cost rates; exceptions. Since the Department recently adopted the revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 as 34 CFR Part 74, references in this section have been revised to be consistent with the new 34 CFR Part 74. Section 76.561␣Approval of indirect cost rates. The Department has revised this section to be consistent with the corresponding section of 34 CFR Part 75 so that State educational agencies may approve multi-year indirect cost rates for recipients subject to 34 CFR Part 76. Section 76.564␣Restricted indirect cost rate_formula. The Department has made a revision to this section to make its requirements consistent with similar requirements in 34 CFR Part 75. Specifically, §76.564(d) has been revised to prohibit the use of unrecovered indirect costs under a restricted rate grant to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. This change is consistent with current departmental practices and with the restriction placed on training grants in §75.562(c)(3). Section 76.565␣General management costs_restricted rate. Comments: Several commenters found the language in §76.565 concerning organization-wide activities to be unclear. Some of the commenters thought that the proposed regulations did not make it clear that some activities considered divisional administration may in fact be organization-wide activities, such as payroll or personnel functions. Discussion: The Department agrees with these commenters and has changed the wording in an attempt to make the final version clearer to readers. Changes: The wording of §76.565(a) has been changed to clarify the meaning of the term organization-wide. Section 76.565(c) has been revised to clarify the use of the term divisional administration. Comments: One commenter said a deputy chief executive officer who oversees general management activities should not be excluded as required in §76.565 (c) and (d). Another said that chief executive officers should be excluded only if their activities are limited to one component. Discussion: Chief executive officers and their deputies are positions that would exist whether or not the organization received Federal funds. To support them with Federal funds would be supplanting, which is prohibited under restricted rate programs. Changes: None. Comments: One commenter disagreed with the definition of component in §76.565(d)(2), saying it conflicts with the generally accepted accounting standard that an agency is a component of a State. The commenter maintains that the proposed definition of a component as an organizational unit within an agency would prohibit States from charging legitimate administrative costs to a grant. Discussion: As stated in §76.563, this section applies to ``agencies of State and local governments,'' most commonly the State educational agency, not to the State itself. In this context, the component would be an organizational unit within a State agency, as described in the regulation. No change has been made in this section. Changes: None. Section 76.567␣Other expenditures_restricted rate. Comments: The Department received one comment that subgrants should be excluded from other expenditures, since their inclusion would distort the indirect cost calculation and subgrants are already excluded from the base in the formula in §76.569. Discussion: The Department agrees with this comment and has made a change. Changes: Section 76.567(b) has been revised to exclude subgrants from other expenditures. Section 76.568␣Occupancy and space maintenance costs_restricted rate. Comments: One commenter thought the last two sentences of §76.568(c) should be deleted as inconsistent with other Federal guidance in OMB Circular A&hyph;87 and OASC&hyph;10, that States cannot afford to pay for the office space occupied by Federal program staff.
