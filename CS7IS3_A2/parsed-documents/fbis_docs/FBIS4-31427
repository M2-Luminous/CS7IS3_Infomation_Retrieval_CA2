"Prior to my departure, we in the inner leadership of the republic of Serb Krajina had agreed to display flexibility and agree to discuss economic relations on the territory of Serb Krajina with the Croatian delegation," Martic said in a statement carried by Radio Belgrade. "Repeated Croatian media claims that the republic of Serb Krajina is an integral part of Croatia should not irritate us, because it is clear here in Geneva and to the whole world that this is not the case. We were received at the highest level here, and I could safely say that this was a diplomatic victory for us, victory in the sense that cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg provided certain guarantees that they would be absolutely in favor of unprecedented sanctions being introduced against Croatia in the case of fresh aggression by Croatia against the republic of Serb Krajina. We were told the same by Akashi," Martic said. According to him, the talks to be held in Plitvice on 16 and 17 June will not prejudice political solutions. This, Martic believes, "will be an opportunity for the whole world and the reporters gathered in Plitvica to find out to whom Plitvice really belongs." Likewise, he said that he had also received assurances from the cochairmen, as well as Mr. Akashi, that they would do everything to ensure that Croatia honored the first stage of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities concerning those articles it had not honored in the past. "Therefore, this is a great step forward, and I personally believe that Akashi will stand by his word and that this will be carried out immediately," Martic said. Martic also said that the Serb Krajina delegation had been received in Geneva "at the highest level" and that "an important diplomatic move" had been made, which "opened the front door in international relations where the republic of Serb Krajina is concerned."
