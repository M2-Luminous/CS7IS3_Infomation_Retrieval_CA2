I hereby state my political position. I think we need to try to dot the i's and act without subterfuge or ambiguity. It is essential to speak out clearly, particularly as the people for whom I have the greatest respect are the members of the National Assembly of JS19J and its rank-and-file members in general. Brothers and sisters in Sandinist Youth: The decision made by the National Council of Sandinist Youth on 19 February was the result of manipulation controlled from outside our organization, encouraged by some of the National Committee (some were naive, while others were well aware of what they were doing, realizing that the rank and file had not been consulted, and that only the National Assembly of JS19J can elect the organization's national officers. The Sandinist youth leadership, like other sectors of Nicaraguan society, has been confronted with some major changes in behavior, and has been rejecting everything that it considers harmful to the youth sector. We now have leaders whom we support for the joint leadership in Sandinist Youth. 1. We are not the founding leaders of JS19J, and so we do not have the same age and experience that others may have had. 2. Our organization's financial resources available for working with youth are totally inadequate. 3. The apathy and scepticism felt by the majority of young people concerning political participation is not the responsibility of our work, and it greatly affects what we can do. 4. We have led Sandinist Youth under the banner of the unity of Sandinism, and so we have rejected any attachment to specific ideological factions or persons. This was part of a decision made in the National Committee of JS19J, a decision which I have respected with fairness and which I have always defended. JS Should Not Be a Springboard The decision made on 19 February affects the unity of JS19J because I was unwilling to allow Sandinist Youth to be used to strengthen specific individuals in the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. I want to make it clear that I had been pressured on various occasions by the departmental secretary of Managua, Bladimir Soto, to take a position in relation to one of the factions (which I refused to do out of respect for the decision of my youth organization). This meant both supporting his candidacy for political secretary of District Two in Managua and of Henry Petrie for political secretary of Managua. By making this clear, I believe that the rest may be readily deduced. This situation is seriously detrimental to Sandinist Youth, both nationally and internationally. The comrades who set up the political ambush in the National Council should consider this carefully. I call upon them to reflect and return the situation to normal immediately. If not, they could be parties to the destruction of JS19J. I will not fail to mention here my amazement about the ingenuousness displayed by comrade Roger Grijalva, who is being used to defend a divisive concept, behavior, and attitude in JS19J. My brother, a man must adopt a single standard of judgment. As a thinking being, no one takes away your right to speak out and to act with honesty. Even in the National Committee we decided that everyone of us has the full right to choose one faction or another, but not to use Sandinist Youth as a springboard to strengthen individuals. On the contrary, our mission is to work to strengthen the party as a whole. Sandinist young people: it is up to you to decide; you have the truth and the power in your hands. Let us strive for Sandinist unity.
