The police arrested Mrs. Fritz Betty Obin as she was attempting to travel to the United States aboard American Airlines. Mrs. Obin confessed that she was surprised by her arrest because she uses powerful magic to help the drug pass through. She admitted that from 4 May 1993 to 7 January 1994, she had already traveled with 30 kilos of cocaine. The amount that the anti-drug police seized would have brought this amount up to 42 kilos that the voodoo priestess would have passed through.
