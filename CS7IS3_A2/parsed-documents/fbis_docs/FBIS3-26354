Some people pointed out that the tax rate is too high, it hits both speculators and honest businessmen, and if developers make no profits, they will be compelled to give up their development plans. In the middle of January, a Hong Kong delegation consisting of 30 people (including real estate businessmen, surveyors, lawyers, and accountants), went to Beijing to air their views and to ask the authorities not to go too far in levying the value-added land tax, but to ensure appropriate profits for honest Hong Kong developers. According to the "Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Land Tax," anyone who transfers real estate and earns an income shall pay tax on the added value according to the regulations. The regulations state that four progressive rates shall be applied in levying the value-added land tax, including: 1) A rate of 30 percent shall be levied on the amount of the increment value that does not exceed 50 percent of the total amount of deductions; 2) A rate of 40 percent shall be levied on the amount of the increment value that exceeds 50 percent but is lower than 100 percent of the total amount of deductions; 3) A rate of 50 percent shall be levied on the amount of the increment value that exceeds 100 percent but is less than 200 percent of the total amount of deductions; 4) A rate of 60 percent shall be levied on the amount of the increment value that exceeds 200 percent of the total amount of deductions. According to reports, the aim of authorities in formulating the regulations on the value-added land tax is to standardize the business order of the land and real estate market, rationally readjust benefits from value-added land, and safeguard state rights and interests. It happened that the Constitution revised in 1986 states "the right to use land owned by the state can be transferred according to law," and that since foreign businessmen were allowed to develop and manage large stretches of land in 1990, the real estate business has developed vigorously in all provinces and municipalities on the mainland, large quantities of land have been approved for development, and the number of real estate development companies has increased to thousands upon thousands. Therefore, many undesirable practices have emerged. For example, local governments, in a bid to attract foreign land developers, compete with each other in lowering land prices, approve at random the establishment of development zones, and development companies which have bought large stretches of land have engaged in land speculation. At the same time, high-grade houses and houses to be sold abroad constitute a greater part of the structure of land investment. As a result, the development of real estate was not balanced and was partially out of control. For example, according to the national plan for 1992, 2 million mu of land should have been approved for development, but 3.6 million mu of land was actually approved, exceeding the target by 80 percent. The input of funds on a large scale into the real estate industry has also affected the development of the energy, communications, raw material, and other industries. Mainland specialists pointed out that an important cause of the appearance of overheated real estate business is that the burden of tax on buying and selling land and real estate is on the light side. For example, foreign real estate companies only need to pay a three percent commodity house business tax and they reap substantial profits. Therefore, more and more foreign investors have invested in real estate. The original intention of the Chinese Government in levying value-added land tax is to regulate and control the real estate market on the mainland in addition to increasing revenue from taxes. According to analysis by specialists, another purpose of increasing the value-added land tax is evidently to curb construction of excessively large quantities of garden villas, holiday resorts, and high-class apartments which have taken up a large amount of resources, which have not much to do with the ordinary people, and which do not have clear market prospects, and to guide the developers to make investment in the construction of common residential houses for domestic sales, which have a great market demand and are closely related to the people's living standard, and to make investment in power plants, highways, and other industries. This can be said to be a means of macro regulation and control. However, because of a different considerations of interest, the increase in the value-added land tax on the mainland has evoked much dissatisfaction in Hong Kong and Taiwan. A real estate businessman said that in additional to paying 30 to 60 percent of value-added land tax according to the regulations on the mainland, it is necessary to pay 33 percent of profit tax for profits from selling houses. This means double taxation. According to this way of calculating taxes, the maximum amount of taxes to be paid for investment in real estates may reach 73 percent, and the minimum tax rate is also as high as 53 percent. Because investment risks and investment returns are out of proportion, some real estate developers may suspend their projects to avoid losses. Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu also pointed out that according to the method of calculation of the central authorities, the implementation of the new tax system will raise production costs of investment by 5 percent and lower profits by 30 percent. If this rate is put into practice, investors will not be able to make any profits. However, he pointed out that the added value tax is a kind of local tax and the local government can formulate detailed rules for implementation themselves. Guangzhou has its own standard in formulating the detailed rules. Therefore, he said that Guangzhou's investors may set their minds at rest. A director of the China Department of the Hong Kong Jones Lang & Wooten Consultants held that the levying of the value-added land tax on the mainland is mainly aimed at short-term speculators and its impact on the real estate market as a whole will not be too great. Some people expected that the temperature in real estate investment on the mainland this spring will fall, but in the latter half of the year, the real estate market will tend to become more vigorous again. The number of transactions will be no fewer than that of the same period last year. The selling prices of various kinds of real estate will rise by 15 to 25 percent. According to reports, the Chinese Government, in a bid to speed up the construction of residential houses for urban residents, is encouraging foreign businessmen to take part in plans for the development of inexpensive residential houses. Major Hong Kong financial groups have responded positively to this. The New World Development Company Ltd. and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. have already signed a letter of intent on the development of inexpensive houses. Various signs have indicated that China's real estate market has broad prospects and is still attracting Hong Kong businessmen's investment in development.
