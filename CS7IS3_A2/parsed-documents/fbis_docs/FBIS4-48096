The Ivorian school system has not been spared by the effects of this crisis, which has affected all aspects of life. Since 1990, the school system has been experiencing serious problems which have been of great concern to the government. Virtually, not a single week goes by without a strike or serious and unjustified acts of vandalism occurring in the national university and in our schools. Loyal to its policy of peace, the government has employed and continues to employ all avenues of dialogue to remedy the situation. However, we are compelled to say that the situation has been going from bad to worse. It is therefore with a sad heart that we have come to talk to you about the Ivorian school system and the crisis it is experiencing. [passage omitted] Our children must go to school and sit their examinations without allowing themselves to be distracted by the surprising behavior of some them -- those belonging to the Federation of University and High School Students of Cote d'Ivoire [FESCI] which we have to mention by name -- who constitute the activists of the school system. FESCI is a student organization that is supposed to represent students' interests but in actual fact this organization is rather quick to engage in politics in accordance with Article 2 of its by- laws, which states that, quote, FESCI reserves the right to express its opinion on any national issue directly or indirectly affecting the education and training of the youth, unquote. It also states in the preamble of the same by-laws that it believes, quote, that the current crisis in school and university circles cannot be curbed with circumstantial measures, but with a total overhaul of our country, unquote. These are all facts that prove the indisputable political involvement of FESCI, which is not a students' union as one may think. [passage omitted] The case of FESCI presents a disturbing peculiarity in the eyes of the law. Although FESCI was dissolved on 20 June 1991 by the government, following the murder of the student Thierry Zebie on 17 June of the same year, it has continued its activities with the tolerance of the public authorities. [passage omitted] Today, the government's tolerance, which is aimed at defusing tension, tends to be perceived as a civic weakness. However, the 30 July 1992 Amnesty Law was not meant to reconstitute FESCI. Consequently, in the eyes of the law, FESCI is still a dissolved association. The fact that it continues to exist implies the maintenance or restitution of a banned association, which is mentioned and punished under Article 34 of Law 60315 of 21 September 1960. This law provides for a penalty of 300,000 CFA francs and one to three years' imprisonment. The truth of the matter is that FESCI doubtlessly appears to be the secular arm of certain political parties, which use it as they wish to settle their differences and to engage, in the name of education, in insurrectional political activities. Hence, the incoherent and, sometimes, surprising nature of some student demands. [passage omitted] The educational, economic, financial, social, and security repercussions are incalculable. Educationally, the prestigious image of the school system has been tarnished. For some years now, lectures and tutorials are not conducted according to the required academic standards. Academic years are cut short -- instead of nine, they are spread over only three months. The most serious consequence of this situation is the nonrecognition of our certificates abroad. Today, a second degree holder from Abidjan who wants to register at an European or American university is forced to start afresh from the first year as if he just obtained his senior high school certificate. Can we continue like this? [passage omitted] History will surely not forgive us. We must therefore react to stop this lawlessness. The government will assume its responsibilities with the support of all those who are committed to saving the Ivorian school system by upholding the supremacy of the law. To conclude, the crisis in the Ivorian educational system -- such as we have just described it -- concerns us all. It must first concern the university and other students themselves, who are the first victims because the issue at stake relates first and foremost to their future. It must concern parents who, after sacrificing their savings and even going sometimes to the extent of borrowing money to educate their wards to guarantee their future, will gain nothing if their efforts go up in smoke. It must concern teachers, supervisors, and all those who in one way or the other are involved in educating the sons and daughters of this country. It must concern all who care about the country's future, which depends primarily on the youth and its education. Last, it must concern all those who care about the future of this country as a whole. It is therefore not without bitterness that we point out the undignified and selfish behavior of a minority of our countrymen who, after attaining comfortable positions as products of our school system, are now preventing our children from enrolling in our educational establishments by masterminding terrorist actions committed unrelentingly by an insignificant group of students at our university campuses and second cycle institutions. The government is aware of the difficulties facing our children today, considering the persistent economic crisis whose most recent consequence is the devaluation of the CFA franc to enable the recovery of our various economies, recovery that can only be achieved in an atmosphere of sustained social peace. Each one of us at whatever level, including the students, is suffering the hardships brought about by the crisis. However, in spite of the adverse effects of the crisis, Cote d'Ivoire continues to view education as a priority among priorities. Indeed, the government continues to allocate 45 percent of its recurrent budget to the education sector. Social transfers alone, that is accommodation, scholarship allowances, feeding, and diverse subsidies, account for 42 percent of this budgetary allocation. This has never been seen anywhere, not even in the developed countries. [passage omitted] We thought that these efforts, virtually unique in the world in relative terms, would tone down the protesting zeal of our students and render them more reasonable. Unfortunately, as anyone would realize, that is far from the case. I therefore urge students to be more realistic and to appreciate government's efforts within our social and economic context. The government calls on all to be vigilant and mobilized to eradicate, once and for all, this scourge which could seriously compromise our country's economic recovery if care is not taken. On its part, the government will do all within its power to quickly and definitely restore law and order in our schools and colleges. [passage omitted] The issue at stake is the future of our dear country, Cote d'Ivoire. The future of our youth is so vital in this regard that political calculations alone cannot remove the present tragedy of the Ivorian school system. For goodness sake, let us stop toying with the future of the youth in order that the Ivorian educational system may regain its past glory and credibility. Dear university and other students, many are those who, today, feel the need to carry on peacefully with their studies. We urge you to come back to your senses and to go back to school quietly, with discipline, and above all with tolerance. Cote d'Ivoire, which has made enormous sacrifices to turn you into worthy citizens, counts on you to meet the challenges of development. However, it must be clear that the government can no longer afford to look on patiently and that in the event of any disturbances adequate measures will be taken to restore peace. Let us together save the Ivorian educational system in order that Cote d'Ivoire may always remain united and prosperous. Thank you.
