FR940712-0-00008 FR940712-0-00005 After reviewing this study the Secretary has determined, in keeping with the intent of Congress to provide a presumption of service connection for former prisoners of war who have diseases which result from dietary inadequacies or unsanitary conditions and for which service connection may be difficult to establish, that the term beriberi heart disease found at 38 U.S.C. 1112(b)(2) includes ischemic heart disease if the former prisoner of war suffered localized edema during captivity. We have amended 38 CFR 3.309(c) accordingly. This amendment is effective August 24, 1993, the date of the Secretary's decision. Since this amendment is an interpretation of existing law, publication as a proposal is not required and the amendment is being issued as a final rule. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required in connection with the adoption of this final rule, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. et seq.). Further, the rule will not directly affect any small entities; only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. This regulatory amendment has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, entitled Regulatory Planning and Review. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.109 and 64.110.
