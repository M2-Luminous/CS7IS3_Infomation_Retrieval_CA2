FR940203-1-00018 FR940203-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 18 CFR Parts 11 and 381 [Docket No. RM93&hyph;7&hyph;000] Charges and Fees for Hydroelectric Projects January 26, 1994. AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is inviting comments on whether it should revise its regulations governing the assessment of annual charges for the administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act and if so, what changes might be appropriate. One alternative that the Commission is considering is to allocate the annual charges for administrative costs among a single class of licensees and exemptees, based on the respective capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum and maximum charge, and with the assessments to commence at the same time as the commencement of project construction. To ameliorate the potential impact on licensees and exemptees, this alternative would include a transition period of several years for phasing-in the changes. Other alternatives would include, but would not be limited to, retention of the current distinction between municipal and non-municipal licensees including retention of the different formulae by which their respective annual charges are allocated. DATES: Comments are due on or before April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: An original and 14 copies of written comments must be filed. All filings should refer to Docket No. RM93&hyph;7&hyph;000 and should be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

I. Introduction The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) invites comments on whether it should revise its regulations governing the assessment of annual charges for the administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act (FPA), 1 and if so, what changes might be appropriate. One alternative that the Commission is considering is to allocate the annual charges for administrative costs among a single class of licensees and exemptees, based on the respective capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum and maximum charge, and with the assessments to commence at the same time as the commencement of project construction. To ameliorate the potential impact on licensees and exemptees, this alternative would include a transition period of several years for phasing-in the changes. Other alternatives would include, but would not be limited to, retention of the current distinction between municipal and non-municipal licensees including retention of the different formulae by which their respective annual charges are allocated. 1 16 U.S.C. 792&hyph;823b.
