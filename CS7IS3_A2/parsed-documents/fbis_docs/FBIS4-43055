Such was, in the course of the colorful ceremony held at the New Zealand Embassy in Paris on Wednesday, 8 June, the cordial invitation made by Mr. Reginensi, deputy mayor of Conde-sur-Noireau. Mr. Reginensi was speaking on behalf of his counterparts from some 12 Calvados municipalities where, on 6 June 1944, there were many "Kiwis" (New Zealanders) among the landing allied forces. Who was he talking to? First of all, of course, to some 35 veterans who had made the "trip to world's end," often with their families, and who, white-haired or balding and rather self-consciously wearing their medals, were bent on proving, champagne glass in hand, that he who still knows how to wet his whistle cannot be deemed an old man. The invitation was also addressed to Prime Minister Jim Bolger, the host of the commemorative ceremony, who was also "reciprocating" Michel Rocard's 1991 visit in Wellington, under circumstances less auspicious than this 50th D-Day commemoration. "The head of the French Government had come to acknowledge mistakes made in the Rainbow Warrior affair, and his apologies had been received with the same generosity as had inspired their formulation," a royal and good-natured Jim Bolger recalled for us. Ever since, "bilateral relations have been excellent," said the New Zealand prime minister, who met with his French counterpart, Edouard Balladur, and is scheduled to meet with the president of the Republic. He added: "We were especially pleased with Francois Mitterrand's announcement that France does not intend to resume atomic testing in the Pacific. We can only hope that next year his successor will stick to this position." Mr. Bolger also notes with satisfaction that "New Caledonia, to which we are close, is now engaged in a peaceful process of political change." No hard feelings about the hard-nosed GATT talks, during which south Pacific countries had found it hard to understand some French positions they perceived as "protectionist?" "None whatsoever! Had our respective positions been in harmony from the start, we would definitely not have needed seven years of talks!," Mr. Bolger said. Indeed, it is generally considered that New Zealand, whose main exports remain farm products, will be among those countries which will benefit from the new world trade order as of 1 January [1995], both because of the ensuing price increases and the opening of new markets for its products. And the prime minister went back to his guests; the most prominent among these was Beatrix de Massin, whom he made a member of the Order of the Queen's Service for hiding for several days, with the help of her mother, a New Zealander whose plane had been shot down in Normandy on 12 June 1944. Another guest of honor was Gerard Whincop, the pilot saved by the providential French woman.
