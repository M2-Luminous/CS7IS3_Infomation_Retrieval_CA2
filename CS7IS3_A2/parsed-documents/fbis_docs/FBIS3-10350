Serra Puche argued that the agreement not only includes goods but also services, copyrights and investments, dispute settlement procedures, and government purchases." [no beginning quotation mark as received] Mexico and Costa Rica trade goods and services for some $80 million a year. Serra Puche believes that the treaty negotiated with Costa Rica, which will come into force on 1 January 1995, could become a very useful guideline for negotiations with other Central American countries. He pointed out that talks with Central America will continue, but they "will not be conducted as a bloc." Therefore, there will be separate negotiations with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and later with Nicaragua. Serra Puche announced that trade negotiations with the Group of Three -- Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia -- might resume in March.
