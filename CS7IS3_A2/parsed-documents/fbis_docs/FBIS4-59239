Primarily, Iraqi President Saddam Husayn has apologized for being unable to receive the delegation at present. On the other hand, a Palestinian military delegation, which has been visiting Baghdad for more than two weeks, discussed technical issues only at the level of liaison officers between the forces of the Palestine Liberation Army and the Iraqi Army. The troops of the Palestine Liberation Army deployed in Iraq will be the first to enter Jericho through Jordan this week. Iraq did not agree to allow these forces to leave and to take along all their weapons. It allowed them to carry personal weapons only, that is, a pistol for officers. It also allowed them to carry 60 rifles as they leave the Iraqi-Jordanian border. The PLO tried to acquire light weapons and ammunitions from Jordan. While discussing this issue, Greece said it was willing to provide the Palestinian police force with light weapons.
