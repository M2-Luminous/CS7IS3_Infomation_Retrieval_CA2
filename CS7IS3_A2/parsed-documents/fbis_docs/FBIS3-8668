However, because the interests of the big and powerful come before the interests of those whom the war directly affects, the big and powerful pursue their policy not in the interest of those who are affected by the war but to their own benefit. We recently had a chance to see what kind of interests are intertwined here from a seemly banal fact. Namely, Saudi Arabia purchased from the United States $6 billion worth of new aircraft for its aircraft carrier. High-level Saudi officials signaled to the Europeans that they have not done enough for the Muslims in Bosnia. France--which wanted to--failed in striking a deal to sell its own aircraft. In place of such a reprimand, the United States was rewarded with an enormous financial deal in which President Clinton was personally engaged. By the way, Saudi Arabia is an Islamic country that financially assists the Bosnian Muslims the most. Let us now reexamine the relations between the Unites States and Western Europe and the United States and Russia. These relations are also being mutually reexamined and reshaped precisely on the issue of the war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has transpired that Western Europe--that is, the European Union--for a long time failed to contribute toward a solution for the Balkan war zone. Therefore, the United States has taken the initiative, more to demonstrate to the European Union that it is not capable of resolving such a problem than to actually solve the problem, and even less to solve it justly. The political message is clear. Europe is not capable of resolving such conflicts by itself and the presence of the United States is inevitable. [passage omitted] Speaking about the sanctions, let us recall that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in a meeting with Greek diplomacy chief Karolos Papoulias actually sent a message to the European Union saying that it has a great political obligation to abolish the sanctions against FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], keeping in mind that the Serbian side had accepted its peace plan, a component of which is also an abolition of the embargo. Prolongation of the sanctions against our country encourages precisely those forces that aspire to accomplish their goals by war, the Serbian president emphasized. As the time is advancing, there is less belief in the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia, as well as a confederation of this federation and Croatia. Does this not mean that instead of a practical step toward peace, an illusion has been created among the international public that the United States is trying to do something--that is, paving the way to force the Serbian side, primarily politically but if possible also militarily, into new territorial concessions. There are increasingly more facts that suggest that this is the true aim of this agreement. Izetbegovic says he would need 60 percent of the territory. The international media assess that the Muslim side would be satisfied with 50 percent or even less territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. In any case, Izetbegovic has doubled his tactics to accomplish this goal. He is faking political cooperativeness in front of the world, as instructed by his tutors, but simultaneously does not hide new military offensive actions against the Serbian positions. On the other hand, Croatian President Tudjman in his apparent cooperativeness wants to take advantage of the expiry of yet another United Nations Protection Force mandate for new threats and not only that to the republic of Serbian Krajina. Regardless of everything, it is increasingly more difficult for the international public to invent endless lies about what is happening in the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]
