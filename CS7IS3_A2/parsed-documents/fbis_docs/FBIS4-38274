The bomb was planted by terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO) on June 28, 1981. "You, survivors of 72 martyrs, should never feel that you have lost anything, rather you should follow the holy path of the martyrs in your thoughts and deeds and be loyal to them... This is victory in itself," president told the audience. He touched on the important role the martyrs played in promoting Islamic revolution and sovereignty of Islamic Republic of Iran's system and referred to events in early years of the Islamic revolution and the efforts spent by deviant and destructive trends to defeat Iran's Islamic revolution. He said such deviant political trends as nationalists, leftists and hypocrites in collaboration with foreign forces tried to prevent formation of a system based on Quranic principles and revolutionary Islam. "Thank's God [as received] that they failed to do so in light of people's presence in the (political) scene and under the leadership of the father of Islamic revolution, the late Imam Khomeini," said the president. Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani said the destruction of Islamic Republic Party headquarters and martyrdom of 72 top persons led by Ayatollah Dr. Mohammad Hossein Beheshti demolished enemies from inside and persuaded people and public opinion to further support officials of the system proceeding on the path of the late Imam Khomeini. He said that hypocrites and enemies of Islamic revolution took their revenge on people, but God destined them to suffer profound regret for a long time and took back all things from them, made them hollow men and alienated them from revolution and the country. President referred to hypocrites' terrorist operations in June 28, 1981 as an event similar to that of Mashhad on Ashura (June 20) and said such crimes unveiled real nature and savage behavior of the false proponents of democracy and human rights before the world and Iranian people's public opinion and brought them notoriety. Rafsanjani wished Islamic revolution martyrs spiritual elevation and their bereaved families patience in following Imam Khomeini's sacred path.
