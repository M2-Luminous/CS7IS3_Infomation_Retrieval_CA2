The interlocutors spoke in favor of the restoration, development, and strengthening of Azerbaijani-Russian ties in all spheres. As the head of the Azerbaijani state put it, the two peoples are linked by almost two centuries of history, and their relations are steeped in rich traditions. It is wrong to discard such a legacy, especially nowadays, when times are so difficult for both countries. In his opinion, the difficulties they are encountering can be overcome only by joint efforts. Regarding the situation of Russians in Azerbaijan, the president emphasized that they are a component part of society and full-fledged citizens of the Republic, which is the way it has been at all times. According to the Azerbaijani leader, the formation of an objective opinion of the situation in the region could be helped by a visit by President of Russia Boris Yeltsin. In this connection he mentioned that such a proposal had been put forward to the head of the Russian state. In turn, Sergey Baburin noted that one of the tasks this Duma delegation has set for itself is to sort out what is currently happening in the conflict zone. In his opinion, A NEGATIVE POINT IS THE ABSENCE IN RUSSIA OF COMPLETE INFORMATION ON AZERBAIJAN. "We are ready to assist," he said, "in ensuring that truthful information reaches politicians both in Russia and in Europe."
