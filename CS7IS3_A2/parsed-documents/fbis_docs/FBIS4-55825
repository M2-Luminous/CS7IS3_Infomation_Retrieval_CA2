FBIS4-55825 "dreeu099_i_94023" FBIS-EEU-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Croat Commander: No Danger to Corridor Region Croat Commander: No Danger to Corridor Region LD2205183194 Zagreb HTV Television in Serbo-Croatian 1730 GMT 22 May 94 LD2205183194 Zagreb HTV Television Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] The Serbs launched attacks last night and this morning from small arms and mortars on eastern defense lines of the free Orasje zone [northern Serb corridor]. [Unidentified correspondent] We have found out from the Orasje operational zone command there were no casualties in this attack, but considerable material damage was caused. General Milivoj Petkovic, the Bosnian Croat Army commander, is currently visiting the units on Orasje-Samac front. [Begin Petkovic recording] Judging by what we have seen so far the people have realized how serious the situation is, and both the Army and the people are behaving accordingly. The general opinion is that there is no danger to this area, judging by what we have seen so far. [end recording] [Correspondent] The most frequently used word in all reports from Bosnian Posavina is the corridor. There is no need to explain what it means to the Serbs. But another question arises here. [Begin Petkovic recording] What are we waiting for? This is the question we are asked everywhere we go. The Army cannot raise itself above politics. The Army has to follow political decisions and it will behave accordingly. All units here, both the Croatian Defense Council's and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 2nd Corps--the Tuzla Corps--are in a state of full combat readiness. I do not think the Serbs have any chance of widening the corridor here. Whether we will try to cut it--you will be told when the time comes. [end recording]
