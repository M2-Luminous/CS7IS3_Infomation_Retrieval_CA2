FBIS4-51937 "dreas087__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-087-A Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Makers To Boost 8-Inch Silicon Wafer Output Makers To Boost 8-Inch Silicon Wafer Output OW0505061794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 10--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0505061794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Five domestic semiconductor wafer makers plan to drastically increase production of 8-inch silicon wafers during the current fiscal year. Shin-Etsu Semiconductor Co. Ltd., the largest among the five companies, plans to begin operating a new plant in Malaysia in July. In addition, the company plans to enlarge its facilities in both Japan and the United States in order to double its current production to 200,000 units monthly. Sumitomo Shichikkusu Co. [name as published] plans to invest a total of 10 billion yen in plants and equipment to double its monthly output to 140,000 units by the first half of fiscal year 1995. The other three major silicon wafer makers are Komatsu Electronic Metals Co. (located in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture); Mitsubishi Material Silicon Co. (located in Noda, Chiba Prefecture); and Toshiba Ceramics Co.; together, the five wafer makers will double their current total output to 450,000-500,000 units monthly. Wafer makers plan to step up their output sharply because domestic semiconductor makers have successively indicated plans to use 8-inch wafers for their products. Shin-Etsu, which supplies nearly 50 percent of the required amount of 8-inch wafers in Japan, plans to double its current monthly output of 100,000 units to 200,000 units during the current fiscal year. The first phase has been completed in the construction of an 8-inch wafer manufacturing plant in Malaysia for which the company plans to spend a total of 20 billion yen. The new plant will start operating in July with a capacity to produce 65,000 units monthly. The company also plans to step up 8-inch wafer production at the Shirakawa factory (located in Fukushima Prefecture), its principal factory, and the "SEH America," its subsidiary manufacturing company in the United States. Sumitomo Shichikkusu plans to gradually build up its facilities at the Imari factory (located in Saga Prefecture) and increase its current monthly output of 70,000 units to 100,000 units during the current fiscal year. It then plans to increase monthly output to 140,000 units in the first half of fiscal year 1995. It expects to spend a total of 10 billion yen in the process. Komatsu Electronic Metals Co. plans to build up its principle factory in Nagasaki to increase its current monthly output of 30,000-40,000 units to 60,000-70,000 units during the current fiscal year. Mitsubishi Material Silicon Co. also plans to double its current monthly output of 40,000 units to 80,000 units during the current fiscal year. In addition to building up its Ikuno factory (located in Hyogo Prefecture), the company now plans to start manufacturing 8-inch wafers at "Syntech," its U.S. subsidiary. Toshiba Ceramics Co. plans to increase its current monthly output of several thousand units to 10,000 units during the current fiscal year. The company supplies silicon wafers mainly to Toshiba Corporation. In view of a shift to full-fledged production of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, semiconductor makers, such as the NEC Corporation and Hitachi Ltd., plan to use 8-inch wafers since these yield 200 chips, while 6-inch wafers yield only 100 chips.
