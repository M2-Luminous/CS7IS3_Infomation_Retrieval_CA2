FR940602-2-00123 FR940602-2-00079 4. Section 19(b) and rule 19b&hyph;1 provide that, except under limited circumstances, no registered investment company may distribute long-term gains more than once every twelve months. These provisions were designed to remove the temptation to realize capital gains on a frequent and regular basis and to eliminate attempts by investment advisers to time distributions to be advantageous to shareholders. Moreover, there was concern that investors would be confused by a failure to distinguish between regular distributions of capital gains and distributions of investment income. Applicants request an exemption from Rule 19b&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection with the redemption of Fund shares to be distributed to unitholders along with the Trust Series' regular distributions. The requested exemption is consistent with the purposes of section 19(b) and rule 19b&hyph;1 because the dangers of manipulation of capital gains and confusion between capital gains and regular income distributions does not exist in the Trust Series. The Trust Series and their Sponsor have substantially no control over events, other than the selection of the portfolio, which might trigger capital gains ( i.e., the tendering of units for redemption). Moreover, because distributions of capital are clearly indicated in accompanying reports to unitholders as a return of principal, the danger of confusion is not present in the operations of the Trust Series. 5. Section 22(d) generally prohibits a registered investment company from selling its shares except at a current offering price described in the prospectus. Applicants request an exemption from the provisions of section 22(d) to permit the waiver of any otherwise applicable CDSC where: (a) The Sponsor has purchased such shares in connection with the sale of units; (b) the proceeds of zero-coupon obligations upon termination of a Trust Series, and distributions from a Trust Series made during the existence of the Trust Series, ahve been reinvested by a unitholder in additional Fund shares; and (c) a Trust Series at maturity has transferred a unitholder's proportionate number of Fund shares from the Trust Series to the unitholder in lieu of redeeming such shares. Waiver of the sales load will not harm the Funds or remaining shareholders. All Funds whose shares are subject to any sales load will fully disclose the waiver provision in their prospectuses. 6. Section 11(a) makes it unlawful for an registered open-end investment company or principal underwriter for such company to make certain offers of exchange on any basis other than the relative net asset value of the securities to be exchanged, unless the terms of the exchange offer have first been approved by the SEC. Section 11(c) provides that section 11(a) will be applicable to any type of exchange offer involving securities of a registered unit investment trust, irrespective of the basis of exchange. Applicants seek an order pursuant to section 11 (a) and (c) approving the termination option described below. At the termination of the Trust Series, unitholders still holding units at maturity will have the option of either (a) transferring the registration of their proportionate number of Fund shares from the Trust Series to a registration in the investor's name, or (b) receiving a cash distribution. Such unitholders also will have the option of either (a) reinvesting the proceeds of the zero-coupon obligations in additional shares of the Fund (without imposition of the normal sales load), or (b) receiving a cash distribution. The exchange will be made on the basis of the net asset value of the Fund shares. 7. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 make it unlawful for any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of either of them, acting as a principal, to engage in a joint transaction with the investment company unless the joint transaction has been approved by the SEC. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangements are consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and participation by each registered investment company is not on a basis less advantageous than that of other participants. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree to the following as conditions to the granting of the requested order: 1. The Trustee will not redeem Fund shares except to the extent necessary to meet redemptions of units by unitholders, or to pay Trust expenses should distributions and rebated 12b&hyph;1 fees received on Fund shares prove insufficient to cover such expenses. 2. Any rule 12b&hyph;1 fees received by the Sponsor or the underwriters of Fund shares in connection with the distribution of Fund shares to the Trust will be promptly rebated to the Trustee. 3. No one Trust Series will, at the time of any deposit of any Fund shares, hold as a result of that deposit, more than 10% of the then-outstanding shares of a Fund. 4. All Trust Series investing in shares of the same Fund will be structured so that their maturity dates will be at least thirty days apart from one another. 5. Applicants will comply in all respect with the requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3, except that the Trust Series will not restrict their portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.'' 6. Shares of a Fund which are held by a Trust Series will be voted by the Trustee of the Trust, and the Trustee will vote all shares of a Fund held in a Trust Series in the same proportion as all other shares of that Fund not held by the Trust are voted. 7. No sales charge or redemption fee will be imposed on any shares of the Funds deposited in any Trust Series or on any shares acquired by unitholders through reinvestment of dividends or distributions or through reinvestment at termination. 8. Applicants agree to comply with rule 6c&hyph;10 as currently proposed, and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended. 9. The prospectus of each Trust Series and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of a reinvestment option will disclose that unitholders who elect to invest in Fund shares will incur a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
