After almost two years of debate in the community, in the Legislative Council chamber and across the negotiating table, the time has come to decide exactly how we are going to conduct the elections due in the autumn of this year and next. Despite some ungracious language in the columns of one or two of the minority- interest newspapers, the debate has been characterised more by common sense than controversy, more by rational discussion than by rhetoric. Few communities would have conducted such an important debate with such restraint. But I now detect a weariness. A feeling of "OK, we have had the debate, there is nothing more to be said, now let's make up our minds and get on with it". In essence, the Legislative Council will be asked to provide answers to two fundamental questions: -- Should our electoral arrangements be consistent with the Basic Law or should we move immediately to a fully directly elected Legislative Council in 1995? This is the issue at stake with the bill to be proposed by Emily Lau Wai-hing. -- Should the 1994 and 1995 elections be open and fair or should we adopt arrangements which, to put it gently, remove some of the uncertainty from the outcome of the democratic process? This is the issue at stake when the Government's bill and the Liberal Party's amendments are debated. The Government's position on these two fundamental questions is unequivocal, unambiguous and unanything else the conspiracy theorists care to name. It has been suggested that we are somehow conniving to water down our own proposals. But let me make it clear what we have been saying to members of the Legislative Council for months. The Government will go on lobbying and arguing for the proposals contained in its bill and at the end of the debate on Wednesday you will find the three official members of the council leading the voting in favour of the bill. The case for the Government's proposals is compelling. -- Our proposals are consistent with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. No one has been able to point to a single instance in which they offend against either document. On the contrary, independent legal opinion has confirmed that they meet the requirements of both. China would therefore have no reason to change the composition of the legislature in 1997. -- They have received widespread support in the community. I do not think anyone seriously doubts that they provide for free and fair elections and that they would command the confidence of the community. -- They would be workable because we would be able to define electorates, draw up voting registers and conduct the elections efficiently. In contrast, there are serious doubts about the fairness of the arrangements proposed by the Liberal Party. Their practicability has also not been established. -- The Government's proposals have another great advantage. They will allow Hong Kong to move on from the debate about electoral arrangements, while both the Liberal Party amendments and the Emily Lau bill would simply prolong it. -- It is quite simply an illusion to assume that a vote for the Liberal Party amendments is a vote for political harmony and a quiet life until 1997. Almost every directly-elected member of the Legislative Council regards the Government's proposals as the absolute minimum they could accept. Does anyone really expect them to acquiesce in the drastically watered-down version which the Liberal Party wants us to accept? Would passing the Emily Lau bill actually bring the debate to a close? Does the community really want electoral arrangements which are so clearly at odds with the Basic Law? The council's debate this week will be long and complex. Members will have to work their way through the details of the functional constituencies and the election committee. But the details matter: -- Are we to rectify the faults with the existing functional constituencies by expanding their franchises and bringing in a breath of democratic fresh air? Our proposals would raise the electorate in these constituencies from 110,000 to 185,000. -- Can we insulate the nine new functional constituencies against corruption and unfairness right from the start by making them more broadly-based and representative of everyone employed in the major sectors of the economy. [punctuation as published] Our proposals provide for a franchise of up to 2.5 million in the nine new constituencies. -- Is the election committee to be composed of people genuinely elected in Hong Kong and will its internal voting procedures be fair? Our proposals would result in an election committee made up of all of the elected members of the district boards. The single transferable vote system we have devised would ensure that the seats are allocated in proportion to the preferences of the electors. Meanwhile, the Liberal Party's answer to all of these questions is "no". Their amendments would not enhance the credibility of the electoral process. For example, their proposals for the nine new functional constituencies would result in a maximum franchise of only about 120,000. Their proposals are heavily weighted in favour of employers and professionals. They give no recognition to the contribution of the great mass of men and women who make our economy the outstanding success that it is. If the Liberal Party's amendments were passed, the result would be that the great majority of Hong Kong's working population would be represented in only four of the 30 functional constituencies. Some of the new functional constituencies proposed by the Government's opponents seem to have more to do with protecting vested interests than producing fair electoral arrangements. For example, why propose a functional constituency limited to retailers when the closely-related wholesale sector has an equally strong case for inclusion? Why is the Liberal Party proposing a new insurance functional constituency when the insurance industry is already covered in the financial services functional constituency? The Government's opponents' amendments on the election committee display a similar reluctance to accept the community's desire for openness and fairness. They have proposed a first-past-the-post voting arrangement which could result in any political group which could control a mere 50 per cent of the votes winning a full 100 per cent of the seats! The Government's proposals were drawn up after our consultations in Hong Kong made it clear that the community wanted open and fair electoral arrangements and that it wanted these arrangements to be consistent with the Basic Law. That is exactly what the Government's bill would achieve. We shall go on making the case for these proposals because we believe that the people of Hong Kong want and deserve electoral arrangements which offer them a genuine choice. We believe that the integrity of the electoral process matters because Hong Kong needs a credible Legislative Council if the rights and freedoms described in the Joint Declaration are to be preserved. Ultimately, the decision rests with the Legislative Council. That is right and proper. The electoral arrangements are a matter of enacting new laws and it is, after all, the Legislative Council's role to enact our laws. But members will be well aware that they will be making a decision on behalf of the whole community.
