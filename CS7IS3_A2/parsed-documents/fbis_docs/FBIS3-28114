Touching on the resistance from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to the tax plan, the top government spokesman said at a news conference, "if the SDP's stance stays unchanged today, I am afraid the situation will be serious for the ruling coalition." The SDP has threatened to quit the coalition government unless Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa modifies the plant to introduce a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to replace the 3 percent consumption tax. Takemura said the government plan might be revised if such a revision would help win public support for the introduction of the tax. He also expressed hope the government will narrow down differences through dialogue with the SDP, which is the largest contingent in the seven-party coalition. The chief cabinet secretary said the government and the SDP will hold fence-mending talks Thursday, but he declined to comment on the possibility of the government retracting the tax plan outright. The planned 7 percent indirect tax is scheduled to take effect on April 1, 1997. Saying the decision-making process concerning the tax in the face of the SDP's opposition was "unusual," Takemura acknowledged it was not all done in the right manner. Takemura said there is no change in the Thursday evening schedule of the announcement of a 15 trillion yen fresh economic package that includes the large-scale income tax reduction. But a policy-making body of the coalition was forced to put off a Thursday morning meeting to approve the stimulus program due to a boycott by SDP members. As a result, the announcement of the additional economic package appears certain to be delayed from the original schedule.
