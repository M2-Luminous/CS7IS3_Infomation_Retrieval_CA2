G. Ulmanis conveyed to the U.S. President his view of the speech recently delivered by Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev, which showed that the policy of Russia towards the Baltic States had changed. B. Clinton confirmed that the United States has already received an explanation of this speech from Russia -- it says A. Kozyrev was misinterpreted. The President of the United States maintained that during his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, there was no talk of any changes in Russian policy and there was also no previous agreement. B. Clinton stated that there was much talk in Moscow about the Skrunda radar station. According to G. Ulmanis, B. Clinton's proposition is that delegations of both countries continue to negotiate and seek a compromise on a schedule for the operation of the station on the territory of Latvia. President B. Clinton pointed out that the issues of human rights and citizenship are by no means linked with the withdrawal of the Russian Army. In his opinion, the issues of human rights and citizenship will be solved by Latvia, in compliance with CSCE resolutions and recommendations. G. Ulmanis concluded that his conversation with B. Clinton allows him to think that there really is no agreement between the United States and Russia that could contain a threat to the sovereignty of the Latvian state. The President of the United States sent his greetings to Latvia and the Latvian people, and his best wishes for their future activities. G. Ulmanis said that with regard to the recent activities of Russia, he does not foresee any changes for the worse in relations between Latvians and Russians residing on Latvian territory.
