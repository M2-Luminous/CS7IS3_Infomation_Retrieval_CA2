Such are the remarks made by Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government, on the pages of an issue of the VOYENNYY PARAD journal issued here. Viktor Glukhikh, the chairman of the state committee for defense sectors, analyzes the state of Russia's military-industrial sector. He notes, in particular, that the volume of production of arms and military equipment in Russia in 1993 was only 47.8 percent of the 1991 level. Over that period, the production of aircraft and helicopters dropped by a factor of 3.8, armored tank equipment by over four-fifths, ammunition by a factor of 4.5, and military production in the electronics industry by a factor of 5.4. The main reason for the drop in the pace of military production is the lack of financing. At the end of 1993, the state owed the military industry about one trillion rubles for already manufactured products.
