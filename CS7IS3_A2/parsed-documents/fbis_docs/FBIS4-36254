Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports: [Begin recording] [Raz] Secretary of State Christopher has recently become more active with regard to the negotiations between Syria and Israel. There are apparently several reasons for this, including domestic ones. The reports, for example, that Christopher may be asked to vacate his post are also spurring him to make greater efforts. Dennis Ross is not exactly popular in Syria, with the end result being both overt and covert activity by the secretary of state. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin is optimistic. He believes that there is a wide base for promoting the negotiations between Syria and Israel. [Beilin] The United States has been very active with both parties on promoting the Syrian-Israeli track over the past few weeks since the last round of talks, mainly through telephone calls and by using the media. I think that we shall see additional process prior to Christopher's impending visit. Any progress made, as well as any U.S. involvement, will hopefully lead to additional progress because we now have an unprecedented basis for negotiations: a readiness by both Syria and Israel to talk about peace as well as withdrawal on the Golan Heights, together with an acceptance by both sides of U.S. involvement. This is a precedent that definitely should be taken advantage of. [Raz] What can we deduce from the fact that Christopher has decided to handle the negotiations himself for the time being and not appoint an envoy as previously intended? [Beilin] I do not know any details about such an intention. It is true that the idea of a special envoy to the Middle East has been raised on numerous occasions. However, the secretary of state apparently decided to continue handling the negotiations personally and that is certainly important because the more senior the envoy the greater the chances of success. [Raz] Could we witness a breakthrough in the next round of talks? Are contacts behind the scenes creating the basis for such a breakthrough? [Beilin] I hope so, but I do not think that it is any specific round of talks that can lead to a breakthrough. A real breakthrough can only come in the wake of ongoing and deeper U.S. involvement, which comprises more than just visits of senior officials to the region. I think that the secretary of state's decision to make a special trip to the Middle East to deal with the Syrian-Israeli track and not as the aftermath to a visit to Europe or Turkey is symbolic in itself and apparently indicates that the United States will now devote separate time to our issue. [Raz] Christopher, however, still has a great deal of work in store for him. There has been no change in the parties' positions. Nothing has actually happened. Syria has still not issued a reply to the detailed plan submitted by Israel through the Americans. Nevertheless, there is a sense of impending developments in the air. [end recording] [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 8 June in a similar report by political correspondent Udi Segal adds that "officials in Jerusalem hope that the Americans bring new ideas to promote the negotiations and succeed in extracting a few answers from Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad regarding the Israeli proposals. As for Syria's latest demand that Israel abrogate the Golan Law, sources in the prime minister's bureau said that would not be necessary because any agreement reached between the two countries which contravened the Golan Law would have to be approved by the Knesset, thus abrogating the law."]
