Stanczyk recalled Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski's speech in the Sejm in May on Polish foreign policy, in which the minister favoured the fast ratification of the concordat since otherwise "Polish relations with the Holy See would enter a difficult stage." Stanczyk refused to comment on whether the rejection of the concordat by the Sejm would result in the recalling of the Polish ambassador to the Vatican. Asked whether it will be possible to negotiate another concordat if the present one is rejected Stanczyk said that such a possibility exists in legal terms but one cannot be sure if the Holy See would be interested in "repeating the uncertain procedure". According to Stanczak the government is of the opinion that there is no incompatibility between the concordat and the constitution so the motion of the Democratic Left Alliance to postpone the ratification debate until the new constitution is signed is not justified.
