Yang Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese Human Rights Association, said by telephone that he was taken from his home at 3:30 p.m. (0730 GMT) Saturday and released at about 10:30 p.m., adding that fellow activist Bao Ge had also been pulled in. The 50-year-old veteran dissident described his detention as a "warning," saying police had told him to stop his campaigning. Bao's father said his 31-year-old son was taken away by two policemen at 5:15 p.m. (0915 GMT) Saturday as he left his home, adding that he was released at about the same time as Yang. Yang and Bao were last detained on April 9 in a sweep on dissidents as French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur arrived in Shanghai. They were released the following day but kept incommunicado in their flats for several hours until the French delegation left the city. Bao, an ardent campaigner for Japan to pay reparations for atrocities committed in the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese war, has said he wants to form a new human rights organisation dedicated to solving concrete social issues. "We absolutely must be closer to the people," he said recently. Activists have begun reemerging from the shadows in recent months, forming groups again for the first time since Beijing's Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, and publicly demanding more democracy in China as discontent grows over soaring inflation, corruption and other social ills. The continuing detentions are part of tightened security as the government seeks to stamp out such activities in the run-up to the sensitive fifth anniversary on June 4th of the army's violent suppression of Beijing's democracy movement.
