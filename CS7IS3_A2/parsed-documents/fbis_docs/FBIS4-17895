"Although the visit to Russia -- the first since diplomatic relations were set up between the countries in March 1991 -- was most of all one of fact-finding, our delegation leaves Moscow with a full portfolio of specific ideas that we intend to implement in the very near future," the head of Panama's Foreign Ministry emphasized. The most important result of the trip was the signing, after talks, by J.R. Mulino and his Russian colleague Andrey Kozyrev of a declaration on principles for mutual activities and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Panama. The foreign ministers agreed to reorganize the consulates general and embassies of the two countries. In the opinion of J.R. Mulino and A. Kozyrev, this step raises the level of bilateral relations to that of full diplomacy, thereby opening new possibilities for unhampered, mutually advantageous links. Besides his meeting with the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, J.R. Mulino during his three-day visit to Moscow, held talks with the heads of the State Committee for the Management of State Property, the Russian Federal Assembly's Committee on International Affairs, and other Russian ministries and departments. The Panamanian minister also had a meeting at Kredo-Bank with representatives of the capital's financial circles. The cultural program for the Panamanian delegation's stay in Moscow included visiting the Bolshoy Theater and the Moscow Kremlin. In the opinion of the head of the Panamanian Foreign Ministry there is enormous potential for the development of bilateral trade and economic relations. J.R. Mulino is certain that Panama, which possesses one of the biggest free trade zones in the Western hemisphere and a powerful international banking center, could be of inestimable service to Russia in the sphere of mastering financial know-how. In addition, the Panamanian side could assist Russia in setting up (?free trade) zones and insuring their normal functioning, [words indistinct], and also pass on some useful experience regarding the creation of legislation (?to insure the normal) development of the economy. On the other hand, if Russia fulfills its trade and investment potential on the Panamanian market, J.R. Mulino considers, this could make it possible for Russian businessmen to do without the services of European middlemen when buying many goods and products that, in turn, will in the end make the prices finally charged to the consumer for these goods and products more acceptable. The head of the Latin American country's foreign policy department confirmed the intention that he expressed the previous day about organizing a visit to Moscow by a large group of Panamanian bankers and businessmen within the next three months; they would concern themselves with drawing up and implementing concrete trade and economic projects. The Panamanian side expects a similar step by Russia. "Having seen with my own eyes the difficulties that your country is facing in its attempts to overcome the economic crisis, I am still confident that the next few years are very promising for Russia in terms of economic development," the Panamanian minister noted. I sincerely wish Russia success, he stressed at the end of the conversation. It is expected that during his one-day stay in St. Petersburg J.R. Mulino will meet the leadership of the mayor's office in the city on the Neva, as well as representatives of local business circles. After this he will return home.
