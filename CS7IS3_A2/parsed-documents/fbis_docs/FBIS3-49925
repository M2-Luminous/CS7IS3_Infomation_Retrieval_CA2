He was speaking after talks between the Czech and U.S. delegations at Prague Castle tonight. Clinton said that individual admission of new members to NATO was theoretically possible, but stressed that Partnership for Peace was giving individual countries immediate opportunities for military cooperation with NATO. "In the talks, we stressed our will to cooperate with our neighbours, we noted closeness of our and our neighbours' stands, and stressed that we attach great importance to regional cooperation as well," Havel said. He said he was exceptionally pleased by the fact that the President of the United States had visited the Czech Republic and that Prague had been chosen as the place to meet with representatives from neighbouring countries. He said that a number of other topics, including U.S.-Czech economic cooperation were discussed. Clinton thanked for the warm reception in Prague and recalled that he was coming to Prague for the second time in his life, after 24 years, in the same week, but in a very different role. He visited Prague in January 1970 as a student. He said the progress made by the Czech Republic since his first visit had greatly impressed him just as his meeting with Havel and the Czech delegation. Clinton reaffirmed that the security of the Czech Republic and other Central and Eastern European countries was important for the security of the United States, the whole of Europe and the Atlantic Alliance. He said that Partnership for Peace was the beginning of a real security relationship which can lead to fully-fledged NATO membership. Clinton stressed that the economic dimension of security had to be taken into consideration as well. The U.S. delegation also included Secretary of State Warren Christopher, White House Chief Thomas Mc Larty, Presidential National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, the President's special envoys Madeleine Albright and John Shalikashvili, and others. The Czech delegation comprised Premier Vaclav Klaus, Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec, Defence Minister Antonin Baudys, Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, Economics Minister Karel Dyba and others.
