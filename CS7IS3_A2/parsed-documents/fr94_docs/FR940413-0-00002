ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is issuing regulations for employees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch issued by OGE. These supplemental regulations address outside employment by NRC employees and ownership of securities by NRC employees, their spouses, and minor children. The NRC is also repealing its current regulations on those subjects, while adding a cross-reference to the new provisions and preserving certain separable financial interest exemptions. EFFECTIVE DATE: Final rule effective July 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Szabo, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone: 301&hyph;504&hyph;1606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (Standards) for codiication at 5 CFR part 2635. See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57 FR 53583. These Standards, which took effect on February 3, 1993, set uniform ethical conduct standards applicable to all executive branch personnel. 5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes executive agencies, with concurrence from OGE, to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations that are necessary to implement their ethics programs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with OGE's concurrence, has determined that the following supplemental regulations, being codified in new chapter XLVIII of 5 CFR, consisting of part 5801, are necessary for successful implementation of the NRC's ethics program. By this notice, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is also repealing the parts of its regulations which were preserved by 5 CFR part 2635 pending issuance of this supplemental regulation (see the additional OGE grace period extension at 59 FR 4779&hyph;4780). II. Analysis of the Regulations Section 5801.101␣General Section 5801.101 explains that the regulations contained in the final rule apply to all NRC employees, including members of the Commission, and are supplemental to the executive branch-wide standards. Members and employees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also are subject to the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch at 5 CFR part 2635, the executive branch financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, and additional regulations regarding their conduct published by the agency in 10 CFR part 0. Section 5801.102␣Prohibited Securities 5 CFR 2635.403(a) authorizes agencies, by supplemental regulation, to prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding of a financial interest or a class of financial interests by agency employees based on a determination that the acquisition or holding of such interests would cause reasonable persons to question the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered. Where it is necessary to the efficiency of the service, such prohibitions or restrictions may be extended to employees' spouses and minor children.
