Olmert said that with all due respect to the Americans and their amazement over the scope of construction around the city, they must understand that the future of Israel's capital will not be decided by the U.S. State Department. Olmert declared his intention to foil any possibility of Jerusalem becoming the Palestinian capital. This was one of the reasons to increase construction work around the city. "As far as the United States is concerned, the neighborhoods of Gilo, Ramot and Pisgat Ze'ev are not part of Jerusalem, and whoever wants to get along with the Americans has to give up Gilo as well. Of course, this is totally inconceivable," Olmert said. Olmert met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the beginning of the week and presented a plan to pave "the east ring road," which was approved by the local planning board during the previous government's tenure. Olmert wants to expedite the paving of the road. One segment of the road lies outside the city's municipal jurisdiction. According to Olmert, the road will prevent Arabs coming from the north from crossing through Jerusalem on their way to towns situated to its south. In his meeting with Rabin, Olmert asked the prime minister to make sure that the government ministries fulfill their commitments to the Jerusalem Municipality expeditiously. Rabin acceded to the request and promised to instruct the ministers to give Jerusalem priority in their policies.
