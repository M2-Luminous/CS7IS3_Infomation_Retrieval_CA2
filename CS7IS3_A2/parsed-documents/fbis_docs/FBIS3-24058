The impressive building of the oblast party committee, located, as it should be, int he very center of the city, has been sarcastically dubbed the "accordion." Not so much for its architecture as for the "music" that came out of it, music to which the entire Maritime Oblast used to dance. The nickname was kept during the time of the building's next tenant: the oblast soviet. Evidently its "music" too closely resembled the party music. And since last 12 December the famous building became the residence of the new representative authority--on that day Maritime Oblast residents elected their oblast assembly. Whether the ironic legacy will attach itself to the assembly, we won't try to guess. So far, people in Arkhangelsk speak of their parliament without irony. And we also will take a look at it with serious eyes, since such elections lie ahead for other regions of Russia, as well. Mirror of the Russian Provinces Thirty-five deputies were elected to the 41 seats in the Arkhangelsk Oblast Assembly. Elections of six more are to be completed at the end of March. The new deputy corps has provided some idea of what can be expected from province authorities today. First of all, professionalism. The communist patriots' favorite argument about the cook a the helm of state has been totally refuted. All the deputies to the oblast assembly have higher-school diplomas and are between 30 and 60 years of age, which is considered the most productive for work. Fifteen deputies are executives of industrial, construction and agricultural enterprises, eight are from rayon and rural administrations, and the rest are physicians, teachers, lawyers and journalists. Second, the province clearly does not want a revival of Soviet practices. Only nine of the legislators out of 35 were formerly deputies to a soviet. And third, the voters are hoping that their deputies will engage in lawmaking, not political struggle. Maritime Oblast inhabitants have elected to their oblast assembly only those who have not linked themselves unreservedly to any one party or movement. "We don't have any factions," says Nikolay Isakov, chairman of the oblast assembly. "We have come here in order to put the oblast's economy in order, and one's political coloring is unimportant for economic laws. Speaker-Diplomat Nikolay Isakov is 47 years of age. He was born on the Pinega River and is a fellow countryman of the writer Fedor Abramov. And he himself is an exceptional person for the Arkhangelsk backwoods. He was graduated from the Friendship of People's University in Moscow, is a historian and economist by training, and is fluent in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. He worked in Cuba on the staff of an economic adviser. Then he governed Pinezhskiy Rayon as head of the administration. It was through his diligence that a museum was opened in Fedor Abramov's house in the village of Verkola, and that a granite monument was placed on the writer's grave. The rayon chief has accomplished a number of other, perhaps more prosaic, but equally good deeds, for which Pinezhskiy Rayon's inhabitants elected him to the oblast parliament. And when the assembly's deputies were deciding who should be speaker, Nikolay Isakov proved to be without competitors. "There is nothing for us to divide up with the executive authority," Nikolay Isakov believes. "The oblast administration is working hard to enable the producer of goods to operate normally. And we will use the means at our disposal to try to accomplish the same objective. Saving jobs in remote areas means saving the people who live there. But where are the muzhiks in a forest village to go if their only timber station closes. And what will they feed their children?" An interesting note: the "accordion" has its own cafeteria, but the speaker has made a habit of dining in the oblast administration building, with the governor. According to Nikolay Isakov, it is better to go over common problems in an informal atmosphere. Not a Word About Privileges Of the 41 deputies to the oblast assembly, 16 may work on a permanent basis. But only three professionals have joined the speaker and two deputy speakers. The rest of the deputies have not quit their jobs. The deputies meet in Arkhangelsk only once a month--for a session that lasts five days. The oblast assembly began its work at the same time as the State Duma. But while their colleagues in Moscow were arguing over what privileges to establish for themselves, the Arkhangelsk legislators were concerned with the socioeconomic state of the oblast, its budget, local tax rates and the structure of local government. None of the deputies said a word about privileges for themselves. "It's disgraceful, to stuff one's own pockets at the expense of the impoverished people," Nikolay Isakov says. The Arkhangelsk parliament lives modestly. Only the chairman has an official car. The deputies are reimbursed for their hotel and travel to sessions. They also have the free use of city transportation, except for taxis, of course. The oblast assembly's staff is half the size of the deputy corps. Those who work on a permanent basis receive salaries: the speaker's is equal to the governor's, his deputies get the same as the vice-governor, the chairman of a standing commission gets the same as the director of an administration, and so forth. "Sensible deputies have been elected," says Governor Pavel Balakshin. "This is no longer the same thing as the former oblast soviet, which contrived to govern everything. I express my own position at sessions of the oblast assembly, and even if it differs from the deputies', we find agreement." Nonetheless, I am wary of drawing the conclusion that the elections of local parliaments that are slated for the end of March in many regions of Russia will bring long-awaited political peace as has been the case in Arkhangelsk. Practically everywhere, heads and deputy heads of administrations of various levels are running for deputies. Seven of such "dual job holders" have gotten onto the Arkhangelsk Oblast Assembly. However, it is not out of the question that the dual job holders will take the majority in the parliaments of other oblasts, and that the representative branch will be suppressed by the executive branch. Consequently, autocratic regimes may be established on part of Russian territory. Our country has many faces, and there is no doubt that the regions' bodies of representative authority should be in accord with their historical traditions. But at the same time, there is a need for a federal law on the general principles of local authority that would guarantee the indivisibility of Russia. And it makes good sense that the March elections in the regions should be postponed until the time when the State Duma adopts such a law.
