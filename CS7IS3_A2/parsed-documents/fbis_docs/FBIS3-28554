The 250-man Army engineering unit named Sangnoksu (Evergreen) was to fulfill one year of service to July, but pushed up the withdrawal date due to an early pullout by Western countries, the ministry said. The decision was also prompted by a request from the Unosom Command post to relocate the South Korean unit, it said. South Korea had dispatched the Army engineering unit in its first participation in a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The unit was responsible for road construction linking major cities in Somalia. The U.N. Security Council decided last Friday to have the peacekeeping unit return to such traditional duties as overseeing humanitarian aid while diminishing the scale of stationed troops. The United States announced last October its PKO troopers would leave Somalia by March 31 this year. Italy, which has been in charge of security in the area where the South Korean unit was stationed, also decided to withdraw by the same date.
