[TEPC], the Kansai Electric Power Co. [KEPC], and other power companies will decrease the "tokumei hatchu" [special designation ordering] system and increase opportunities for adopting a competitive bidding system. Under the "tokumei hatchu" system, an electric company asks only one company to make an estimate for procuring materials or ordering works. Various electric companies intend to increase the ratio of using competitive bidding to 50 percent from the current 30-40 percent. They have decided to do so to deal with growing demands from foreign countries that transparency be promoted in biddings for public works and government procurement of materials. By promoting competition in ordering works, electric power companies also intend to try to reduce costs and control electric charges. Most of plant and equipment investment by the electric power industry -- which accounts for nearly 10 percent of the private sector's plant and equipment investment, or 5 trillion yen annually -- will be a subject for the current review of the ordering system. For this reason, it is likely that this will widely affect such industries as the electric equipment and construction industries. Electric power companies have adopted two methods of procuring materials: the "tokumei hatchu" and the designated competitive bidding systems. Under the latter system, several companies, which attain a certain level of technology and quality control abilities, compete in the electric power industry's procurement of materials. Since the ratio of competitive biddings is small, people both inside and outside the electric power industry have begun to express the following critical views: "Companies which employ those who once worked at electric power companies are being favorably treated" and "the ground for selecting designated companies lacks transparency." TEPC intends to begin reviewing the ordering system and increase the ratio of adopting competitive bidding to 50 percent during fiscal year 1994. KEPC also intends to attain the 50-percent target by the end of the next fiscal year. The Hokkaido Electric Power Co., Inc. will try to increase the competitive bidding ratio to 50 percent from the current 30 percent as soon as possible. Chubu Electric Power Co. [CEPC] is expected to attain the 50-percent target by the end of fiscal year 1993. Because some materials related to electric power plants are jointly developed by electric power companies and makers and highly advanced technology is necessary to develop such materials, "it is difficult to drastically increase the percentage of the designated competitive bidding system to largely exceed 50 percent (as stated by CEPC). However, electric power companies have judged that it is possible to adopt the designated competitive bidding system in procuring power-transmission wires, pylons, general power transformers and distributors, communications equipment for business contacts, and other materials. Meanwhile, with regard to ordering works, KEPC has begun studying an idea of introducing the general designated competitive bidding system, which does not limit companies from bidding. As far as KEPC is concerned, the designated competitive bidding presently accounts for 60 percent of its orders for works and the "tokumei hatchu" system accounts for 40 percent. Because strict qualifications are necessary for receiving electric power-related works, the company, at first, intends to introduce the general competitive bidding system to ordinary engineering and construction works.
