With the economic recovery in the United States, truck demand is rapidly increasing and since orders are too much to handle just with the existing U.S. plants, they will establish another plant exclusively for this mechanism. They will invest about 1 billion yen and begin production in 1995. After two years, the production of truck steering wheel mechanisms in the United States will increase to 3 billion yen, double that of today. In order to raise production capability quickly, "We will purchase a new or used ready-built plant for the new plant" (President Michihiko Yamabe). The Michigan or southern U.S. areas are favored for the location, and matters are scheduled to be decided by summer. They will make use of leasing for introduction of equipment and start with 200 or 300 employees. Fuji Kiko purchased the U.S. auto parts manufacturer Douglas Autotech (Michigan) in 1991, and has come to use the Douglas plant as the production base for steering wheel mechanisms in the United States. This new plant is also scheduled to be opened via its Douglas subsidiary. The item produced is a steering wheel mechanism where the wheel height and angle can be changed manually. It is a product that has over a 50-percent share in the U.S. large truck market where carrying capacity exceeds 30 tons. Besides delivery to the major U.S. truck manufacturers, Navistar and John Deere, they also are studying supply to local Japanese manufacturers and export to Japan. Along with the opening of the new plant, they will also increase production of steering wheel mechanisms for passenger cars that are being produced in the Douglas plant. They say that "We have also decided to supply U.S. Ford Motor recreational vehicles (RV), with whom we have not previously done business" (President Yamabe). Fuji Kiko sales for the March 1993 quarter were 56.4 billion yen, and business with the Nissan group such as Nissan Motor, Nissan Diesel, and Nissan Body exceeds 80 percent. Since Nissan sales have been sluggish, however, they have been pressed to open up new markets.
