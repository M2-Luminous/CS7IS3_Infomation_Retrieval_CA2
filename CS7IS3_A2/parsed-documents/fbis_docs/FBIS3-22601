Janet Gribb reports that two men have been diagnosed positive for HIV-2, which is so far associated with people from West Africa and their sexual contacts: [Begin Gribb recording] These two new cases bring to three the number of HIV-2 cases reported in Australia. This strain of the virus attacks the immune system in the same way, but appears to progress more slowly towards AIDS. The latest issue of the AUSTRALIAN HIV SURVEILLANCE REPORT said the two men diagnosed were in a relationship and the second man appeared to have contracted HIV-2 from his partner, who may have acquired the infection as long ago as mid-seventies. Dr. Nick Crofts of the McFarlane Burnett Center for Medical Research says the two cases are interesting in that so far no links with West Africa have been established. He says the general public need not be concerned about the new cases, as all Australian blood products are tested for both strains of HIV. [end recording] The Victorian AIDS Council says there is no need for any change in public health policy on AIDS and people should not be alarmed in the wake of the discovery. AIDS Council President Michael Bartoff said there are lots of similarities between the two AIDS strains: [Begin Bartoff recording] In some ways there are not all that many implications. HIV-2 is pretty similar to HIV-1 -- it is transmitted in exactly the same way, its effects are pretty much exactly the same -- but in public health terms, in terms of the sort of prevention of transmission, it is really exactly the same as the HIV-1, and I think it is something that has also been well anticipated.
