FR941026-0-00024 FR941026-0-00008 This Amendment is an intermediate step before the April 6, 1994, interim final rule is reissued as a final rule. •What is an Economic Development Conveyance (EDC)? An EDC is a new process for transferring real property to a Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) to help spur local economic development and job creation. An EDC may be with or without initial payment or with only partial payment at time of transfer, may be at or below the estimated fair market value of the property, and allows for negotiated terms and conditions of payment (consideration) to the Department of Defense. These negotiations must be fair and reasonable to both parties and strike a balance between compensation to the Federal taxpayer and the need for the EDC to spur redevelopment. The EDC offers LRAs an additional tool to use in the acquisition of former military base property. •When should an EDC be used? The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA) of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484) and airport public benefit authorities (49 U.S.C. 47151&hyph;47153) allow for public benefit transfers to units of government or non-profit institutions that maintain the use of property for a public purpose including, but not limited to, parks, public health, education, aviation, historic monuments, and prisons. Transfers of property under public benefit transfers must be in accordance with the sponsoring Federal agency regulations. The FPASA also allows for negotiated sales at fair market value to public entities for public purposes or direct sales through a public bid process. The EDC should be used when the LRA wants to obtain property for job generating purposes and it is not practicable to pay fair market value at the time of transfer. However, the EDC is not intended to supplant other Federal property disposal authorities and cannot be used if the intended land use can be accomplished through another authority unless unusual circumstances are presented that demonstrate that the needed economic development and job generation cannot occur under the other allowable federal transfer authority.
