This afternoon, the leaders of the two delegations held a news conference. I would like to mention that this is the first news conference since the beginning of negotiations between the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation on the issue of the 14th Army's withdrawal. Summing up the results of this eighth round of negotiations, the leaders of the delegations, that is, Ambassadors Anatol Taranu and Vladimir Kitayev noted the importance of continuing negotiations and emphasized the constructive attitude of both sides toward finding optimal solutions regarding the terms of the 14th Army's withdrawal. The sides appreciated the presence in the negotiations of the representatives of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic as a favorable element. The leaders of the two delegations announced that they have initialed the draft accords on granting judicial assistance on issues connected with the temporary stationing of the 14th Army on the territory of the Republic of Moldova as well as on granting social guarantees and pensions to former soldiers and members of their families. Military experts signed a document drafted jointly on technical requirements for the withdrawal of the 14th Army and on the issue regarding the transportation of the military property of the Russian Federation from Moldova. Unfortunately, the sides could not overcome disagreements regarding the terms for the withdrawal of the 14th Army. The sides presented new variations to Article No. 2 of the basic accord, which includes the withdrawal of the 14th Army and agreed to continue discussions on this issue during the ninth round of negotiations to be held in mid-May in Moscow. In connection with the presence of the CSCE observers in these negotiations, Ambassador Vladimir Kitayev declared that Russia respects the activities of this international body, but since it has not been specified how the negotiations should be followed, the Russian side considers it reasonable to inform the CSCE at the end of each round of negotiations. Ambassador Anatol Taranu stressed that on this issue the Republic of Moldova continues as before to express the opinion that the presence of the CSCE observers in the negotiation would make a constructive contribution to the unfolding of the respective negotiations. Regarding the synchronization of the withdrawal of the 14th Army with the granting of a special legal status to Dniester, the Russian side continued to support this idea. The leader of the Moldovan delegation, however, expressed the view that if this condition were accepted, the negotiations would virtually have not made one single step forward. Therefore, it would be reasonable to reactivate the previous four-party mechanism to solve this problem.
