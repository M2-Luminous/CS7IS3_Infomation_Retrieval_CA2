FBIS3-1334 "drafr058_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-058 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Botha Provides Evidence of ANC Communist Influence MB2403201694 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1939 GMT 24 Mar 94 MB2403201694 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Statement by Foreign Minister Pik Botha; place and date not given; later issued by the NP Federal Council on the SAPA PR Wire Service] [Text] At a National Party [NP] press conference in Pretoria today Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha said: On 24 January the SACP [South African Communist Party] published a list of 34 members on the ANC [African National Congress] candidates list. The SACP acknowledged that its members made up an "embarrassing" 16 of the top 50 on the ANC list. SACP member Jeremy Cronin challenged the NP to produce proof of any other members on the ANC list. Today the NP is doing exactly that. We attach documentary evidence drawn from public sources to disprove the SACP's figures. We say that the SACP is systematically deceiving the South African people by concealing the extent of its influence in the ANC. An examination of the top 50 ANC candidates reveals that 25, not 16, are current SACP members. A further 3 are former SACP members. This means that a total of 28 out of the top 50 ANC candidates are current and former SACP members. It is absolutely extraordinary that the SACP, which as a political party in its own right only obtains 1 percent support in opinion polls, should be given the majority of places in the ANC's top 50. This is truly a case of the ANC horse being ridden by the SACP jockey. Or a wolf in sheep's clothing. The questions for the SACP to answer are: Why, when they held their press conference, did they lie to the media and the public about the number of SACP members on the ANC list? Why did the SACP conceal the identities of the following party members who are in the ANC top 50? (ANC list number in brackets): Steve Tshwete (12), Dullah Omar (15), Gertrude Shope (22), Mohammed Valli Moosa (26), Peter Mokaba (27), Aziz Pahad (37), Penuell Maduna (38), Alfred Nzo (44), and Gill Marcus (47). The SACP on 24 January declared that Ahmed Kathrada (7) and Marc Maharaj (17) no longer belonged to the party. Why did the SACP omit to mention that Thabo Mbeki (3) was in the same category? Furthermore, there is doubt over whether Mr Kathrada has really left the party. As recently as 7 January 1994, he was named by fellow SACP member Essop Pahad (29) as one of 15 SACP members on the ANC National Executive Committee. The ANC and the SACP have continued to lie about the extent of SACP influence in the ANC. On 23 February, Thabo Mbeki was reported as telling a Johannesburg breakfast meeting that "no aspect of the ANC could be described as communist". On 13 March, during the Top Level TV programme on communists in the ANC, Mr Joe Slovo said of SACP members "we know there are 26 on the list". Mr Slovo should have known better. After all, he is the SACP chairman. His figure was 8 members less than the SACP itself admitted in its deception of 24 January. Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the minority of non communists in the ANC top 50, remains silent on this highly embarrassing issue. Interviewed on Britain's Channel 4 TV news on 24 January, Mr Mandela said, "I think as far as the question of the Communist Party is concerned, that's a non issue as far as we are concerned. We are not even prepared to discuss it". The ANC and the SACP have also remained silent about the non elected communists they intend to bring in to the administration after the April election. THE WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN (11-17 February) named several members of the ANC's civil service unit pilot group expected to become senior Pretoria officials. These included Josiah Jele (also 138 on the ANC candidates list); Sindiso Mfenyane; Sipho Makana (former ANC chief of mission in Moscow); Anthony Mungalo (former ANC chief of mission in East Berlin); and Stanley Mabizela. All are SACP members. THE SUNDAY TIMES (13 March) led its business news section with the headline, "ANC's Fiery Turok To Run PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Economy". Mr Turok who the ANC plans to be in charge of its Reconstruction and Development Programme in the PWV, is a former member of the SACP. There can be little doubt in the minds of any objective person that the communists play a dominant role in the ANC, and would play a dominant role in ANC government posts and policy formulation. This is why the communists are trying to reassure the business community and international opinion by pretending that their policies are not those which brought economic and political disaster to every other country which practised them. But if the SACP try to deceive people about their real numbers in the ANC, they will try even harder to deceive people about their real policy intentions.
