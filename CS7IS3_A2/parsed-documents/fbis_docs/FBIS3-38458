As an opposition force, this is their prerogative. But right-wing politicians have been either acerbic -- those who belong to the RPR [Rally for the Republic] -- or gently mocking -- those who belong to the UDF [Union for French Democracy]. The right therefore has been failing to do its job, which is to support the government. In fact, reactions to the measures announced on Sunday 30 January by Edouard Balladur after a government "seminar" can all be summed up with a single word: disappointment. Disappointment with the feeble steps taken to bolster economic growth. Disappointment with the few, unimaginative job creation incentives. Disappointment with the postponement of the tough but crucial decisions needed to save the French health insurance system. For a large part, of course, such lack of support from the prime minister's own side can be traced to strictly political motives; however, he also has his own behavior to blame. In an attempt to cast into oblivion his retreat -- that is, his failure -- on the revision of the Falloux Act, Mr. Balladur had insisted that it would not steer him away from reform and that he would prove his point on the occasion of the government seminar, which was meant to act on the French people's main concern (jobs) and the most delicate issue of all, which has plagued governments for a long time (social security). The goals were so ambitious that achieving them was never going to be easy. The prime minister failed simply because the way he trained his horse was not likely to let him overcome this particular hurdle. Owing to his carefully constructed image of a quiet administrator, Mr. Balladur could not afford to look like he was putting out a "new plan" that contradicted the policy he has been conducting since he came into office. Hence the difficulty of introducing real consumption-boosting measures since during the past 10 months he has steadily ruled out demand-driven recovery measures, preferring instead supply-driven ones. Having chosen tight control of public expenditures as his first article of faith, he cannot introduce excessively costly proposals. Furthermore, the "Balladur method" was bound to complicate matters. The bitter Falloux affair strengthened the prime minister in his resolve to eschew anything likely to anger the population. Like Michel Rocard when he was prime minister -- could this stem from the fact that, as for Mr. Rocard, his prime ministership is meant to be a springboard for his presidential ambitions? -- Mr. Balladur believes no reform is possible without it being accepted by a majority of the French population. Hence, although he denies it, the extreme attention he has been paying to opinion polls -- again, just like Mr. Rocard. Clash of Ambitions This concern explains Balladur's insisting on Sunday that "consultations" on all sensitive issues will be held; however, it also let him postpone measures on social security which he knew were bound to irritate the medical lobby, so influent within his majority. This is also a letdown -- no matter what he said in his Sunday press conference -- since in his general policy statement of 8 April he had already announced a five-year law meant to bring "sustainable balance" to the health insurance system. All this explains why a number of tangible measures developed in various ministries were rejected in the final round of decisions. Above all, it explains the feeling of disappointment: Expectations had been brought to fever pitch by the very attitude of the head of government, his ministers, and their staff. This is a chance Edouard Balladur's rivals were not about to miss. In the UDF, those who, like Charles Millon, have not been "Balladurized" saw it as an opportunity to toot their own horn, in order to let their views and existence be felt. Even Raymond Barre said he favored another direction, although he reserved judgment on the actual measures and approved many aspects of the government's policy. At the RPR, those who remain loyal to Jacques Chirac will not approve the initiatives of a man with whom their "boss" has been feuding almost openly, and when one -- like Jean-Louis Debre -- is asked for his views on the matter, he hastens to point out the shortcomings of the government's plan and to call for "another policy." Such is the clash of ambitions between the Paris Mayor [Jacques Chirac] and the prime minister that as long as he does not have to, the former will give the latter no support which would tie his hand for the future. These reactions to the measures announced on Sunday are a confirmation, for the prime minister, that 15 months before the presidential election, he can now only count on himself and on those who have bound their fate with his own. Of course, that is still a lot of people.
