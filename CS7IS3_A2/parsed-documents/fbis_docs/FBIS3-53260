The Political Forces Dialogue Committee had earlier set 10 January 1994 as the deadline for completing the dialogue document, which must enshrine the bases for building the state and addressing the problems plaguing the homeland and its citizens, and which must also be used as a guide to defuse the ongoing crisis. The concern to reconcile the views of all participants made it impossible to reach agreement on this document on time. This prompted some forces taking part in the dialogue to say that they would not proceed with the dialogue unless the committee issues a statement, explaining the reasons and setting another deadline for completion of the document. The Dialogue Committee favorably viewed a host of proposals submitted by the opposition bloc. Hence, the Dialogue Committee regrets the delay, which was not under the participants' control, and announces that 18 January 1994 shall be the last deadline for agreement on the draft document in preparation for its endorsement by the concerned parties. The political forces engaged in the dialogue pledge to our people's masses to do their utmost to complete the agreement document. It is God whose satisfaction and guidance we pray for.
