No, they are not the problems. The last thing we need is for someone engaged in politics to have to worry about Miglio. The problem is [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, who is now returning to his job selling detergent. It is he who is behind it all. It is he who, lacking any ideals, is trying to acquire other people's." This was the old [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi talking, with great frankness when necessary. But this time, after his usual "appeals against Berlusconism," he was cautious and reasonable too, at a time when it is necessary to define the Northern League's course for the coming months. [Da Rold] Mr. Bossi, you talk about a situation in flux. When will a balance be reached? [Bossi] In two years, at the next general election. [Da Rold] What? Another general election? [Bossi] No, take this down carefully: A balance will be reached in two years, or at the next general election. I will not jeopardize the country's governability. At present governability is a common asset, an asset demanded by the people. In connection with certain legislation, certain issues, we will play our part to the full; we are not accustomed to betraying the voters. But we will not jeopardize the country's governability. [Bossi ends] Bossi did not say so explicitly, but he made it very clear: a two-year truce for the Berlusconi government, partly an "armed" truce, with sharp distinctions between the League and the other government forces, and the possibility that other majorities could take shape in Parliament over certain legislation. [Da Rold] Pardon me, Mr. Bossi, you emphasize governability, but at the same time you are not avoiding causes of conflict. A "Tiziana Parenti case" is emerging over the Mafia Committee, and you are recommending Pino Arlacchi, that is, the opposition candidate. The other day in Da Rold Parenti called you dishonest and a destabilizer. [Bossi] She talks virtually like Miglio. She is like Miglio. I am mistrustful of magistrates who engage in politics; I have a preconceived suspicion in their regard. Be that as it may, let us not turn this into a personal issue. I am simply saying that it is right that the minority be granted the chairmanships of some of the committees. Yes, of course, we have a first-past-the-post system. Some people say that we should take everything. But it is wrong to believe that everything in this country can change all at once. And just consider what the opposition is doing. It is just as well that we have the Interior Ministry. [Da Rold] Is it not the case, rather, that you are trying to flirt with [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto and the Left? [Bossi] No, there is absolutely no flirting. What I am saying is that we must beware of the problems that could emerge in the streets. In other words, if anyone wants to be stubborn about that committee, then let them. We will play our part, then we shall see, and the country will judge who is more democratic or not. [Da Rold] But all this means that in certain instances -- such as this business of the Mafia Committee -- different majorities could take shape. [Bossi] Other majorities. In connection with certain bills, I will defer to nobody. In other words, there are some things that are part of the country's assets. For instance, privatization, antitrust legislation, federalism, and institutional reforms. I repeat: We are not accustomed to betraying people. We conducted our election campaign on those points, and we will play our part on those points. This, without jeopardizing the country's governability, but saying what we believe. Then the country will judge. [Bossi ends] This seems like Bossi's old "stop-go" policy. He is obliged to govern with Berlusconi, but at the same time to distinguish himself from the great television charmer. [Da Rold] Pardon me, Mr. Bossi. Now President Scalfaro is challenging anyone to prove that the Sisde funds were misspent. But those funds did exist.... [Bossi] I do not want to talk about this business. Why should I too start demolishing everything? In these two years there will be some major reforms to carry out. And maybe it will occur to some people to set presidentialism against federalism. Maybe some people want to change the electoral law. Everyone knows on which side I will fight. [Da Rold] But is there not an immediate issue concerning Mr. Scalfaro? [Bossi] Why should I demolish everything? It is possible to talk to Scalfaro. In the meantime let him remain there, irrespective of what emerges in his regard. [Da Rold] These two years will be truly decisive. [Bossi] The transition from the First Republic to the Second has not taken place yet. It will take place when the Constitution is changed. The reforms must be carried out in these two years. Now the League has established itself and will fight for the new; the battle starts now. Previously we avoided this battle; we were in difficulties, on steep paths. Now we are on flat ground. [Da Rold] The League too has its problems. Let me remind you again of Miglio and Castellazzi. [Bossi] They are like the blind leading the blind. And, like in the parable, they will both fall down -- on the Right. [Da Rold] How would you describe the League at present? [Bossi] As a force of struggle and government. Not as Berlinguer did with the PCI [Italian Communist Party], because he was not part of the government, but only of the patronage system. [Da Rold] What about the Berlusconi government hitherto? [Bossi] A few things, some of them good, albeit obviously only aspirins. I protest only at the fact that there was no support for Slovenia's entry into Europe.
