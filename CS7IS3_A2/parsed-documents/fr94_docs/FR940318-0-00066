FR940318-0-00066 FR940318-0-00013 D. Safe Harbors In response to commentators' requests, the final regulations provide several safe harbors. The safe harbors apply to (i) typical contracts to acquire stock that are closed on a change date within one year after they are entered into, (ii) options that are part of security arrangements in typical lending transactions, (iii) certain compensatory options, (iv) certain options exercisable only upon death, disability, mental incompetency, or retirement, and (v) certain rights of first refusal. In addition, the final regulations authorize the IRS to promulgate additional safe harbors by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. An option to which a safe harbor applies is generally not subject to the ownership, control, or income test. A contract to acquire stock, however, is not exempted from the income test regardless of whether it is described in the safe harbor applicable to contracts. E. Treatment of Options Related to Certain Bankruptcy Reorganizations Section 382(l)(5) provides rules that apply to ownership changes that occur while the loss corporation is under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case. A loss corporation that qualifies for these special rules can use its pre-change losses, after certain reductions, without regard to the annual limitation provided in section 382. Section 1.382&hyph;9(o) of the regulations provides that the option attribution rules of the temporary regulations do not apply to certain options that arise as part of a plan of reorganization in a title 11 or similar case until the time that the plan becomes effective. This rule clarifies the timing of any ownership change that results from the plan. This Treasury decision amends ยง1.382&hyph;9(o) to provide that neither the option attribution rules of the temporary regulations nor the new rules of the final regulations apply prior to the time the plan becomes effective. In general, the new option rules of the final regulations apply to determine whether an ownership change occurs at the time the plan becomes effective. As explained in Part F, below, however, a loss corporation that is subject to a title 11 or similar case filed on or before May 17, 1994 may elect to apply the option attribution rules of the temporary regulations up to the time that the plan of reorganization becomes effective. Section 1.382&hyph;9(e) of the regulations provides rules regarding the treatment of options for purposes of determining eligibility for the special rules of section 382(l)(5). The preamble of the proposed regulations requested comments on the desirability of changes to the rules of ยง1.382&hyph;9(e) in light of the option rules of the proposed regulations. The IRS and the Treasury Department are considering the comments received in response to this request. F. Effective Date The option rules of the proposed regulations were proposed to apply on any testing date on or after November 5, 1992. Many commentators asked that taxpayers be allowed to apply the new option rules retroactively. These commentators observed that many of the options that were treated as exercised under the temporary regulations (and thus resulted in ownership changes) would not be treated as exercised under the rules of the proposed regulations. Thus, if the same options had been issued after the effective date of the proposed regulations, they would not necessarily have caused an ownership change. The commentators argued that the application of the section 382 limitation should not depend on the timing of the issuance of certain options. The IRS and the Treasury Department have declined to allow taxpayers to apply the new option rules retroactively because the results of retroactive application of these rules would be inappropriate. The results would be largely the same as if no option attribution rules had been in effect prior to November 5, 1992, except cases in which attribution favored the taxpayer. A taxpayer could argue that the options in question could not have had an abusive principal purpose because the temporary regulations treated an option as exercised whenever an ownership change would result. Accordingly, a taxpayer who had an ownership change under the prior rules could reverse the ownership change by electing to apply the new rules retroactively_an election the taxpayer would presumably make unless, in retrospect, the application of the temporary regulations had proved to be favorable. In light of the foregoing, the final regulations retain the general effective date of the proposed regulations; the option rules of the final regulations generally apply on testing dates on or after November 5, 1992.
