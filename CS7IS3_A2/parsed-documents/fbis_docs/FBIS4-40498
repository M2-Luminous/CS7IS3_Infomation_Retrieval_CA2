These articles are clearly written by a foreign author. We know that he who pays the piper calls the tune. It would be possible not to pay attention to this were it not for the fact that hidden behind these published materials, which in a number of instances bear the nature of personal attacks against the Russian ambassador to Armenia, are the coordinated actions of certain forces that are pursuing the objective of slandering the foreign policy of Russia with respect to countries of the near abroad. Clearly it is no accident that the appearance of such articles coincides time-wise with the shift beginning to be seen in the Karabakh settlement, achieved to a great extent thanks to the active peacemaking efforts of Russia and the interparliamentary assembly of the CIS. Russia does not dictate its will to the sovereign republics of the former USSR, does not interfere in their internal affairs, does not seek any advantage from the difficulties they have to endure, and does not impose on its friends. Such policy is alien to Russia. Russia is interested in peace and stability along its borders and in the regions adjacent to it, so as to give its undivided attention to accomplishing its own internal political, economic, and other tasks. There can be no doubt but that all the attempts of enemies and those pretending to be Russia's friends to impede the development of Russian-Armenian relations, which are on the rise, and to sow seeds of mistrust between Armenia and Russia are doomed to failure.
