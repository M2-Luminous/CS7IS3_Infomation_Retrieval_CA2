FBIS4-27115 "dreas104_c_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 North Korea Remarks by U.S. `Hardline' Faction Denounced Remarks by U.S. `Hardline' Faction Denounced SK2805142594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 28 May 94 SK2805142594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 28 May 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by station commentator Kim Ho-sam: "Dangerous Military Moves"] [Text] According to the recent issue of the British weekly magazine specializing in military affairs, JANE'S DEFENCE WEEKLY, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry handed out a directive to the U.S. aircraft carrier, Independence, to assume an alert posture in the area from which it can reach the Korean peninsula within a week. Reporting this, the paper wrote that this step is designed to promptly cope with the crisis if it emerges on the Korean peninsula. Such a report by the British paper specializing in military affairs is not an accident at all. As has been known, the hardline conservative faction in the U.S. Congress and Government, and impure forces who collaborated with international reactionaries recently made intolerable, violent, and bellicose remarks one after another on the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue. Concerning the replacement of nuclear fuel rods in our experimental nuclear power station, the U.S. hardline conservative faction raved that we should suspend the replacement, the International Atomic Energy Agency should choose fuel rods and keep them separately, and so forth. Thus, it raised a unreasonable [ichie matti annun] demand. As we refused this demand, U.S. Senator McCain on 24 May made violent remarks at the Senate that North Korean nuclear facilities should be air raided or attacked with cruise missiles. Moreover, U.S. Vice President Gore, stating that continuously holding talks with North Korea is dangerous, said that so-called security steps taken by the United States for South Korea are all wise. The wise steps he referred to mean the Patriot missiles and Apache offensive helicopters that were deployed in South Korea some time ago. At a time when the U.S. hardline conservative faction openly calls for attacking the experimental nuclear power station in our country, the U.S. defense secretary is attempting to launch and put a mobilization posture on the carrier Independence in the area close to the Korean peninsula. This illustrates that the United States has not discarded at all the ambition to crush [apsal] the popular mass-centered socialist system of our own style by means of force and by mobilizing all of its Navy and Air Force on the pretext of our nuclear problem. As has been known, the carrier Independence is an ultra-large carrier based in Yokosuka, Japan after replacing the Midway some time ago. This carrier has experience in directly participating in landing exercises on the sea off Pohang when the Team Spirit joint military exercise was staged in 1991. The United States is planning to deploy this ultra-large carrier in the sea close to the Korean peninsula. This proves that the U.S. bellicose circles are going to launch a surprise attack on our Republic at a certain time [ku onuttaee kasonun] on the pretext of so-called nuclear development in collusion with Japanese Self- Defense Force troops that are concentrated in western Japan facing the Korean peninsula. What we should not overlook in particular is that the directive of the U.S. defense secretary is to be executed during the period of Rimpac training which continues from the end of May until mid-July. As was already reported, during the period of Rimpac training, the United States will organize a joint fleet with the Japanese naval self-defense force and the South Korean puppet navy for the first time since this military training started in 1970, and will carry out joint operations with them. Concerning the plan of U.S. Navy, the Japanese naval self-defense force, and the puppet South Korean navy to organize a joint fleet and to stage the Rimpac training, the director-general of the Japanese Defense Agency openly stated that this plan will serve as a political message against the North Korean nuclear plan. This clearly shows that this joint fleet is aiming at our Republic. The fact that under this situation, the carrier Independence will move to an area close to the Korean peninsula and be placed on alert status shows that the tripartite military alliance system between the United States, Japan, and South Korea is actually in motion. Because of such policy for crushing the DPRK by the United States, a very dangerous situation is prevailing on the Korean peninsula. This arouses deep concern among the peaceloving people of the world. The people of the world wish that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiations. However, the U.S. hardline conservative faction is continuously scheming to carry out adventurous military action. However, this is not beneficial to the United States itself, nor will this situation advance as the United States wants [kurona kugosun miguk chacherul wihaesodo iropchi mottamyo, ttohan migugui uidodoeronun kyolko toeji annul kosimnida]. The U.S. policy for crushing the DPRK is very harmful from the standpoint of not only U.S. interests but also of peace and security of Northeast Asia. The U.S. attempt to crush us by means of force is a great mistake. We are prepared for war and for negotiations. The United States should not adhere to adventurous military action, but had better act with discretion.
