The outspoken politician predicts in his book "The New Conservative Revolution" that the country's political forces will divide into two in the future -- one that places priority on the public interest and one that is at the mercy of public opinion. Demanding that the coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa be dissolved, Watanabe urges "public interest" political forces to unite against others which he claims merely go along with the current of the times. Watanabe criticizes the Hosokawa coalition of seven parties ranging from conservatives to reformists, saying, "parties with different basic ideas cannot do anything." He proposes realigning the LDP and four coalition parties -- Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New Party (JNP) of Hosokawa, and the new party Sakigake -- into two conservative groups. Watanabe, who was both deputy premier and foreign minister under the government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa from 1991 to 1993, also sanctioned dissolving the LDP to help create "the two conservative forces." Shinseito and Sakigake are mainly made up of LDP defectors. Shinseito and the Buddhist-backed Komeito are also seeking to establish a two-party system of the LDP and a new rival party to be made up of non-LDP forces, including Shinseito and Komeito. Hosokawa, whose coalition was inaugurated last August when the LDP lost its 38-year grip on power, is reportedly tilting in favor of ties with the Shinseito-Komeito camp, shifting from close relations with Sakigake which is in favor of a multiparty system, though fewer than the current number. The three other coalition parties are the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the minor United Social Democratic Party (USDP). The SDP and the DSP are in line with Sakigake on political realignment. Ichiro Ozawa, the alliance's chief strategist and Shinseito's secretary general, and Masayoshi Takemura, Sakigake's leader, have also published books discussing the future of politics in Japan.
