The survey's regular respondents consist of about 150 directors of industrial enterprises in different regions of Russia. The specificity and the value of the observation sample is in that it represents the most typical entities. It consists of medium-sized enterprises (800-1,200 employees). Naturally, they produce first and foremost for the domestic market and know the state of it well. These enterprises do not possess any monopoly privileges. Although a considerable number of them have gone through the crucible of privatization (the share of state-owned enterprises has declined over nine months of 1993 from 52 percent to 30 percent), they have not experienced (so far) any perceptible effect of it. The respondents' answers are notably uniform. The spread of opinions is minimal. All of this indicates a sufficiently high level of competency and precision of the directors' observations. The Protracted Decline What do the directors think about the situation as a whole? Last time we compared the results of the first six months of 1993 with respective forecasts of the respondents. Now, following the same pattern, let us look at the data of another six-month period--April-September 1993 (see Table 1). Table 1. Some Summary Indicators for April-September 1993 and the Forecast for March 1994 (in percents) September 1993 as % of March Forecast: March 1993 1994 as % of September 1993 Forecast made Actual in April 1993 1. Real volume of 99 101 98 output, contract work, services 2. Number of employees 96 97 97 (including supernumeraries, contractors, part-time employees, etc.) 3. Real volume of 35 49 46 capital investment 4. Average prices of 193 259 239 the output produced 5. Average prices of 233 304 293 purchased products 6. Employees' average 175 260 193 monetary wages The data in this table show again that the directors' forecasts are quite precise. They undoubtedly appraise correctly the trends in the economic situation. The fact that the directors register a relative stability of the real volume of production, contract work, and services (which contradicts official data of the State Committee on Statistics) is somewhat puzzling. Additional analysis shows that this is primarily the result of the fact that the respondents represent medium-sized enterprises. The latter turn out more stable in the environment of general economic instability than their largest and smallest colleagues. Actually, this stability means only, figuratively speaking, running in place. No more than that. This time the directors again showed themselves to be both pessimists and optimists. Over six months, investment at enterprises has fallen not by a factor of three (as they had anticipated) but only by half. On the other hand, the directors just cannot overcome their timidity in judging inflationary expectations. The real rise in prices considerably exceeded the directors' forecasts: over six months, prices for enterprises' output rose by a factor of 2.6 (instead of 1.9, as forecast); prices of purchased products--threefold (instead of 2.3, as forecast); and the price of labor (wages) rose over this period by a factor of 2.6 (instead of 1.75, as forecast). On the main subject, the directors' evaluation was entirely correct: as they had predicted, production is falling slowly or is in a state of stagnation; investment is declining swiftly; prices of purchased products are running ahead of selling prices; wage increases do not keep up with the rate of inflation, which signals a continuing decline of real income of workers at industrial (in this case, average, typical) enterprises. Such negative stability is revealed by many other indicators as well. According to the respondents' monthly appraisals, the degree of utilization of enterprises' production capacities remained within the range of 71-74 percent of the level they consider as normal for the corresponding period (in the first half of the year the appraisal produced an indicator of 72-78 percent). The share of enterprises where the degree of production capacity utilization has increased fluctuated during the third quarter within the range of 6-13 percent (in the first half of the year, 8-14 percent), while the share of enterprises where this indicator remained unchanged in the third quarter fluctuated within the 46-60 percent range (58-66 percent within the first half of the year). The share of barter deals in enterprises' turnover remained stable--9 percent. The level of inventories of unsold products also remained stable as compared to the "normal level"--86-97 percent (82-99 percent in the first half of the year) and the backlog of orders--79-83 percent (79-92 percent in the first half of the year). At the same time, there are visible signs of the continually worsening financial situation of enterprises: In September, only 20 percent of the respondents evaluated it as good (in January there were 4 percent, and in June--1 percent); 64 percent considered it bad (52 percent in January and 59 percent in June); and 34 percent appraised it as normal (44 percent in January and 39 percent in June). The share of enterprises where the financial conditions of operations have improved measured in the third quarter as follows: with respect to conditions of obtaining bank credit--0-2 percent (2-6 percent in the first half of the year); with respect to the ratio of selling prices to prices of purchased products--2-3 percent (1-7 percent in the first half of the year). On the other hand, 24 percent of the respondents expressed hope that in six months (by March 1994) their enterprises' financial situation would improve (but in January 1993, 33 percent of the respondents still had that hope). Respondent enterprises' debt to banks in September 1993 was 77 percent greater than in March 1993 (in June 1993 it was 57 greater than in December 1992, and in March 1993, 38 percent greater than in September 1992). One may consider as a certain indicator of directors' expectations the answers to the question: "Is a threat of bankruptcy real for your enterprise within the next one to two years?" In February 1993, 15 percent of the respondents answered affirmatively; in May, 23 percent; and in August 1993, 28 percent. Looking six months ahead, the directors did not find it expedient to adjust their expectations. They envision March 1994 much the same as compared to September 1993: real volume of output--98 percent; the number of employees--97 percent; real volume of capital investment--46 percent; selling prices--239 percent; prices of purchased products--293 percent; and the average wage--193 percent. As before, directors persist in the opinion that economic growth will resume only in five or six years. Such Familiar Reasons As before, the respondents were asked to name three out of 12 possible choices among the primary factors holding back the development of production over the preceding six months. Replies are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. What were the primary factor in holding back production at the enterprises? (as a percentage of the number of respondents) Possible factors Time the reply was received January April July October 1993 1993 1993 1993 1. Shortage of 56 56 61 64 financial means 2.

Transportation- and 6 2 1 0 information-related difficulties 12. Low skills of the 3 ... ... ... labor force 13. Other reasons 8 7 3 6 The picture has remained practically unchanged: the situation in the sphere of turnover--the situation in financial and commodity markets--is leading the pack. The only perceptible trend worth noticing is an increasing weight of financial problems in 1993: the pressure of insufficient financial means, and especially the tax burden, has increased. The influence of the enterprises' own financial factors is so great that they seem to be beginning to exert an essentially antimarket pressure on the economy. The evidence of this is the strange (from the market standpoint) situation whereby demand for products and prices for production factors (raw materials, component parts, semifinished products, labor, transportation, information services, and so on) have an increasingly diminishing effect on the producer. The situation in the labor and investment goods markets remains one of the lesser concerns for enterprises. The impact of the privatization process on enterprises is completely negligible. It looks as if the predominantly monetarist approach to stimulating a market is beginning to kill the market itself. Another indication of the causes for the decline are the answers to another question: What does the enterprise need first and foremost in order to adapt faster to the current situation? (see Table 3). In this question, too, the respondents were asked to choose three out of 12 possible options. The data received in March and June of 1993 have already been published; the replies received in August are being published for the first time. Table 3. What does your enterprise need first and foremost in order to faster adapt to the current situation (as a percentage of the number of respondents) Possible factors Time the reply was received March 1993 June 1993 September 1993 1. To get paid by the 60 50 55 purchasers of the output 2. To find new 46 54 49 distribution markets 3. To pay debts to 24 33 35 suppliers 4. To change the mix 36 32 28 of the output produced 5. To expand 13 12 22 production capacities 6. To pay bank debts 17 29 21 7. To make changes in 13 10 16 the way the enterprise is run 8. To find suppliers 29 22 15 of raw materials and components 9. To cut the labor 5 8 8 force 10. To privatize the 19 15 7 enterprise 11. Other 6 4 3 12. Everything is 3 1 2 fine as is Of course, the replies to this question add color to the total picture, make it more graphic: The concentration of singular factors is much less prominent here. There are no grounds, however, to change the general conclusion above. The impact of the monetary factor has increased, first and foremost as a result of nonpayments on the part of customers and difficulties in paying debts to suppliers. The impact of indebtedness to banks has attenuated somewhat, although, as noted above, the total volume of such debt has increased. Apparently, this is a relative decrease--the impact of other factors is stronger. Quite abnormal is the weakening of influence of such strictly market factors as the need to search for new distribution markets and changing the mix of the output produced. One could cheer a greater weight of the need to expand production capacities had it been accompanied by increased investment and demand for the enterprise's output. Unfortunately, most likely this reflects the sad fact that the existing production apparatus is fast becoming obsolete and the beginning of its decline in absolute terms. Only two out of 100 directors felt safe to report that "everything is fine as is." Accent on Production In this connection, of unquestionable interest are the answers to the new question included in the September survey (see Table 4). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4. In your opinion, what is more important now for the Russian economy?| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Possible answers |As % of respondents | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1. Stimulate production |66 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2. Slow down inflation |27 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3. Hard to tell |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is worth noting that there are very few who hesitated to answer this question. The directors' position was clear: Two-thirds of them placed emphasis on factors related to stimulation of production. Of course, this does not mean that they are against slowing down inflation. It is just that the people who know the practice of economic life do not believe in the effectiveness of managing the Russian economy solely through operations in the monetary market. Investment Needed In the investment sphere, the third quarter of 1993 has not brought any perceptible changes, either. As one could see from Table 1, the respondents appraised the real volume of capital investment in September 1993 as 49 percent of the March 1993 level and predicted 46 percent for March 1994. They put the level of realization of the production plans for April-September 1993 at 54 percent, which is not different from similar appraisals made in March and June 1993 (53-55 percent). More than half of the enterprises (52-56 percent) have not purchased any equipment at all in the third quarter of 1993 (in the first half of the year this indicator fluctuated between 47 and 57 percent). Neither was there practically any change with respect to the reasons causing the decline of investment. In evaluating the reasons that had been primarily responsible for hampering investment at the enterprise, the respondents, as before, were asked to mark no more than three of the reply options listed (see Table 5). The data in this table, received in January, March, and June 1993, have already been published, but the replies received in September are being published for the first time. The set of questions in the questionnaires has been changed somewhat, but it does not affect the summary results. Table 5. What were the primary reasons holding back capital investment at enterprises? (as % of the number of respondents) Possible factors Time the reply was received January 1993 March 1993 June 1993 September 1993 1. High cost of 69 68 72 75 equipment, construction, etc. 2.

Other reasons 6 8 3 8 In this respect, too, the causes of the decline have dramatically shifted into the financial sphere: investment growth was increasingly hampered by money barriers--upward-creeping prices of investment goods, interest rate on credit resources, the growing shortage of ruble means and the increase in enterprises' aggregate debt. The weight of impact of these four factors follows the lead of the rising cost of credit. Other factors clearly do not have any perceptible influence. It is probably worth noting the absolutely absurd phenomenon of an increase in the share of the respondents (from 5 to 12 percent) in whose opinion increased investment is hampered by existing excess production capacities. In September 1993 about one-third of the respondents (32 percent) declared the presence of excess production capacities in relation to the volume of demand expected within the next 12 months. This was in the environment of a decline in an absolute volume of production apparatus (in September 1993 it was 8 percent smaller than a year ago); in the environment where the share of capital investment in the total volume of enterprise turnover amounted in April-September 1993 to only 4 percent, where 13 percent of existing production capacities had been unprofitable over the past six months, where 7 percent of currently existing production capacities most likely would never be used, and where only 15 percent of credit obtained is being directed into capital investment. Thus, the "excess" production capacities undoubtedly merely represent idled equipment that have ended up being such as a result of a crisis-induced stoppage of production. Degradation and Primitivization of Economic Structure Continue During the period under consideration, there have been no serious changes in the investment structure, either (see Table 6). Table 5. Some indicators of enterprises' capital investment structure over the past six months (as % of total volume of capital investment) Possible factors Time the reply was received March 1993 June 1993 September 1993 1. Structure of financing capital investment: a) enterprise's 66 72 65 internal resources (profit, amortization) b) outside resources 42 19 28 (credit, proceeds from issuing stock, etc.) 2. The ratio of production and nonproduction (social and cultural facilities) capital investment: a) production 56 65 60 b) nonproduction 32 30 36 3. Approximate technological structure of capital investment in production: a) passive elements 42 46 54 (buildings, structures) b) active elements 46 54 46 (machinery, equipment) 4) Reproduction structure of capital investment in production: a) expansion of 30 32 33 production capacities b) replacement of 56 59 65 expended assets, modernization, repairs Of course, in the environment of a sharp decline in investment, one cannot judge reliably the dynamics of its structure. This conclusion is also supported by fluctuating numbers in the table above. Still, an increasing share of investment in passive elements of production assets (an increase from 42 to 54 percent) and a low share of expenditures on expansion of production capacities (30-33 percent) evidence a continuing degradation of the production apparatus and the accompanying primitivization of the economic structure. Innovation: A Rollback to Primitivism The same primitivization processes take place in the sphere of innovation as well. The June questionnaire contained a number of questions characterizing the process of innovation at enterprises. It turned out that in 1992-1993 almost two-thirds of the respondent enterprises (65 percent) introduced innovations (new or improved production or technology). However, also in almost two-thirds (63 percent) among these innovations, the change amounted predominantly to changing production rather than technology. The result was that 26 percent of the products in the total structure first came on the market in 1992-1993. The analysis of respondents' replies shows a clear increase in the elements of primitive methods in introducing innovation: ninety percent of the respondents indicated that the bulk of the research and design work with respect to innovations had been done in-house; only 6 percent said that this work had been carried by a state research institute, and 4 percent--by private research organizations. Also, let us not forget that the respondents do not represent large and major enterprises. This means that economic realities force even the "mid-level" to develop "homegrown" research and development capabilities. Of course, the experience of many foreign companies presents quite a few examples of highly effective work of small collectives, who draw in their work on the achievements of strong basic research concentrated in academies and universities, which are reasonably well financed by the state and major companies. But the Russian disintegration of research and development is taking place in an environment of the catastrophic decline of the prestige and the impoverishment of national basic science and the system of higher professional education. The editors of ROSSIYSKIY EKONOMICHESKIY BAROMETR asked whether enterprises attempted to obtain credit for innovation-related investment projects in 1992-1993. The replies showed that more than half of all respondents (54 percent) had attempted to obtain targeted state loans for these projects, but only one out of four had succeeded. Forty percent of respondents were bold enough to turn to a commercial bank for help, but only one out of three got it. As a result, a majority of the respondents who had introduced innovation had neither a targeted state loan (85 percent) nor a commercial bank credit (86 percent). The replies to the same July questionnaire enable us to form a certain idea of the goals pursued by enterprises in the process of innovation introduced in 1992-1993 (see Table 7). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Purpose of innovation |% of respondents | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1. New or improved product: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |a) expanding the nomenclature within |36 | |the main sphere of activities | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |b) modification of existing products |23 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |c) going outside the main sphere of a-|18 | |ctivities | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2. New or improved technology: | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |a) increasing production flexibility |19 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |b) decreasing labor intensity |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |c) decreasing material resource inten-|11 | |sity | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |d) improving labor conditions |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |e) decreasing energy intensity |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |f) improving environmental qualities |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As we can see, these undertakings are essentially of an accidental nature and apparently are necessitated by the imperative to somehow stay afloat. Economic Reform As already noted, 70 percent of the respondent enterprises are no longer owned by the state. In October 1993 two-thirds of the respondents (62 percent) reported that their enterprises already have been privatized. On average, this has happened nine months before the survey. Twenty-nine percent of respondents replied that they were planning to privatize within the current year; 6 percent did not have such plans; and only 3 percent of the respondents replied that their enterprises were not subject to privatization. The recent nature and incompleteness of the processes make the evaluation of how the respondents perceive the government's current economic policy very difficult. Even more so since it is far too early to make unequivocal conclusions on what kind of impact privatization has on the economic life of enterprises. The program that tabulates the survey data enables us to differentiate replies received from directors of both privatized and nonprivatized enterprises. We hope to present the results to DELOVOY MIR readers at a later date. Right now we will show an updated (as compared to the report on the results of the first half of 1993) summary of enterprise directors's replies regarding their attitude toward the current economic policy of the government (see Tables 8, 9, and 10). Please note that in the previous report (DELOVOY MIR, 28 August 1993, p. 10) the months in these tables had been moved one forward (for instance, the March column showed February data, the June column--May data, and so on). Table 8. Do you understand the economic policy of the government? (% of respondents) Possible answers Time the reply was received February 1993 May 1993 August 1993 1. Yes 2 7 8 2.

The enterprises 41 35 46 "held its ground" 3. The enterprise 8 20 12 gained (or lost less than others) Let us repeat: So far, there is clearly too little data to produce a reliable judgment with respect to the opinion of directors of medium-sized Russian enterprises. Also, as the replies above show, the spread of opinions among the respondents on this issue is quite considerable. In August 1993 the share of those who did not understand the economic policy of the government has increased perceptibly (to 32 percent as compared to 15 percent in May), as well as of those who do not believe this policy is correct (to 30 percent as compared to 17 percent in May). At the same time, the share of those who understand this policy (8 percent) and consider it correct (2 percent) remained very low. However, among the same respondents, the share of those who lost because of implementation of this policy has declined somewhat (to 42 percent in August as compared to 46 percent in May and 51 percent in February), and the share of those who "held their ground" has increased (to 46 percent in August as compared to 35 percent in May and 41 percent in February). However, the share of those who believe they have gained was lower in August (12 percent) than in May (20 percent), but higher than in February (8 percent). Brief Conclusions 1. The directors' responses on the results of the third quarter of 1993 have not brought anything substantially new in the appraisal of the economic crisis situation. The spectrum of their opinions showed increasingly clearly the stagnant nature of the decline. 2. At the same time, as the elements of structural changes noted above have shown, enterprises are somehow adapting to the new economic environment. This looks more, however, like a struggle for survival on the road of increasing primitivization of production and "relying on internal resources." 3. The results of the third quarter of 1993 survey do not detect an approaching economic pick-up, which is evidenced first and foremost by the decline in investment and degradation of the production apparatus. 4. The directors' appraisals clearly register a progressing financial crisis. One may also state that a majority of directors of monitored enterprises lean toward the conclusion that the search for a way out should go in the direction of giving priority to stimulation of production and shifting the accent into this sphere from the monetary policy by itself. 5. Finally, one cannot fail to notice that in their forecasts several months ahead, the directors consistently err in their evaluation of the future financial situation. Such repeated errors lead us to different generalizations. One could, of course, accuse the directors corps of a collective lack of competency. But one may also approach it differently: Do not these persistent errors reflect a certain artificial nature of forming the current financial situation, its conflict with the real state of affairs and the needs of the real Russian economy? Perhaps those who form the financial policy should look more attentively at themselves in the collective mirror of directors' opinions.
