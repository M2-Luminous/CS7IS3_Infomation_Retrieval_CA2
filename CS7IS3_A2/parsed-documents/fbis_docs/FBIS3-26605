The governor said he is convinced that the planned visit by Portuguese premier and the announced visit by Portuguese president to the People's Republic of China would be an important symbol of maintenance of the mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the two countries. Thus, he continued, "We have sufficient reasons to predict that we'll have all conditions that will enable us to work for our economic modernization, improving our infrastructural construction and implementing localization policies." He hoped that all people would do a good job in the new year, saying that "Our success will be a powerful contribution to the strengthening of friendship between China and Portugal and a stable base for the progress of Macao."
