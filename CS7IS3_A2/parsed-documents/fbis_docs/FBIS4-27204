Minshu no Kaze defected from the JNP, which is headed by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, due to differences with the party leadership. Sakigake, a 15-member party, is headed by Masayoshi Takemura, former chief cabinet secretary in the preceding coalition government. The three-member Seiun, also a breakaway from the JNP, left after Hosokawa failed to carry out a planned merger with Sakigake. Political sources said there are still some members within the JNP who are opposed to the leadership's close ties with the key coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. They predicted that the division within the JNP could lead more breakaways to join the 22-member parliamentary group comprising Sakigake, Seiun and Minshu no Kaze.
