FR941110-0-00283 FR941110-0-00018 Adenophorus periens is found in Metrosideros polymorpha ('Ohi'a)/ Cibotium glaucum (Hapu'u) Lowland Wet Forest between 470 and 1,270 m (1,540 and 4,140 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992a7, 1992a8, 1992a14 to 1992a16). Associated species include Broussaisia arguta (kanawao ke'oke'o), Cheirodendron trigynum ('olapa), Dicranopteris linearis (uluhe), Freycinetia arborea ('ie'ie), and Psychotria hawaiiensis (kopiko) (HHP 1992a7, 1992a8, 1992a15, 1992a16). The primary threats to Adenophorus periens are habitat degradation by pigs ( Sus scrofa ); competition for light, space, nutrients, and water with alien plant species; and habitat destruction by fires. Asa Gray gave the name Bonamia menziesii (NCN) to a plant from the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) in honor of its collector, Archibald Menzies (Gray 1862). Wilhelm Hillebrand (1888) placed the species into the segregate genus Breweria . Otto Degener (1932a, 1932b) described a new genus, Perispermum , and placed Bonamia menziesii in it. He also described another species of Perispermum , P . albiflorum . T. Myint and D.B. Ward (1968) recognized only one Hawaiian species and placed it in the genus Bonamia . They recognized two varieties: variety menziesii and a new variety, rockii . The current treatment (Austin 1990) recognizes only one species with no subspecific taxa. Bonamia menziesii , a member of the morning-glory family (Convolvulaceae), is a vine with twining branches up to 10 m (33 ft) long that are fuzzy when young. The leathery, oblong to oval leaves measure 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) in length and 1 to 4 cm (0.4 to 1.6 in) wide. The upper leaf surface is usually hairless or covered with sparse hairs and the lower surface is covered with dense fuzzy hairs. The white to greenish funnel-shaped flowers, each 2 to 2.5 mm (0.08 to 0.1 in) long, are produced singly or in clusters of three on stalks 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long with tiny bracts (modified leaves) at the base of each stalk. Stamens usually have glandular hairs at their bases. The flower has two styles that are separate or partly fused. The fruits are tan or yellowish brown capsules 1 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) long that contain one or two oval seeds imbedded in black pulp. This species is the only member of the genus that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and differs from other genera in the family by its two styles, longer stems and petioles, and rounder leaves (Austin 1990). Historically, Bonamia menziesii was known from the following general areas: scattered locations on Kauai, the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, scattered locations on Molokai, and the eastern sides of Maui and Hawaii (HHP 1992b3, 1992b4, 1992b10, 1992b11, 1992b13, 1992b15 to 1992b17, 1992b28, 1992b35). Currently, Bonamia menziesii is known from 28 populations on 5 islands. On Kauai, five populations are known from Kalalau, Paaiki Valley, Mount Kahili (all on State land), and Wahiawa drainage on private land (HHP 1992b25 to 1992b27, Lorence and Flynn 1991). On Oahu, Bonamia menziesii is known from both the Waianae and the Koolau Mountains. In the Waianae Mountains between Kuaokala and Nanakuli, 10 populations are spread over a distance of 24 km (15 mi) on Federal, private, and State land; 8 of these populations are clustered in the northernmost section over a distance of 8 km (5 mi) (HHP 1992b6, 1992b8, 1992b9, 1992b12, 1992b19, 1992b20, 1992b22, 1992b23, 1992b30, 1992b34). In the southeastern part of the Koolau Mountains, five populations are found over an area of 6 sq km (2.5 sq mi) on private and State land (HHP 1992b5, 1992b14, 1992b18, 1992b21, 1992b31). On Lanai, Bonamia menziesii is known from four scattered locations from Kanepuu to Puhielelu on private land (Garnett 1991; HHP 1992b1, 1992b2, 1992b32; HPCC 1991d). On Maui, one population is known from the western slopes of West Maui on private land and two populations are located on East Maui on private and State land (HHP 1992b24, 1992b29, 1992b33). On the island of Hawaii, a single population is located at Kaupulehu on private land (HHP 1992b7). The total current populations throughout the State consist of approximately 200 individuals, with the largest populations occurring on Oahu (HHP 1992b14, 1992b21, 1992b23, 1992b30). On Kauai, there are approximately 28 plants; on Oahu no more than 150; on Lanai approximately 9; on Maui a total of 10; and on the island of Hawaii at least 1 specimen has been collected (HHP 1992b1, 1992b2, 1992b5 to 1992b12, 1992b14, 1992b18 to 1992b27, 1992b29 to 1992b34; Lorence and Flynn 1991). Bonamia menziesii is found on steep slopes in dry to mesic forest and sometimes in wet forest between the elevation of 150 and 625 m (492 and 2,051 ft) (Austin 1990). Associated species include 'ohi'a, Canthium odoratum (alahe'e), Nestegis sandwicense (olopua), Pisonia sp. (papala kepau), and Sapindus oahuensis (lonomea) (HHP 1992b1, 1992b2, 1992b4, 1992b7 to 1992b9, 1992b18 to 1992b20, 1992b22, 1992b23, 1992b25, 1992b27, 1992b30, 1992b31, 1992b33). The primary threats to Bonamia menziesii are habitat degradation and possible predation by wild and feral ungulates (pigs, goats ( Capra hircus ), axis deer ( Axis axis ), black-tailed deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ), and cattle ( Bos taurus ), competition with a variety of alien plant species, and fire. Diellia erecta (NCN) was described by William Dunlop Brackenridge based on a specimen collected during the Wilkes Expedition in 1840 (Brackenridge 1854). He also described Diellia pumila , which subsequently has been considered a depauperate form of D. erecta . Davallia alexandri was published by Hillebrand in 1873. It has subsequently been considered a form of Diellia erecta with finely dissected fronds. Diellia erecta and Davallia alexandri had been placed in the genus Lindsaya by certain early authors, and Diellia erecta into the genus Schizoloma . Degener and Amy B. Greenwell (1950) published the new combination Diellia erecta var. falcata for a taxon originally described by Brackenridge as Diellia falcata . However, further study has established that Diellia falcata is best considered a separate species. Diellia erecta is now considered to be a species with no subspecific taxa (Wagner 1952, Wagner and Wagner 1992).
