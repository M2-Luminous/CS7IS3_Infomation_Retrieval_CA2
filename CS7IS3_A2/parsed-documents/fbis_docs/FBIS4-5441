FBIS4-5441 "dreas069_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 North Korea Secretary Perry Castigated on Recent Remarks Secretary Perry Castigated on Recent Remarks SK0904112994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1222 GMT 7 Apr 94 SK0904112994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1222 GMT 7 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The U.S. Scheme for Provoking a Korean War Is More Conspicuous Than Ever"] [Text] According to a foreign press report, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said in an NBC television interview on 3 April that if the situation in the Korean peninsula does not change in six more months, the United States would consider its so-called diplomatic approach has failed and hinted that they would move in the direction of imposing heavy pressure, including economic sanctions. Then he added that he would not preclude the possibility of a preemptive military attack if their diplomatic and nonmilitary pressure proves unsuccessful. This bellicose outburst by the incumbent U.S. defense secretary is very out of the ordinary, and we must regard it as grave. Perry's provocative outburst coupled with his recent remark that they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war, shows that the U.S. imperialists are attempting to provoke a new war in Korea any time they choose. This bellicose violent remark was not made accidentally. Although the United States has raved that it is interested in the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, this is false, judging by the violent war remarks made recently by the U.S. military leader. Perry's remarks also show that the United States has only been scheming for a policy of crushing [apsal] the DPRK by force. Let me take a few instances. According to a recent WASHINGTON POST issue, war fanatic Perry, babbling about our so-called nuclear development, said that the United States would stop our so-called nuclear weapons development even if it had to pay the price of starting a war on the Korean peninsula again. Saying that the U.S. strategy is taking step-by-step measures while isolating North Korea, he stated that the United States would take more serious measures. Perry also disclosed that the parts and maintenance personnel of the U.S. forces' fighter planes are being dispatched to the military bases in South Korea and Japan, that the South Korean puppets are being prepared with some kind of weapon, and that preparations are underway to deploy to South Korea the second lot of launching pads for Patriot missiles. Moreover, he unhesitatingly and undisguisedly made violent remarks of war that the United States will deal an overwhelming air strike against someone else's provocation within 24 hours. What should be noted seriously is that he openly disclosed that he will have in-depth talks with the South Korean puppets during his forthcoming junket to South Korea on not only simple military countermeasures but also on when, how, and why the military measures should be taken. Perry's remark shows that he himself undisguisedly disclosed that the purpose of his visit is examining the preparations for the Korean war on the spot and giving a new war order. Worse still, this time he once again raved that he would not preclude the possibility of a preemptive military attack. This vividly shows that they attempt to crush our republic through a surprise armed attack. The military moves perpetrated around the Korean peninsula clearly prove this. After a spokesman of our country's Foreign Ministry on 4 April issued a statement rebuffing the so-called 31 March UN Security Council president's statement urging us to accept an additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the imperialists' attempts to crush us militarily are all the more stepped up. First of all, extremely bustling moves are being perpetrated in Japan. In a U.S. Air Force base in Yokota, the U.S. imperialists' countless warplanes are preparing to make a sally while assuming a posture for offense and defense, simulating attacks on our Republic. Furthermore, the United States and the South Korean puppets are staging joint aerial war exercises against us in South Korea almost every day. The number of planes that have taken part in the daily exercise have totalled 700 on the average. Warplanes of various types brought in from overseas to South Korea are aimed at increasing their capabilities of making a surprise attack on the North and at enhancing cooperation between various flying corps. The extremely hazardous situation, which resembles that of the eve of 25 June 1950, is prevailing on the Korean peninsula these days. The then U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had inspected the 38th parallel before the outbreak of war. Likewise, today, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry tries to crawl into [kiodulda] South Korea with the same intent. All these facts show that the United States is driving the situation on the Korean peninsula into the brink of war while expanding its policies aimed at crushing us in a step-by-step manner. However, the United States should know very well that this kind of policy of power would never get by to us. For us, we have strong defense capabilities that could stamp out any aggressor in a stroke and the might of single-hearted unity among the party, the leader [suryong], and the people. The U.S. imperialists should squarely see the power of our single-hearted unity, the invincible faith, and the steel-like will, and not run amok recklessly. Only death will be given to those who play with fire.
