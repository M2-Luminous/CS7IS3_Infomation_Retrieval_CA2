Your day is beginning in our famous and legendary St. George's Hall in the Grand Kremlin Palace, in which the names and historic deeds of our great ancestors are reflected. This setting does, as it were, provide the starting point for our talks. I well remember our first meeting in Vancouver. I remember how we laid the foundations for a U.S.-Russian partnership and how personal friendship arose between us. I am sure that this is a basis for ensuring that the talks this time will be even more in- depth, more practical, and more global in nature. I think that you will retain a good memory of people in Russia, of Muscovites, and that you will sense this fully in your meetings with people. Welcome to Russia. Welcome to Moscow.
