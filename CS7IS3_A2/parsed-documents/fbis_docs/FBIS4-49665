Sutherland made the remarks in a brief interview with XINHUA on his arrival at the Beijing International Airport. The GATT chief, invited by Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, will meet with Chinese leaders to discuss China's resumption of its contracting party status in GATT. He said that this particular visit takes on particular importance in regard to timing since it immediately follows the Marrakech meeting last month, at which the overall documents of the Uruguay Round talks were signed. The world is on the eve of the creation of the new trading order as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, Sutherland said, and he hoped that the new order in terms of the world trade organization would come into existence by the beginning of next year. The chief said that from the viewpoint of the rest of the world, it is the desire that China should be part of the system rather than outside it. It has been said that the negotiation process is a difficult one which has been pursued for years, but, he said, "we are very anxious that the negotiation process should be pursued speedily, constructively and with a view to finding solutions to any difficulties that may remain." And therefore, it is a matter of some urgency to speed up the negotiation process. All parties involved in the negotiations have to cooperate to find solutions and bring China into the world trade organization. China's enormous importance, politically and economically, to the world is evident, Sutherland said, and China's integration into the new world trade system will be helpful to world trade development. As it is the first overseas trip he has taken since the Marrakech signing of the Uruguay Round, Sutherland said, it shows the extreme importance with which the world's largest trade body views China's re-entry. Long Yongtu, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, welcomed the chief at the airport. Long said that China attaches much importance to the chief's China visit and expects that the visit will help push forward the negotiation process on the restoration of China's GATT membership. China's development needs the world and the development of world trade also needs China, Long said, and China is willing to make due contributions to world trade development.
