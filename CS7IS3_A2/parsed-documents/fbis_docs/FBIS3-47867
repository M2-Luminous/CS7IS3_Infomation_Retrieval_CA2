The government, which had insisted that more than 130,000 SDR (special drawing rights; approximately 20.15 million yen) worth of government procurement be subject to bids, has decided to lower that figure to 100,000 SDR (approximately 15.5 million yen). The government also has decided to extend the announcement period of bids on the OFFICIAL GAZETTE by 10-20 days. Another decision is the adoption of a new system under which the government briefs foreign and domestic firms on its outline procurement plans prior to publishing them in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE. In this way, the government has decided to accept most U.S. demands in a bid to break the stalemate in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. One of the priority sectors at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks is procurement of medical instruments and telecommunications equipment. The government intends to ask for U.S. concessions by presenting its own concessionary proposals at a working-level meeting on medical instruments scheduled in Tokyo on 18 and 19 January, and at a working-level meeting on telecommunications equipment due to be held in Washington on 22 January. According to the concessionary proposals, more than 100,000 SDR worth of medical instruments and telecommunications equipment would be subject to bid. The Japanese Government has so far insisted on running announcements for medical instruments and telecommunications equipment for 40 days in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE, but has decided to extend this to 50 days. However, it has decided to keep the current 40-day period unchanged for such widely used medical items as X-ray machines, though extend the period to 60 days for specialist medical instruments which require longer to develop.
