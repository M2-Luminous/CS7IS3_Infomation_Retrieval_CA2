It is mainly used to describe changes in such property rights as arising from enterprise mergers, amalgamations, sales, and auctions, as well as purchases of shares in enterprises. Since our country introduced the policies of reform and opening up, lateral ties among enterprises have developed constantly. During the process, some enterprises whose liabilities exceed assets, whose production capacities cannot satisfy the requirements of the economic scale, and whose economic returns are poor have been amalgamated, in an active or passive manner, with enterprises generating good economic returns. Some enterprises have bought the property rights of other enterprises, thus annexing the latter by depriving them of their qualifications as legal persons or by changing their status as legal entities. Competent departments have begun to sell the property rights of some small state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises, especially those whose liabilities exceed assets, those which approach bankruptcy, those which have chronically operated poorly, and those which have suffered losses or made meager profits for successive years. Some localities have established enterprise auction markets to auction off property rights. Some have sold property rights in their entirety while others have sold them separately in the form of shares. Since the early eighties, Sino-foreign joint ventures have mushroomed and the enterprise shareholding system has gradually taken shape. There have been mutual purchases of shares between state-owned and foreign-funded enterprises, among state-owned enterprises, between state-owned enterprises and enterprises not under state ownership, and between enterprises and individuals. This has resulted in interchanges among various principal holders of property rights. Shares and share certificates issued by joint stock enterprises have been traded openly through listing or over the counter. The movement of property rights has been fairly constant. The aforementioned changes in property rights are generally termed the movement and realignment of property rights. They are the positive results of reform of our country's economic structure. According to state provisions, assets must be evaluated and the evaluation results must be verified by competent departments prior to the movement and realignment of property rights.
