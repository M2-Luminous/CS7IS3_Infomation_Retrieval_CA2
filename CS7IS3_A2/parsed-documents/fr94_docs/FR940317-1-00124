FR940317-1-00124 FR940317-1-00013 (f) The claimant certified that no part of the loss is covered by insurance. If private insurance covers any part of the loss, the claimant must first settle with the insurance company. See §536.181(b)(5). (Coverage under most personal property insurance carried by service personnel includes items lost or missing, destroyed, or damaged by water while in custody of a public carrier.) §536.172 Guides for computing amounts allowable. (a) For claims of losses incident to service processed under this subpart or subpart L, the Commander, USARCS, will periodically publish an Allowance List_Depreciation Guide specifying rates of depreciation and maximum payments applicable to categories of property. The Allowance List_Depreciation Guide will be binding on all Army claims personnel. (See §536.9(f).) For claims for losses incident to service processed under this subpart or subpart L, no payment will be made on an item or category of items in excess of the maximum payment in effect at the time the claim arose, except as provided in §536.174(b). (b) The Commander, USARCS will promulgate additional guides, references, and tables to assist in computing allowable compensation under this chapter. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 2.) §536.173 Ownership or custody of property. Compensation may be allowed even though the property was not in the actual possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss. Compensation may also be allowed even though the property was not owned by the claimant, provided it was lawfully under his or her dominion and control. However, compensation will not be allowed for damage or loss to personal property transported to accommodate another, other than the claimant's family members, nor will compensation for damage or loss to a vehicle loaned to a claimant be allowed unless both the claimant and the owner are proper party claimants. A vehicle registered in the name of the claimant or a spouse is not deemed, as between them, to be loaned. When a vehicle is subject to a lien, the vehicle is not deemed to be loaned merely because the title is in the name of the lien-holder. §536.174 Determination of compensation. (a) A claim may be allowed only for the amount and quantity of personal property considered reasonable or useful for the claimant to have used or possessed under the attendant circumstances, incident to his or her service or employment. In determining the reasonableness or utility of types and quantities of property included in a claim cognizable under this chapter, an approval or settlement authority will give consideration to the claimant's living conditions, family size, social obligations, and need to have more than average quantities, as well as the circumstances attending acquisition or possession of the property and the manner of damage or loss. (b) The maximum amounts allowable for specific types and categories of personal property listed in The Allowance List_Depreciation Guide constitute a determination of amount of quantity deemed reasonable or useful. A maximum allowance per item indicates that the allowance for a single item of the type or category of property involved will not exceed that amount. A maximum allowance per claim indicates that the total allowance for all items of the listed type or category is limited to that amount. Where both a maximum amount per item and per claim are applicable, the total allowance for all items will be limited to the maximum per claim, which will reflect the allowance of not more than the maximum per item for any individual item. To avoid application of these maximum allowances, a soldier or civilian employee may obtain additional protection on shipments by requesting full replacement protection or increased value protection. The Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS may waive the maximum in a particular case for good cause shown. (c) Compensation allowable for an item of personal property will not exceed the actual value of the item at the time of its loss, damage, or destruction. Guidance on determining the base figure for actual value, using replacement costs, estimates, or the Table of Adjusted Dollar Value, is provided in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 2. Because soldiers are permitted to replace items missing or destroyed during PCS moves from the Overseas Post Exchange Catalog, even when ordering from this catalog is not otherwise permitted, such items may be valued using this catalog. (d) In adjusting a base figure to determine actual value, standard yearly rates of depreciation have been established for the types and categories of items that have generally recognized periods of useful life; standard flat rates of depreciation have been established for certain kinds of items that decrease in value primarily as the result of the fact they are no longer new and unused, but which do not continue to depreciate on a yearly basis since they are not subject to fixed periods of useful life. (See Allowance List_Depreciation Guide.) However, if personal inspection of damaged property indicates that it was in better than average condition prior to damage, a lesser rate of depreciation should be applied. Similarly, if the evidence indicates that an item was in poor condition at time of damage, a higher rate of depreciation is appropriate. Variations from the established rates of depreciation will be fully explained. The following rules are to be observed in computing the depreciation applicable to any item:
