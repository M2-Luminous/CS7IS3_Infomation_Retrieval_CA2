The proposed programme, likely to be introduced in June, will increase the basic salaries of most government cadres. The central government postponed a plan to turn its 34 million cadres into civil servants over fears that the move would fuel inflation. Sources said that Guangzhou was wealthy enough to proceed with its scheme. Under the plan, the average take-home pay of government cadres would be raised to a level "slightly higher than" or "at least on par" with the amounts paid by enterprises of similar nature. A source said the basic wage of an average cadre could be increased to about 600 yuan (HK$532) a month, and a senior ranking official might receive more than 1,000 yuan a month. However, critics fear that lower-income groups and pensioners will continue to suffer as prices continue to rise. Last year, the official inflation figure for Guangzhou was 24.1 percent. The government hoped to contain the figure at 15 percent this year. Although city government officials admitted that prices had jumped 20 to 30 percent since November they claimed that the increases were still within the limits that the majority of Guangzhou residents could bear.
