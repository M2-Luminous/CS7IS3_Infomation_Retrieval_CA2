Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius that judging from Russian TV reports, Lithuanian and Latvian president's urged Estonian President Lennart Meri to accelerate troop withdrawal talks with Russia. The opposition leader said is was "a big political mistake" to urge Estonia without urging Russia because two Baltic states indirectly pressured the third one. Landsbergis also noted that the future of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region should be discussed on an international level. Commenting on Russia's intentions to merge Kaliningrad navy, army and air force headquarters into one center, Landsbergis said such steps are usually done to improve the efficiency of operations. Politically, Landsbergis said, the step would mean that Russia strengthens its military presence in the center of Europe. He said there is also a possibility that Russia wants to know the limit beyond which there would be strong reaction from the West.
