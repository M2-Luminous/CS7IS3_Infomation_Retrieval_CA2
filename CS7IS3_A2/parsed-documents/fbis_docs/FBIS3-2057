Making proper arrangements for people who have been released after serving prison sentences or who have been relieved of reform- through-labor terms and giving them help and education, so that they can truly be reformed, is the continuation of the effect of this policy. The practice in many areas proves that wherever this task is given adequate attention, the effect is always good and crime can be reduced; in areas where such people do not receive proper arrangements and help and education, there is a high recidivism rate and some of them go on to commit bigger crimes, seriously jeopardizing social wellbeing. In the new context of the establishment of a socialist market economic system, this task involves many new conditions and new problems. It is necessary to carry on with the good methods that have proved effective on the one hand, and to keep improving work methods on the other. Six central departments, including the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social Security, put forward working recommendations [gong zuo yi jian 1562 0155 1942 6015] for solving this problem after investigation and research. This is of great significance to maintaining social stability. Helping those who have been released after serving prison sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms to find means of livelihood is a key link in preventing recidivism. It is necessary to support and assist them in seeking jobs on their own; and to encourage enterprises and various kinds of economic entities to accept and give employment to such people. Meanwhile, appeals have been made for all circles in society to show concern for and take part in providing placement, help, and education, so that such people can find means of livelihood and employment. Those who have been released after serving prison sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms enjoy, by law, citizens' rights and should perform their obligations as citizens. In job placement, housing distribution, and provision of social relief, they should be treated in the same way as anyone else without being discriminated against. Meanwhile, we should also recognize that a considerable proportion of them do have much difficulty in finding employment and should be given some special care. They still have some mental obstacles to overcome, so education for them should be strengthened. In this sense, those who have been released after serving prison sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms are a special social group. To give them more assistance and education and help them narrow and eliminate the gap they feel in a social and psychological sense after they return to society as quickly as possible is the common responsibility of the whole society. Naturally, however, while stepping up our efforts to make arrangements for them, we should selectively strengthen help and education for those who have more deep-rooted negative traits or who have not been so well reformed and show a tendency toward recidivism; and sternly punish those who break the law and commit crime again. To make a good job of the placement, assistance, and education for those who have been released after serving prison sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms requires close attention and support from the party and government leaders at various levels, the cooperation of relevant departments, and concerted efforts from all circles in society, so that joint and comprehensive management can be achieved. We believe that with the joint endeavors of the whole society and timely implementation of various work measures, more of those who have been released after serving prison sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms will embark on the road of rebirth, the incidence of recidivism will drop, and society will be more stable, peaceful, and harmonious.
