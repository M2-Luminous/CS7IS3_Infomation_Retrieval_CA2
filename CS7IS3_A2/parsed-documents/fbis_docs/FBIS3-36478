As one of 130 consignees of the Paris convention banning chemical weapons, Russia, which joined it in January 1993, is obliged to eliminate all its materials designed for conducting chemical warfare before the year 2005. Russia has officially admitted that it has 40,000 tonnes of such materials. The consortium brings together the world's two companies which have experience of operating chemical weapon elimination installations. Raytheon engineers and constructors installed and networked equipment for the single operating plant for the elimination of chemical weapons of the U.S. Army. It is located in the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The plant, operated by the same company, can destroy up to 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents annually. Lurgi has been running and maintaining a similar plant for the German government in Lower Saxony since it was established in 1982. The German Foreign Ministry in October 1993 allocated 3.2 million DM (about two million U.S. dollars) to finance the phase of the development of the conceptual framework for the Lub/Saratov project. The working out of the conceptual framework is scheduled to be completed in March 1994.
