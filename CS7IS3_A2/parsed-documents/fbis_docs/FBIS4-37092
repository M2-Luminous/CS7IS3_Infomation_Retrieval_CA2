Dismissing claims by the Indian army that they are on the run, a top Moslem militant commander warned that the guerrilla movement could enter a new phase if the eight million Kashmiris are not allowed to decide their own fate. "The militancy begun in Kashmir will engulf all of India soon if it does not accede to our demands," said Majid Jehangir, the deputy commander of the Hezbul Mojahedin, the most powerful Kashmiri Moslem militant outfit. "In Punjab, the Sikh militants will rise again," said the 33- year-old Jehangir, who also goes by the name Khalidul-Islam, as he touched a well-oiled AK-47 rifle at his feet. "They are reassembling and reorganizing." "We will take the struggle out of the Kashmir Valley in stages," the burly, bearded guerrilla said at a hideout surrounded by gun-toting youths. "We have started the struggle in the Jammu region (of southern Kashmir) and we will be taking it to Ladakh (in the north-east) and then outside the state. "The question now is how long can India hold on to Kashmir," said Jehangir, whose Hezbul Mojahedin favors merging India's only Moslem-majority state with Islamic Pakistan. "The expenditure on Kashmir is likely to ruin India." Jehangir claimed that his group had obtained U.S.-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles, hundreds of which were supplied to the Afghan mujahedeen during their war against the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul, and many of which today remain unaccounted for. "We have got three Stinger missiles," he said, "and more are coming." He refused to disclose the source of the missiles but a number of former Afghan mujahedeen have made their way to Kashmir to fight alongside local Moslems in what they consider a "jihad," or holy war. "Militants from 46 Moslem countries have come to Kashmir to help us ... There is no problem in recruiting boys these days," said Jehangir, who figures near the top of the army's most-wanted list and who served three years in prison for secessionist activities before rising to the number two post in the Hezbul Mojahedin. There are dozens of militant organizations operating in the Moslem-majority Kashmir Valley but they are split between those favoring independence and those seeking a merger with Pakistan. Clashes between factions are common and have left nearly 400 people dead during the past three years, according to the Indian authorities. Yasin Malik, leader of the pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the Hezbul Mojahedin's chief rival for popularity, has accused the pro-Pakistan group of targeting him on two occasions this month. Jehangir denied the charge, and played down the importance of rifts between the groups. "This is guerrilla warfare and the more outfits there are, the more attacks there will be against the enemy," he said. He said his organization was open to a proposal by Malik to merge the various outfits into two major groups -- those favouring independence and those favoring a merger with Pakistan. "If other militant groups agree to his proposal than we will also accept it," he said. India has poured tens of thousands of troops into Kashmir in a bid to crush the Moslem insurgency, which it charges is fueled by arms supplied by Pakistan. It has consistently rejected Kashmiri Moslem demands to hold a plebiscite to decide whether to remain part of India or to join neighbouring Pakistan, which also claims the Himalayan territory. Nearly 10,000 people have lost their lives in Kashmir since 1989, and the violence has left its tourism-driven economy in ruins.
