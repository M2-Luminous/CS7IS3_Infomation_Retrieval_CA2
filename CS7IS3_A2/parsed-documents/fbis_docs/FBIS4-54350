Kono, meeting with Mondale at LDP headquarters in Tokyo, said he hopes the issue will be resolved through dialogue involving China, Japan, South Korea and the United States, the officials said. "Our country is within the range of North Korean missiles, and people of North Korean origin are also living here. We should not react eccentrically," Kono was quoted as saying of speculation that Pyongyang would attack Japan at any moment. Mondale said the basic U.S. stance is to continue talking with North Korea, maintaining close contact with Japan and negotiating with South Korea and the United Nations, according to the officials. They met for the second time at Mondale's request, following a meeting last October, they said.
