But why should the newspapers conceal the truth? "Perhaps because of the cynicism of the financial groups behind the major sectors of the press." Does he think that the center can win? "I say that the race is still on. There are still a large number of unknown factors." Enveloped in a blue haze of smoke from his Muratti cigarette, Martinazzoli knows that he cannot do much to cloud the reality of the election forecasts. According to the opinion polls, his Popular Party [PPI], at best, is worth 12 percent. This, together with the 6 percent from [Mario] Segni's Pact for Italy, would seem to lend strength to the arguments of those who, whether out of opportunism or for other reasons, prefer not to bet on the center. And even though from here (we were in Brescia, in a prosperous attorney's office which it would be ridiculous to compare to the grandeur of Arcore [Berlusconi's home]), Rome looks like a front abandoned to the overwhelming strength of the enemy, the PPI secretary does have a strategy. He explained it to L'ESPRESSO, pointing out that the first rule is not to overestimate your adversaries. Starting with Achille Occhetto who, Martinazzoli said, "inebriated by the results of the November and December local elections and, among other things, ignoring the fact that they were held under different electoral mechanisms, has believed that the same pattern could be reproduced in the general election." [Padellaro] Whereas? [Martinazzoli] Whereas Occhetto will probably lose. But above all, by so doing, he has not helped the development of the Italian political system. And he has not fulfilled his ambition to really build a democratic left, freed from the old origins of the PCI [Italian Communist Party]. [Padellaro] Could you be more specific in your charges? [Martinazzoli] A party, the PDS, that solemnly declared that it wanted to distance itself from its origins should not have got together again with that part of it, Communist Renewal, that did not accept that challenge. And neither should it have permitted such a movement as Rete to characterize the ideology of the so-called progressive alignment in such a marked way. The representatives of the left are seeking votes on the basis of their guarantee that they are no longer what they were in the past. But they are unable to say what they are now. [Padellaro] What about Berlusconi? He seems unstoppable. [Martinazzoli] Forza Italia is exploiting the draw of the television message and its power of suggestion. It is no coincidence that, as far as can be gathered, it is mainly women and young people that are captivated by the image that Berlusconi is able to project. He may be victorious in those sectors that have fewest social reference points. We certainly have candidates that have a more direct relationship with their environment. [Padellaro] But who are Berlusconi's potential voters? [Martinazzoli] They are certainly people who want a little more order and a few more certainties. They are outraged by the political corruption. Deep down, they have always nurtured a certain mistrust of politics. They are people who identify with the figure represented by Berlusconi and who regard him almost as an avenger against the attitudes and behavior of professional politicians. And by virtue of this identification, they expect an immediate appropriation of the political dimension. [Padellaro] Is their confidence well placed? [Martinazzoli] When I think about Berlusconi, I feel prompted to say that politics concerns not your own affairs, but those of others. I would add that, in general, those who are too successful in their own affairs are rather neglectful of other people's. [Padellaro] So was it what we could call this difference of mentality that prevented an election agreement between you and Berlusconi? [Martinazzoli] When I went to visit him around Christmas he presented me with the logic of the abacus. He told me, there is the left which is all united, and we must unite everything other than that. Perhaps I failed to understand that what was at stake was a victory by the left-wing forces in our country. I replied to him that the arithmetical logic of the abacus would have defeated even our traditional reservations about the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. I tried to explain to him that we have been part of Italian history since 1919. We saw Mussolini win, and we saw many Popular Party members who considered it more realistic to side with him. Sturzo, however, preferred to go into exile, and it was in exile that [Alcide] de Gasperi's DC [Christian Democratic Party] gained its legitimacy. True, between Berlusconi and me there was not merely a tactical lack of understanding, but an acknowledgment that our respective visions of politics were incompatible. But he knew that already, and had prepared himself in time. [Padellaro] Why do you think that? [Martinazzoli] The fact is that Berlusconi had decided to enter the arena some time before. Otherwise, why would he have tried to scale down [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi's leadership? And why would he have encouraged and helped the mini-split within the PPI by Casini and company? [Padellaro] Are you worried about the prospect of Berlusconi's becoming prime minister? [Martinazzoli] Probably in the United States too, on the eve of Reagan's victory, some intellectuals may not have been happy about the idea of a Hollywood actor's becoming president. Later, however, Reagan showed that he possessed certain capabilities. The problem with Berlusconi, rather, is that he is someone who has closely involved his business with politics, though he now portrays himself as a hero of the free market. Certainly I feel like laughing when I read, on the subject of the composition of the next government, that Berlusconi's orchestra or [Northern League lower house floor leader] Maroni's band will include a woman judge whose job will be to organize her former colleagues. [Padellaro] Are you not talking that way out of envy for Berlusconi's political successes? [Martinazzoli] It may be that I display the complex of the nobleman in decline, but permit me to draw a parallel, albeit an apparently unpleasant one. The judiciary will decide on the matter of [former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi's criminal responsibilities, though his political faults are in any case clear. But I was a minister in a government of which Craxi was prime minister, and Craxi was a politician who did have some political ideas, and that is a fact. The destruction of the race of politicians and their massacre is a price that we have to pay for the faults that they committed, but it is certainly not the remedy to all this country's ills. [Padellaro] Some people say that the errors that led to the elimination of several of the Popular and Pact candidates were no accident. And that in fact they conceal a maneuver on the part of the sector of the former DC which, deep down, supports Forza Italia. It is also said that cooperation between you and Segni is not always of the best. Is this so? [Martinazzoli] No, it seems to me that in Latium, which is where we had the biggest problems, an error was made in the interpretation of the law, which is in any case a kind of trap. Certainly, at the local level there were some misunderstandings with Segni's people. We had situations in central Italy where the Pact first demanded certain constituencies for their own candidates and then, the next day, decided not to gather signatures. I am not blaming Segni for this, but the fact is that he has some local officials, often former Christian Democrats, who, like all those who have left, maintain difficult relations with us. It is not an intolerable problem, but it is a problem. [Padellaro] You are very critical of Occhetto and Berlusconi. After the elections, however, the center may be forced to ally with one or the other. [Martinazzoli] We could also go into opposition. But if nobody is victorious, the problem of alliances will arise for all the forces. In a situation in which the absence of a victory by the left or the right destroys these schemes, it is we who will be the point of attraction. We are arrogant enough to think that it is the others that will offer us an agreement. [Padellaro] An agreement for what kind of government? [Martinazzoli] I see no chance of continuing with a government of experts. I think that we must act on the lesson that we learned from the Ciampi government, namely, that the more skills, seriousness of purpose, and impartiality there are in a government, the better it is for everyone. This, even though I hope that Ciampi will remember to make it clear to the Italian people that it is we and the others who enabled him to govern well. But I fear that we no longer need a politically neutral government, if we consider the complexity of our new problems. In past months there has been a revival in Europe of major wars and of grand diplomacy to build industrial alliances that will later be brought to bear in the subsequent stage of the European market and in economic competition with America. Will our iron and steel industry look toward France or Germany? And how will the automobile industry resolve its problems? We also need a government that is equal to the complexity of the constitutional problems -- a constituent government, therefore, that will tackle first and foremost the problem of federalism and that can complete the electoral reform. [Padellaro] A reform to introduce a two-round system? [Martinazzoli] Yes, though, rather than runoffs, a French-style open system would be preferable. [Padellaro] A new system with which to hold another election soon? [Martinazzoli]That remains to be seen.
