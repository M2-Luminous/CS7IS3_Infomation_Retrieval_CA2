FBIS4-38058 "drnes124_l_94009" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Sha'th: Palestinian Charter To Be Amended Sha'th: Palestinian Charter To Be Amended TA2706165894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1500 GMT 27 Jun 94 TA2706165894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] The Palestinian Covenant is to be amended at the first meeting of the Palestinian Council in Gaza. This was stated this evening by Nabil Sha'th, the chief Palestinian negotiator, who was making a rare appearance on an Israel radio phone-in show. This was what Sha'th had to say in answer to a listener's question: [Begin Sha'th recording] We have committed ourselves to the amendments of the charter. All our existing present organizations, Executive Committee, and so on, have approved these amendments, and now we are moving toward holding the Palestine National Council -- which I hope will be in Gaza -- so that these amendments will be made. [end recording] And on the controversial question of the division of sovereignty and power in Jerusalem, this is how Nabil Sha'th outlined the Palestinian position: [Begin Sha'th recording] Well, I think if we are thinking of long-term peace, real and stable peace, we must be thinking in terms of equals, and equals means two neighboring states side by side, and this means, again, sharing Palestine. But it also means sharing Jerusalem. It's not a question of being naive or not. I think people are not all yet decided about real peace. Some people think they can delay the real dividends and price of peace, and they are getting to learn gradually that this means real rights for the Palestinians, including the right of self-determination, which means if we choose a state then we have a right to live side by side in two states in peace. [end recording] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 27 June, reporting on Sha'th's Israel radio phone-in appearance, adds: "Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that Yasir 'Arafat has promised Yitzhaq Rabin to do his best to locate the Israeli POW's and MIA's. To the best of his knowledge they are located in Lebanon and Syria, in areas which are not under the PLO's control. Nabil Sha'th said he is aware of the fact that this issue is traumatic to the families involved and to the entire Israeli people." ["Asked why Palestinian industrialists are refusing to cooperate with their Israeli counterparts, Sha'th said the autonomy authorities are interested in cooperating with the Israeli economy, but they do not want to depend on it, because such a dependency will eventually make things harder for the Israeli economy as well."]
