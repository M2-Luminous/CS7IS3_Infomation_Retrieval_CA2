The vice-premier cited numerous facts proving to great difficulties with the sale of Russian-made products in the country's major industrial centres. Thus, about 70 per cent of dairy and meat products come to the Moscow and St. Petersburg markets from abroad, while domestic commodity producers are actually barred from these markets. According to Zaveryukha, the reason lying behind this is that certain structures find it more profitable to do business with foreign suppliers than Russian ones. The deputy prime minister promised that "this move will not entail a jump in retail prices for foodstuffs. The new rates of import duties are to reduce profits of importing organizations rather than send prices up", he emphasised. Zaveryukha told reporters that "certain circles objected to this order, they were openly lobbying against it and continue lobbying for its cancellation". But the government, specifically Zaveryukha himself, stand up for support of agricultural producers in all spheres, including in the financial one. "I have been instructed to investigate into the causes of over- 20-day delay in credits extended by the government to assist rural areas with the spring sowing campaign", the deputy prime minister reported. He believes such a delay amounts to disruption of the sowing campaign and "will result in the loss of 7-8 million tons of grain this year". And yet, even with this situation taken into account, Russia will have enough basic foodstuffs this year, largely made by domestic producers, Zaveryukha said.
