'Abd-al-Shafi asked: Does 'Arafat's hesitation in signing the maps prove that there is a contradiction between what is written and what is drawn? 'Abd-al-Shafi added that the agreement places many obstacles to reaching a just peace and gives Israel more reasons to cling to its inflexible stance and its claim that it has a right to the occupied territories. He noted that Israel has expressed its positions by setting up more settlements and annexing Jerusalem, in addition to the numerous measures that it has practiced against our people. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: At any rate, now we are facing a fait accompli, which will confront us with new threats. [passage omitted] Shaykh Jamil al-Hamami, one of the most prominent Islamic figures in the occupied territories, said: I am pained and saddened over what happened in Cairo. Is this how one manages the future of a people and nation and the struggle of generations of people? If this is proof of anything, it is lack of seriousness in discussing the Palestinian people's fate and the Palestinian cause. Al-Hamami said: This agreement represents a great obstacle to achieving a just and comprehensive peace and to realizing the Palestinian people's aspirations. We in the occupied territories feel very sad in light of Israeli arrogance, the settlers' practices, and the U.S. Administration's support for Israel. Al-Hamami added: This is a temporary and not a permanent agreement because it does not respond to the aspirations and hopes of our Muslim Palestinian people, who have been patient and have suffered and endured. I do not think this is the end as the agreement is stillborn. [passage omitted] Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi said that the Palestinian people deal with reality and not with conferences, papers, and political positions. They are endeavoring to remove and end the occupation. She added that while the agreement was being signed in Cairo by the PLO chairman, Israel continued to impose a blockade on Jerusalem and settlers were engaged in provocative acts. Dr. 'Ashrawi said: We are not against peace, but the process should be based on fundamental considerations and a cumulative momentum that lead to obtaining rights, not beautifying them and maintaining the occupation. For his part, Faysal al-Husayni said: It was not necessary to abide by the date of the signing of the agreement and to leave important issues. It would have been better to postpone the signing until an agreement with clear outlines was reached. In a related development, most of the Palestinian figures in the occupied territories who support the peace process refused to attend the signing ceremony to express their reservations to the agreement.
