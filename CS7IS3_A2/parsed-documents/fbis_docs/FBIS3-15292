Unlike the Russian Constitution, the Republic of Komi's Constitution was adopted not by referendum but at a session of the Supreme Soviet. The republic is remaining Soviet because the legislative organ will be called the State Soviet. The Constitution introduces a new concept -- the "head of the republic" ["glava respubliki"]. The drafters of the Constitution rejected the term "president" in the belief that there should be only one president in Russia. Furthermore, in the referendum the republic's population indirectly opposed the post of president. The new Komi Constitution envisages private ownership of land and a state guarantee of free medical aid and proclaims two state languages on the republic's territory -- Komi and Russian.
