According to data of the Research Institute of Nutrition (VUV), which monitored in this period the state of nourishment of the population in economically high-risk regions [ekonomicky rizikove regiony] (Orava, Kysuce), the daily consumption of milk should be at least half a liter. The consumption of dairy products has declined here 17.3 percent, consumption of cheese 13.3 percent, and consumption of fish more than 20 percent. The consumption of fruit has declined 19 percent in these regions and vegetable consumption as much as 22.1 percent. According to A. Bederova, MD, head of the Epidemiology Department, surprisingly negative findings have been ascertained with regard to children and youth from poorer regions. The deteriorated spectrum of fat substances in blood is alarming. The high level of cholesterol in the blood of school-age children and adolescents has gone up from 15-17 percent to 22-29 percent. The number of obese children has gone up by 2 to 6 percent. Almost one in three adolescents had a reduced level of selen (an important protective substance against tumorous diseases). The intake of calcium has declined 51 percent and intake of vitamin C 61 percent.
