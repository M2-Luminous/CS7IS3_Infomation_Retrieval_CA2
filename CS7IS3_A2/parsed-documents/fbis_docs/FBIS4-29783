The DTI's Bureau of International Trade Relations [BITR] clarified that the decision of the United States to maintain its present level of sugar importation, including the substantial amount exported by the Philippines, is based precisely on the conversion of its quantitative restrictions on the import of that product to tariff equivalents. This, in effect, is what the principle of tariffication is all about. BITR Director Antonio Buencamino pointed out that conversion of import ceilings to tariff increases to effect the same degree of protection for country's competitive industries. The clarification is made in the wake of assertion of Sugar Regulatory Administration head Rodolfo Gamboa that the U.S. quota system, which presently employs tariffs, received an exemption from the GATT agreement under the Uruguay Round.
