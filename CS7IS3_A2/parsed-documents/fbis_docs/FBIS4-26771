From 21 to 23 June, after inspecting flood-prevention projects at dikes along the Beijiang River in Guangdong, Chen Junsheng immediately led a central joint work team, and hurriedly travelled over 1,000 kilometers to other disaster-stricken areas. He successively inspected four counties and districts in Qingyuan, Zhanjinag, and Maoming cities that have been seriously affected by flooding. Chen Junsheng and his party went into disaster-stricken areas, visited households of flood victims, studied the flood situation, and extended greetings and appreciation to cadres, the masses, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], officers and men of the armed police corps, and public security cadres and police who have been performing relief work at the forefront in disaster-stricken areas. After studying the damage inflicted in the flooded areas and the ongoing relief work being carried out, Chen Junsheng said: The ongoing relief work has been very well organized and systematic. Social order has been good; commodity prices have remained stable; the society has been relatively calm; and the feelings and spirit of cadres and the masses have been good, too. While holding discussion meetings with leaders at provincial, city, and county levels in Guangdong, Chen Junsheng laid down instructions on relief work at the next stage. He pointed out: To resume production and to rebuild flood victims' homes are top priorities of our relief work in the next stage. First, we should stress on properly providing food, shelter, and medical care to flood victims. We must ensure the supply of grain rations to flood victims and absolutely no one is allowed to starve to death. We should promptly renovate and rebuild houses for flood victims so they can regain a stable living environment as soon as possible. It is necessary to promote hygiene and stress prevention epidemics in an effort to prevent epidemic diseases that normally appear after a calamity. Second, we should organize personnel to resume production as soon as possible. In particular, we should properly handle grain production. We should promptly fix up farmland that has been destroyed by flooding and replant late-autumn crops. We should strive to plant more late-autumn crops so as to harvest more later, and cannot afford to miss the right timing. Relevant departments should provide support and supply seeds, fertilizer, pesticide, and diesel to disaster-stricken areas. When renovating facilities that have been destroyed by flooding, we should specifically and promptly restore roads, bridges, and water conservancy projects. Chen Junsheng pointed out: Guangdong's recent rescue and relief work during the flood has fully demonstrated the rallying forces of our party, that of reform and opening up, and that of economic progress, and has also fully shown the fighting capability of the PLA, that of officers and men of the armed police corps, and that of public security cadres and police. These rallying forces and their fighting capability were the factors that enabled us to secure preliminary victories over our first battles fighting a major disaster. He fully affirmed the Guangdong format whereby members of its leading bodies, in separate groups, respectively went to the forefront of disaster-stricken areas to direct rescue and relief work. He said: It has been a very good experience. We should persistently promote the experience for a long time in the future to attain a total victory in the rescue and relief work during the flood.
