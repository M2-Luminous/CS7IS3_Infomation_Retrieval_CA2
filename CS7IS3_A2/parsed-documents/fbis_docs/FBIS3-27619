Over the past few years, with a view shaping a public security system, Guangdong has gradually gained a consensus from practice and carried out numerous explorations on ways to strengthen comprehensive control over public security. I. The Complexity of Public Security Problems Requires Us To Exercise Comprehensive Control. The significance of maintaining a sound social order is known to all because it has a great bearing not only on the safety of thousands of thousands of families, and on the interests of millions of people, but also on bringing about a stable and sound environment for economic development and on the decisions of foreign businessmen to run factories, do business, and go sightseeing in China. Meanwhile, it is also a very serious political issue which will produce a direct impact on the confidence of the masses in upholding the four cardinal principles and in carrying out reform and opening up. That is why we have never relaxed our efforts in exercising control over public security. However, despite the arduous efforts we have made, the public security situation still remains quite grim. This fact serves to show the complexity, severity, and protractedness of our work to keep tight control over public security, which is actually a tough social system project involving many aspects of social life. Therefore, we cannot succeed in our work if we just simply launch a few campaigns or rely on the strength of one or two departments. To find effective solutions to security problems, what we must do is to acquire a correct understanding of the protractedness and severity of the work, and persistently exercise comprehensive control over public security. First, the public security situation involves various complicated social factors. With complicated ideological and social roots of various sorts, different violations of the law are a comprehensive reflection and the result of interactions of the negative factors existing in many fields in society, including the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fields. Such violations are born of many adverse objective or subjective influences which exist in the country or come from outside the country. Problems generated from various complicated factors have to be dealt with comprehensively from various angles and using different measures. Second, we should have a correct understanding of the many rampant, stubborn, and repetitive negative factors which can lead to security problems. Both international and domestic political struggles are protracted in nature, as is the corrosive influence from decadent ideologies and cultures of the declining classes in the ideological field. For a considerably long period of commodity economic development, the influence of negative factors inherent in the commodity economy has also been protracted. To resist and eliminate these influences, we must be prepared for an extended struggle, undergo repeated trials of strength, and never relax our efforts. Third, during the process of reform, the shift of the new and old economic structures, readjustments of interest relations, and changes in people's ideological concepts have inevitably given rise to many contradictions and frictions, as well as various factors leading to security problems. Since it takes the lead in reform and is also on the forefront of opening up, Guangdong may be the first to face more conspicuous and severe problems in public security. Various criminal activities are running rampant in the province and lawbreakers coming from inland areas as well as triad forces from outside China have committed many crimes, including drug-trafficking and drug-taking, prostitution and patronizing prostitutes, smuggling, robbery, and blackmail. All these problems keep surfacing despite repeated bans, adding greater difficulties to our control over public security. Under such circumstances, we can attain greater results only when we make greater efforts to unswervingly give full rein to all social forces and fight in coordination when exercising comprehensive control over public security. II. Give Play to Superiorities and Exercise Comprehensive Control Over Public Security Exercising comprehensive control over public security is a societywide system project mainly characterized by integrating: Special campaigns and the strength of the masses; central and local supervisions; the efforts of the province itself and its coordination with other provinces and foreign countries; anticorruption struggles inside the party and the elimination of evil-doing in society; and integrating short-term campaigns of "severely cracking down on criminal activities" and "elimination of seven evils" on the one hand and long-term efforts of comprehensive control on the other. As regards the concrete methods used by the system project, party and government leading organs will coordinate all sides concerned and strive to bring about a comprehensive effect by making use of various political, economic, administrative, legal, educational, and cultural means. Judging by the realistic situation in Guangdong, a number of localities have done a good job in exercising comprehensive control and their experience can be summarized as follows: "Developing the economy, intensifying functions, arousing the masses to exercise comprehensive control, paying attention to education, and reinforcing management." --Developing the economy. A better economy can enable the masses to live in peace and comfort, ease up various social contradictions, lay a foundation for reducing crime, and provide conditions for increasing security input and upgrading the necessary equipment. Therefore, we have persistently paid attention to developing the economy and regarded and carried out the work as a basic task of the system project of comprehensive control. --Intensifying functions. This means that we need to give full play to the functions and roles of organs of dictatorship, as well as the dual role of the law in protecting the people and cracking down on criminal activities. The procuratorial and judicial contingents are backbone forces in the work of comprehensive control. Therefore, we need to strengthen the building of these contingents in real terms and we must not begrudge the money spent on reinforcing police forces and upgrading their equipment. It is imperative to enhance the political and professional qualities of procuratorial and judicial workers, help them improve their skills in struggling against crime, and nurture procuratorial and judicial personnel who are able to act in strict accordance with the law, handle cases with a high efficiency, and refrain from acting impetuously or using penalties instead of adopting legal actions. With coalitions between provinces and municipalities, and between local governments and such special departments as the railway and customs, we will make continued efforts to carry out the campaign of "severely cracking down on criminal activities," as well as other special-purpose struggles, and strike relentless blows at criminal activities of various sorts. --Arousing the masses to carry out comprehensive control over public security. The masses comprise the biggest deterrent force against criminals and evildoers. To prevent crime, we should not only rely on professional contingents but also arouse and organize the forces of the masses in an extensive way. By so doing, we can spread a dragnet so that the criminals have no way to escape. Judging from Guangdong's practice, we have mainly paid attention to the following several links: 1) A joint defense has been set up by the army, police, and militia. Security patrols, factory and neighborhood joint defense commands, and residential quarters' security squads have been organized in urban areas, with militia patrols and peasants' joint defense commands in rural areas. All these security-keeping units are on patrol duty round the clock in key districts, sections, and units; open and covered sentinels have been posted in hotbeds of criminal cases; and a patrol duty system as well as police information posts have been set up in all neighborhoods, buildings, residential quarters, and key vital communication lines. 2) Giving full play to the roles of security teams in public places, especially hotels, shopping malls, and banks, and establishing a strict internal management system. 3) Setting up and perfecting the militia and joint defense organizations and bringing the roles of these grass-roots organs into full play. 4) Setting up antigambling and antidrug associations across the rural areas, organizing youths and women and helping them enter contracts and supervise each other in the struggle against gambling and drugs. 5) Encouraging the masses to exercise supervision, inform against lawbreakers, and to give assistance in cracking criminal cases. We need to commend and give people handsome rewards for their heroic behavior and their contribution to solving criminal cases, thus creating a general social mood that "everybody has responsibility for maintaining sound social order." 6) Earnestly strengthening management over the floating population and apartments rented by the hour. 7) Carrying out rectification in areas and units where there are relatively more problems to prevent them from becoming criminal dens. Practice has proved that all these measures are workable and effective and have played an important role in maintaining public security and stability in our province. --Paying attention to education. The process of comprehensive control, viewed from a vertical angle, mainly consists of three links: Preventing and cracking down on crimes and transforming criminals. Of the three, prevention and transformation are positive measures. To reach the goal of preventing crimes and checking the reemergence of crime, a fundamental way is to do a good job in ideological, ethical, and cultural education and enhancing the ideological, ethical, and cultural qualities of the people. Therefore, we should regard education as a system task and provide people of different ages with education at different levels. Particularly, we should pay great attention to teenagers and youths, for it is the need of comprehensive control and the need of rearing a generation of people of a new type. We should strengthen ideological and ethical education in schools, education on vocational ethics in enterprises, and education on social morality and the legal system in the entire society, to bring about a favorable turn in the general mood of society. We should base our education on problems emerging during reform and opening up, guide the masses to resist the adverse influence of the negative factors of the commodity economy, guard against erosion from the incorrect concept of "evaluating everything in terms of money" and become rich through legalized operations and honest labor. Careful ideological education, mediation, and guidance are also required in solving contradictions and disputes among the people, so that these contradictions and disputes do not turn into security problems. Departments in charge of reeducating criminals through labor should work together with society; give full play to the roles of enterprises, neighborhoods, townships, and villages in reeducating and transforming criminals; and do a good job in arranging the resettlement and employment of personnel who have undergone reeducation through labor. In addition, we also need to adopt vivid forms to enable the masses to educate themselves. --Reinforcing management. Setting up and perfecting rules and regulations on social security and management is a basic task of comprehensive control. With strict rules and regulations, as well as careful implementation, we can plug all loopholes and eliminate all evildoing in the light of the system. First of all, we need to set up a target responsibility system and implement the target down to the grass-roots levels by translating the general target of security into various concrete and workable goals, requirements, and measures in accordance with the principle that: "Whoever takes charge should assume the responsibility." Leaders at all levels as well as persons in charge of grass-roots units should take charge of security affairs and regard security work as one of the contents of the target responsibility system during their tenure. Second, efforts should be made to set up and perfect various concrete management systems, including management of floating and temporary population; of guest houses, cabarets, roadside inns, and apartments rented by the hour; of financial and accounting; of outward remittances; and the management of passports, frontier permits, and documents for multiple visits to Hong Kong and Macao. Third, we should set up various corresponding inspection and supervision systems and firmly check violations of rules and regulations. Country rules on maintaining social order should also be extensively drawn up in rural areas. All the aforementioned measures are interrelated and inseparable and not a single one of them can be dispensed with. Only by successfully mobilizing the entire society, taking concerted efforts, and doing a good job at every link can we bring about effective solutions to public security problems. III. Strengthening Leadership and Coordinating the Work of All Sides Comprehensive control over public security is a common task for the entire society. To properly coordinate the forces of all sides, we need a powerful command center. Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels should place the work of comprehensively controlling public security on their major agenda; devote a great deal of effort, time, and resources to the work; reinforce concrete guidance; ensure the implementation of all measures; and set up corresponding work organs. Departments under the party and mass system, including party and youth league organizations, trade unions, women's federations, and the militia; sectors on the propaganda, cultural, and education front, including the press, publication, films, television, broadcasting, schools, and hospitals; organs on the procuratorial and judicial front, including public security organs, procuratorates, people's courts, judicial organs, and departments in charge of reeducation through labor; and government departments, including industrial and commercial bureaus, taxation departments, banks, audition departments, and the customs should all work together to make the work a success. Party committees and governments at all levels should draw up unified work plans on the comprehensive control of public security and strengthen, in particular, the building of grass-roots organizations. If we succeed in the building of leading bodies at the grass-roots level, we can surely fulfill the task of comprehensive control down to every grass-roots organization. Whether or not the command center of comprehensive control over public security can work with high efficiency and high authority depends on whether or not it can perform an exemplary role in observing and acting in strict accordance with the law. Therefore, party and government leaders at all levels should integrate comprehensive control of public security with the work of opposing corruption and maintaining a clean administration. So long as the leaders succeed in taking a good lead, the entire system project of comprehensive control can be carried through efficiently and all problems with public security can be solved properly.
