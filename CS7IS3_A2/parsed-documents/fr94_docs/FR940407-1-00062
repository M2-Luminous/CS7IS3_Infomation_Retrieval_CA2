FR940407-1-00062 FR940407-1-00012 (B) Adding the total principal amount outstanding for all long-term debt issues expected to be outstanding as of the beginning of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base to the total principal amount outstanding for all long-term debt issues expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the resulting sum by two, which yields the average total principal amount expected to be outstanding for all issues for the 12-month period; and (C) Dividing the average total annual dollar cost of long term debt for all issues for the 12-month period by the average total principal amount expected to be outstanding for all issues for the 12-month period, which yields the average annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues to be used in computing the BTWACC. (v)(A) Cost of long-term debt capital calculation (Schedules F&hyph;II, F&hyph;II(A), F&hyph;III and F&hyph;III(A)). The carrier shall calculate the annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues of long-term debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base separately for the two dates, and shall also calculate the average annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt for all issues for the 12-month period. The carrier shall support these calculations by showing in tabular form the following for each class and series of long-term debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period separately for the two dates: ( 1 ) Title; ( 2 ) Date of issuance; ( 3 ) Date of maturity; ( 4 ) Coupon rate (%); ( 5 ) Principal amount issued ($); ( 6 ) Discount or premium ($); ( 7 ) Issuance expense ($); ( 8 ) Net proceeds to the carrier ($); ( 9 ) Net proceeds ratio (%), which is the net proceeds to the carrier divided by the principal amount issued; ( 10 ) Cost of money (%), which, for existing long-term debt issues, shall be the yield-to-maturity at issuance based on the coupon rate, term of issue, and net proceeds ratio determined by reference to any generally accepted table of bond yields; and, for long-term debt issues to be newly issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period, shall be based on the average current yield (published in such a publication as Moody's Bond Survey) on long-term debt instruments similar in maturity and investment quality as the long-term debt security that is to be issued; ( 11 ) Principal amount outstanding (%); ( 12 ) Annual cost ($); and ( 13 ) Name and relationship of issuer to carrier. (B) Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company, the carrier shall show the cost of long-term debt calculations and information required in this paragraph (e)(7)(v) for its own cost of long-term debt unless the carrier applies for and receives permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC. Where such permission is granted, the subsidiary carrier shall show the required cost of long-term debt calculations and information for the consolidated system's long-term debt. (vi) In the event that new long-term debt is to be issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base, the carrier shall submit a statement explaining the methods used to estimate information required under paragraphs (e)(7)(v)(A) ( 1 ) through ( 13 ). (8) Cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital Schedules F&hyph;IV, F&hyph;IV(A), F&hyph;V, and F&hyph;V(A)). (i) The cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital shall be calculated by the carrier for the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base on the basis of: (A) Embedded cost for existing preferred (and preference stock); and (B) Current cost for any new preferred (and preference) stock to be issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period. (ii) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital calculated on the basis of all issues of preferred (and preference) stock expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to calculate projected mid-year rate base shall be the cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital used in computing the BTWACC. (iii) The annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital for all issues of preferred (and preference) stock expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base shall be calculated separately for the two dates by: (A) Multiplying the cost of money for each issue under paragraph (e)(8)(v)(A)( 9 ) of this section by the par or stated amount outstanding for each issue, which yields the annual dollar cost for each issue; and (B) Adding the annual dollar cost of each issue to obtain the total for all issues, which is divided by the total par or stated amount outstanding for all issues to obtain the annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital for all issues. (iv) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital for all issues to be used as the cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital in computing the BTWACC shall be calculated by:
