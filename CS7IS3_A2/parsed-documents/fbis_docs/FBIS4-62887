Currently, we can only discuss a slow moving forward toward a confederation based on CIS structures. Given favorable circumstances, this goal can be achieved no earlier than 10 or 15 years from now. However, everything will depend on how quickly the European Union members adopt a similar path. We can speak about a confederation on the territory of the entire area of the former USSR, including some neighboring states, however, the idea of a confederation of two entities -- Russia and Belarus -- is absolutely illusionary. Two states, so different in size (correlation in the population is 15:1 and in territory -- 70:1), cannot unite in one confederation, a union of sovereign states, which foresees not only formal equality, but equal rights in adopting decisions. The point is that the confederation is built on the "dual key" principle. However, will Russia agree that one Belarusian vote has the same power as 15 Russian votes? I am afraid that those, who insist on setting up a confederation of two entities, understand this all too well. They say "confederation" but mean a federation, with a strong centripetal tendency. Well, two subjects will hardly establish a federation. Do they mean a simple incorporation of the Republic of Belarus into the Russian Federation with some rights of "autonomy?" This danger exists, and our citizens should realize that the status of a former autonomous republic within Russia cannot be compared with the status of a republic within the former USSR. Though my attitude toward relations between the federal and republican organs in the former USSR is overly critical, I have to admit that from a legal point of view, all the republics were formally equal before the center of the federation. This formal equality had, at least, psychological significance and encouraged, to a certain degree, the preservation of a specific amount of national culture, and even some economic welfare. Nothing of this kind has ever been noticed within the Russian Federation. Many of its bodies, even until lately, were of a purely unitary nature. Currently, the issue of the status of the national republics within the Russian Federation remains very complicated, even regarding regions where people with a high national awareness reside in close quarters to one another. Until now, none of the former "autonomies" failed to obtain guarantees from Moscow for an easy withdrawal from the Russian Federation. For Belarus, incorporation into the Russian Federation would mean a national catastrophe. Short-term advantages arising from this decision will destruct everything that identifies the independence of Belarus. This will happen not due to the imperial aggressiveness of the Russians, but due to the weakness of the national awareness of Belarusians. Therefore, during the upcoming elections for president and Supreme Soviet deputies, Belarusians should be on the alert: What do the candidates propose? Do they support Belarusian sovereignty? All the remaining issues -- a degree of economic integration with Russia, the attempts to achieve the status of a neutral state, cooperation within the CIS security system, with NATO and other defense unions, currency union with Russia and other CIS states -- can be resolved by various means regarding the difference in voters' opinions and different approaches to the domestic and foreign situation. However, any program should unequivocally provide for the state independence of Belarus.
