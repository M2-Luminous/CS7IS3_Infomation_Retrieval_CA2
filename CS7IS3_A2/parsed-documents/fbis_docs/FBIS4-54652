The central bank estimates the growth to be between 105 and 117 billion forints [Ft], which corresponds to a 16-18 percent increase. As a comparison, in 1992, the amount of credits increased by Ft2.7 billion, i.e., by 0.4 percent. In estimating the increase in the actual amount of credit, the central bank took into consideration the cancellation of debts, which led to a decrease in the amount of credit. The cancellation of debts at the end of 1993 affected outstanding amounts of Ft61.3 billion; according to preliminary data from the banks, the effect on the decrease in the amount of credit can be estimated to be Ft30-42 billion. As a result of debt cancellation during the year, the amount of credit to businesses decreased by Ft15.1 billion. While the amount of current asset credits to businesses decreased in 1992, in 1993 it increased by approximately 12 percent. However, the amount of investment credit decreased in both years. The pace of the growth of foreign currency credits to businesses slackened: While in 1992 the increase amounted to Ft14.5 billion, in 1993 it amounted to only Ft4.5 billion. The pace of the growth of small business loans was nearly the same in the last two years. In 1992 the amount of credit increased by Ft14.8 billion, while in 1993 it increased by Ft15.4 billion. The amount of loans taken out by businesses directly from abroad amounted to $1 billion, which increased gradually to $1.8 billion in the course of the year until September and remained constant by the end of the year. According to year-end data, the discrepancy in interest rates decreased. Although the decrease in the discrepancy between the interest rates for credits which would come due within the year and those which were taken out this year, which began in May, came to a halt in the fall, it continued in December, and as a result at the end of the year the discrepancy between interest rates was the lowest since May 1992 (9 percent).
