The C-3 silica gel with a mean radius of 48 A and a 200-250 ï¿½m mean grain size made in Gorkiy is used as the matrix, and the immunoglobulin fraction of the AIDS patient serum containing high titres of specific antibodies (1:3,000 in the indirect immunofluorescence reaction) is used as the ligand. The sorption binding of monocyte EVK/IRA/3 culture cells chronically infected with HIV-1 is summarized. Two approaches are used in the study: immobilization of antibodies to viral proteins expressed on the surface of affected cells on a rigid matrix and the use of nonspecific interactions of the model system cells with the sorbent cells. It is noted that no attempt was made to develop a superselective sorbent (selectivity is defined here as predominant sorption of HIV-infected cells compared to intact model system cells). The findings make it possible to speculate that one can develop a selective sorbent for predominant binding of HIV-infected cells by using an inert material, e.g., sepharose, as the matrix, and confirm the feasibility of immunosorption binding of cells expressing HIV proteins. The approach aimed at removing HIV proteins, intact virions, and circulating immune complexes from the blood or plasma with the help of immunosorbents is recognized as promising while the use of immunosorbents synthesized in vivo is thought to be debatable. The immunosorbents demonstrate a selectivity rate of 92% vs. 29% for the control group. Tables 1; references 9: 1 Russian, 8 Western.
