Oelofse] [Text] Mmabatho March 21 SAPA -- The recently-appointed joint administrators of Bophuthatswana released a report at the weekend detailing their progress in the territory since the violence which toppled President Lucas Mangope. Signed by administrators Dr Job Mokgoro and Dr Tjaart van der Walt, the report states the "administration is now in the process of creating interim structures and mechanisms to address grievances presented by existing structures". On the heated issue of pension funds, the administrators said: "for those who prefer to opt out, the office of the administrators has briefed pension experts to advise on the feasibility of, and mechanisms of, effecting pay-out." Amid widespread claims of mismanagement and corruption of the Sefalana Employee Benefits Organisation (SEBO), the administrators have authorised an investigation into all SEBO's affairs. The investigating structure includes both employer and employee representatives. Unfair dismissals under Mr Mangope are also being considered. The administrators stated they were aware "of a number of actions taken against employees, in particular in the public and and parastatal sectors, which were based on the so-called security laws of the former Bophuthatswana government. There is no doubt that in a normal democracy such laws have no place". A commitment is made to "reverse all dismissals and suspensions motivated by political considerations". On the issue of "expatriate staff" the administrators said there were indications that some expatriates "have been excessively remunerated and many have allegedly been placed in positions for which they lack appropriate qualifications". This also would be redressed. On security, the administrators would make "every effort" to revamp the security forces and immediately start the process of integrating them into appropriate forces within South Africa. Employers in Bophuthatswana are urged to "handle cases of absenteeism with the greatest sympathy and sensitivity". However, the administrators appealed to all employees to return to work as soon as possible.
