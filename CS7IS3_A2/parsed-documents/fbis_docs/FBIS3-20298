This was reported by the Environment Ministry of the land in Wiesbaden on Monday [28 March]. The pipe in question in Block A, where contaminated water had leaked out from a pipe for the taking of samples, was checked. First results of a metallographical expert report of the Krafwerksunion (KWU) Company showed that the major number of cracks had probably been caused by chlorine, it was stated. The nuclear supervisory board in Hesse took out a one-meter long section of the defective pipe of the pressure-keeping system. Part of it will be further checked in a Finnish material-testing laboratory. According to its own information, the Environment Ministry will only agree to repairs when the cause of the damage has been clarified without any doubt.
