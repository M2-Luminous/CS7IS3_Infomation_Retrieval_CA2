"They had better understand in Belgrade that this time the international community is determined," said Andreatta, who acknowledged that Draskovic did not see eye to eye with Italy on the threatened air strikes, but that the meeting had been useful. Draskovic leads the strongest opposition party in Belgrade's parliament, called the Party of Serbian Renewal. He told ANSA today that a NATO military strike would be a "very serious mistake, and could signal the beginning of a disaster for the Balkans, and perhaps for all of Europe. I have never spared my criticisms of Radovan Karadzic and the other Bosnian Serb extremists," Draskovic said, "but if NATO planes bombard them, I would have to take their side." But he warned the Bosnians Serbs that "there is no choice," Sarajevo "must be unblocked." He said he hoped "they are aware of the necessity to withdraw from their positions," if they "don't want to be held responsible for further massacres." He also said he did not think the Serb ultranationalists would carry through on their threats to take reprisals against Italy in the event of an air strike. (In another context tonight, Italian Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, at a press conference with foreign journalists, said that "while Italy is exposed geographically to reprisals, we don't believe this danger is real." He said he felt Italy was protected not only by the NATO European defense network, but also by the fact "that we don't think there will be any reprisals coming from the other side of the Adriatic.") Andreatta, speaking after today's meeting with Draskovic, said he thought that the European Union would take up the problem of the air strike in a scheduled meeting at the beginning of next week (and not in an emergency meeting before the Sunday deadline, as had been rumored.) "By now the question is in the hands of the UN, not the EU," Andreatta said. Italy's diplomatic chief said he told his Serbian interlocutor that "once this initiative has been put in motion, it can only be stopped when the Bosnian Serbs have the good sense to withdraw their artillery or give it over to the UN." "It's not even a question of saving face, it's just a question of guaranteeing that the people of Sarajevo no longer get blown up by these weapons," Andreatta said. Although he and Draskovic did not see eye to eye on the ultimatum, Andreatta said he "admired" the Serb opposition figure's "judgment" and his desire "to bring Serbia back to its place among the European nations." The Serb opposition leader said he believed the moment was exceptionally good for a negotiated settlement, because "people in all three camps are weary of fighting" and their chiefs "are incapable of rallying the forces needed for their respective armies." But a NATO strike would call everything into question, he said, allowing "the Albanians of the Kosovo to feel encouraged about proclaiming their own state while the Turks might decide to join the fray alongside the Muslims," the Serbian MP said. "And the Russians? Who can rule out their intervening?" he added. Draskovic said he didn't think the stalemate would continue until NATO actually dropped bombs. The Bosnian Serbs would withdraw their heavy weapons to 20km from the capital, he believes, "especially if they have UN and NATO guarantees that the Muslims won't take advantage of their withdrawal to move in their militias."
