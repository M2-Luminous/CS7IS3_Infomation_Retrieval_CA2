The clandestine group made the announcement in a letter to Hermilda Gaviria de Escobar, mother of the late drug trafficker Pablo Escobar, in which it reported that, contrary to the intentions of the Escobar family to sign a peace agreement, remnants of the Medellin Cartel are not thinking of peace. "You and the criminal organization of your late son know of our capacity. Our objective is to stop the appearance of new Machiavellian individuals like Pablo Escobar," the Pepes noted. It added that "your intention is not shared by the remaining Medellin Cartel members. This is an aspect that worries us because it would turn us into victims, a situation that we will not accept under any circumstances."
