It is tiding over surpluses in facilities and staffing by increasing sales and utilizing the group's strength; but in manifesting its latent power it is causing damage to other auto firms. In late August at Toyota Motors headquarters in Toyoda City, Aichi Prefecture, the first "emergency" meeting in 35 years was held. It was an "emergency meeting of Toyota dealership association officers" bringing together some 100 major dealers. Regular meetings are held once every two months; but August is "summer vacation" so that the one after the June meeting usually is in September. Toyota Motors president Tatsuro Toyoda, stood to greet them and explained, "Its is because I would be uneasy if I did not see you all (dealers) for the three months until September." What president Toyoda meant by uneasiness is the worsening of earnings, such that an operating deficit is even conceivable for the current December interim quarter. Also, the lower operating rate is such that a whole factory is said to be surplus. Director Shigeharu Tsuji, in charge of domestic operations, says: "Toyota has traditionally persevered while the manufacturer and dealers shared a common understanding and pursued a single goal. Even so, I think there are still things about the manufacturer that dealers find hard to understand. So, this time we had quite a detailed explanation from the top about Toyota's operating environment. This was the main purpose of the meeting." As a result, the "operating environment explanation" tied into a call for increased sales; and it is not hard to imagine that there may be calls for price cutting. So, if the operating rate goes up, they can get by without raising employment issues, and the cooperating parts makers can be saved as well. About To Demonstrate Latent Selling Power Toyota's worsened performance is caused by stagnation in domestic sales and the rapid rise of the yen. The June 1993 quarter current-account earnings fell to 40 percent of their past peak in the 1990 June quarter; but now the focus of the problem is shifting to facilities and staff from merely worsened earnings. Squeezing out facility surpluses properly is difficult; but as one criterion we will look at a comparison of the average monthly production of vehicles for the five big makers since 1988, plus average monthly production for January through August this year. Except for Mitsubishi Motors, which had increased RV [recreational vehicle] production in recent years, we find a peak in 1990 and recent production holding at about 70-80 percent of that. For Toyota, its latest vehicle tally is at 86.4 percent of its peak. Furthermore, in late 1992 the plant of its Toyota Motors Kyushu subsidiary went into operation; this month the Iwate plant of the group's Kanto Auto Industries goes into operation; and late this year Toyota Auto Body's Inabe plant will be operational. Yet, one must discount these facts just a bit. First, because during the peak period they were going all-out with overtime and work on holidays, the peak production level was somewhat "abnormal." Also, as Toyota Auto Body says, it is normal for "the new plants' share not to equate directly to facility increases because when the new plants go operational we will be doing things like idling facilities whose capacity increases were forced in the bubble era." Even taking such things into account, a Toyota leader admits to "the fact of a surplus at present." In August the plant's operation was cut by one day from the planned level by making the 16th a day off. Reduced production due to increased days off occurred for the first time since 1955. The facility problem is sure to become paired with staffing problems. At Toyota, employment adjustments such as limiting new hires and short-term temporary duty for the production staff are already being seen. In August it was decided to cut in half the initially projected 1,000 April 1994 hires of production staff from among high school and technical school graduates. From the outset, college graduates to be hired were 400, down 40 percent from the previous year. Temporary workers, too, numbering 2,900 in 1990--the peak year--are now approaching zero. Again, 175 production cadres from such plants as Aichi and Motomachi have been sent off to Toyota Auto Body. Split into two teams, they will have the status of temporary-duty workers for three months each during September-December. If such employment adjustments suffice, the burden imposed on employees will be comparatively small; but that assumes domestic production will not fall any further. To keep from being driven to using temporary layoffs and voluntary retirements, sustaining the plants' operating rates is essential. All they can do is expand sales; but autos are not an industry that can put out new products one after another based on bright ideas; and their appeal naturally starts with the price. Toyota has a flock of such strong dealerships that it is called "Toyota of sales." Its 41.7 percent share of the domestic market (excluding light cars) already shows its strength fully; and yet in fact it still holds strength in reserve. For example, given its surplus funds, it could pass out sales incentive funds. Other carmakers always fear such latent power. And yet, the criticism is nervously made that so far the bigger Toyota has become "the more it seems to want everything for itself." As a result, it has avoided conditions such as would ultimately drive other firms to the wall. Yet, now it comes down to Toyota itself being driven to the wall over "issues of facilities and personnel." The reality is that, to ensure a soft landing for itself, it cannot be concerned about the others. And yet, Toyota's earnings now face an unprecedented crisis. If it pushes its sales expansion offensive too far, it will suffer losses. How far it goes with that depends on whether it can calculate improvements in the management environment for the medium range and whether it has methods to deal with that skillfully. Walls Standing in Way at Home and Abroad If domestic production (domestic sales and exports) makes progress under current conditions even minimally and overseas production runs according to plan, Toyota can be an international firm preserving its high standing at home and abroad without making large employment adjustments or discarding facilities. Yet, in actuality, in domestic sales, exports, and production abroad there are differences of degree and barriers intervene. First of all, there are no signs that domestic sales are recovering. While domestic registrations in September were down 5 percent from the same month last year and have improved from the double-digit reduction at the middle of this year, many see this as largely the effect of model changes of such popular car types as the Skyline and Accord and not a change in the underlying tone. Director Tsuji of Toyota says, "The present situation is one of a `reluctance to buy' deriving from such things as uneasiness over the future course of business. We derive hope from such things as the new government's economic policies and the Tokyo motor show opening this month. But our real sense is that we are in the dark about any clear-cut time for recovery." Among analysts and others involved a common view is that in mid-1994 there will be an upturn in demand for cars along with economic recovery. This also depends on the economy, and the timing may slip; but there will certainly be replacement buying for that portion sold in a burst in the bubble era. So, one may foresee at least a surge in domestic demand in the mid-1990's. But, most forecasts do not see that happening to the extent of its level much surpassing that of 1990. Now, as to exports, shipments to Europe and the United States, making up 65 percent of Japan's car exports, are severely affected by price increases responding to the high yen. Passenger car sales in the United States were up 8.1 percent in August compared to the same month last year; but those exported from Japan were down 2.1 percent. Japanese carmakers have set much larger price increases than the U.S. Big Three makers for the 1994 models being released this fall; and, along with the quality improvements in U.S. cars of late, this greatly lowers the competitiveness of Japanese cars. In Europe, too, Japanese cars not only have weakened price competitiveness, but the outlook for car demand within the EC area is a drop of 16 percent. Due to this, in September the car-export monitoring framework for the EC in 1993--set in April at 1.085 million vehicles--was reduced to 980,000. Any recovery in demand next year also is moot. Medium- and long-range exchange rates are generally expected to be anywhere from the present level to about 100 yen per dollar. Exports of Toyotas and other Japanese cars to Europe and the United States are gradually falling for two reasons: lessened competitiveness and expanded local production. At Toyota, they say, "We will strive to develop demand in places like Southeast Asia and China" so as to make up for this. Yet, current demand for autos in Asia is of only 34 million vehicles; and, except for a handful of countries like Thailand, the pace for market expansion is not at all clear. Whatever the long-range prospect, for the present it would be difficult for this alone to compensate for declining exports to Europe and the United States. Trump Card Is Group Strength That being so, the scenario of domestic production stagnating even more in the near future is not unrealistic. That brings up the matter of surplus staffing. Normally, the ways to avoid personnel reductions are to sustain operating rates by expanding sales and to improve profits by raising prices, et cetera. Yet, at Toyota they also have an additional trump card: a "group strength" that is sturdier than that of the other companies. As to price increases, Director Tsuji says, "Before that, cutting costs is important. Price increases are one way, too; but at a time when the market is sluggish the effect of that on sales is large." So, they still have one option left. The Toyota group's solidarity is firm, causing a weakening of any sense of their using people excessively. At Toyota there is a whole group of companies that were formed shortly after the founding of the predecessor Toyota Auto Industries by splitting them off and making them autonomous. They number 14, including the parent firm of Toyota itself, Toyota Automatic Loom Works, the later merged Daihatsu, et al., with most being parts makers. In the face of the current recession, they have set a practice at Toyota of transferring people within the group, as is seen in the case of Toyota Auto Body. Further, it is expected that from now on, too, they will skillfully control prosperity and idleness of the firm itself and of its group firms in car types and parts, absorbing any surplus personnel. So, the outcome will be that they can deftly work out ways to keep people on not only at Toyota but at all the firms. That means they have, even before now, been making a number of skillful "cooperative plays" aimed at trying to maintain earnings at each firm in the group. As an example, Toyoda Boshoku, weak in earning power relative to the others, has in the past also been shifting the manufacture of all kinds of parts to other companies in the group. Starting this quarter, it is even getting orders for air bags from Toyoda Gosei. Again, Toyota considered the big deficits of Toyota Machine Works and is increasing its orders somewhat. The Toyota group is thought to be showing its ability to respond and so to adapt to conditions even in solving personnel problems. That being so, its impact on manufacturers with few trading or capital connections may be inevitable. Shifting Overseas Not Easy Expanding overseas production is the inevitable route for the internationalization of Japanese manufacturers, and an effective way to avoid the risks of exchange fluctuations. Toyota's overseas production for the 1993 June quarter was 830,000 units, and it plans 930,000 for the current quarter. As major bases, its plant in England began operation at the end of 1992, and its second plant (TMM [Toyoto Motor Manufacturing]) in Kentucky will start up in the spring of 1994. At Toyota they speak as follows about their ideas on production abroad: "Fundamental, first of all, is that it is best to produce locally the cars to be sold abroad. Our plans for production overseas were in place before the to-do about the high yen. Still, since the past and current pace of the high yen has a major effect on exports, a shift overseas is good policy even in the sense of avoiding that" (Director Hideichi Kumabe). With all of that, it is no longer true that promoting production abroad is all to the good. First, the issue has arisen of balancing that against sustaining domestic operating rates. The Camry scheduled for production at TMM's Plant No. 2 is now being built at the Tsutsumi plant in Aichi. TMM's Plant No. 2 initially had to raise its operating rate slowly while watching the operation of the Tsutsumi plant. Also, it is unrealistic for any and all to be shifted abroad. Conversely, the carmakers are in a situation where they can neither achieve a considerable global division of functions in a progressive way nor escape exchange-rate risks. Even at Toyota, says Director Kumabe, "We are even studying something we could call an international horizontal division of functions--where it would be good, in the future, to build and where to sell, taking a more global view than we do now. Yet, there are problems of distribution costs and each nation's legal restrictions on auto imports, so that it is not easy." In short, some exported cars will have to continue indefinitely to be built in Japan even as it is further raising its labor costs, high by international standards, and while remaining exposed to the risk of the high yen's progress. It may be that Toyota's December 1993 interim accounts settlement will fall into an operating deficit. The "10 billion yen" which is the company's stated goal was premised on 110 yen per dollar, but it is all but certain that the reality will be a yen higher than that. One analyst foresees that "if Toyota goes into a deficit balance at this time, the other auto firms may `feel at ease' about the 1994 March quarter and announce deficits." But, about the time that the other companies put out their March quarter balances, Toyota may be steadily pushing forward its policies for resolving the problems it currently confronts. One cannot gainsay the possibility that its soft-landing scenario will link into the other firms' hard landing.
