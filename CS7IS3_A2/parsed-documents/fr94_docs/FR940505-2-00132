SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2732) (the Act), the Coast Guard may certify, on an annual basis, an alternative voluntary advisory group (advisory group) in lieu of Regional Citizens' Advisory councils for Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound, Alaska. The Coast Guard published guidelines on December 31, 1992, to assist groups seeking recertification under the Act (57 FR 62600). The Coast Guard issued a policy statement on July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36505), to certify the factors that the Coast Guard would be considering in making its determination as to whether advisory groups should be certified in accordance with the Act; and the procedures which the Coast Guard would follow in meeting its certification responsibilities under the Act. The Coast Guard has received an application for recertification of PWSRCAC, the currently certified advisory group for the Prince William Sound region. In accordance with the review and certification process contained in the policy statement, the Coast Guard now solicits comments from interested groups including oil terminal facility owners and operators, owners and operators of crude oil tankers calling at the terminal facilities, and fishing, aquacultural, recreational and environmental citizens groups, concerning the recertification application of PWSRCAC. At the conclusion of the comment period, the Coast Guard will review all application materials and comments received and will take one of the following actions: (a) Recertify the advisory groups under 33 U.S.C. 2732(o). (b) Issue a conditional recertification for a period of 90 days, with a statement of any discrepancies which must be corrected to qualify for recertification for the remainder of the year. (c) Deny recertification of the advisory group if the Coast Guard finds that the group is not broadly representative of the interests and communities in the area or is not adequately fostering the goals and purposes of the Act. The Coast Guard will notify PWSRCAC by letter of the action taken on its application. A notice will be published in the Federal Register to advise the public of the Coast Guard's determination. Dated: April 29, 1994. A.E. Henn, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection.
