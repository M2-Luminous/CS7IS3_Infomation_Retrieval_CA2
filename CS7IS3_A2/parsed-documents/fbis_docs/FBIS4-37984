What are the real reasons for this? [Tahir] The other party in Sanaa has fully prepared for the war over a long period of time. The treacherous attacks on our units in the north were practical "rehearsals" for this war. Moreover, the regime in Sanaa has thrown in all the army and tens of thousands of armed tribes that are loyal to this regime and to 'Abdallah Bin- Husayn al-Ahmar. It also mobilized the entire human and material resources of the state in this war. As for us, we confronted this all-out war with modest human and material resources because the balance of power between us and them is no more than one to 10. This means every 10 brigades by Sanaa will be met by only one brigade on our side. For example, 7,500 troops attacked our (southern) 650-strong 3d Armored Brigade, which was stationed in the outskirts of Sanaa. Nevertheless, this war has failed to achieve its strategic objectives. As you may know, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his advisers had planned to settle accounts with what they termed "separatists" in two or three days. [Al-Qallab] Why were you late in your reply at the start of the war, especially after the destruction of your brigades in the north? Were you not expecting a northern military action of such magnitude? [Tahir] In fact, and as you have said, we never expected 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to go so far as to launch an all-out war against our people. The war began by attacking and annihilating our brigades in the north and then by storming our borders from four directions. This was accompanied by random artillery, missile, and air bombardment of villages, houses, and schools. Vital economic installations like the Aden refineries, water and power stations, and secure residential areas were also bombed. Actually, we had a bitter experience with 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, from whom we saw nothing but maneuvers. We were also not prepared for this war which was imposed on us. Nevertheless, our Armed Forces and people confronted the aggressors in all governorates after it became certain that the aim of the war is occupation and domination of the south, something which has never been accomplished. The war is entering its 50th day and the steadfastness of our people and forces is, in all criteria, considered victory. [Al-Qallab] You spoke about Sudanese and Iraqi participation in the fighting against you, but you did not prove that through prisoners, equipment, or other evidence. [Tahir] There is absolutely no doubt about the participation of Iraq and Sudan in this war on the side of the regime in Sanaa. There are Iraqi military experts and soldiers fighting with the northern forces. Some of them were captured at Shabwah axis. There was audio and visual news media coverage of this subject. I can confirm to you that the war launched against us is totally run by Iraqi expertise. Sudan is also directly or indirectly participating in this war, thus proceeding from the declared alliance between the two regimes in Sanaa and Khartoum--an alliance in which the extremists play a basic and decisive role. The "Arab Afghan" groups are also fighting with the northern forces. [Al-Qallab] Is it true that there are northern penetrations in your ranks? [Tahir] It is quite natural for the so-called penetrations to occur, not only in our ranks, but also in the ranks of the northern forces. The reason is that we were one state. As for us, we did not think with a conspiratorial mentality or work with intelligence methods as the other party did. In any case, this had no impact on our forces' combat position on the fronts. The war the other party triggered against our people was an all-out war which was opposed by all not only in the south but also in the north as well as in the Arab homeland and the entire world. Matters have become clear and the war is no longer a war against "rebels" or "separatists" as Sanaa media rumored. It emerged as a war against en entire people and state, which is the Democratic Republic of Yemen. [Al-Qallab] Does President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih want indeed to see Aden fall, or did he intend to pressure you on that front in order to keep your forces in this area so that he can divert his attention to the oil-rich region of Shabwah? [Tahir] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih cannot take Aden or occupy the oil-rich areas in Shabwah. The only thing he could do was to bring about further damage and destruction in Yemen, murder more innocent civilians, and destroy the northern and southern armies. Events since the eruption of fighting on 27 April confirmed that this is a losing war in which there will be no victors. Certainly, the results of this war will be against the wishes of those who ignited it. [Al-Qallab] The northerners are accusing you of receiving military aid from certain neighboring states. How true are these accusations? [Tahir] These accusations are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from the aid which the other party is receiving from a number of states. Foreign media and diplomatic sources revealed on several occasions the names of these states. [Al-Qallab] It is well known that you use Soviet and eastern- bloc weapons in general. How have you managed during the war, especially with spare parts? [Tahir] We have sufficient weapons and equipment to defend ourselves and the sovereignty of our state. [Al-Qallab] If there was a cease-fire, how will you deal with the issue of the Democratic Republic of Yemen's territory occupied by the northern troops during the war? [Tahir] The cease-fire is no longer a Yemeni issue, but an international one, according to UN Security Council Resolution 924 which was only adopted after 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refused to heed the calls of reason and logic and all the Arab appeals and initiatives to stop this war, which aims at murder and destruction. We have presented an initiative to set up a team of international observers to monitor the cease-fire and the withdrawal of the northern troops to the positions they occupied before the fighting started. Here, I wish to stress that we will not relinquish a single inch of the Democratic Republic of Yemen's territory. [Al-Qallab] Do you think things will stop at that point if a cease-fire goes into effect, or will the war take another shape? [Tahir] This war was imposed on us by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his regime. We are defending ourselves and our people's right to a dignified, free life without any humiliation or submission. Our people have chosen their own future and path by supporting the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen which is based on law and order and respect for human rights. [Al-Qallab] Since you are the defense minister and aware of many things, who do you think is planning and running the operations on the northern side? [Tahir] I was the defense minister of the Republic of Yemen and I am now the defense minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. I know that the military regime in Sanaa has long ago planned this all-out war against our people in the Democratic Republic of Yemen. I know that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's advisers and Iraqi military experts have planned and run the military operations against our people. Their schemes, however, failed, or, at least, were not implemented according to plan. They only succeeded in inflicting further human losses and destroy and sabotage the economic infrastructure in the northern and southern parts of Yemen. [Al-Qallab] What are the real losses in men and equipment? [Tahir] If we are talking about military losses within the southern army, these are very small and limited, despite the acts of treachery against our units that were based in the north. As for civilians, there were great losses because the battles were fought on our land and because the northern troops deliberately and indiscriminately bombarded, with rockets and artillery and from the air, the towns and villages, including the capital Aden, leaving hundreds of dead and wounded among the innocent, defenseless people. You can be certain that the civilian losses on the northern side are very small because from the beginning, our forces were eager not to hit the cities and residential areas in the north. As for the military, the northern troops suffered major losses, which I estimate at scores of thousands of dead and wounded. This is because our forces were in a defensive position while the other troops were attacking. Furthermore, the Sanaa regime was throwing in scores of thousands of untrained young men who had no faith in this losing war. [Al-Qallab] Why did the northern forces bombard southern airports and vital targets at a time when you ceased to attack the northern airports, although you bombarded Sanaa airport at the beginning of the fighting? [Tahir] We did not bombard Sanaa airport. We only bombarded military targets in this airport and scored accurate hits on the first day of war. We did not bombard any vital, economic, or service targets, contrary to the northern forces which indiscriminately attacked power and water stations, oil refineries, schools, hospitals, and residential areas. All northern air raids and attacks, however, did not score any worthwhile hits against our military targets despite the Iraqi and other foreign expertise and aid. [Al-Qallab] Is it true that the northerners are pushing you to declare a state in Hadhramaut, so they can turn Aden into a free zone and annex the governorates captured by the northern forces? [Tahir] There is no doubt about it. The Sanaa regime's talk about legitimacy and unity is an exposed media and political deception. However, I assert to you that our people will courageously and valiantly resist and will defend every inch of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. [Al-Qallab] What proposal on unity will you accept, now that the previous formula has failed and resulted in this devastating war? [Tahir] It is difficult to discuss any formula for a unity with Sanaa's military regime which slaughtered unity and wanted to annihilate our people and occupy their territory. [Al-Qallab] Why has there thus far been no Arab recognition of you? Does this mean that you entered the war without having made good calculations and good assessment of the situation? [Tahir] What we care about is that our people have chosen their path, and the steadfastness of our Armed Forces and people in a devastating total war for almost two months calls for pride. This is the real recognition of our existence as an independent state on the ground. The Arab and international recognition will be made on this basis soon. With regard to saying that we entered the war without good calculations, we actually did not enter this war. It was imposed on us, and they planned this war without our knowledge. However, their calculations were wrong because they announced that they would finish it in two or three days. But the war has been raging for approximately 60 days, which means that their calculations were wrong although they planned this war. [Al-Qallab] Why did 'Ali Salim al-Bid move to Hadhramaut? Does this mean that you believed that Aden would fall? [Tahir] The presence of brother (President) 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Hadhramaut was part of a plan to distribute the political leadership members among the governorates and areas in order to lead and guide the defensive and tactical actions on various battlefronts, especially since the Sanaa regime aimed to occupy all southern governorates, which now constitute the Democratic Republic of Yemen. In any case, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid has accomplished his mission and he is now in Aden. Meanwhile, other leadership members are still distributed among the governorates, and some others are on diplomatic and political missions abroad.
