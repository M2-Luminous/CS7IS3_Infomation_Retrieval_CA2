Representing the Government during the negotiations were Lieutenant General Khin Ngunt, secretary general of the State Law and Order Reform Council or SLORC, and other high-ranking military officers including Major General Kett Sein, commander of the Burmese Army in the southeastern region. It was reported that Nai Shwe Kyin, 81, leader of the New Mon State Party, did not attend the meeting. The negotiations are scheduled to begin 17 March at the command headquarters of the Burmese southeastern army region in Moulmein, where the two sides earlier held similar talks. The chairman of the New Mon State Party reportedly disagreed with the idea of holding peace talks with the SLORC because, he believed, the latter is insincere and has no intention of accepting conditions proposed by the Mon side. The conditions proposed for the peace talks by the Mon included the presence during the negotiations of representatives of neutral nations, news media, and the United Nations, release of all political prisoners, a nationwide cease fire, and meetings with representatives of the DAB, or Democratic Alliance of Burma. Rangoon could not accept all the conditions proposed by the two factions, particularly the one calling for the meeting to be held in Thailand, because the request was turned down by the Thai Government. A source in the New Mon State Party said the party has accepted the proposal for cease-fire talks because it wanted to demonstrate its intention to settle the conflict through peaceful means. The success of the negotiations, however, depends on the sincerity of the SLORC. He noted that the party's decision to come to the negotiating table with the SLORC should not be viewed as an act of disarmament or giving up the struggle for the Mon national cause. As long as the military regime is in power, the party will not give up its weapons. A [Thai] National Security Council source told PHUCHATKAN that the cease-fire talks between the Mon and SLORC are likely to be successful. The two sides are expected to sign a cease-fire agreement in April. The Karen group will reportedly hold peace talks with Rangoon in the near future.
