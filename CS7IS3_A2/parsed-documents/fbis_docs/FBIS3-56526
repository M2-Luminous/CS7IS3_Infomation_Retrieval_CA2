The President announced this Monday [17 January] to the Vilnius-based chiefs of diplomatic missions. He said he was planning to visit Belarus and invite his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk to visit Lithuania. Treaties on cooperation and neighborly relations were likely to be signed as a result of those visits. Algirdas Brazauskas felt relations had improved between his republic and Russia. The discussion, he said, would soon resume of an agreement on military transits from Russia to the Kaliningrad region via Lithuanian territory. The Lithuanian President told diplomats that calls for the revision of the Pottsdam conference's decision on the Kaliningrad region had nothing to do with his administration's official foreign policy line. The calls were coming from certain members of the Lithuanian parliament.
