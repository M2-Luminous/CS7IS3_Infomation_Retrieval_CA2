Wu Bangguo said: "Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our party has upheld and developed Mao Zedong Thought, and actively sought a socialist construction path suited to our nation's conditions; it has scored tremendous success in this respect. The most important thing is that it has finally found the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which Comrade Mao Zedong sought but failed to find in those days, thus enabling the formation of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialism with Chinese characteristics."
