In a news conference at the conclusion of his visit, Arsenis said that Hellenism's defense area from Thrace to the Aegean and over to Cyprus is unified and any defense plans that are separate are destined to fail. He added that a unified plan of this area increases the effectiveness of defense capabilities. The Greek national defense minister said that for Cyprus, specific decisions were made for cooperation covering all fields -- land, sea and air. In Cyprus, he added, there is an illegal occupation and presence of 35,000 Turkish troops, and within the framework of the defense cooperation a balance should be reestablished, since the occupation troops are not withdrawing, in order to safeguard the defense of the Republic of Cyprus. In this framework, he said, it has been agreed that the Cypriot National Guard needs substantial quantitative and qualitative upgrading in order to promote its capabilities. This relates to specific arms programs and the qualitative upgrade of personnel, he said. Arsenis stressed that what is important is that a program for work and a timeframe have been set, so that future meetings will deal with which specific measures have been implemented and not what is the meaning of the unified defense area. Replying to questions, Arsenis said that when there is an imbalance of forces, there can be no successful diplomatic negotiation. The deterioration of Hellenism's positions, Arsenis said, is largely the result of the military imbalance. Cypriot Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis said in the news conference that the direction started a few months ago is evident, and he expressed the hope that what has been jointly decided will be implemented even faster in the future.
