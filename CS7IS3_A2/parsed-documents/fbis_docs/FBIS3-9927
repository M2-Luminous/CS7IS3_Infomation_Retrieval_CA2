Enriquez Morales made this statement when asked about the recent changes in the so-called security cabinet, particularly the high-ranking military positions. [Enriquez] I believe the changes in the Army, as rightly said by Gen. Gonzalez Paracena on the commemoration of Tecun Uman's Day, are routine and we should get used to changes of that sort. Normally, posts are rotated and changes made each month. When these changes are implemented at a higher level, however, there is always some apprehension. I can tell you, however, that there is nothing extraordinary about these changes, which seek to strengthen the Army as an institution. [Reporter] Are destabilization attempts the cause for these changes? [Enriquez] The truth is we have been hearing rumors of a coup d'etat, destabilization, instability, and ungovernability for a long time. It seems to me that some people, individually or as a sector, would be pleased if the constitutional order were broken. As the defense minister, I want to let everyone know that I would defend the constitutional order with my own life if necessary. In addition, the officers of the Guatemalan Army are already very aware that one of their main roles is to preserve the constitutional order. I do not want to mention the 25 May and 1 June events again, but they truly exemplify the Army's new attitude. I have also said the democratic process will not be consolidated by imposing a dictatorship in Guatemala, which is what many might want. A democratic system may not be perfect, but it has been proven to be the best system. The problem is that we have not learned yet to live in a democracy. Sometimes, we confuse democracy with excess freedom. The reason there are protests by many sectors of the population is because we demand only rights and forget our obligations. [Reporter] What are [words indistinct] that the president mentioned, such as [word indistinct] the country's institutions, strengthen the Army's unity, and he also mentioned kidnappings? [Enriquez] I have told you that we must strengthen the institutions, and the president, with every reason, has been very concerned with the inefficiency of the work done by the security cabinet. A case in point is the resignation of Government Minister Ortiz Moscoso, to whom I send my regards and respect. He is a very good and kind person. It seems there was somewhat of a lack of coordination which hurt the security the state must provide its citizens. You are aware that the rate of kidnappings has increased abruptly, many estates have been invaded and war taxes imposed. In addition, some social sectors of the country have suffered disappointments and been disillusioned when they saw that the state's response did not conform with their expectations or has not been the appropriate response. As a result, the president must make his decisions, which, although political in nature, benefit the population in general. [Reporter] Did this lack of coordination you mentioned take place in the National Defense General Staff? [Enriquez] No, it occurred in the security cabinet. I believe there was somewhat of a lack of coordination between the security forces and the Government Ministry, which affected the security cabinet. This was not the reason for General Quilo's removal however. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Enriquez] Gen. Quilo is retiring. He will have his farewell party and leave with all the honors. I believe the president's decision regarding the removal of Gen. Quilo is reasonable. Gen. Quilo is a very good friend of mine. [Reporter] Would you recommend a military member for the Government Ministry? [Enriquez] I believe any citizen who is capable of fulfilling the duties of that position would be eligible. The candidate must also inspire security given the current situation of uneasiness and disquiet that stems mainly from the high crime rates in Guatemala. That a military member might become president is not so farfetched because it is the right of any citizen. It could be a military member who has retired or resigned, or it could be a civilian, which is what I tend to believe the most probable. [Reporter] Could the Army propose a candidate? [Gen. Enriquez] The Army should not recommend candidates for civilian positions. I believe the Army would be wrong to recommend anyone to the president because he already knows many people who can cooperate with him. If at any time, however, the president asks for advice, we would be willing to comply in a very institutional manner. [Reporter] What is your opinion on the article published in THE MIAMI HERALD, which argues that the president and the Army are very close? [Enriquez] You must see that they have always said that. You must recall that former President Vinicio Cerezo, in his campaign, used to say the Army should return to its barracks, and after his victory, Cerezo was accused of being too close to the Army. This should not surprise anyone. The Army is a disciplined and obedient institution. Once one becomes familiar with the Army, one gives it the credibility and the respect it deserves for its loyalty to the institutions, the president, and the entire democratic system it defends. I repeat, we still have a long way to go to consolidate our democracy. [Reporter] Reports have said the Army was going to cooperate in the investigation of some kidnappings. Are there any clues so far; what investigations have been conducted? [Enriquez] I believe the Army is cooperating through the Intelligence Directorate, and it is participating in joint actions with this purpose in mind, specifically in the case of Jorge Carpio Nicolle, although we have many problems in Guatemala such as kidnappings, war taxes, estates invasions, and robberies. This case, however, is special and has caused a stir worldwide because it involved Carpio Nicolle, who was not only a professional but also a former presidential candidate, and the owner of EL GRAFICO newspaper. All cases are dealt with in the same manner, but regarding this particular case, I believe the president's decision to appoint representatives from various sectors to investigate this crime is the right one.
