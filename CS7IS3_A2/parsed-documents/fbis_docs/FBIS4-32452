Zdravko Kleva reporting. [Kleva] [Video shows Brijuni and the meeting] Assessing the international position of Croatia and Istria and problems at the local level, it was seen as useful to form an advisory body. Consequently, journalists were told after the constituent session in Brijuni, the Council for Istria was formed. Today's session was attended by 12 of the 17 members appointed by Franjo Tudjman, the head of state. Other state officials also attended. [Begin recording] [Nevio Sesto, not further identified] We know that two people are out of the country and they could not attend. Two more people apologized for not being able to attend. Only one member has not turned up without a word. [Unidentified correspondent] There was one more member. [Sesto] Yes, we received a request to extend our membership, that is, that a member of the Istrian County branch of the Association of Croatian Volunteers in the War for the Homeland wanted to join us, and we accepted that. We expect the president of the republic to soon appoint Mr. Ivan Pletikosa as a new member of the Council for Istria. [end recording] [Kleva] The Council for Istria will be active in five groups which will propose solutions for strategic issues in Istria--from demographic issues and those concerning culture and education to economic issues. Advisory groups will be set up to work on relations between the state administration and local government. The council will present its proposals to county and central state authorities. [Begin Monsignor Josip Pavlisic, president of the Council for Istria, recording] On my part, I believe that it is useful to give a good word or thought to those who seek our advice in order to coordinate the needs and wishes of the head of the republic and local bodies. We are not advising political parties, but people holding certain posts. The president of the republic is the president of all Croats and people living on Croatian territory. We decided that we had to take that into account, and our actions, discussions, and advice will not refer to a party or the opposition, but how best to achieve the best conditions for development and improvement of living conditions. [end recording] [Kleva] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman invited representatives of the local public and political life to a luncheon in honor of the members of the Council for Istria today. The mayors of Istrian towns and Istrian County Prefect Luciano Delbianco apologized and did not attend the luncheon.
