FR940224-0-00070 FR940224-0-00013 MSHA also feels that 405 KAR 12:010 section 3(5)(a), regarding inspection frequency, should be revised in order to clarify that a reduction in partial inspection frequency cannot occur until after Phase I reclamation. In reviewing the proposed revisions to section 3(5)(a), as discussed in Finding III.B.2. herein, the Director has determined that Kentucky's proposal is no less effective than the Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 840.11 (a) and (f). The Federal rule clearly provides the regulatory authority with certain discretion in conducting partial inspections of inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operations. In subsection (f), the rule identifies an inactive site as one for which the regulatory authority has received notice of temporary cessation of operations. Kentucky's proposal is consistent with the Federal rule in that it allows for a reduction in partial inspections upon completion of Phase I reclamation, or upon receipt of notification of temporary cessation of operations. Therefore, the Director believes that the proposal is acceptable as submitted. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the program amendment as submitted by Kentucky on May 21, 1993, and revised and resubmitted on June 14, 1993, and October 19, 1993. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 917 codifying decisions concerning the Kentucky program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage the State to conform its program with the Federal standards without delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq .). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence is not required. VI. Procedural Determinations Executive Order 12866 This final rule is exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq. Regulatory Flexibility Act
