She, however, underscored that this stand does not mean that certain missions will not be allowed to come, but only on condition that they announce they are arriving in Yugoslavia, and not in Kosovo (Serbia's southern province), Vojvodina (Serbia's northern province) or the Raska region (southeast region in Serbia, Turkish name Sandzak). Savovic said that there had been attempts that the activities of permanent missions be carried out by the representatives of several embassies in Yugoslavia, who had even submitted reports about their findings. They were, however, warned that this is out of the question. Yugoslavia also cannot accept the proposal by a Swedish independent foundation that U.N. civilian rule be imposed in Kosovo due to the alleged human rights violations in this Serbian province, because this represents an attempt to internationalize the situation in Kosovo and impose a U.N. protectorate in Yugoslavia, the minister said. The same or similar reasons exist for refusing a permanent UNESCO representative in Kosovo to help organize the situation in the province's education system, because this is an internal affair which should be resolved through talks rather than internationalization, Savovic said. For decades the Albanian separatists in Kosovo have been trying to secede this province from Serbia, i.e. Yugoslavia, and annex it to neighbouring Albania. The Albanian separatists are also using classical terrorist tactics of attacking the police and army. A letter by the Islamic Organization Conference to the U.N. Security Council about the violation of the human rights of the allegedly indigenous 'Bosnian Moslem' population in Raska (Sandzak), also represents interference in Yugoslavia's internal affairs together with a statement by Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic that the so-called 'Moslem national council of Sandzak' should be included in the talks on the resolution of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, Savovic said. Raska is a region divided between Montenegro, Serbia and the ex- Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is mainly populated by Moslems. Extremist Moslem leaders are persistently trying to annex this region to the Bosnian Moslem territories. Throughout the entire war in Bosnia, the Raska Moslems have supplied the Bosnian Moslems with weapons and manpower. The Yugoslav human rights minister said that the Yugoslav government would write to the U.N. Human Rights Commission to deny a draft resolution by this commission, as well as 84 letters to this international body, about the alleged human rights violations and ethnic cleansing in Vojvodina and southern Baranja. Hungarians are the biggest ethnic majority in the Vojvodina province and they enjoy the same rights as all Yugoslav citizens. Asked about the work of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Savovic said that this court would be more acceptable if it had a universal character, and did not deal solely with war crimes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Savovic said that lists consisting mainly of Serb names are being compiled for the Hague court and underscored that Yugoslavia will not extradite its citizens because this is prohibited by its constitution. All war criminals will be tried in Yugoslav courts according to Yugoslav laws.
