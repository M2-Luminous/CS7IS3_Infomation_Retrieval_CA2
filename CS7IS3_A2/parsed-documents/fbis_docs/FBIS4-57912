Campos: "In Varadero, `The Best is the Best'"] [Text] Varadero, Cuba -- A luxurious sun caresses the tourists who come to this beach resort, which in 1880 was absolutely pristine but now has plenty of excellent hotel facilities. Those who make repeat visits to the Hicacos peninsula claim that here, where the finest sand delights visitors for more than 20 km, the sun is more than a star. This is also a good place for tourist businesses and this is why the Cuban Tourism Convention, which is being held from 16 to 20 May, every year becomes more significant. The convention has been held in Havana, but the so-called blue beach is undoubtedly its pinnacle. Seeing visitors walk along the streets of Varadero or travel by car toward the end of this narrow sweep of land one might think this beach has always been a haven for vacationers, but this is not the case. The first luxury hotels emerged in the 1950's following a long period of neglect, during which pirates plundered the area and only a handful of landowners were present. The Internacional Hotel and some residences of the Kawama housing project are the oldest structures enhancing this landscape. Around the time these installations were being built, the peninsula also began to host Boston-style homes that were dismantled in Boston and moved to Varadero. The Ambrosio cave, which contains aboriginal drawings, and cays such as Mono Cay where seagulls make annual visits, is in Varadero. These and other characteristics make Varadero a superb and beautiful destination. [Words indistinct] green branches and glass-walled elevators, or the back-and-forth journeys of catamarans, yachts, and motor-boats cruising the sea. In spite of blistering heat, the 15th Annual Cuba Tourism Convention attracted many people to the 464-square meter Puntablanca Fair Room. While attending their own exhibition rooms or walking around in search of pleasant conversation, businessmen from 88 commercial firms in 26 countries are informing interested journalists from around the world about the possibilities of Cuba's nascent tourist industry. Cuba's Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos reported that Cuba expects some 1 million tourists in 1995. Many other Tourism Ministry officials, however, say they are getting ready to receive more than that. The island, which has many other beautiful attractions in addition to Varadero, has more than 7,000 rooms available, and negotiations are under way so that every year 2,000 new rooms become available, according to official reports. There are two especially significant attractions: the beaches, or let us say, the landscape; and the people. This is what we mean when we say "the best is the best," keeping in mind a suggestion by Rene Capriles, a Rio de Janeiro colleague who is one of the 85 foreign reporters covering the convention, which will close tomorrow. This blue beach located in an area that began to be utilized in 1883, when 10 people from the neighboring town of Cardenas decided to buy land, today is the standard of Cuban tourism. Many people from that town would have acquired peninsula land had they foreseen the admiration held for this paradise, which today is hosting numerous tourist installations. One gets the impression that without Varadero there might be no sun and no warmth anywhere else, when just the opposite is true. Varadero has become, perhaps, the standard for multitudes of Cuban tourist attractions. This is the reason why all of the businessmen at this convention are saying "the best is the best." It is true.
