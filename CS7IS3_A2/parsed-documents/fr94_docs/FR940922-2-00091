FR940922-2-00091 FR940922-2-00061 The transparency requirements are the most detailed and complex substantive provisions of the proposed Final Judgment, and therefore the most likely to be affected by regulatory changes in the United States and the United Kingdom as well as marketplace developments. They have been designed to be consistent with existing regulatory requirements in both countries, and they do not conflict in any way with the additional obligations recently imposed by the Federal Communications Commission as a precondition to its approval of the transactions between BT and MCI, following the filing of the proposed Final Judgment with the Court. 2 2 In re Request of MCI Communications Corporation [and] British Telecommunications plc Joint Petition for declaratory Ruling Concerning Section 310(b)(4) and (d) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, File No. I&hyph;S&hyph;P&hyph;93&hyph;013, FCC 94&hyph;188 (released July 25, 1994). It remains possible, however, that future actions by telecommunications regulatory authorities in the United States or the United Kingdom could give rise to conflicts with the Final Judgment, or that some of the transparency provisions could become unnecessary as the result of regulatory decisions or significant changes in the competitive environment in the United Kingdom affecting international telecommunications. Accordingly, the proposed Final Judgment was drafted to provide some flexibility for limited adjustments without unduly burdening the Court. The United States agreed to include in the proposed Final Judgment language giving it authority, upon express written notice to defendants and to the Court, to waive the transparency requirements in whole or in part without a prior public comment process or formal approval by the Court. This will enable the United States to respond rapidly to changing conditions that affect the enforcement and usefulness of these requirements. The United States would not, of course, be obliged to waive any of the transparency requirements merely because a regulatory agency adopted similar obligations for defendants, or took action giving rise to a conflict with the defendants' decree obligations. Nor would a decline in BT's market shares or other changes in its competitive position necessarily warrant modification. 3 The United States would, however, be able to modify the transparency requirements where desirable to further the public interest, without the need for lengthy comment filing periods or delays engendered from crowded court dockets. Often it will be useful, as ACC suggests, for the United States to obtain information from competitors as well as defendants before agreeing to modify any of the transparency requirements. There is nothing in the proposed Final Judgment that precludes the United States from soliciting the views of affected competitors on a case-by-case basis before reaching a decision, and indeed the United States expects that it would frequently do so. 3 Information disclosed in BT's most recent public report for 1994, which the United States obtained after the filing of the Complaint and proposed Final Judgment, indicates that BT's current market shares are no more than one to three percentage points below those stated in the Complaint and the Competitive Impact Statement. This report also acknowledges that there are signs that the rate of attrition of BT's market share for business customers is declining. ACC is incorrect in suggesting that this authority for the United States to waive the transparency requirements is somehow improper under the Tunney Act. The APPA requires that any proposal for a consent judgment submitted by the United States in a civil antitrust proceeding be filed with the district court, and directs that the consent judgment only be entered after the district court has found that it is in the public interest. 15 U.S.C. 16(b), (e). It nowhere precludes the district court, however, from concluding that it would be in the public interest to permit the United States to waive compliance with certain specified provisions of a consent judgment after its entry, so as to respond to regulatory or marketplace changes. ACC cites no authority to the contrary. Were the United States and the defendants to agree to a modification of this consent judgment after its entry, this Court would in any event be ``bound to accept any modification that the Department *␣*␣* reasonably regarded as advancing the public interest.'' United States v. Western Electric Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1576 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 487 (1993). Section VII of the proposed Final Judgment, with which ACC does not quarrel, specifies that ``[i]f a motion to modify this Final Judgment is not contested by any party, it shall be granted if the proposed modification is within the reaches of the public interest.'' The discretionary waiver authority in Section II.A of the proposed Final Judgment simply averts the risk of prolonged litigation over every change to the transparency requirements, litigation that would in the great majority if not all cases result in no public benefit, but would simply confirm that the modification agreed to by the United States and the defendants was within the reaches of the public interest. IV Standard of Review Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §16(e), the proposed Final Judgment cannot be entered unless the court determines that it is in the public interest. The focus of this determination is whether the relief provided by the proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint. United States v. Bechtel Corp., 1979&hyph;1 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶62,430, at 76,565 (N.D. Cal. 1979), aff'd, 648 F.2d 660, 665&hyph;66 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981). Absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making its public interest finding, should *␣*␣* carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact statement and its response to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the circumstances. United States v. Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., 1977&hyph;1 Trade Cas. ¶61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977). The court may reject the agreement of the parties as to how the public interest is best served only if it has ``exceptional confidence that adverse antitrust consequences will result *␣*␣*.'' United States v. Western Electric Co., 993 F.2d at 1577. V Conclusion After careful consideration of the comments, the United States continues to believe that, for the reason stated herein and in the Competitive Impact Statement, the proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint. There has been no showing that the proposed settlement constitutes an abuse of the United States' discretion or that it is not within the zone of settlements consistent with the public interest. Therefore, entry of the proposed Final Judgment should be found to be in the pubic interest. Dated: September 8, 1994. ␣␣␣Respectfully submitted, Carl Willner, Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division.
