The Vice-Premier in charge of agriculture was elected a member of the State Duma on the ticket of the Agrarian party which brings together almost 200,000 men and women. Russia's one and only Agrarian labor union boasts a membership of almost 16 million. According to Zaveryukha, the Agrarians had failed to sign the civic accord agreement owing to differences of opinion on government support for the agro-industrial complex. In addition, he said, the labor union and the government differed on the issue of social insurance. But, Zaveryukha said, the Agrarian faction in the State Duma supported the president- and government-backed draft of the Federal budget although those who had signed the civic accord agreement opposed the draft.
