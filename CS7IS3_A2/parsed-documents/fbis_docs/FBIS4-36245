A Qol Yisra'el reporter says the soldiers thought they were under fire, but the shooting was in fact from a Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] group that was firing in the air to celebrate the release of one of their members from the Qezi'ot prison. The Palestinian police are investigating the incident. In Jericho, a Palestinian resident was lightly wounded yesterday when Palestinian police opened fire. The victim reportedly drove through a police roadblock without stopping. In Gaza, the Palestinian police arrested four members of the Fatah Hawks for shooting and wounding six residents of the Tuffah neighborhood, one of them seriously and two others moderately. The Qol Yisra'el reporter says the Fatah Hawks tried to arrest a car thief, claiming they were from the Palestinian security service. The driver put up a fight and a shooting broke out. The four Hawks were arrested and their guns were confiscated. In another incident, the Palestinian police demolished a house in the Rimal area that had been built illegally on public land. An Israeli was lightly injured last night on the Trans-Samaria Highway when his car was stoned near the Arab village of Mashah.
