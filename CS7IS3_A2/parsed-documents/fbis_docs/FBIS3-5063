"I strongly hope the U.S. Government will take sensible action based on a sensible judgment," the premier said at a session of the House of Councillors special panel on political reform. He made the comment in reply to a question by Hidehisa Otsuji of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party. Hosokawa also said the Japanese Government will be closely watching U.S. moves on the matter, in lieu of contemplating countermeasures to the potential revival of the Super 301 trade law. Super 301, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1988, gives the government the right to retaliate against countries which the U.S. deems to be engaging in unfair trade practices. U.S. media reports have speculated that the measure might be revived for use against Japan following the collapse of bilateral trade "framework" talks and as a result of Washington's discontent over Tokyo's alleged failure to grant sufficient access for U.S. firms to its telecommunications market. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also called on the U.S. to take a cautious stand over the handling of the lapsed Super 301, reiterating that Japan has already decided to voluntarily devise a package of measures to further open its markets, to be announced by the end of March. "The Japanese Government started making efforts to break a stalemate quickly and voluntarily," the top government spokesman told a news conference, adding that Washington should take such moves by Tokyo into account. Meanwhile, a government source on Thursday morning said Tokyo would file a complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if the U.S. moves to impose sanctions on Japan over the spat on access to the Japanese cellular phone market. Saying the revival of Super 301 has already been discounted, the source revealed the Japanese Government is considering taking the case to the GATT in accordance with international rules in order to settle what it perceives as unilateral sanctions.
