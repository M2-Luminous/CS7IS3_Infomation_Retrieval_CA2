In a bid to join the General Agreement of Tariff and Trade [GATT], Taiwan has held trade talks with its trading partners to discuss reducing its import ban items, and it is the first time that Taiwan has put forth a concrete step to relax import regulations. The Japanese Government, however, is reacting against the Taiwan offer, claiming that "the VER runs counter to the basic principle of GATT" (according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry). Hence, Japan and Taiwan are likely to face rough sailing in their trade talks. At present, Taiwan allows only the import of Japanese-built automobiles with more than 3,000-cc engine displacement which are not built in that country. For this reason, Japanese automakers have formed joint ventures with Taiwan automakers for local production of automobiles or exported their automobiles built at their plants in the United States to Taiwan. In Taiwan, the demand for Japanese-built cars has been growing and it is highly possible that Taiwan's full liberalization of automobile imports from Japan will deal a blow to the Taiwan automobile industry. For this reason, the Taiwan Government intends to protect the domestic automobile industry by asking the Japanese Government to adopt the VER which sets the total number of Japanese-built automobiles to be exported to Taiwan. The Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs held a meeting with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo in late April at which the Taiwan side expressed a willingness to allow Japanese automakers to make phased exports of small Japanese-built automobiles with about 2,000-cc engine displacement to Taiwan. The Taiwan side, however, proposed that Japan apply the same VER and the same import monitoring system to Taiwan as it does to the United States and the EU in return for the trade concession. As measures for the phased exports of small Japanese-built automobiles, the Taiwan side proposed that the rate of tariffs for them be set in two categories and a "tariff quota formula" that restricts the import of low-tariff Japanese-built automobiles be introduced. The Japanese Government takes the position that the VER is incompatible with the objective of GATT, but it plans to decide on its stand while examining the "tariff quota formula." In an attempt to join GATT, Taiwan has held trade talks with its trading partners to discuss ways to open its market. It is now examining the possibility of freeing Japanese firms from the ban on their participation in bidding for construction projects for nuclear power plants and steel plants.
