"The National Bank is convinced that we should integrate with Russia and set up a joint currency union, however, on equal terms," stated Stanislaw Bahdankevich. Nevertheless, he believes that the signed agreement contains specific provisions that cannot be accepted by Belarus. First, this concerns the unification of their budgets as early as 1995, reflected in clauses No. 5, 6, and 7 of the aforementioned agreement; second, the fact that Belarus will have to receive loans not through the Central Bank of Russia, but in the form of state loans through the Russian Ministry of Finances contradicts the Belarusian Constitution. In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, clause No. 5, which stipulates the transfer of assets and liabilities from the National Bank of Belarus to the Central Bank of Russia, causes the greatest objections. It virtually means the liquidation of the National Bank of Belarus. This was the reason why Stanislaw Bahdankevich did not initial this clause when signing the 12 April agreement in Moscow. "As a result, we have virtually no monetary merger agreement because, due to the lack of consent in regard to this clause, two most important documents, which are integral parts of this agreement, have not been adopted and signed," stated the bank official. These documents are as follows: "Intergovernmental Agreement on Single Mechanism of Managing Belarusian and Russian Budgets Upon Unification of Their Monetary Systems" and "Interbank Agreement on Unification of the Belarusian and Russian Monetary Systems and Mechanism of Functioning of a Single Monetary System." Stanislaw Bahdankevich believes that the April 1994 agreement is much more inadequate than the monetary merger agreement signed on 8 September 1993. The earlier agreement was an equal rights agreement, according to which Belarus could pursue an independent economic policy. Stanislaw Bahdankevich declared that the Belarusian side should insist on signing an agreement on exactly the same conditions -- the establishment of a single customs zone, the operation of a single legal tender (Russian ruble), issued by two banks according to mutual agreements, the denotation of limits of budget deficits, which were postulated by the September agreement and were not ratified by the Russian legislature. In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, the expectations that the deficit of the payment balance, stabilization of inflation, and fulfillment of mutual accounts between enterprises will be resolved are illusory. The National Bank chairman also criticized that part of the signed agreement which concerns the mutual lifting of customs duties. In his mind, the gain from lifting customs duties, which will be enjoyed by Belarus, cannot be compared with its gain, had it taken money from Russia for maintaining the Russian Strategic Armed Forces --deployed on the territory of Belarus -- and the transit of Russian freight, oil, and gas through Belarusian territory. Though Russia lifted customs duties for Belarus, it introduced excise taxes on Belarusian goods and additional payments for transport, thus leaving Belarusian traders virtually without profits from lifting customs duties. In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, the unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems within one to two months is impossible, though Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich talked about this recently. "I admit that I simply may not know something he knows if he says that this monetary merger could be introduced in the immediate future," he added. The National Bank chairman explained his prolonged silence after the signing of the agreement -- which is extremely unfavorable for Belarus -- by the fact that some clauses of the agreement, which contradict the Constitution, would be changed after a course of negotiations.
