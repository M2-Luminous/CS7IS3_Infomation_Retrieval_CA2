[End boxed material] We posed a number of questions concerning the current socio-political situation in the republic. Today we present to the reader part of the responses, in which the respondents give an evaluation of the republic and oblast leadership, as well as their attitude toward the Constitution and the Zhogorku Kenesh. The political processes during our transitional period are rather fast-moving. We believe many readers recall with nostalgia that "stagnant" period when certain leaders could spend decades at the head of structural subdivisions which provided comfortable positions for them. That time has passed, never to return. The political situation today changes practically every week. It is influenced by numerous factors, domestic as well as foreign, objective as well as subjective, central as well as regional. The effort by certain regions to exert pressure on the course of the current session was felt not only by the deputies, but also by inexperienced listeners and viewers. Therefore, in every case in our publications we also give readers the responses in a regional cross-section. (Tables 1 and 2). Table 1.

Assuming this fact, we also included questions on this, which for some is really the "thirteenth," session. The results are presented below. We will not comment on them at this time, leaving this possibility for the future. (Tables 3 and 4). [End boxed material] Table 3.
