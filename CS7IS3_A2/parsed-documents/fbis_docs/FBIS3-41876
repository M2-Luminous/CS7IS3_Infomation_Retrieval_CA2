South Asia faces a threat from India, not Pakistan, which wants to meet its power shortfall by utilizing nuclear energy. Pakistan has no other option but to build its own nuclear reactor to meet its energy requirements. He made these observations while addressing the 23d graduation and awards ceremony at the Center for Nuclear Studies. Pakistan is faced with the problem of increasing its power output. The existing resources cannot produce an adequate amount of electricity to meet the requirements of the industrial, agricultural, and trade sectors as well as domestic consumers. That is why the country has to cut power distribution every year, thereby affecting industrial and agricultural production and disrupting people's normal lives. Increasing electricity production is essential for Pakistan's all-around development. The country's existing thermal and hydroelectric power stations are generating electricity at full capacity; to produce additional power, Pakistan will have to utilize nuclear energy. France is an example for everyone. That country meets most of its energy requirements with its nuclear power stations. Pakistan can also become self-sufficient in electricity production. The nuclear power plant in Karachi has been running successfully for the past 20 to 22 years, and the expertise gained with this plant can be utilized to operate other nuclear power stations. The country can rely on the expertise of Pakistani scientists and technical experts to build nuclear reactors to generate electricity.
