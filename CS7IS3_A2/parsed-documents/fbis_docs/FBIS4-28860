As has been already reported, the Japanese authorities recently committed an outrage by sending several hundred policemen, raiding the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, and searching many places including houses of Chongnyon functionaries on the groundless pretext of a violation of the national land utilization law. The recent raid and search commotion, which followed its crackdown on the Osaka prefectural organization of Chongnyon in April, is a deliberate act to destroy the Chongnyon organization and block its patriotic activities and is an unpardonable criminal act. As is known, Koreans in Japan did not go to Japan on their own initiative. They are the ones who were drafted by the Japanese imperialists who colonialized Korea or their offspring. The Chongnyon is a dignified organization of overseas citizens of our Republic which launches the righteous activities of safeguarding the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan and promoting friendly relations with the Japanese people. Accordingly, the Japanese authorities should protect them and value their rights, instead of intensifying suppression of the Chongnyon. Nonetheless, the Japanese authorities raided Chongnyon organizations and houses of Chongnyon functionaries, and searched them in broad daylight by fabricating groundless excuses. This is an extension line of the policy of obliterating Chongnyon, an expression of their undisguised hostile policy towards us and Chongnyon, and a grave challenge to them. The Japanese authorities are these days becoming all the more malicious in their attempt to stifle us over our so-called nuclear issue while making haste with so-called sanctions and adopting emergency legislature. While openly babbling about the dispatch of the Self-Defense Armed Forces to the front line of South Korea in case of emergency, the Japanese authorities mobilized its armed forces to a southeast area adjacent to the Korean peninsula in accordance with a new military strategy. Timed to coincide with this, their provocative act committed against the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon was not a mere mistake as they have insisted. This is part of the anti-Republic hostile policy which has been stepped up maliciously through collusion and collaboration with the United States and the South Korean puppets, and a deliberate and premeditated act designed by the Japanese authorities. The Japanese authorities have launched into a heinous anti-Chongnyon campaign whenever the anti-Republic moves of the United States and the South Korean puppets got hysterical. This is a clear proof of it. Regarding the suppression of Chongnyon and the hostile policy toward our Republic, the present Japanese authorities are more arrogant and tyrannical than their predecessors. What they pursue is realizing the past dream of becoming a colonial dominator by involving itself in another war of aggression on Korea by following the United States' emergency scenario. However, this is nothing but an anachronistic wild dream and only reveals their unchangeable aggressive nature. The DPRK Foreign Ministry clearly declared that if Japan should take the lead or be inveigled or join force in any sanctions against us, we would regard it as a declaration of war, and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment for it. We never use empty words. Japan occupied our country for almost half a century, committing never-to-be-condoned crimes to our nation, and has not atoned for its past criminal acts up to now. Japan must ponder the consequences to be entailed by its anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and act with discretion. The Japanese authorities should immediately stop their hostile policy toward our Republic and their suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for the recent case and sternly punish the chief culprits. If the Japanese authorities continue to step up their suppression of Chongnyon, joining the anti-Republic commotion of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, they will have to pay a dear price for it.
