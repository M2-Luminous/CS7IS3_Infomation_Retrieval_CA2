We traveled first by train and then by military helicopter, and finally we arrived at the launch site, where an SS-17 missile with a multiple warhead is concealed in a silo. It is targeted on the Warren U.S. nuclear missile base located near the city of Cheyenne in Wyoming State -- the headquarters of (Dirk Jamieson), a U.S. 3-star general who commands land-based strategic missile forces. This missile would take 30 minutes to reach Warren base. General Gribov, commander of this Russian missile division, descended with our camera crew to his underground labyrinth, which is well protected against the consequences of a nuclear explosion. It is possible to descend even further to reach the combat control console, from which 10 missiles can be launched, one of which we have just seen. [video shows Borovik proceeding along an underground corridor. An overhead inscription reads: "Command Post of Military Unit No. 14264"] The officers on duty here spend hundreds of hours a year in these nuclear underground corridors. Every time before they come on duty they have to pass a test to demonstrate their precise knowledge of the functioning of this equipment and the sequence of all their actions. They also have to undergo thorough medical and psychiatric tests several times a year, and routine checks prior to every duty tour. The fate of our planet is in these people's hands. They are not told where their missiles are targeted. Division Commander General Gribov also prefers not to know, although he is fully entitled to this knowledge. When a launch command goes out, our missile men know exactly how to distinguish between a training command and a combat command, while U.S. officers on duty at similar consoles are not told by their commanders which is a training command and which is for real. Such missile army divisions are scattered throughout Russia and also Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Invisible nerves link them to a single nuclear center which is located a 25-minute drive from the Triumphal Arch [video show arch) to the west of Moscow at a place called Vlasikha. The missile men told us that in the last century there was an estate here whose owner was popularly known as "Vlasikha." Only a few years ago these roads and traffic along them were controlled by our counterintelligence. Outsiders could not pass here without being stopped. This whole vast nuclear mechanism of the former Soviet Union comprising many thousands of land-based missiles is under the command of Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces.
