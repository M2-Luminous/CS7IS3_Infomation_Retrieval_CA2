The stipulations aim to present information concerning the structure, management and performance of the listed companies in a more standardized format. This should allow investors to compare listed companies, in terms of an investment risk, more readily. Analysts said that the move will also revitalize international investors' enthusiasm for buying Chinese shares. Sufficient information will help them better understand Chinese firms and make right investment decision. According to the format, the interim report should include a financial report, review and forecast of business operation, company's major events, changes of the company's stock structure, brief introduction of provisional general meeting and documents for future reference. The CSRC requires that the board directors of each company should guarantee the accuracy, truth and fairness of the reports. The documents should be completed within 60 days after the end of the first six months of the fiscal year. The listed companies should submit 10 copies of their reports to the CSRC and stock exchanges for record purposes. These reports will be issued in at least one of the eight domestic newspapers and magazines which are authorized by CSRC to issue securities information. They include, China Daily, Financial News, Economic Daily, China Securities, Securities Market Weekly, Shanghai Securities News, Securities Times and China Reform Newspaper. Chinese companies, which list their shares on both domestic and overseas exchanges, should issue their interim reports at the same time to domestic and overseas investors.
