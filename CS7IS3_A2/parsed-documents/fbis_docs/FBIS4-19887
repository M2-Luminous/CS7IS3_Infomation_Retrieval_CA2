Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said that Albania is reexamining the measures taken to reduce the number of diplomatic staffers at the Greek Embassy. He added that, following this development, Greece will decide its stance on the issue after a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries on 3 May in Zurich. Six administrative staffers will be leaving the Greek Embassy in Tirana. It should be noted that the Greek Embassy in Tirana has 19 people while the Albanian Embassy in Athens has only one administrative staffer out of a total of six people. Replying to questions, the government spokesman said the Albanian Government obviously made these decisions after taking current developments into consideration. Venizelos also said that it should be considered self-explanatory that Mr. van der Stoel, as CSCE officer responsible for minority issues, is interested in the situation of the Greek minority in Albania. A short while ago, our correspondent in Ioannina, Yeoryios Kirousis, reported that the Albanian authorities began releasing [from detention] officials of the Greek minority party, Omonoia. So far, the president and two members of Omonoia's chapter in Gjirokaster have not been released.
