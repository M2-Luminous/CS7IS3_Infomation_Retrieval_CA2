The authorities of the Communist regime immediately indicated to Washington's diplomatic chief that he had no right to meddle with the affairs of the host country. In order to make things quite clear, shortly before Mr. Christopher's arrival, the Shanghai police briefly detained Wang Fuchen, the secretary of the human rights association of the southern capital. The difference of agreement is nothing new: Beijing has always acted as leader of those -- mainly Asian -- countries which more or less support the view that the subject of human rights is only used by the West as a means of exerting pressure, mainly for commercial ends. The debate was revived by the possibility of an imminent reconsideration by Washington of Beijing's attribution with most-favored-nation status. Recently, President Clinton gave his Chinese partner until June to demonstrate good will regarding human rights. The novel aspect now is that this time China risks humiliating the world's leading power for which it has generally reserved more circumspect treatment than for many other Western countries. Why? Without a doubt it feels emboldened by the points it has just scored against France, which was forced to call off its sale of aircraft to Taiwan, and against Great Britain, which was duly informed that the reforms implemented by Hong Kong Governor Patten will be repealed on the same day that the colony returns to the fold. Perhaps, above all, Beijing's attitude is symptomatic of the form of government practiced by the high-ranking officials in the run-up to the probable upheaval that will follow the death of the patriarch Deng Xiaoping: Nothing must happen that calls their absolute authority into question. Even the respectful mode of dissent chosen by the dissidents, who sweep aside any hypothetical removal of the regime, is not convincing the old guard to accept the dialogue which questions their system of order. The Chinese leaders believe they can adopt the same attitude in the international context. Deep down, they believe that President Clinton, following the others, will ultimately consider it more pressing to uphold the capitalist interests of his country than to echo what they take to be pure sentimentality on the part of both intellectuals and humanitarian organizations, relayed by an influential international press. Consequently, the visit by Mr. Christopher would appear to be crucial. In fact, it will enable the Chinese to gauge U.S. determination, and inevitably it will serve as a barometer for other visitors, starting with Edouard Balladur, who is expected in Beijing on 7 April.
