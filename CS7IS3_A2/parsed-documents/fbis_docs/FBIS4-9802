He rejected the notion there might be risks of currency instability, saying the central bank's independence will strengthen states' initiatives. With only a few hours remaining before leaving to occupy the new post of governor of the Bank of Mexico (Banxico), Mancera admits: "It is a great challenge and an enormous responsibility that we will have to face." Now, as of 1 April, "no state agency or institution will be able to pressure the central bank into approving credit "without the government board's approval," and that, he insisted, "is very healthy for the economy." In brief statements to this newspaper after being sworn-in before the congressional Permanent Commission of the Union as new Banxico governor, Mancera weighs the experience of deputy governors Guillermo Prieto Fortun, Francisco Gil Diaz, Ariel Buira, and Jesus Marcos Yacaman. He adds these are people who are very familiar with the country's financial system. Franciso Gil Diaz, also interviewed by EL FINANCIERO, said: Banxico's greatest challenge, starting with this new legal framework, will lie in each of us getting to know what will be our responsibilities. "I have been with the bank for 25 years, and, nevertheless, I still have to get used to the institution, its new provisions, as well as its financial operations." Gil Diaz added he believes Banxico officials, who will be assuming this responsibility, will have to do a little more of the same and "exert a little more effort" because we all have had specific duties; some even had operational obligations in addition to local obligations. The Key: Budget Independence When asked how there can be budget independence within an official structure, the up until now under secretary of revenues of the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) explained: New legislation allows the bank to handle its own budget. Wages, for example, are established with a stipulation that could subordinate the bank due to the higher wages its officials earn. Bank supervision is included in the law, but under a different agency in order to prevent "supervisory" elements from being used to apply any pressures; "in other words, everything is well established." Mancera agreed this operation is in accordance with legal provisions included in Banxico's new legal framework. Gil Diaz recalled a new bank organization law had been enacted starting from the constitutional reforms. The new law includes stipulations on the central bank's activities. Strengthening of Currency Exchange Mancera had to wait more than two hours to take his oath of office because the legislators could not see eye to eye on whether to appoint Miguel Montes. He did not reject any of the questions. Instead he tried to be as precise as possible. "The national bank's autonomy will aid in correcting the financial situation and strengthening the currency." He did not evade any questions either. The situation the country is facing, he added, will not affect the peso's stability in the least. The bank has had no reason to intervene because exchange rate activity has stayed within normal boundaries. He predicted the activity surrounding the dollar-peso exchange rate will not affect the economic outlook, as they will tend to level off. Proof of this is that Mexico has not needed to use any of the $6 billion the Clinton administration has offered. He said the central bank's new autonomous nature will help to strengthen the national currency. He denied it would create division between the state and the people, as a Popular Socialist Party legislator has charged. The draft bill, now approved, is clear about this issue and is consistent with the state's authority. The basic issue here, he added, is there will no longer be indiscriminate credit for any agency. This is, he commented, consistent with the country's process of economic opening and modernization. Foreign Approval According to several analysts, local and foreign banks alike have welcomed the appointment because "Miguel Mancera Aguayo's experience and dedication within the Mexican financial system is well proven." They also said he has the international financial community's recognition, support, prestige, and respect. Analysts from the Deutsche Bank, Banamex, Bancomer, and the Swiss Bank agree it is precisely he who "knows Mexican financial policy inside out." Directors at Banpais have said the new structure of the Bank of Mexico plus Miguel Mancera Aguayo at the helm are a guarantee that the financial policy will not drift off course, financial reorganization will continue, the corporation's resources will be safeguarded, and investor confidence will grow. Analysts from Deutsche Bank, the Bank of Montreal, and the National Bank of Paris have said the central financial agency must continue its clear and efficient performance in order to protect the peso. They say the current challenge will be to maintain and consolidate Mexico's economic, social, political, financial, and monetary stability.
