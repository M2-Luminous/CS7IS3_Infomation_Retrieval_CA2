The writer maintains that the secularists' chief concern is "to confront religion and slander Islamists." The secularists, he says, "view terrorists and Islamists of all schools of thought as one and the same thing. Categorizing them into moderate Islamists, extremist Islamists, and criminal terrorists, secularists say, is merely a distribution of roles within the same trend, a backward and metaphysical trend hostile to civilization." Acknowledging anyone's right to choose his own thinking and ideology, the writer contends that no one should go beyond this freedom to attack religion and those who believe in it. "Those in our country who adopt secularism as their ideology are free to do so. If they use the sword of authority or the weapon of the media to confront the other side, they will be dragging the country to catastrophe. But they will achieve nothing. No force, no matter how strong, can sow this bad seed in Egypt's soil. Egypt can never suit the growth of this kind of thought; it is the land of faith, religion, and prophets." Commenting on the current debate on religion and secularism, Mahmud says: "I don't think such debate could have started if the stage had not been carefully prepared for it by the horrible introduction of the so-called Islamic terrorism." The writer adds sarcastically: "And because there is Islamic terrorism, the secularist assembly must take the lead and rush to defend our society, which is threatened with destruction." The writer then cites a CNN report on CIA financial support for Golboddin Hekmatyar, "who runs training camps for over 10,000 terrorists in Afghanistan," concluding that "Islamic terrorism, which suddenly appeared on the scene to upset balances in the region, is a creation, premeditated sedition." He explains: "After the Islamists triumphed in Afghanistan, it became a pressing American interest to divide their ranks and create conflict among them to deprive them of the fruits of victory and, more importantly, to turn Islamic rule into a massacre so that no one would be tempted to establish such rule." He adds: "If Hekmatyar is opening scores of camps to train over 10,000 terrorists and then send them to particular Arab countries for sabotage, this is his second mission. Through its agents in Pakistan or any other agent Arab country, the CIA will provide him with the millions he needs." The writer states: "If they are sabotaging Egypt and distorting its Islam so that it has no Islamic rule, then they are mistaken. With the diversified composition of its people and its position amid storms, Egypt will not choose `a professional Islamist' to rule it. It will always prefer a civilian government that respects Islam and preserves its traditions and respects Christianity and preserves its values. No Egyptian Islamist thinker plans to rule. The Islamists' greatest ambition is to create an enlightened and influential Islamic public to preserve religion's values and role in the social arena." "If they realized this," the writer adds, "they would feel at ease and let others rest; they would save those squandered millions. But, most likely, they have a far-reaching objective: Shaking the Islamic creed, breaking its backbone, and removing it from hearts. But they, and all the money in the world, can never achieve this."
