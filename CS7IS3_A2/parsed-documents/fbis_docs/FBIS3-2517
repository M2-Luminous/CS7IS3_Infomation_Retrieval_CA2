In his report on government work delivered to the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress, Li Peng reviewed China's achievements in reform, opening to the outside world and modernization drive last year. In 1993 China's economy continued to expand vigorously. The gross domestic product exceeded three trillion yuan, representing an increase of 13.4 percent over the 1992 figure. Good harvests were reaped and the added value of agricultural output increased by four percent. Except for a drop in the output of cotton and sugar-yielding crops, the output of major farm products increased considerably. The added value of industrial output increased by 21.1 percent, and the output of major industrial products rose enormously. He said the domestic market was brisk, the pattern of investment improved, more funds were used on key projects and the construction of projects in energy, transport and telecommunications advanced apace. In view of the conspicuous contradictions and problems that cropped up in the course of rapid economic growth, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council took prompt macro-control measures to restore financial order, stabilize the economy and maintain sound development. This created the necessary conditions for sustained development and smooth progress of the reform in the present year and also helped accumulate valuable experience in exercising macro-control under conditions of a socialist market economy. Referring to the progress of economic restructuring last year, Li said China deepened the reform of enterprises, continuing to concentrate on changing the way they operate and gradually giving them more decision-making power. The state-owned and collectively owned economic sectors developed, and so did the privately owned sector and the sector with foreign investment, Li Peng noted. China rationalized price relations and for the most part, lifted controls over the purchasing and selling prices of grain. China accelerated the development of markets for the basic means of production, including capital, labor, land, technology and information. China has also drawn up plans for reform of finance, taxation, banking, investment and foreign trade and began to implement them smoothly. Over the last year the country continued to open wider to the outside world. Foreign trade expanded in all fields, with the volume of imports and exports increased by 18.2 per cent over the 1992 figure. Achievements were scored in the fields of science and technology, education, sports, literature and art, the press and publishing, radio, film and television, social sciences, public health, pharmaceutical production, family planning, environmental protection and the prevention and control of natural disasters. Further efforts were made to improve the comprehensive management of public security. Achievements were also scored in national defense. Socialist cultural and ideological progress were promoted and socialist democracy and the legal system improved. He pointed out the living standards of urban and rural people continued to improve after allowing for price rises. Last year the average income of city dwellers per capita increased by 10.2 percent over the 1992 figure. The average per capita income of people in the countryside increased by 3.2 percent. Consumption level of both city and country people rose steadily, and their cultural life was continually enriched. In his report, Li Peng also mentioned the major contradictions and problems in the midst of progress, such as excessive investment in fixed assets, a fairly sharp rise in prices, irrational economic structure, and some state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises having difficulties with production and operation. In some areas public order is poor, and not enough has been done to combat social evils. The corrupt practices of a few government functionaries, such as embezzlement, fraud, accepting bribes and bending the law for personal gains, and formalism and bureaucratism in government organs have impaired the close ties between the government and the people. The party central committee and the State Council regard these as serious problems and are making every effort to solve them, Li said.
