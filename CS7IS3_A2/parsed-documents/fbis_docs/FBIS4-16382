Following General Pavel Grachev's trip to Beijing ties between the two neighboring powers' armies have been strengthening. Contacts are developing between neighboring military districts and there has been an exchange of visits by naval vessels. All these are a natural consequence of the normalization of relations between Moscow and Beijing. But observers in Asian states bordering China and in the West are asking whether the sale of Russian arms to China will pose a threat to the states of South and Southeast Asia. After all, China has some outstanding territorial problems with some of them. Doubts have arisen above all because many aspects of the military-technical ties between China and Russia have been cloaked in secrecy. For instance, a Western colleague showed me the text of the agreement on cooperation between the two defense ministers. One article in it envisages that Russia will send its specialists to China to overhaul arms and to train Chinese personnel. Is this article present in the agreement? By avoiding the press General Kolesnikov has essentially turned his official visit into a semisecret meeting, providing grounds for new suspicions in Asian capitals.
