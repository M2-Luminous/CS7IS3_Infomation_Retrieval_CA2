FR940523-0-00004 FR940523-0-00003 Farmers Home Administration 7 CFR Part 1942 RIN 0570&hyph;AA08 Rural Business Enterprise Grants and Television Demonstration Grants AGENCY: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulation that is utilized by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) to make grants to facilitate the development of small and emerging business enterprises in rural areas. A change is needed to implement Title V, Section 516(d) of Public Law 102&hyph;552, Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, which provides that grants may also be made to create, expand, and operate rural distance learning networks and rural learning programs that provide educational or job training instruction related to potential employment or job advancement for adult students. The intended effect is to make this an eligible grant purpose under the Rural Business Enterprise Grant program. DATES: Interim rule effective May 23, 1994. Written comments must be submitted on or before July 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments in duplicate to the Office of the Chief, Regulations Analysis and Control Branch, Farmers Home Administration, USDA, room 6348, South Agriculture Building, Washington, DC 20250. All written comments will be available for public inspection during regular working hours at the above address.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification We are issuing this interim final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and the Office of Management and Budget has determined that it is a ``significant regulatory action.'' Environmental Impact Statement This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' RDA has determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190), an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. Executive Order 12778 This document regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with State law are controlling. All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B, must be exhausted prior to filing suit. Intergovernmental Review This action affects the following RDA program as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under 10.769 Rural Business Enterprise and Television Demonstration Grants and is subject to the provisions of E.O. 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 CFR part 3015, subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983, 49 FR 2267, May 31, 1984, 50 FR 14088, April 10, 1985.) Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575&hyph;0132 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This interim rule does not revise or impose any new information collection requirement from those approved by OMB. Discussion of the Interim Rule It is the policy of the Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, the Department is making this action effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register without securing prior public comment. The purpose of this rule is to implement Title V, Section 516(d), of Public Law 102&hyph;552, Farm Credit Banks and Association Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, which amends Section 310B(c) (7 U.S.C. 1932(c)) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act which allows grants for the creation, expansion, and operation of rural distance learning networks or rural learning programs that provide educational instruction or job training instruction related to potential employment or job advancement for adult students. This rule making action does not encompass discretionary decision making by the agency, but merely adds the text of Section 516(d)'s amendment to Section 310B(c) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act into the regulations governing the Rural Business Enterprise Grant program. That program provides grants to facilitate the development of small and emerging private business enterprises in rural areas. This assistance is expected to further the development of small and emerging private business enterprises in rural areas by making available to developing businesses qualified employees necessary for successful startup or expansion. While the Department is reluctant to short circuit prior public comment, it is certain that failure to implement the program will result in negative impact in rural areas by not fully utilizing the grant program to its fullest authorization for avenues to help facilitate the development of businesses in rural areas. Because the appropriated funds for the program are not available past the end of fiscal year 1994, it is essential that this authorization be implemented this fiscal year.
