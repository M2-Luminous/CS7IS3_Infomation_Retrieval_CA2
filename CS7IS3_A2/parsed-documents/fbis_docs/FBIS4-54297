In principle, MITI and ANRE plan to abolish the safety inspections in five years by gradually shifting the power plant inspections to private companies' voluntary inspections after revising the Electricity Enterprises Act [EEA] by the end of 1995. MITI will also study the possibility of abolishing its auxiliary organ, which carries out the safety inspections as MITI's subcontractor. This is in response to a request made by power companies, which following implementation of the plan, will be able to save over 10 billion yen. It seems that the plan will also be linked to lowering the power rate, which is higher than in European countries. Regarding power companies and household power generation, the government enacted safety standard on the basis of the EEA. Currently, engineers of MITI and its auxiliary organ, the Power Generating Facility and Technological Inspection Association, make regular one-the-spot safety inspections at power generating stations, either operating or under construction, once a year. They inspect boilers, turbines, and other facilities and there are more than 100 items subject to inspection. The number of items has been increasing since the EEA was enacted in 1911. According to a plan MITI explained to electric companies on 11 May, the government plans to: 1) gradually abolish, except for nuclear power plants, the on-the-spot inspections, which are being conducted at all power generating stations, by allowing instead private companies to carry out voluntary inspections; 2) reduce frequency of inspections and the number of inspected items; and 3) ease the system in which private companies are required to have government approval for power plant construction plans, and to convert it to a notification system. Except for nuclear power plants, MITI will gradually abolish on-the-spot inspections in five years. Nine electric power companies are paying the government and its auxiliary organ 4-5 billion yen a year as fees for the inspections and state examinations. The power companies, if the plan is implemented, will not have to shut down their power plants for the inspections. Therefore, their plant operation efficiency will improve. Ultimately, "the power industry as a whole will be able to reduce operation costs by more than 10 billion yen," (according to a senior executive of an electric power company). MITI started in March discussing the possibility of easing government regulations on electric power at meetings of the Council of Electric Power Companies [Denki Jigyo Shingikai] (an advisory organ to MITI). The same agency plans to incorporate measures designed to gradual abolish the inspections into a proposal that will be mapped out in late June. MITI will submit a bill for revision of the EEA to an ordinary Diet session in 1995 at the earliest.
