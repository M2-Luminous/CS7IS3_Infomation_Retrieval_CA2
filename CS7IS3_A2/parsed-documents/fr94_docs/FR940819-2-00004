FR940819-2-00004 FR940819-2-00001 5. Show specifically why any similar information already available cannot be used or modified for the purpose(s) described in 2. There is no similar information available to replace the written request of the borrower or the set-aside addendum. However, and as previously stated, if the borrowers production and income and expense records for the disaster year have already been collected, this information does not have to be provided again. 6. If the collection of information involves small businesses or other small entities, describe the methods used to minimize burden. The information required by this regulation places no burden on small businesses or other small entities beyond that performed in the course of normal business practices. 7. Describe the consequence to Federal program or policy activities if the collection were conducted less frequently. The borrower can only request disaster set-aside one time. Therefore, the frequency of collection is at the absolute minimum level necessary to enable FmHA to make responsible decisions. 8. Explain any special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. There are no information requirements that are inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 9. Describe efforts to consult with persons outside the agency to obtain their views on the availability of data, frequency of collection, the clarity of instructions and recordkeeping, disclosure, or reporting format (if any), and on the data elements to be recorded, disclosed, or reported. The following groups were contacted in July 1994 to obtain their views on the paperwork burden: (1) Lane Landenburger of the North Dakota Department of Agriculture, Telephone number 701&hyph;223&hyph;4423, (2) Lynn Hayes, Farmers Legal Action Group, Telephone number 612&hyph;223&hyph;5400, (3) Renee Robinson, Illinois Stewardship Alliance, Telephone number 217&hyph;498&hyph;9707, and (4) Melody G. Julian, National Association of County Supervisors, 316&hyph;227&hyph;3761. The regulation and form letter were reviewed. Their comments were all favorable. In their opinion, the regulation and instructions to the borrower were easy to understand. Most borrowers should have their actual records for the 1993 disaster year completed since the 1993 tax year has already passed. In fact, most borrowers will have already provided these records to FmHA for their year-end analysis and will not have to provide them again. In these cases, the only item left to submit is the letter of request. They also stated the addendum the borrower signs is easy to read and understand and there shouldn't be any confusion. 10. Describe any assurance of confidentiality provided to respondents and the basis for the assurance in statute, regulation, or agency policy. There is no assurance of confidentiality provided to respondents for the information required by this regulation. 11. Provide additional justification for any questions of a sensitive nature, such as sexual behavior and attitudes, religious beliefs, and other matters that are commonly considered private. The information to be collected under this regulation does not involve any questions of a sensitive nature. 12. Provide estimates of annualized cost to the Federal Government and to the respondents. Also provide a description of the method used to estimate cost, which should include quantification of hours, operational expenses, and any other expense that would not have been incurred without the paperwork burden. The annual cost to the Federal Government to implement and administer this regulation is estimated to be $1,544,400, which includes salaries, operational expenses and overhead. The national average cost factor is $17.16 per hour. Federal Government costs for this regulation are based on the number of notifications, responses and persons qualifying for the program, times the hourly cost factor. The estimated annual cost to respondents is $246,092, using a rate of $10.34, derived from the Statistical Abstract of the United States 1992, the National Data Book, Table 650, page 410. This table was based on information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Average Hourly and Weekly Earnings in Current and Constant (1982) Dollars for 1991. 13. Provide estimates of the burden of the collection of information. Attached is a chart indicating the estimates of the public's annual burden. FmHA estimates that approximately 100,000 farmer programs borrowers will be notified of the DSA program. This number includes all FP borrowers who operated in a disaster area during 1993. FmHA estimates that approximately 60,000 of these borrowers will make a written request for DSA. The other 40,000 will not apply for various reasons. Approximately 10,000 borrowers have or will be restructured under subpart S of part 1951 and therefore will not be eligible for this program. Approximately 20,000 will not apply because they know they cannot meet the eligibilty requirements. The other 10,000 will not apply because even though they might have operated in a disaster area, they were able to pay all family living and operating expenses, and all payments to FmHA and other creditors. Of the 60,000 borrowers who request DSA, FmHA estimates that 50,000 will actually receive DSA. The other 10,000 will either not qualify for the program or will choose 1951&hyph;S servicing instead. 14. Explain reasons for changes in burden, including the need for any increase. This is a new regulation. 15. For collections of information whose results are planned to be published for statistical use. There are no plans to publish information from these documents for statistical purposes and therefore Section B does not apply.
