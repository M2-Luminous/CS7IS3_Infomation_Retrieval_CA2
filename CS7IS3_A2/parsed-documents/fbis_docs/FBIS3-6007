The agreement followed a private-level accord reached between Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) and Motorola Inc. of the U.S. The U.S. was scheduled to unveil a list by March 17 of Japanese products that will be subject to punitive tariffs unless there is a negotiated settlement. The Japanese and U.S. Governments will hold regular meetings to check whether IDO is implementing its agreement with Motorola, as demanded by the U.S. Government. Under the accords on governmental and private levels, IDO will open 159 new relay stations for Motorola-formula telephone service by October 1995 to expand Motorola's service network in Japan. IDO will also change its radio frequency on the formula of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) from 8 megahertz to 6.5 megahertz, the same as the Motorola formula.
