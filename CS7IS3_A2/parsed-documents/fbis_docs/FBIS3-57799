In his New Year's message, President Konstandinos Karamanlis stresses that it is about time that we all realize our mistakes and search, with compromising procedures, for the national policy which will get us out of the current impasse. Referring to the situation in the Balkans, the president stresses that the imprudent intervention of elements outside the Balkans is added to the innate political and economic problems of the region. The president notes that with their groundless and inconsistent initiatives, these outside elements aggravate the disputes among the peoples in the Balkans. The president said that an example of the above is the continuing drama of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the indirect encouragement of Skopje's provocations against our country. In this unstable and inconsistent world, the president notes, our country should live and prosper. The president concluded: I believe that despite the difficulties we are called upon to face, we will make the new year the beginning of our country's exit from its current impasse. In his New Year's message, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou notes the broad crisis that marked 1993 at the national, economic and social level by taking the country to the verge of collapse. He stresses that this trend toward destruction was interrupted with the election on 10 October and the triumph of the Panhellenic Socialist Party. The prime minister notes that for the Greek people, 1994 could be a year of greater hope and feeling of security because today we have firm bases for recovery, progress and development. The government and I, Prime Minister Papandreou adds, are optimistic that with responsibility, maturity and wisdom, with will, determination and continuous dialogue with the social forums and the people, we will proceed with the national reconstruction and productive direction.
