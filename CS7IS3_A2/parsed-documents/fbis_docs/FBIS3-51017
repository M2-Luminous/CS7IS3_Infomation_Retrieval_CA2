These motors constitute a successful test prior to the adjustment phase of the factory that is being built in Cacocum, Holguin Province, with PRC cooperation. The new electric motor factory is scheduled to begin operations during the first quarter of 1994. It is 72-percent complete, and its 120 basic machine tools are already installed. The first of these factories of moderate technological complexity in the country has the means necessary to annually produce 30,000 top-quality triphasic and monophasic motors of 23 types, motors that will fulfill vital requirements in such economic sectors as the sugar and the nickel industries. The factory also opens horizons for exports and for penetration into the home electrical appliance field in Cuba.
