Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin spoke to Yasir 'Arafat on the phone a short while ago. Rabin told 'Arafat: On behalf of the government I would like to express shock over the brutal murder by this madman which resulted in the death of innocent people during Ramadan, at a place holy to both Jews and Arabs. I want to tell you that this is a disgrace to us all. We condemned this insane act and will do everything we can to ascertain what caused it. Although we know that the murderer committed suicide, we know that three days ago he said he wanted to carry out a dramatic act in order to halt the peace talks. He acted against us all, but especially, he killed innocent people, and we will adopt all measures to restore quiet and to check whether he had accomplices. I wanted to speak to you directly and to express the government's condolences to you and to the Palestinian people. I can find no words to denounce this act. Let us speed up the effort to do what we committed ourselves to in the Declaration of Principles. I am sorry that this happened now, in the middle of our attempt of reaching a conclusion on the Gaza and Jericho issues. As an Israeli, I am ashamed of this act. The meeting at the Defense Ministry here in Tel Aviv, with the participation of the prime minister and ministers, is still continuing. U.S. Ambassador Djerejian came here and left the meeting a short while ago.
