Just You Wait, `Hare!' Prime Minister Intends To Sign Accord With Moscow on Any Terms"] [Text] "The merging of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is impossible without Belarus' losing its independence and statehood," said parliament opposition leader Zenon Poznyak, speaking in the Supreme Soviet. He painted grim prospects awaiting the country, thinking that if it joins the ruble zone: "This would be the capitulation of the Belarus economy and the Belarus state to a more powerful Russian capital and entrepreneurship. Our enterprises and banks would be swallowed up, and the property bought up. In the end, we would remain on our soil, but it would no longer belong to us.... We would turn into a free-ride corridor for the duty-free transit of Russian gas, oil, and raw material to the West." On behalf of the Belarus People's Front, Mr. Poznyak called the country's citizens to a nationwide political manifestation to demand the resignation of the government, the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, and early democratic elections. He also pledged support for the free trade unions and strike committees that are preparing a general political strike slated to go ahead on 15 February. New Belarus Parliament Speaker Myechyslaw Hryb reacted nervously to the opposition statement. He interrupted Mr. Poznyak's address with the words: "We do not need such documents," and ordered the microphone turned off. In the meantime, the Russia-Belarus expert-level talks on a mechanism for the merger of the monetary systems continue near Minsk in anticipation of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit. The meeting is taking place behind closed doors. Asked for comments on the progress of the talks, Myechyslaw Hryb replied that they are proceeding "normally, in a coordinated and orderly way." According to reports from informed sources in the Belarus Government, the premier intends to sign an agreement on a single ruble space in any shape, and on whatever conditions the Russian side insists.
