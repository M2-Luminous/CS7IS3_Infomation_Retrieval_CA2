In an interview with the daily SMENA today, Cernak says that "an absolute blindness towards the demands of national minorities cannot correspond with the real interests of the Slovak nation." Since Slovakia has gained its independence and thus implemented its statehood, it should be a good father and mother for all its citizens. Only when internal stability is achieved will Slovakia be able to join the European and world communities. We cannot continue to divide ourselves into those who were for Slovakia's independence and those who were against it. The process of national reconciliation should begin and everyone should be included into the process of building the Slovak statehood," Cernak says. Referring to his past activities as a SNS founding member, Cernak says: "When (former Slovak premier and chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) Vladimir) Meciar came to me and spoke about our possible cooperation I told him that he would not be successful with his federalistic statements. It was during this talk that the word 'confederation' was used for the first time and I then admitted the possibility of confederation as a possible compromise between my views and Meciar's," Cernak says. However, the SNS has become excessively radical and personal interests have ever more prevailed over the interests embedded in its manifesto, Cernak says, adding that in the long run, with the help of Meciar who actually corrupted the SNS, the radical wing in the party gained an upper hand. "I think the fact that the radical wing has managed, after our withdrawal, to topple the moderate one will eventually lead to the party's suicide," says Cernak who was dismissed as SNS chairman and expelled from the party at its congress in February after which he and his followers established the NDS. The NDS seeks to gain voters with the idea of national reconciliation while at the same time remaining a national- orientated party, Cernak says. He says the NDS's programme is close to that of right-centre parties', adding that the question of whether NDS leaders will accept the Christian Democratic Movement's (KDH) offer to run on its slate in the autumn parliamentary elections, or whether it will resume talks with the Democratic Union (DU) headed by Premier Jozef Moravcik, would be decided soon.
