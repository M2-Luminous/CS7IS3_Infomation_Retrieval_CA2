Their fighting was the fiercest in southern Bosnia and in the Mostar region, then outside Vitez, Kiseljak, Zepca and Zavidovici. Sources of the two sides indirectly confirm that the Moslems were sustaining big losses in central Bosnia. Inter-Moslem armed provocations also continued in the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB), as tensions were mounting amongst local population ahead of the expiration on Thursday of the deadline set by the fifth command of Bosnian Moslem forces loyal to the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo. The ultimatum wanted an unconditional surrender by the APWB forces. The APWB signed separate peace with Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats, striving for a peaceful solution to the three-nations conflict in the central ex-Yugoslav republic. Moslem forces in the past 24 hours continued provocations and offensive actions towards the Serb side on a number of battlefronts. [passage omitted]
