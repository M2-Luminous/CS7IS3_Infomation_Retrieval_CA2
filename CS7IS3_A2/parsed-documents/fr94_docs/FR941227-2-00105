FR941227-2-00105 FR941227-2-00075 [NAFTA&hyph;00224] Scab Rock Feeders, Incorporated; Othello, WA; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration On December 7, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance for former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published in the Federal Register . Investigation findings show that Scab Rock Feeders, Inc., ceased operations in August 1994, when all workers were laid off. The workers were previously certified for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) on July 28, 1989 under petition TA&hyph;W&hyph;23,045 which was published in the Federal Register on August 22, 1989 (54 FR 34834). On reconsideration, it was found that the workers were negatively impacted by imported Canadian cattle. The Canadian government subsidizes their cattle industry. New findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer decreased its business with the subject firm because of increased import purchases of Canadian cattle. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the workers at Scab Rock Feeders, Othello, Washington were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with that produced at Scab Rock Feeders in Othello, Washington. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following revised certification for the Scab Rock Feeders, Inc., workers in Othello, Washington. ``All workers of Scab Rock Feeders, Inc., Othello, Washington who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, DC., this 9th day of December 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
