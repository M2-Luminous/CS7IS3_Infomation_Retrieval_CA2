Consumers owe the industry more than 2 trillion rubles. Nonetheless, our unique power complex continues to function smoothly, without disruptions. The 50-hertz reading on the central control panel of Russia's unified power grid indicates that the power grid is operating stably. The stable operation is the result not just of good equipment and the harmonious operation of the collective, but also of credits, big credits. Will these, together with the fairly steep interest rates, not have to be shouldered by consumers next year? [A.F. Dyakov, president of the "Russia's Unified Power Grid" Russian Joint Stock Company] The bill for the credits should be footed by defaulters. In that case disciplined consumers would be protected. Their electricity rates would remain unchanged. [Omelchenko] Despite all the financial difficulties, new capacities totaling 3,000,000 kW have been commissioned during the current year. That is quite a lot. There are big plans also for the coming year. Russo-German joint-production modern, economical gas turbines are being assembled in St. Petersburg, the North Caucasus, and Novgorod. Construction is continuing of the state regional electric power stations at Khoro-Nor in Chita Oblast, Nizhnevartovsk in Tyumen Oblast, and in Pskov, and also the Severnaya Heat and Electric Power Station in Moscow. Power engineers are paying a lot of attention to energy saving. So, for example, the (?Cryocor) Joint Stock Company is planning to commission a turbo-expander installation at the No. 21 Heat and Electric Power Station in the capital in the new year. This installation converts the gas energy in trunk gas pipelines into electricity and in addition produces cryogenic products -- nitrogen, oxygen, argon, xenon, and so forth. [Dyakov] We have 600 such power stations. So there is a great deal of scope for employing these turbo-expanders as energy-saving technologies. [Omelchenko] You have a new control panel here at the central control room. This is a showcase of the electronic equipment which is operating in Russia's power grid today. [Dyakov] What is important is not just the hardware but also the software, and we have developed it ourselves. [Omelchenko] The intellectual basis of the power industry is being created by the sector's leading scientific research institutes in cooperation with the Professor Solomatin Software Institute. [Dyakov] Thanks to our comprehensive collective we have been able to operate reliably, and I hope that we will always be able to operate reliably.
