I disagree with many of his views," Jozef Lauko told CTK today. Lauko, an entrepreneur who, along with Ladislav Mojzis, the owner of West-Club restaurant in Bratislava, invited Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) for a private visit to Slovakia. [sentence as received] Zhirinovskiy, accompanied by six aides, is to arrive in Slovakia on Saturday, May 21. "I favour him because of his effort to return respect and authority to the Russian nation and all Slavs," Lauko said of Zhirinovskiy. He said he "invited Zhirinovskiy to Slovakia merely as a private person", and assured that "no Slovak political party stands behind" his invitation. He added he had known Zhirinovskiy for more than 15 years. The Russian politician wanted to visit Slovakia mainly to have a rest, he added. Lauko himself is not a member of any political party. "After all, I do not expect any Slovak politician to afford meeting him now, before elections," Lauko said. The elections in Slovakia are slated for September 30 and October 1. However, Lauko pointed to the importance of the opportunity of meeting a man, who he claimed would most probably be the next Russian president. Lauko said that the West perceived the idea of pan-Slavic mutuality, promoted by Zhirinovskiy, as an element dangerous to its (Western) interests. The West has beat the economic bloc in the economic sphere, but now it has come to an understanding that it has caused great problems to itself at the same time, Lauko said. "I am convinced that the time is not far away when the West will start to raise political and administrative obstacles so that visits by Slovaks, Poles, Ukrainians and Belarussians... be reduced to the least possible frequency and number," Lauko stated. "What is the difference between our suffering under the yoke of the West and of Russia?" Lauko reacted to the question whether the idea of "pan-Slavism" would not lead to Central and Eastern Europe's return under the Russian yoke. He said Slovakia was now in a worse economic situation than when it was a part of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact within the Czechoslovak Federation. However, Slovakia remains dependent on Russian energy sources, he stated. "Zhirinovskiy won the Russian elections because he gave hope to his nation," Lauko said, adding that Zhirinovskiy had built his electoral victory on the inability of his political rivals.
