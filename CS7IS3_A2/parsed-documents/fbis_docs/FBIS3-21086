While it is under this commission that the agency is being restructured to enable it to soon operate with a new leadership, the principle guidelines for its activities will be decided by the government. The fact that the finance bill did provide sufficient funding to allow the ASI [Italian Space Agency] to respect all its obligations has meant that some international agreements have had to be rediscussed. This anyway comes within the general modification of the situation following Russia's entry into the space station program. The CIRA, [Italian Aerospace Research Center] that was "completely disorganized," has also been reorganized and it has been possible to release 600 billion lire for its operation. However, its role has been completely redefined as far as programs are concerned, changing its direction toward aeronautical topics with programs that decisively favor national industry in the sector to help it "participate in new international programs with dignity." CIRA Funding Released At a press conference held on 11 January, University and Scientifical and Technological Research Minister Umberto Colombo described those aspects of the document, which he presented to the cabinet meeting on 27 December, on "Research for Development: Government Lines of Action on Research and Innovation Policy," that directly affect aerospace research. As well as giving suggestions for the future, the document describes the results of the actions that were taken to balance the accounts almost a year ago now. The availability of the funds for the CIRA that have finally been released is one example of the actions taken by MURST [Ministry of Universities and Scientific and Technological Research] to compensate for the inadequacy of the resources that the country makes available for research, recuperating efficiency wherever possible. Colombo stated that: "Through improvements obtained by eliminating areas of inefficiency or bad management it has been possible to recuperate about 3.3 trillion lire, this being about 15 percent of the annual funding for public research, which in 1993 totaled 23 trillion lire. In this way, that is, substantially by demobilizing a mass of passive outstanding amounts that are mainly the results of burdensome bureaucratic procedures, we have managed to more than balance the reduction of 4.5 percent that the finance bill made on the budgets for research bodies in 1994. As well as providing for the above-mentioned Aerospace Research Center this release of funds includes 390 billion lire under Law No. 46 on industrial research, 1.5 trillion lire for programs inherited from the former Cassa del Mezzogiorno [Extraordinary Intervention Fund for Southern Italy], 300 billion lire for science and technology parks, and 600 billion lire for national research programs into the environment, remote controlled medicine, biotechnology, electronic machine tools, neurosciences, pharmacy, building and the textile industry. A Warning From The Minister Colombo warned that although the situation has been remedied in this way this year, it will not be possible to do any more. Italy must inevitably dedicate greater resources to innovation from now on. "It will shortly be necessary to increase the resources that are available because the gap separating us from the other industrialized countries has now reached an intolerable width." It is also necessary to take some action, particularly within the small and medium-sized industries, to assist the culture of technological innovation that is traditionally lacking in Italy despite the diffused cult for "noble" science. We are risking isolation, not from the most prestigious goals of science, but from the benefits that this and leading-edge technologies bring to a nation's productive system, and therefore to its economy and employment. Colombo placed particular emphasis on this latter point, insisting on the basic change in national research policy that the document proposes. Strategies should be defined in advance, instead of allowing the researchers themselves to indicate the goals that should be aimed at generally without any reference to the overall interest of the country, as has happened up to now. It is necessary to focus on promoting innovation and its rapid application in the productive sectors of the leading industrial areas and on promoting advanced technologies that have a strong capacity for diffusion. It is also necessary to reinforce R&D activities relating to the modernization of the infrastructure networks (computer science "but verifying where it is really needed," telecommunications, and transport). Generally speaking, the sprinkling of interventions that Colombo recognizes the validity of for basic research, as far as "targeted" research is concerned, should leave the way clear for consistent support to be given to the sectors that have an assured potential for economic development while an effective control of expenditure and results must be guaranteed. Research should be organized to avoid wasting efforts, even in sectors of research that have already been widely explored by other nations and sectors that have little in common with our sectors of "excellence" -- in which manufacturing fields that only apparently have little connection with technological innovation, such as clothing and food production, must be renewed -- and in keeping with the European R&D program, which was recently approved thanks to Italy's decisive contribution, Colombo recalled.
