Following separate meetings of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] parliamentary groups making up the coalition, governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen (CDU) told journalists today that the two sides agreed that in the interests of the capital they will continue their cooperation until the end of the legislative period in the fall of 1995. The differences of opinion over Interior Senator Dieter Heckelmann (CDU) however have not been fully settled, it was stated. The SPD still objects to the senator's behavior in the affair concerning the contacts maintained by his spokesman, Hans-Christoph Bonfert, with right-wing groups. According to Ditmar Staffelt, the SPD's regional and parliamentary leader, the SPD will not, however, submit a formal no-confidence motion in the [Berlin] House of Representatives. The majority of the SPD parliamentary group will abstain in the vote on motions of no-confidence brought against Heckelmann by the Alliance 90/Greens and the FDP [Free Democratic Party]. The coalition compromise allows Heckelmann to remain in office. However the regional Office for the Protection of the Constitution is to be separated from the Interior Ministry and placed under the jurisdiction of the governing mayor. [passage omitted]
