"All our various branches contributed to this gratifying growth rate," Helmut Ricke, chairman of the board of directors, said in Hannover on Monday [14 March]. "According to the currently available figures, we have before-tax revenues of more than DM5 billion, which is fully passed on to the Federal Government." Upon inquiry by DPA, it was said that there "will certainly not be any profit" shown in the balance sheet. One can once again expect compensation payment to the sister companies, but one cannot yet say anything about that. For 1994 Telekom expects another increase in sales by 8 percent to DM63 billion. By the year 2000 business is to be expanded to DM80 billion and the number of employees is to be reduced by 30,000 to about 200,000. This year 3,500 employees are to be dismissed, which will increase productivity. Four years before the end of the telephone monopoly, Ricke drew up a positive interim balance sheet: "We have made a lot of progress on the path from an authority to a market- and customer-oriented company." The number of telephone hook-ups rose from 35.4 million to about 37 million last year. The number of cable hook-ups rose from 11.8 million in 1992 to 13.5 million in 1993. Regarding the use of ISDN [integrated services digital network] networks, Telekom "occupies first place internationally," Ricke said. The number of channels, with which language as well as text and pictures can be transmitted in one network, has almost doubled from 600,000 to more than 1 million in 1993. By the turn of the century Telekom plans to have all analog systems replaced with digital ones. The exchange will be concluded six years earlier than planned. The average Telekom customer need not expect any price increases. Telekom plans to enter the Asian-Pacific market with representations in Singapore and Beijing. The transformation into a shareholding company will probably be postponed by four months to January 1995, according to Ricke. In 1996 at the latest Telekom wants to go to the stock exchange.
