In its statement March 28, the committee said the U.S. act at a decisive moment with the solution of the nuclear issue at hand clearly proved that it was still pursuing a double-dealing policy of resorting to a war scheme and threat to socialist Korea while having talks with the latter. Pointing out that the United States is manoeuvring to isolate and stifle Korea, cashing in on talks, negotiation and "nuclear inspection", the statement demanded that it immediately withdraw from South Korea with all its nuclear weapons and allow an overall inspection of its nuclear weapons in South Korea. Secretary General of the Committee, Om Prakash Mantri, sent protest letters to the U.S. President and the South Korean chief executive. The letters demanded that the United States take an effective measure for the implementation of the agreed conclusions, squarely looking at the realities, and the South Korean authorities stop obeying to its orders. The committee published on March 29 an appeal to political parties and public organizations and peaceloving people in Asia, calling upon the peaceloving people of Asia and the rest of the world to wage a vigorous struggle against the perfidy of the United States.
