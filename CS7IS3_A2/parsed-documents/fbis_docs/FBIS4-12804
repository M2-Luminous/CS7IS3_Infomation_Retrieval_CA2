Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] sources have said that al-Siyayli is carrying out his duties and is available in his residence every evening with a number of his advisers in the governorate. Informed sources had confirmed the report about the injury of the Aden governor, who is the strongest YSP opponent to the General People's Congress' policy. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT contacted al-Siyayli's house, and one of his aides said he was in the house holding a meeting with more than 30 people. He said that "if he had been subjected to any harm, the situation would have been different." Sanaa sources linked these reports with Salih al-Siyayli's disappearance and failure to attend the meetings held over the past days by Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. [passage omitted]
