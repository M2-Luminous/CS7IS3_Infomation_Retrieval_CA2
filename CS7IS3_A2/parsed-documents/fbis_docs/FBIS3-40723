With the release of this technology, India will have an indigenous capability for supporting transmission systems for voice and data communications to supplement telecom networks. The VSAT technology is being released to indigenous manufacturers who are already producing C-DoT products. Significantly, the C-DoT's breakthrough has come at a time when the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is about to forego its monopoly on running VSAT services. The service, so far called the remote area business messaging network (RABMN), has aimed at providing data communication facility to subscribers scattered throughout the country by using satellite in VSATs provided at the subscribers' premises. In addition to Hughes Network Systems, three other private sector operators have been shortlisted. This is expected to bring about a boom in sale of VSAT dishes. The C-DoT-developed VSAT operate in the C-band frequency of satellites for data and voice communication at 64 kilo bit per second (kbps). The shortlisted private sector operators have been asked to operate on extended C-band frequency of the INSAT-2A satellite. To begin with, the Department of Science and Technology is going to use VSAT for linking various nodes in their network to transmit weather data to the central supercomputer installed in Delhi for inward and outward transmission to various centres.
