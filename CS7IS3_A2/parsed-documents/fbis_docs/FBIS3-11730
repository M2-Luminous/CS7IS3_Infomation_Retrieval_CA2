We asked him how things are in the economic sector after Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination. Aspe said clearly Mexico has the necessary economic stability to face the situation, and he announced economic and stock market activities will be resumed in our country today. He then explained clearly and in detail the $6-billion line of credit the U.S. Government has extended to Mexico. [Begin recording] [Barcenas] Finance Secretary Aspe, what can we expect in Mexico's economic sector following the latest events? [Aspe] As everyone knows, following the deplorable events which occurred yesterday and which resulted in the death of our friend, Luis Donaldo Colosio, today the financial sector endorsed the appeal issued by the president of the republic concerning a day of mourning, and it abstained from working. A certain nervousness prevailed earlier today, however, in international markets where constant operations are carried out, for example, public debt operations, the issuance of shares registered at the New York Stock Exchange and other types of documents, and this resulted in a downward trend. We noticed a return to stability during the day, however, and this was a pleasant surprise, meaning the markets are much more serious and--why not say it--more mature. Banks, stock market firms, the Mexican stock market, foreign exchange houses, etc. will return to normalcy; they will open for business as any other day. The important thing to note about this is the enormous stability we noticed despite these tragic events. We truly have bigger, more serious, more stable, and more mature markets. [Barcenas] The U.S. reaction, meaning President Bill Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, has been to support Mexico fully; could you explain what this support entails? [Aspe] Yes, of course. You must have heard today the U.S. President issued a series of favorable statements concerning Mexican institutions after talking with the president of the republic. You know Secretary Bentsen issued two statements: One was a statement of support, enormous support, for the way President Salinas has handled economic policy; second, an unusual thing. We have a reciprocal support agreement between the two treasuries, meaning, the U.S. Treasury and the Mexican Finance Secretariat, as well as an agreement between the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and our Central Bank of Mexico. These reciprocal support agreements had involved $1 billion for many years. In an unusual act and following many talks and negotiations that we were able to expedite today, we received an increase in the line of reciprocal support, from $1 billion to $6 billion, a 600-percent sudden increase. Why is this important? It is important to have a good economic policy, not to have a deficit, to have a cautious monetary policy, and to have an autonomous central bank, which will begin operations in April; in addition, we must have ample international reserves, which we fortunately have. This has been achieved throughout the years thanks to the efforts exerted by workers, peasants, businessmen, and--why not say it--the government. We have ample reserves, but the reciprocal support agreement means, in addition to the reserve levels, we have $600 billion so markets may operate in an orderly manner, to prevent any erratic movement, and to support the stabilization of foreign exchange markets and, of course, the economy as a whole. I had the opportunity to talk with Secretary Bentsen yesterday and today, and it is truly something that pleases us, because it represents great trust, the idea that we are truly trade partners, that we are partners with long-term visions and mechanisms. This give us what is necessary to maintain stability at a time when we may face short-term turbulences. We must not forget real stability is achieved at home, and this stability has been built progressively; hence, we will have no fiscal deficit this year. We will not have it because this is a pledge assumed by the president of the republic: To deliver an economy with a very low inflation, comparable with international inflation; a growing economy, which is being recovered; an economy with reserves; an economy with order, vision, and guidelines.
