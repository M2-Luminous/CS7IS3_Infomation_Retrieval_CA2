Snipers fired at residents throughout the day as they ventured into the streets to search for food, water, and firewood. The situation in Cuito could be described as critical. Unable to challenge government forces, Jonas Savimbi's men fire shells into the city and at civilians. The latter have gone without food and medicines since emergency relief operations have been discontinued. The number of people killed as a result of the shellings is on the increase. A civilian died of starvation at (Cangota) Ward this afternoon. Should the relief program not resume soon, more people are likely to die of starvation.
