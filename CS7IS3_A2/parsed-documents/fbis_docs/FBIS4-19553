The news was revealed in a communique by Rosa Russo Jervolino. "What makes our opposition different, she explained, is its sense of responsibility. It will be orientated toward the common good (we are not part of the culture of extremism) and it will have the capacity of making serious counterproposals. It is for these reasons and because of their substantial ambiguity that the invitation to join the PDS has received our courteous but firm rejection."
