Almost all of the survivors, who were in total panic, deserted the battlefield. Seeing that the first, second, and third groups of his assaulting forces were beaten and dispersed, Pol Saroeun, the Vietnamese puppets' general staff commander, ordered 500 soldiers from the Kompong Cham provincial unit to rescue their colleagues on Route 68. However, he could mobilize only 300 of them. However, nearly 100 of these forces fled while they were sent by truck to this area. Between 15 and 18 January, these assaulting forces tried to launch an onslaught, but all their attempts were smashed by our mine attacks. Many of them were killed or wounded, and their trucks and armored personnel carriers were destroyed. All the wounded were in despair, waiting only for their dying day. On 16 and 17 January, six trucks hit land mines and were shot at and destroyed in an area east of Samraong District. Fifty-six puppet soldiers were killed, 62 others were wounded, and 180 others deserted the battlefield. A major general from the engineering unit [name indistinct] and 12 colonels, majors, and captains were among those killed. [passage omitted]
