The figures confirmed that an economic recovery is underway in Australia. But economists say they are also likely to fuel renewed market speculation about an interest rate rise, despite comments by the prime minister, Paul Keating, last weekend that it was not the time for a rise. The latest increase in growth is broadly based, with the official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing strengths in the housing sector, farming, retail spending, and manufacturing. The figures reflect a winding back of government spending as the recession eased, the slack being taken up in the private sector. However, growth in total business investment remained weak. Exports grew during the quarter by 2.2 percent, while imports were up by 1.3 percent.
