FBIS4-128 "drafr063_c_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Electoral Chairman Barred From East Rand Townships Electoral Chairman Barred From East Rand Townships MB3103194894 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 31 Mar 94 p 4 MB3103194894 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY English BFN [Report by Johannes Ngcobo] [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] yesterday declared East Rand townships "no-go" areas for the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and said commission head Judge Johann Kriegler and commissioner Oscar Dhlomo were not welcomed anywhere near hostels in the area. The IEC yesterday called off a planned Operation Access initiative in the East Rand, saying recent Inkatha activity was cause for concern and that hostels there could prove too volatile for political canvassing. Police said the bodies of two unidentified men who had been beaten and stabbed to death were found at the Denver hostel, eastern Johannesburg, yesterday. IEC spokesman Ghadija Vallie said the Operation Access process, in which formal public debates were conducted between party representatives under the auspices of the commission, had been started by the IEC to enable parties to put their cases in areas where canvassing would not be possible. Inkatha Thokoza leader Abraham Mzizi and local indunas [assistants to a chief] said the IEC had not consulted them about a planned Operation Access visit. Mzizi said the insinuation that hostels could prove volatile was an insult to Inkatha's leadership in the East Rand. "The IEC thinks indunas are inferior," said Mzizi. Inkatha West Rand chairman Humphrey Ndlovu said Dhlomo -- a former Inkatha general secretary -- and Kriegler were not welcome near hostels on the East Rand. "We would repeat what happened to Kriegler when he was at Ulundi in Natal. Inkatha members are angry, and Zulus in particular. If Kriegler wants to be hurt he should defy my warning," said Ndlovu. Inkatha members would grant the IEC access when Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini was granted sovereignty and called upon his subjects to listen to the commission. IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje said the IEC's visit to Ulundi had managed to set up a working group between the commission and the KwaZulu government. He said the IEC message had always been that people were free to vote for parties of their choice and free not to vote in the elections. "This freedom requires tolerance and acceptance that one person's democratic freedom can be exercised only if he or she allows everyone to the same," said Cronje. The PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region deputy secretary-general Obed Bapela said his organisation was disappointed that the IEC had cancelled yesterday's Operation Access initiative. He said Inkatha was in the minority in East Rand townships and the party's leadership knew that some hostel residents wanted to vote on April 27. It was unfortunate that hostel residents would be prevented from voting. "I call upon the IEC and Kriegler to start using the powers given to them to ensure people on the East Rand go to the voting stations on April 27," said Bapela. Wits [Witwatersrand]-Vaal peace secretariat director Rupert Lorimer said Ndlovu had been through a difficult period because of the shootings in central Johannesburg on Monday. He hoped cool heads would prevail.
