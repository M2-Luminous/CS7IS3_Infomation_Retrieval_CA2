Early in the morning the specialized banks screened the market rates of renminbi against major foreign currencies -- posted by the central bank, the People's Bank of China. Smooth trading was reported on China's major foreign exchange swap centers. At the Shanghai center, the country's leading indicator, one U.S. dollar was traded at 8.7 renminbi yuan, with the total trading volume for the day hitting 16 million dollars. That was approximately parallel to the level of the last trading day of last year, observers here said. A bank official, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the specialized banks will mainly adopt the benchmark exchange rates announced by the central bank before an inter-bank foreign exchange market is established. Observers here noted that the exchange markets keeping their orderly operation demonstrates a good start for the introduction of a floating market rate. This, to a great extent, has benefitted from China's progressive reform of its foreign exchange system over the past few years. The government has been eager to limit the scope of the use of the official exchange rate. Up to the end of last year China's swap centers offered more than 85 percent of the total foreign exchange needed for the country's imports and exports. This laid the foundation for the shift toward the new, market- oriented system. Meanwhile, as most of the macro-regulatory measures introduced by the central government over the economy in July 1993 are still in place, and especially as the authorities have repeatedly pledged to stabilize the exchange rate, the balance between demand and supply of foreign currencies achieved since last July will not be changed in the short term. Steps to protect the vested interests of localities, enterprises and individuals are considered to be another factor in helping stabilize the market. This consideration is crystallized in such measures as allowing enterprises to use foreign exchange accumulated under the old system and declaring that foreign exchange certificates (FEC) can be used for payments with their value unchanged until they are gradually withdrawn by banks. However, most experts here agree that it will be some time before enterprises, the general public and the banks get used to the unified exchange rate system. Over the next few weeks or months most of them will probably take a wait-and-see attitude, and will inevitably adjust their behavior to the new environment, gradually, the experts assume.
