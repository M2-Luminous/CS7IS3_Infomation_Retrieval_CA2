Colonel Nikolay Madzhar, the chief of the Tajik Interior Ministry's public order directorate, told ITAR-TASS that the social and politic situation in the region remained stable and under full control. The colonel admitted that a few small scale meetings had been actually held in the district administrative centre of Gissar, at which demands were voiced to put an end to criminal outrage in the district and ensure personal security of its inhabitants. The meetings were provoked by a tragic incident which had occurred in Gissar on 5 May, in which eight people were killed in a bloody clash between two armed and uncontrolled groups. But the incident was not political in character. According to the colonel, Tajikistan's Interior Minister Yakub Salimov arrived on the scene on the same day and the security forces detained more than ten instigators of the clash. The investigation is controlled by the minister and the Republic's chief prosecutor in person. Colonel Madzhar said Tajikistan's leader Emomali Rakhmonov met representatives of the relatives of the people who were killed in a clash and assured them that the guilty militants would be punished exemplarily. The colonel said certain political forces in the Republic and the Gissar region have been trying to use the Gissar incident to reach their own selfish ends. Tajikistan's Security Minister Major-General Saydamir Zukhurov said the situation in the Gissar district was no source of alarm, because "political confrontation in that district is a fruit of sick imagination of the forces which are against peace and stability in the Republic and are not averse to using any methods to attain their own objectives."
