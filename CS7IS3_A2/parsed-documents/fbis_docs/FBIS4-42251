The yes side has been weakened a little in the course of the spring. The number of undecided has increased. The no side remains unchanged. The "don't know" group has increased notably among Social Democratic voters. This is what emerges from DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's opinion poll carried out in the last week of May when it is compared with the results in April and February. - The yes side today has 31 percent against 34 percent in April and 35 percent in February. The whole series of figures since May 1992 is as follows: 39, 35, 31, 29, 35, 34, 31. - The no side has 42 percent -- unchanged for the last three polls. The whole series: 38, 43, 45, 45, 42, 42, 42. - Undecided voters or voters who do not intend to vote today total 27 percent, an increase of 3 percent since April and of 4 percent since February. The whole series: 23, 23, 24, 26, 23, 24, 27. The yes side's upward trend last winter has come to an end. Asked how the EU referendum will turn out in November, a majority of voters generally reply that they believe that the outcome will be a majority for yes. This is interpreted to mean that the yes side has a chance of gaining many supporters in the large group of the undecided. Today more than one voter in four has no firm view on the EU question. Nonsocialist voters who are opponents of the EU are still hesitant about showing their true colors, because the no side is seen as a left-wing scheme. Socialist voters who are supporters of the EU are vacillating because the yes side is still seen as a right-wing idea. The percentage of those who are certain about the decision they have reached is large and growing on the no side. Today 65 percent are completely certain about their "no" choice, against 57 percent earlier this spring. [passage omitted]
