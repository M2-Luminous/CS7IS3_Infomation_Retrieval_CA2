If Our Voice Is Not Heard...!"] [Text] This appeal comes from representatives of the social movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!" On behalf of the inhabitants of Abkhazia who have been driven to despair, we ask you to adopt the most urgent and extreme measures to establish peace and harmony on the long-suffering Abkhazian land. As a result of the criminal policy of the Gudauta adventurists in Abkhazia, genocide is being perpetrated on the entire population of this once prosperous and blessed land. Abkhazians, Georgians, Armenians, and Russians and the representatives of other nationalities are either leaving the Republic or being forcibly banished from it. Out of the population of more than 500,000, little more than 100,000 remain. Unless the United Nations becomes immediately involved and the most cardinal measures are taken, the continuing genocide against the population of Abkhazia could lead to the most irreparable consequences. We ask you to use all your authority and all the means at your disposal to force the incompetent leaders who have led the republic into a blind alley to take constructive steps aimed at settling the conflict. Ardzinba and his close associates have neither the moral nor the legal right to speak on behalf of the Abkhazian people, on behalf of all the peoples of Abkhazia, because the majority of the electorate is roaming on foreign soil as refugees, forcibly displaced persons, or emigrants. We ask you to hear the voice of the long-suffering people of Abkhazia, mothers who have lost their sons in a senseless war, old people and children who have been deprived of shelter, and men and workers who are longing for creative labor. We ask the Russian president, Batoni Yeltsin, to introduce peacekeeping troops into Abkhazia; we believe that Russian troops will be able to bring peace and calm to Abkhazia. We appeal to Batoni Shevardnadze to ensure public order in Abkhazia by means of Georgian police. We ask for the right to life, peace, and the happiness of our children. Do not refuse us this. If our voice is not heard, if Ardzinba and his close associates are given, as before, the opportunity to bury all attempts aimed at a peaceful settlement in demagogic ruses, we will be forced to oppose the Ardzinba regime with weapons in our hands. The Abkhazians are a small nation. We have already paid too high a price for the excessive ambitions of these politicians. We will not allow the entire Abkhazian nation to be wiped off the face of the earth. The movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!"
