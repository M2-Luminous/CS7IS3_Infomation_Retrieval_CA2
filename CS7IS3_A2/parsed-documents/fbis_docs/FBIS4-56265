"We want cooperation, not confrontation," Carlos Larreategui, the government's secretary general, said while reporting that everything was calm in the country during the election in which 6.2 million voters will elect 65 of the 77 Congress members. No incidents have been reported during the election, which began at 0700 local (1200 GMT) at 15,870 polling stations throughout the country's 21 provinces. Nevertheless, military forces are keeping watch at strategic locations, as stipulated by the Electoral Law, which also forbids the sale of alcoholic beverages. "This is calm, not indifference," Jaime Nebot, former presidential candidate for the Social Christian Party, said. "Those who talk about indifference do so because they have not seen the excitement of the party's campaign," he added. According to opinion polls, the Social Christian Party will be the overwhelming winners in the election. The party is expected to win at least one-third of the seats for which the country's 17 parties are competing. The government is expected to be the great loser, receiving less than 10 percent of the seats in the new Congress to be installed on 10 August. Nevertheless, it is possible that the ideological affinity between the government and the Social Christian Party, parties separated by personal rather than ideological disagreements, will allow implementation of the government's economic opening program despite the government's minority in Congress.
