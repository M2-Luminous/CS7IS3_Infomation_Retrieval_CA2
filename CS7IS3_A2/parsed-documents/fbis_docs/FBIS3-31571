In an interview given to the Zagreb weekly DANAS, Muslim Deputy Foreign Minister Pasalic listed as the Muslim priorities at this time the recapture of the Lasva River Valley in central Bosnia and the launching of a counter-offensive in the Brcko area in the north and the Mostar area in the southwest. "It is our strategic objective to liberate central Bosnia (from Croat control). If we accomplish this, we shall improve our chances in the valleys of the Neretva in the southwest and the Bosna in the north, and, eventually, for the liberation of all of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he underscored. "It does not matter if it takes eight months, or four years, or even 12 years, we must and can war on," said Pasalic. The statement came at a time when tensions have been eased around Sarajevo with the withdrawal and placing of Bosnian Serb and Muslim artillery under U.N. control, which most politicians and media in the world interpret as a major step forward in bringing the peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosnian Muslims have invariably been rejecting all peace offers for Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the belief, encouraged by military successes against the Croats in central Bosnia, that they would get more territory at arms than they could at the conference table.
