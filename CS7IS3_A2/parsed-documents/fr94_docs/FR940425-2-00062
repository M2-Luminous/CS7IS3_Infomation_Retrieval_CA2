FR940425-2-00062 FR940425-2-00047 Proposed Methodology for Establishing Priorities for Health Care Technology Assessments The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) announces a proposed methodology to be used for establishing priorities for health care technology assessments conducted by AHCPR's Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA). The methodology consists of weighted criteria, which are based on a study by the Institute of Medicine, statutory requirements, and the results of a public meeting held by the Technology Assessment Task Force of AHCPR's National Advisory Council on Health Policy, Research, and Evaluation. Background The AHCPR was established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;239, December 12, 1989) under Title IX of the Public Health Service Act (the Act). The AHCPR is to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research, and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice (including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions), and improvements in the organization, financing, and delivery of health care services. In carrying out these purposes AHCPR, among other activities, conducts and supports specific assessments of health care technologies. Since the establishment of AHCPR, Title IX, including provisions of the authority for health technology assessments, has been amended by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;410, October 13, 1992) and the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;43, June 10, 1993). Section 904(b)(2) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299a-2(b)(2)) provides that in carrying out health care technology assessments, the Administrator, AHCPR shall consider the safety, efficacy and effectiveness, and as appropriate, the legal, social, and ethical implications and appropriate uses of health care technologies, including geographic factors. Public Law 102&hyph;410 added as a requirement that the Administrator also consider the cost-effectiveness of technologies where cost information is available and reliable. Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;410, consideration of the cost-effectiveness of a technology was optional. Section 904(e), as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;410, requires that the Administrator develop and publish a description of the methodology used to establish priorities for health technology assessments and a description of the process used to conduct the assessments. The ``Process for Health Care Technology Assessments and Recommendations for Coverage'' was published, with invitation for comments, in the Federal Register on December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63988). This notice provides the proposed methodology, consisting of criteria and numerical weights, that will be used in setting priorities for assessments to be conducted by AHCPR. Special consideration in setting priorities may be given to requests for assessments from federally financed health programs to assist them in making coverage decisions. Written comments on the proposed methodology are invited. The AHCPR will not respond to individual comments, but will consider all comments received in determining the final methodology. Once adopted the final methodology will be published in the Federal Register . Comments, in writing, should be submitted by [Insert 45 days from publication date of this notice] to: Linda K. Demlo, Ph.D., Director, Office of Program Development, Suite 603; 2101 East Jefferson Street; Rockville, Maryland 20857. All comments will be available for public inspection at the Office of Program Development, Telephone (301) 594&hyph;1457, weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. The AHCPR, through the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA), conducts assessments of health care technologies on behalf of the Public Health Service. Technology assessments, at the request of federally financed health programs, have been conducted and the results published since 1981. However, Title IX of the PHS Act does not limit AHCPR's authority for the conduct of technology assessments to only those requested by federally financed health programs. In 1990, AHCPR contracted with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study how topics for technology assessments could be prioritized. The IOM published a monograph in 1992, which outlines a procedure for establishing such priorities entitled ``Setting Priorities for Health Technology Assessment: A Model Process.'' Section 904 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299a-2(d)(4)), as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;410 in October 1992, states that the criteria to be used in determining priorities shall include: 1. The prevalence of the health condition which the technology aims to prevent, diagnose, treat, and clinically manage;
