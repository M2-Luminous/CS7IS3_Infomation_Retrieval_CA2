By 1996, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) said, the U.S. would experience export losses of 250 million bushels of wheat if China retaliates the withdrawal of its most favored nation (MFN) trade status. The resulting weaker demand and larger U.S. stocks will depress U.S. wheat prices by about 15 cents per bushel by 1996, the report said. President Clinton will decide by June 3 whether to renew China's MFN status, which makes China, like most other nations in the world, enjoy the lowest possible tariffs in its exports to the U.S.. "The psychological effect of losing a major foreign wheat market might tend to push U.S. prices down even further in the future," the CRS said in its report to the House Committee on Agriculture. The CRS stressed, meanwhile, that China will continue to be "a significant buyer" of American wheat assuming that China's MFN status will be extended. China became a major U.S. farm export market in 1987, when it broke into the ranks of the top 20 importers of farm products. Wheat has amounted to between 60 and 92 percent of China's farm imports from the U.S.. Since 1989, however, China's rank in wheat imports has slipped, with the purchase of 376 million dollars of U.S. wheat last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to the department, the Chinese typically prefer to buy high quality, high protein wheats, such as hard red spring or winter wheat, which they mill for flour for bread and other baked goods. "Other wheat exporting countries," the report said, "hold enough wheat stocks to fill China's lost supplies from the U.S., should China choose to reject U.S. wheat exports altogether" in the next three years. In addition to wheat, China purchases a broad array of U.S. farm products, including grains, soybeans, cotton, livestock, horticultural products and even wine and tobacco. Wheat accounted for half of the value of U.S. exports to China in 1992. A major proportion of U.S. wheat exports to China have been subsidized by the U.S. Government.
