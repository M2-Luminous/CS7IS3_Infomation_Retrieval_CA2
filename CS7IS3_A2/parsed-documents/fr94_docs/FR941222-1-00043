FR941222-1-00043 FR941222-1-00008 Discussion The volume reported by the industry in the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data for wastewater treatment sludge from the manufacture of azo pigments (K162) is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns. Over 99% of this wastestream currently is disposed in Subtitle D municipal landfills. Therefore, the Agency used disposal in a municipal landfill as the baseline management practice. In addition, as explained under Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency evaluated on-site monofilling as a plausible management scenario. The projected risks of increased cancer or hazard quotient above one for exposure to this waste are presented in Table II&hyph;2. The data presented in this table represent 16 samples collected from 4 azo pigment-manufacturing facilities. Eleven of the 16 samples were collected and analyzed by industry, and were submitted to EPA for evaluation. The 11 industry samples were analyzed using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), Method 8270B in EPA's ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'' (SW&hyph;846, Third Edition) but were not analyzed using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography/Thermospray/Mass Spectrometry (HPLC/TS/MS), Method 8321 in SW&hyph;846. EPA has reviewed the quality of these industry submitted data and has found that these data meet the Agency's data quality objectives and, therefore, qualify for inclusion in the waste assessment. Inclusion of these industry data, however, does bias the industry's characterization toward one facility ( i.e. , of 16 data points, 11 were submitted by one facility, and 2 were collected by the Agency at that same facility). The five EPA-collected samples, representing four facilities, were analyzed using both methods, a process which encompasses more analytes. Therefore, several analytes, specifically acetoacetanilide (AAA), acetoacet- o -toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacet- o -anisidide (AAOA), were detected in some or all of the EPA samples, but were not analyzed in the industry samples. The calculated risks from ingesting contaminated ground water associated with disposing these sludges in on-site monofills are very high. Three of the compounds that exceed risk levels of 1E&hyph;4 are common raw materials used as coupling agents in the manufacture of azo pigments: acetoacetanilide (AAA), acetoacet- o -anisidide (AAOA), and acetoacet- o -toluidide (AAOT). These three compounds were expected to be present in the waste, and consistently were found in the samples collected by the Agency. The three coupling compounds present in this waste, AAA, AAOA, and AAOT, are predicted to pose very high risks via ground-water ingestion when managed in an on-site monofill. As shown in Table II&hyph;2, the calculated risks posed by these compounds range from 1E&hyph;3 to 6E&hyph;4. These risks were calculated using metabolic product structural-activity relationships (SAR) for these compounds. A detailed discussion of the SAR for these compounds, and the estimation of toxicities for AAA, AAOA, and AAOT is presented earlier in this preamble, under Section II.C, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, and in the Health Assessment Background Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (See addresses section). These three compounds are high-volume couplers used in the manufacture of azo pigments. Based on RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, AAA is the third highest-volume reactant in the pigment industry, with over 8200 metric tons used in 1991. AAOT and AAOA also are used in high volumes; their 1991 use volumes were 2600 and 850 Mtons, respectively. AAA, AAOT, and AAOA were found in 85% of the wastewater systems where they are used. When detected in the wastewater system, the compound was found either in the wastewater or in the sludge. Table II&hyph;4 presents the number of wastewater systems where each of the three coupling compounds were detected. Table II&hyph;4 also shows the number of samples in which the three coupling compounds were detected relative to the number in which the compounds were expected.
