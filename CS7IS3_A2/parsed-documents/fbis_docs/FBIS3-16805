Here is what he thought of the visit. [Begin Olenenko recording in Russian fading into superimposed report in Estonian] The ambassador regards the fact that the meeting took place as well as its outcome as something very important. He is convinced that it will pave the way toward a strengthening of political, economic, and cultural relations between Estonia and Ukraine. The ambassador emphasized that the Ukrainian leadership and President Kravchuk will rate the visit and the agreements achieved very highly. The agreements allow for relations between our countries to develop further by using every opportunity to this end. Ukraine and Estonia see each other as equal partners. They do not set any conditions on each other. Instead, they aim for relations between our states to serve as a model for Europe, to serve as a guarantor for stability. [passage omitted] (end recording] [Announcer] I will remind you here once again what Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said at a press conference yesterday: There is no Russian-speaking population; there are only nationalities, the Russians, Ukrainians, Estonians. Why should a person who speaks Russian have immediate protection because of this fact?
