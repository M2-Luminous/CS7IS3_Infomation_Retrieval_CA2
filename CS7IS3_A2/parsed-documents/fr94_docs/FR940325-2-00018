FR940325-2-00018 FR940325-2-00004 Respondent argues that the amortization of patents and trademarks was included in the reported G&A expenses. DOC Position We agree with respondent. Upon review of the verification exhibits we found that the reported depreciation costs included the amortization of patents and trademarks. (See Exhibit 14 and Cost Verification Report at 12). Comment 8 Petitioner argues that, for purposes of calculating the CV for clinker in the final determination, the Department should use the BIA profit ratio that the Department calculated for the preliminary determination. Petitioner does not believe the Department should use the reported profit ratio because this calculation includes data on sales of non-subject merchandise. Petitioner argues that this profit ratio expands beyond the CA cement and cement clinker class or kind and, therefore, should not be used. Petitioner further maintains that in past cases the Department has consistently rejected the use of profit based on merchandise other than of the class or kind subject to investigation. Respondent contends that the antidumping statute does not require the Department to use the profit on the ``class or kind'' of merchandise in its CV calculations. Rather, respondent states that the statute directs the Department to use the profit rate on the ``general class or kind,'' indicating an intent that the Department have flexibility in choosing the appropriate profit rate, and not be limited solely to the profit on the merchandise comprising the ``class or kind.'' DOC Position We agree with respondent. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B), we have used the verified profit rate for all CA products, including the subject merchandise, sold in France because it represents the profit experience on sales of the general class or kind of merchandise in the home market. Comment 9 Petitioner contends that certain reported U.S. flux sales made under an expired master order allegedly renewed prior to the POI should be included in the Department's analysis as sales made during the POI. Petitioner argues that the master order expired prior to the POI and was not renewed prior to the POI as respondent claims. Despite respondent's claim that prior to the POI the parties ``evidenced a clear intent to continue the contract under the terms specified in the expired master order'' but failed to renew the contract due to internal delays, there is no evidence on the record to support respondent's position. Petitioner argues that implicit renewal of the contract is not legally binding (i.e., there was no binding agreement between the parties as to any essential terms of sale at the time shipments of CA flux were made to this customer during the POI). According to petitioner, any shipments made to this customer during the POI were individual spot sales with dates of sale established by the date of the invoices issued for particular shipments. Respondent argues that the Department should use the date of the master order as the date of sale for sales made pursuant to this contract (which it claims was renewed prior to the POI), and exclude them from the dumping analysis in the final determination. Although the original contract expired prior to the POI, Lafarge claims that the customer continued to purchase from LCA after that date in accordance with the sales terms set in the original contract. Moreover, respondent maintains that the orders placed by the customer during the POI continued to reference the purchase order numbers from the expired master order. According to respondent, the customer indicated its intent to re-issue the master order, but had not yet done so because of internal delays. Based on these facts, respondent maintains that the shipments to this customer during the POI continued to be governed by the terms of the original master order even if there was no formal written agreement to that effect. DOC Position We agree with petitioner. The effective date of the subject master order was prior to the POI. At verification, LCA could not provide any documentation indicating renewal of the subject master order prior to the POI. Without some documentary evidence of a renewal of the master order prior to the POI, we cannot assume, based on respondent's word, that the essential terms enumerated in the original master order (which expired three months prior to the POI) governed the subject flux shipments made during the POI. (See Crankshafts from the FRG and Gray Portland Cement from Mexico.) Therefore, we have included these sales in the final determination, using the verified date of purchase order (or date of invoice where the date of purchase order was unavailable) as the date of sale.
