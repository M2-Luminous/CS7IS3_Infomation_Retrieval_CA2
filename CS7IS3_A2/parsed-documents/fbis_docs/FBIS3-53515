Salman said that the sudden revelations about scandals to harm the person of President Clinton have suddenly surfaced in the defamation media on the eve of the summit and are merely open operations of blackmail aimed at intimidating the U.S. President and forcing him to remain committed to the Israeli logic during his talks with President al-Asad, as the Syrian minister put it.
