The year 1993 was a difficult one. We felt the full effects of the worldwide economic recession. Many jobs were lost. No one should remain indifferent when fellow citizens lose their jobs. I am also thinking in particular here of the psychological distress of those concerned and of their families. Many feel that they are no longer needed. That is not the case. We are all dependent on one another. It is our joint responsibility to secure existing jobs and create new ones. Reports show our economy improved again toward the end of this year. Things are also gradually getting better in our most important partner countries in Europe and in America. The important thing now is to decisively exploit these favorable prospects to improve employment in Germany. We must preserve jobs throughout Germany and create new jobs. That is and remains my most important aim, and this aim is achievable if we all work together -- employers and employees, trade unions and employers' associations, the state and the parties. However, overcoming the recession is insufficient in itself. With a view to the future, we must also simultaneously strengthen Germany as a business and investment location. The German economy has not worsened, but we all have to adapt to the fact that our competitors in the world have in the meantime improved and are more numerous than before. We have already made a number of important and also some unpopular decisions in 1993 to secure our future. Reductions in personal assets were unavoidable in this process; demands often had to be restrained. Only in this way can we permanently preserve the basis of our social security. We have again made good progress on the path toward internal German unity. Growth was really strong in the states of former East Germany. Many people's personal situation has improved. Unfortunately, existing jobs are still being lost, but increasingly we are succeeding in replacing them with new competitive jobs. Particularly in difficult times it is important to stand together. I know how much good will, how much public spirit, and how much willingness to help there is in Germany. Every day millions of people simply carry out their duties -- at work, at home with their families, and as voluntary workers at social establishments. I would like to thank them all most, most warmly. Hard work and public spirit are the basis for our country's wealth. Having confidence in oneself, being there for others, raising children, sharing with others -- these are the real sources of happiness. In this understanding of ourselves we will also complete the unity of our fatherland. Walls of indifference have to be removed in this process. This task can be carried out every single day. This is also true of the relationship between old and young. Elderly people deserve respect and affection. They have the right to recognition for their life achievements. We are now harvesting what they sowed. Therefore, it goes without saying for me that pensions cannot be touched and that pensions in the former East Germany must be brought up to the Western standard without delay. The youth is our future. In 1993 we again succeeded through common effort in providing enough places for education and training. We can all be happy about this success, and I thank all those who contributed. I am proud of our young generation. They are open-minded and cosmopolitan. They want to learn in order to achieve something later. They are prepared to take on responsibility in the economy, society, and the state. We are influenced by the developments and events in our neighborhood more than most other people in Europe. For 48 years we, the Germans, have been fortunate enough to be able to live in peace. Hardly any generation before us was granted this. Peace and stability are not available for free. They must be secured again and again. Therefore, we must press ahead with European unification and continue to develop our alliance with the United States. European unification and friendship with the United States will guarantee us peace and freedom in the future as well. We are all worried by the wars and bloody conflicts in the east of our continent, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. Only in a strong European Union can we effectively help to solve these problems. The Maastricht Treaty gives us new opportunities to do this. Europe is a fundamental basis for growth, employment, and economic stability. Not least, this benefits the Germans. Every third job here depends on exports, particularly exports to our neighboring European countries. Dear fellow citizens, we will also face difficult tasks in 1994. The discussion about the correct path for our country is good, and it is necessary. Despite all our differences we should, however, be fair in our dealings with one another, show respect and understanding for one another, and have patience with each other. The fight against hostility to foreigners and extremism must unite us all. Right- and left-wing extremism are a disgrace to our country! Despite all our troubles we should gratefully acknowledge that we have it better than most of the peoples in Europe and other continents. However, securing our future requires us to tighten our belts further. I know more and more people are realizing this is necessary. The tasks we have ahead of us can be solved. What we need are courage, realism, energy, and confidence. I wish you all a good new year. May God protect our German fatherland."
