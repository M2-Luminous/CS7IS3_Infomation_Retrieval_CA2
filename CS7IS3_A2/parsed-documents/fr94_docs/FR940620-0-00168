FR940620-0-00168 FR940620-0-00030 List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 172 Hazardous materials transportation, Hazardous wastes, Labels, Markings, Packaging and containers, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Issued in Washington, DC on June 6, 1994 under authority delegated in 49 CFR part 1. Ana Sol Gutiérrez, Acting Administrator, Research and Special Programs Administration. In consideration of the foregoing, Part 172 of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows: PART 172_HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TABLE, SPECIAL PROVISIONS, HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COMMUNICATIONS, EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION, AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 1. The authority citation for Part 172 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 App. U.S.C. 1803, 1804, 1805, 1808; 49 CFR Part 1, unless otherwise noted. 2. In Appendix A to §172.101, the paragraphs preceding the tables, and Table 1 are revised to read as follows: Appendix A to §172.101_List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities 1. This Appendix lists materials and their corresponding reportable quantities (RQ's) that are listed or designated as ``hazardous substances'' under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14) (CERCLA; 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq ). This listing fulfills the requirement of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), that all ``hazardous substances,'' as defined in 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), be listed and regulated as hazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. That definition includes substances listed under sections 311(b)(2)(A) and 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A) and 1317(a), section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6921, and section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412. In addition, this list contains materials that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has determined to be hazardous substances in accordance with section 102 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9602. It should be noted that 42 U.S.C. 9656(b) provides that common and contract carriers may be held liable under laws other than CERCLA for the release of a hazardous substance as defined in that Act, during transportation that commenced before the effective date of the listing and regulating of that substance as a hazardous material under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). 2. This Appendix is divided into two TABLES which are entitled ``TABLE 1_HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN RADIONUCLIDES'' and ``TABLE 2_RADIONUCLIDES.'' A material listed in this Appendix is regulated as a hazardous material and a hazardous substance under this subchapter if it meets the definition of a hazardous substance in §171.8 of this subchapter. 3. The procedure for selecting a proper shipping name for a hazardous substance is set forth in §172.101(c)(8). 4. Column 1 of TABLE 1, entitled ``Hazardous substance'', contains the names of those elements and compounds that are hazardous substances. Following the listing of elements and compounds is a listing of waste streams. These waste streams appear on the list in numerical sequence and are referenced by the appropriate ``D'', ``F'' or ``K'' numbers. Column 2 of TABLE 1, entitled `` Synonyms '', contains the names of synonyms for certain elements and compounds listed in Column 1. No synonyms are listed for waste streams. Synonyms are useful in identifying hazardous substances and in identifying proper shipping names. Column 3 of TABLE 1, entitled `` Reportable quantity (RQ) '', contains the reportable quantity (RQ), in pounds and kilograms, for each hazardous substance listed in Column 1 of TABLE 1. 5. A series of notes is used throughout TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 to provide additional information concerning certain hazardous substances. These notes are explained at the end of each TABLE. 6. TABLE 2 lists radionuclides that are hazardous substances and their corresponding RQ's. The RQ's in Table 2 for radionuclides are expressed in units of curies and terabecquerels, whereas those in Table 1 are expressed in units of pounds and kilograms. If a material is listed in both Table 1 and Table 2, the lower RQ shall apply. Radionuclides are listed in alphabetical order. The RQ's for radionuclides are given in the radiological unit of measure of curie, abbreviated ``Ci'', followed, in parentheses, by an equivalent unit measured in terabecquerels, abbreviated ``TBq''. 7. For mixtures of radionuclides, the following requirements shall be used in determining if a package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance: (i) if the identity and quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of each radionuclide in a mixture or solution is known, the ratio between the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) and the RQ for the radionuclide must be determined for each radionuclide. A package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance when the sum of the ratios for the radionuclides in the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than one; (ii) if the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture or solution is known but the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) of one or more of the radionuclides is unknown, an RQ of a hazardous substance is present in a package when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than the lowest RQ of any individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution; and (iii) if the identity of one or more radionuclides in a mixture or solution is unknown (or if the identity of a radionuclide by itself is unknown), an RQ of a hazardous substance is present when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) in a package is equal to or greater than either one curie or the lowest RQ of any known individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution, whichever is lower.
