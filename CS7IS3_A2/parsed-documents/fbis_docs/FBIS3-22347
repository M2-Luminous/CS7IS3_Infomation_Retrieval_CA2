Yuriy Kostenko stated this in conversation with the correspondent of Ukrinform. He stated that this is the opinion of his ministry. We have never come out against, and are not coming out against nuclear energy as such, understanding that the future energy security of the state is connected with the employment of nuclear energy. But the level of security of the nuclear power stations evokes concern. Unfortunately, the minister said, the departments which are responsible for them often follow only their own concerns, and pay attention only to the positive aspects of nuclear energy. Our fundamental goal is to do everything so that all branches of the economy do the least possible harm to people and to nature. Analyzing the world's experience with the development of nuclear energy, one comes to the conclusion, that it is not as effective as the ministries concerned imagine. And in this, the most telling is the experience of the United States, where the majority of nuclear stations belong to private companies. It shows that the cost of the electricity produced by nuclear power stations is approximately one and a half times higher than that produced by stations which use gas or coal. And this is in addition to the fact that in the United States the equipment is much more advanced than here. In speaking about the ecological aspect, it is true that if the station functions normally, it ejects into the atmosphere few harmful substances, compared with other energy producers. Nuclear power stations are ecologically cleaner, and their operation does not cause air pollution. This is a plus. But the minus side also cannot be forgotten. Accidents at nuclear stations can lead to disastrous consequences. The Chernobyl tragedy and events at other stations show this. Yuriy Kostenko emphasized that nuclear energy has to exist, but to act on different principles. That is, to be economically effective and ecologically secure. First of all, a closed nuclear cycle has to be created, which can guarantee a lower level of ecological danger. Another way is the development of less powerful but more effective reactors. In fact, this program is now being studied in the United States. In this approach, new types of reactors can be brought to such a degree of security that, in any sort of accident, ejections of radioactive substances do not go beyond the boundary of the thermal shell. If we choose this way, the development of nuclear energy in Ukraine will proceed successfully. All the more so because we have the industrial base for it, and personnel, and experience. But with all this, we still lack a clear, and well reasoned and calculated concept of its development. Speaking about the aspects of nuclear energy characteristic of the past year, Yuriy Kostenko pointed out that countries using nuclear power stations have encountered a series of complex problems. One of these is the security of the fuel. Previously, the government took care of this completely, allotting a great deal of money from the budget. Thus, the cost of fuel did not have an effect on the price of electrical energy. But now, when the majority of so called imposed expenses are imposed onto the stations, the price of electrical energy will grow. Another complex problem is connected with the exhausted fuel. It proved to be an especially difficult issue last year. A critical situation developed at the Rivnenska, Khmelnytska, and Zaporizka stations, where the storage areas at the stations were already overfilled. Unquestionably, this situation will force us to consider the necessity of creating national storage areas for exhausted fuel, to seek ways of acquiring fuel at cheap prices, and possibly to organize industries for this in Ukraine. The Supreme Council of Ukraine has cancelled the moratorium for bringing new nuclear power station blocs on line. I do not think, Yuriy Kostenko said, that it is necessary to bring them all on line. The three which are at the highest level of readiness are enough. I think, the minister emphasized again, that without the development of nuclear energy, though of a higher qualitative level, we will not be able to function.
