"Not a craft took off from airfields of Armenia even with training purpose that day", the defense minister told SNARK. Moreover, continued Sargisyan," an inspection group from Great Britain aiming to assess the information in the armed forces arrived on January 18 in Armenia and is currently inspecting divisions of the Armed Forces of Armenia". As to Sargisyan, such news is apparently spread for the justification of the Azerbaijani Air Forces' recent air raids upon settlements of Nagorno-Karabakh. Meanwhile, the defense minister did not exclude the possibility of bombing Armenia, for such public misinformation could be used by Azerbaijan as a propaganda trick.
