Since my visit to your country about a year ago, we have been able to make good progress in fleshing out the agreements we achieved at that time. Today, at the beginning of our talks, we discussed further initiatives, which we want to shape intensively over the next 12 months. Over the past years Asia has increasingly developed to an international economic and political focal area. As a turntable in the Southeast Asian region, your country, Mr. Prime Minister, is playing a special role in this respect. Therefore I welcome the fact that today we are able to continue our dialogue about the deepening of our relations in the political, economic, technological, and cultural field. During my visit to your country we discussed for the first time the idea of even closer cooperation between German and Singapore companies on the growing markets of the Asian region. I cite the PRC in this connection. I could also cite India or, for instance, aspiring Vietnam. There our companies can achieve great advantages if they proceed together. I would like to especially express my pleasure, Mr. Prime Minister, that your predecessor, current Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, will visit us in a few days and that this also shows the strength of our relations. In our talks we have always agreed on the particular importance that we attribute to the relations of our two countries in the economic and technological fields. The economic associations of our two countries -- and I would like to stress this gratefully here -- also decided in favor of this involvement right from the start. Therefore today we can sign the founding document of the German-Singapore Economic Forum under the patronage of the Asia-Pacific Committee of German Industry. However, I also want to stress that relations with your country and with Asia in general are of great importance not only for economic reasons but also with a view to cultural and political cooperation. Germany must be and remain a country open to the world. This also includes that we cultivate friendship with many countries in the world. I am happy that the friendly cooperation with your country, Mr. Prime Minister, has developed so well. In particular, I am happy that with the establishment of the German-Singapore Economic Forum we have managed to take another concrete step toward implementing the Federal Government's Asia concept. It is our response to the great and constantly increasing importance of the Asian region in the international economy. The task of the forum is to bring together companies from Germany and Singapore with similar interests in a direct and pragmatic way and to make good use of joint opportunities. I note with pleasure that two projects have been signed today. The German laender are also open toward our idea of cooperation, in particular with regard to the PRC. Only recently did a delegation of entrepreneurs, headed by the Bavarian economics minister and accompanied by an official representative of Singapore, visit a Chinese partner province. A delegation from Baden-Wuerttemberg will soon visit two industrial parks in China, which have been planned by Singapore. In this connection I would also like to mention that we expect Chinese Premier Li Peng to visit in a few weeks. It is our intention to contribute to having the important role of this important country in the Asian region meet with more attention and understanding both in the fields of economy and trade and in international politics in general. Today I expect the visit of the mayor of Shanghai and in a few days the mayor or the representative of Guangzhou. I consider these intensive talks and contacts very important to gradually deepen political cooperation. Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister, your country is enjoying an excellent reputation as a dynamic economic center in the Asian region. German companies have long valued this fact. Nowhere else in the aspiring markets in Southeast Asia are there more subsidiaries and representations of German companies than in Singapore. In many cases, they already fulfill supraregional business tasks. This is also a good basis for success in the work of the German-Singapore Economic Forum. Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to express once again my pleasure at your visit. From our friendly personal relationship I derive the certainty that we will continue this good cooperation in the future. If a problem were to arise at some time, or some matter were not to proceed as intended, we have agreed, Mr. Prime Minister, not to wait long but to contribute toward a quick solution in a personal talk.
