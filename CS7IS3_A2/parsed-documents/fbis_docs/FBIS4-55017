Discussions in the final-day session centered on government policies to promote economic reforms in the region and measures to close regional economic gaps, conference sources said. The participants also exchanged views on a declaration, adopted by business executives at a business forum Friday, calling for 200 billion dollars of direct foreign investment in the region by the year 2000, they said. Present at the discussions on Saturday morning were ministers in charge of economic, industrial and trade affairs and business representatives from the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations and 10 countries of Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics, they said. The declaration also called for the privatization of state-run enterprises in the 10 countries and promotion of East-West trade, they said. Eijiro Hata, Japan's minister of international trade and industry, told a ministerial-level session in the afternoon that Japan will cooperate to promote industrial development in the region. In connection with this, Hata said Tokyo will hold seminars in Moscow and Warsaw in late September to help promote the development of smaller enterprises, foreign trade and investment. Hata also said Japan will conduct surveys in two former East-bloc countries, including Poland, in 1994 and 1995 to work out measures to overcome the economic recession. The United States is likely to be selected as the site for the next session in 1995, the sources said.
