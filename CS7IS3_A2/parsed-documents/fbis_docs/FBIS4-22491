And every entrepreneur now operates under the threat of the court and penalties based on the legislation presently in force. First Deputy Chairman of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property Petr Mostovoy, one of the leading authors and elaborators of the law on joint-stock companies, has recounted to IZVESTIYA how the government intends to resolve these problems. "The obvious criminalization of Russian business," says Petr Mostovoy, "is in many respects related to the major deficiencies in the legislation now currently in force. Precisely that is why many entrepreneurs and simply adventurists calmly make deals knowing beforehand that they will not be able to fulfill their conditions and that it is difficult to make them answer for this according to the law. On the other hand, the victims also well know that it is simpler for them to conduct an `investigation' with the use of a fire-arm than legal proceedings." It is no secret that today we protect the rights of all participants in the economic turnover poorly. During the years of Soviet power our Civil Code underwent such changes that today it is absolutely inadequate for economic and legal reality and many situations have proven to be practically altogether without regulation. The question of the legislative regulation of the activity of joint-stock companies is especially critical. The draft of a law on joint-stock companies has been prepared for a long time already and its elaboration has been delayed somewhat precisely because it has been necessary to coordinate its basic norms, formulations, and terminology with the draft of the Civil Code. Moreover, the authors of the draft legislation, well understanding its enormous importance for the activity of joint-stock companies, have refrained from the temptation to introduce its basic provisions by presidential edict. Without the approval of so important a legal document by the parliament it would be more complicated to insist on the need for and the obligatory nature of its use for all joint-stock companies. Both the law on joint-stock companies and, in addition, draft bills on trading partnerships, state enterprises, non-commercial organizations, cooperatives and some others will be introduced together with the Civil Code for the consideration of the Federal Assembly. These acts are vitally necessary. The fact is that even the legal sphere of the activity of state enterprises, which constitute so significant a share of economy, leaves much to be desired. Thus, the institution of "complete economic authority" as the legal basis for the activity of state enterprises has long since outlived itself. In the draft bill it is planned to transform state enterprises in two directions. Basically, they will be transformed also into joint-stock companies with a varying share of the property remaining with the state and even with a 100-percent share of state capital. This is not simply a change of sign in P. Mostovoy's opinion. State enterprises as juridical bodies are thereby transferred into the category of active participants on the basis of the right of ownership. The possibility is created, incidentally, of recovering their debts with the use of a penalty on the property of such an enterprise. There also are many other positive features. The preconditions emerge for attracting non-state funds and investments into such joint-stock enterprises. Another alternative for state enterprises is their conversion into "public (kazennyy)" enterprises, i.e., operating not on the basis of the right of ownership and economic authority, but on the basis of operational control. The state is the proprietor of such enterprises, similar in status to institutions. Today the first precedents have already been created. Such enterprises as a port administration, enterprises for air traffic control and the use of air space, a basin administration on rivers and a further entire series of structures have been converted to the status of institutions, but with definite opportunities in the sphere of economic activity. What are the defects of our previous legislation? In the first place, norms ensuring the protection of the rights of the stock-holders are almost completely absent in this legislation. Norms which protect the minority of stock-holders from decisions taken by the majority to the detriment of their interests are lacking. In particular, those provisions which are common for world practice according to which stock-holders who possess if only ten percent of the shares have a right to convene a stock-holders meeting, to schedule an audit of the activity of a joint-stock company, to require a valuation of the shares belonging to them at a fair market price in the case of the reorganization or liquidation of the company, etc., etc. Such norms are present in the privatization legislation but they are absent in the general legislation for the country and for enterprises created outside the privatization process. For example, the activity of closed type joint-stock companies is very poorly regulated. This is a sphere of purely entrepreneurial initiative. With us such companies cannot be created with the participation of state capital, only with the participation of foreign investors. So, regulation of their activity falls outside the sphere of privatization legislation. The entire practice of the activity of these joint-stock companies shows that a stock-holder there is especially unprotected. Right up to the fact that the possibility of the compulsory confiscation of shares from certain stock-holders based on a decision of the general meeting is provided for in the founding documents of such joint-stock companies, which is complete nonsense. If any one of the members of such a company wishes to sell his shares, then he is obliged to sell them either to the company or to his favorite stock-holder at a price which is known to be unobjective. And there are no norms whatever protecting the stock-holder. The majority of the norms which protect creditors are also absent in today's legislation. In particular the norms related to the obligations which ought to result if a joint-stock company undergoes reorganization, is liquidated, or the charter capital of the joint-stock company is decreased. Such mutual relations of a joint-stock company with a creditor are not regulated in Russia. And the only alternative remaining to creditors is to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. As a matter of fact, Petr Mostovoy thinks, bankruptcy is not at all obligatory in the majority of real situations. If the appropriate norms were in effect in the general legislation, one should be able to regulate these disputes by other less painful methods. The courts before which applications concerning the bringing of a bankruptcy action come up don't know what to do with them, they haven't the practice, and there isn't an adequate normative base. The appropriate provisions have already been established in the draft bill on joint-stock companies. Questions related to the issuance of shares and their distribution are regulated in greater detail in it. It is well known that joint-stock companies issued additional shares in order to obtain funds to cover debts, that dividends were paid to stock-holders through funds received from an issuance, and that these funds were used for regulating mutual relations with third parties, which is not to be tolerated. What more new is there in the draft law on joint-stock companies? For example, norms regulating reorganization procedure: additions, mergers, divisions, separations. In today's legislation there are norms which concern only the merger of companies and they are present in one single document--in the provisional statute on holding companies. These norms have been treated in greater detail in the draft bill and have been extended to all types of reorganization. Questions related to the rights of the possessors of privileged shares have also been entered in greater detail. In particular the range of situations when they acquire the right to vote at a general meeting of the stock-holders has been defined: if the joint-stock company does not fulfill its obligations with respect to them, does not pay dividends over a period of two years, etc. They retain such a voting right as long as the company does not settle with them completely. If in the next few months the Federal Assembly will consider and adopt the Civil Code together with the law on the joint-stock company and the draft bills regulating the juridical relations of all the remaining participants in economic turnover, then, in Petr Mostovoy's opinion, Russia will secure a serious legislative base for the market economy and the sphere in which the state today is compelled to exercise its regulating functions will be drastically limited.
