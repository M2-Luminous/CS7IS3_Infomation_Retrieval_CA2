Since foreign semiconductors have succeeded in taking up 20 percent of the Japanese market, as provided in the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement, the Japanese electronic industry claims that "we already maintain a good relationship with the U.S. industry." It has so far remained calm. However, the possibility remains that the U.S. Government, which now takes a tough attitude toward Japan in economic issues, may again take up the semiconductor issue. The semiconductor industry has not shown signs of being affected by the U.S. Government's recent revival of the Super 301 provision (on the identification of and sanctions against countries guilty of unfair trade practices) of the U.S. Trade Act, and the tension in bilateral relations. While the share of foreign semiconductors has shown some decline since 1993, U.S. makers have been making moderate remarks all along -- such as: "We believe our company's share in Japan will continue to grow. We do not have any complaints against Japan" (according to a Motorola executive). In fact, the U.S. semiconductor industry's hands are quite full with meeting the U.S. market's booming demands. It has limited capability to supply the Japanese market. This is in great contrast to the past situation when both the U.S. Government and industry were unanimous in their criticism of Japan. Nevertheless, the U.S. Government may still take up the semiconductor issue because semiconductors are a model case for setting numerical targets, which is the key issue in the present Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, and this is being used as a "tool" in the overall negotiations. The share of foreign semiconductors in the fourth quarter of 1993 will be announced in mid-March, to be followed by bilateral semiconductor talks at the government level. Earlier this month, the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association [SIA] issued a report saying the share of foreign semiconductors in Japan will be 25-30 percent in 1996. While "this is merely a forecast, and is not a demand being presented to the government" (according to a SIA official), the semiconductor agreement is scheduled to be reviewed in the second half of 1994, and there is a possibility that the U.S. Government may make this a new demand. As the semiconductor issue is facing a delicate political timetable, the important thing is to make sure that face-saving measures will be ready for the U.S. Government, which has "brandished its fist." Although the U.S. industry does not seem to have any misgivings about the semiconductor issue, it is not in a position to go against the government's wishes. At a news conference given by the U.S. and Japanese semiconductor industries in June 1993, a Texas Instruments executive stated that "it is better not to have government intervention"; he was said to have incurred the U.S. Government's ire. Later, the SIA "revised" its comments and claimed that it "supports the Clinton administration's result-oriented trade policy." Therefore, the Japanese position at present is to try to win the U.S. Government's understanding while working to prevent the setting of new market-share targets -- which would be the worst scenario for Japan -- and, at the same time, seek new forms of bilateral cooperation, such as "design-in" (joint development from the design phase).
