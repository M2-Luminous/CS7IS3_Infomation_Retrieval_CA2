Economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences [CASS] and the State Statistics Bureau made their analyses and forecasts a few days ago. This so-called "Spring Report," based on an analysis and forecast of China's economic situation in 1994, was made by a study group presided over by Liu Guoguang, former president and now guest adviser to the CASS, and led by Li Jingwen, director of the CASS Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics, and Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist in the State Statistics Bureau. The group was comprised of many economic researchers from the CASS and the State Statistics Bureau. It is considered by international economic circles as a comparatively advanced method of analysis and forecast to use the means of combining modelization with positivist analysis to forecast the macroeconomic trend. The study group, which uses this method to analyze and forecast the economic situation in our country, divides its analysis and forecast into a "Spring Report" and a "Fall Report." "The Overall Measure for Macroeconomic Regulation and Control in 1994," carried in the last issue of this magazine put forward suggestions on the basis of last year's "Fall Report." The main points of the study group's "Spring Report" on the trend in economic development in 1994 are as follows: The Main Characteristics of China's Economic Development in 1994 In 1994, our country will maintain a considerably fast economic growth rate but the macroeconomic regulation and control will also face fairly serious problems. Generally, the economic development this year will have the following main characteristics: After two successive years of rapid growth, the speed of our economic growth rate will tend to slow down but the fall will not be too big. The economy will maintain its momentum for fairly high growth throughout the year and it is expected that the GDP will grow by 11.5 percent. The seasonal growth this year will tend to be fast at first and then it will slow down. Viewed from the growth structure of industries, the added values of the primary industry, secondary industry and the tertiary industry will rise by 3.5, 16, and 10.5 percent respectively. The gap between the growth in the tertiary industry and the growth of GDP will further narrow. This will be advantageous to the rationalization of the industrial structure. It is necessary to maintain a fairly fast economic growth rate in 1994. First, it will help avoid major fluctuations in the economic development, limit the effect of shocks caused by cyclical fluctuations of the economy, maintain the stability of economic development, and maintain the situation of social stability and unity. Second, a complementary relationship exists between the vigorous development of infrastructure and basic industries and the maintenance of a fairly fast economic growth rate. Basic industries cannot depend solely on stock adjustments to increase their supply capacity but must chiefly depend on investment to increase new supply capacity. This requires that the economy grow at a considerably high speed to supply funds and materials. It is only when the "bottleneck" restriction of the basic industries is alleviated that the economy can maintain rapid development. Third, it is also necessary to maintain a fairly high economic growth rate, especially in the comparatively backward and poor areas in central and western China, to improve the uneven economic development between areas and narrow the income differences between residents in various walks of life. Fourth, given that China relies chiefly on speed to obtain efficiency, only by maintaining a fairly rapid economic growth rate is it possible to ensure a steady increase in residents' incomes and constantly improve the people's living standards. Fifth, the world is "upbeat about China." In 1993, actual use of foreign funds increased by 91.5 percent while direct foreign investment increased by 130 percent. A sharp decrease in the economic growth rate will affect the introduction of foreign funds. The possibility exists of maintaining a fairly rapid growth rate in our economy. First, the deepening reform has provided a better environment in terms of economic structure. The development of economic sectors under different systems of ownership has strengthened the vitality of the whole economy. Second, in 1993, infrastructural construction developed fairly quickly, with communications and post and telecommunications doubling and redoubling and the production output of basic industries increasing fairly rapidly. With great increases in state investment in basic industries and a fairly quick development of the national economy for several years in succession, the "bottleneck" sectors have strengthened their adaptability to the speedy development of the national economy. Consequently, their restriction has been alleviated and will be further alleviated. Third, the nearly 2,000 billion yuan investment in fixed assets in 1992 and 1993 will gradually develop into productive capacity and consequently improve the supply condition. Fourth, in 1993, per-capita income of residents in cities and towns increased by 10.2 percent, that of rural residents increased by 3.2 percent, and investment in fixed assets on a society-wide scale actually increased by 22 percent. In 1994 the income of the residents and investment will remain at a rather high level. This will increase social demand and make it possible for the economy to grow quite rapidly. However, the analysis of the necessity and possibility of maintaining a comparatively fast economic growth rate is only one side of the problem. Under the current situation wherein the pressure of inflation is quite serious, we should be flexibly in coordinating the objective of controlling inflation with the objective of maintaining a fast economic growth rate and strictly prevent the occurrence of malignant inflation brought about by the blind pursuit of high growth rates by localities. Investment Remains the Chief Impetus For Pushing Economic Growth Ahead in 1994 In 1994, investment will remain the chief impetus to push economic growth ahead. The growth rate of investment will still outstrip that of the GDP. It is estimated that the total societywide investment in fixed assets for the year will reach 1,500 billion yuan, an increase of 27 percent or an actual increase of about 12 percent. The growth in investment scale will slow down but it is still necessary to maintain moderate investment. The main reasons are as follows: First, the maintenance of a certain scale of society-wide investment in fixed assets is highly necessary for the realization of a stable transition of the national economy. It will help prevent the occurrence of economic slide and the intensification of the contradictions between the general supply and general demand. Second, in 1993, the total society-wide investment in fixed assets increased by 50.6 percent, the highest increase since the reform and opening to the outside world began. However, because the construction scale was over-extended and the funds were far from being made available, the commissioning rate of investment in fixed assets was only 47 percent last year, the lowest for the past 10 years and more. Under such circumstances it is necessary to maintain a moderate investment scale. Any method of major retrenchment or big cuts will be inappropriate and cause bigger losses, mainly because it will weaken market demand and increase sedimented funds. Third, in terms of investment structure, in 1993, with the exception of communications and telecommunications, the proportion of investment decreased in those weak sectors that needed to be strengthened urgently, such as agriculture, energy, and raw materials. It was the lowest since the reform and opening to the outside world began. To ensure funds can be concentrated for the development of the "bottleneck" sectors and to carry out structural readjustment in an active way, it is also necessary to maintain a moderate scale of investment. The stress of investment in 1994 should be laid on structural readjustment and the strengthening of the weak links to reduce losses and optimize the structure. Fourth, after the rectification of the financial order in 1993, the monetary system itself has a lot of overstored currency. By the end of 1993, the provision rate [bei fu jin lu 0271 0102 6855 3764] of specialized banks in the central bank was as high as 11.9 percent. Besides, the pressure of increasing currency issues will no longer aggravate because of the reform of the tax system and the implementation of the new system of financial revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the banking financial system has the credit capability to support a moderate investment scale. Fifth, although there are still deficits in foreign trade the cash balance has increased, thus increasing the room for maneuver. However, one problem that cannot be neglected is that the scale of investment has become the most fundamental root cause of the pressure of inflation. The problem now is not how to make investment up to a moderate scale but how to control investment within a moderate scale. This requires that we should control the force of macroeconomic regulation and control appropriately and implement the financial, monetary, and fiscal policies correctly, while accelerating reform of the investment structure. So long as finance is not out of control, that is, the issue of new currency does not exceed 160 billion yuan and the scale of newly added loans does not exceed 550 billion yuan, the scale of investment in fixed assets will not be out of control. The Main Characteristics of the Current Inflation in Our Country Since the last quarter of 1993, the price levels of our country have shown a continuous tendency to rise. Since the beginning of 1994, the situation has tended to be more serious. In the first quarter of the year, the national retail price index increased by 20.1 percent over the same period last year. The central government has taken various measures to restrain the momentum of rocketing price hikes. Since March, price increases have tended to slow down. According to predictions, the commodity retail price index for the whole year will rise by 13.2 percent while the cost of living index for the residents will rise by about 14.5 percent. The increase rate will generally be the same as last year or a bit higher. The price index of investment goods will rise by about 15 percent, lower than last year. If we do not restrain excessive price increases quickly, this will hamper the reform, affect development, and also cause social instability. So, the price problem can by no means be treated lightly. We should analyze the causes of excessive price increases so as to take corresponding measures. On the other hand, we should flexibly coordinate-ordinate price control with the maintenance of a rapid economic growth rate. From the beginning of reform and opening to the outside world in 1979 up to 1993, the average annual economic growth rate was 9.3 percent while the annual rate of inflation was 6.4 percent. This situation was very satisfactory. However, in 1993 the inflation rate almost equalled the economic growth rate and, in 1994, there has surfaced the danger that the inflation rate will exceed the growth rate of the economy. So, the primary task of macroeconomic regulation and control at present is to balance rationally the maintenance of rapid economic growth and the control of inflation so that the national economy can grow at a considerably high speed and the inflation can be controlled at a comparatively low level. There have been obvious changes in the operating mechanism and the level of economic development of our country and the changes are still going on. In the course of the changes, the occurrence of inflation to a certain degree is the price we must pay for the realization of the reform and economic development. However, the present inflation has exceeded the normal scope. Its chief characteristics are: First, prices rise at the same pace both in cities and rural areas; second, the increase in service prices exceeds that in consumer prices; and third, the hefty price increases of daily necessities have caused strong dissatisfaction among residents. On the other hand, the problem of delinquency among enterprises is getting more serious and the stocks of certain goods keep increasing. The signs indicating that the cycle of economic operation is not smooth have emerged. These contradictory phenomena are worth our notice. There are various causes of the abovementioned abnormal phenomena. The direct causes which triggered excessive inflation in the first quarter of 1994 are mainly as follows: First, in 1993 prices rose because the investment and credit scales exceeded those planned and the structural price adjustments and price liberalization were carried out in a very big way. The aftereffects will bring the commodity retail price index up by 5 to 6 percentage points. Second, the nationwide grain price fluctuation which spread from south to north at the end of 1993 gave the impetus to hefty price increases. At the same time, the decision to raise the purchase prices of grain and cotton in 1994 also had a certain effect. Third, the personnel and salary reforms in the public servants system had the social effect of causing price increases to a certain degree. Fourth, although the implementation of the new tax system does not affect the total tax revenue very much, most of the 28 percent of the enterprises on which added tax are levied produce goods in short supply. The prices of their goods will therefore rise while the prices of goods produced by the 26 percent of the enterprises that have their taxes deducted are not reduced. Moreover, in the actual implementation of the new tax system, there have been instances of distorting the tax system and causing abnormal price increases. Fifth, when the foreign exchange rates were unified at the beginning of 1994, the single exchange rate was at first higher than the weighted average exchange rate before the unification. Consequently, the actual price rose on the foreign exchange market. Moreover, another factor which should receive attention is: As the old system of planned economy is being transformed into a new system of market economy, the traditional closed economy is transformed into a modern, open economy; the management, with administration playing a leading role, is transformed into one wherein the legal system plays a leading role; microinflexibility is transformed into microflexibility; and families with low incomes are changing into well-to-do and rich ones. Especially with the change from state price controls over most commodities to the liberalization of price controls over more than 95 percent of commodities, the interest principals in China are becoming increasingly diversified. So, before the establishment of a perfect market price management system, prices have become the important means through which different interest principals make profits. For a period of time, unstandardized phenomena such as arbitrarily raising prices, driving up prices, and willfully raising prices by monopolistic businesses will inevitably become more serious because management of the market cannot follow up immediately. The present price increases are not simply double inflation but are of a comprehensive type. To deal with this, we should not only depend on the control of supply and demand, especially control of excessive investment scale, but we should also supervise and control the practice of driving up prices and profiteering, establish a sound legal system, and order the market economy. We should change the situation in which the strength for price reform is strong, whereas the strength for price management is weak, and raise the work level of the government in controlling and keeping down prices. Analysis of the Trend of Economic Development in 1994 The "Fall Report" of 1993 predicted that there would be three possible futures for the development of China's economy. First, if the strength of the macroeconomic regulation and control is handled properly then the momentum of the "overheated" economy will be controlled, the inflation rate will begin to drop, and the growth rate of the economy will also drop to about 10 percent. Second, if the strength of the macroeconomic regulation and control is too strong or the retrenchment is excessive, the economic growth will lose too much speed and the economic "hard landing" will occur. Third, if the deep-rooted contradictions which impede the healthy development of the economy are not settled the macroeconomic regulation and control will be loosened in haste, amid the complaints about "funds shortages" by local authorities and enterprises. Consequently, the economic growth rate will regain its speed too early so that inflation will be rekindled. The economic situation in recent months indicates that the third result has occurred. So, stronger measures have to be taken and the danger of their leading to the second result still exists but it is possible for us to strive to achieve the first result. According to a positive analysis of the relationship between the development of the national economy and the price increases, generally, the abovementioned first and third results can be described quantitatively as follows: If the economic growth rate and the rate of price increases are basically kept at the same level in 1994, the GDP growth rate is 9 percent and the price increases are controlled beneath 10 percent, then the first positive result will be achieved. In view of the present actual situation, if the growth rate of the GDP is 11 to 12 percent and the retail price index rises by about 13 percent, it will still be a considerably positive result. If the price increase rate exceeds the economic growth rate by over 5 percent, as it did in 1988 when prices rose by 18.5 percent while the growth of the GDP was 11.3 percent, then we can judge that the economy has deviated from its normal development. So, one of the emphases in the economic work of 1994 is to achieve coordination and balance between economic growth and price controls. We should understand that the price raise, to a certain extent, is unavoidable in the course of the reform and that it is the cost we should pay for the reform. However, we should also note that price increases should be controlled within the scope sustainable by the people and society to create conditions to push the reform ahead and maintain a considerably fast economic growth rate. We can say that both opportunities and risks exist in 1994. If we fail to control both the investment and credit scales, even if the economic growth rate rises by one or two percentage points, the loss will outweigh the gain if the prices rise by 20 percent for the whole year. Eventually, it will lead the development of our national economy to a trough, seriously affecting the course of establishing a socialist market economy. If we do a good job in 1994, we can expect that economic development will further approach the expected goal of macroeconomic regulation and control. The growth rate of the GDP will be around 10 percent while the growth rate of investment will drop to around 20 percent and the price increases will be controlled at around 10 percent. Our economic development will further follow a steady upward course.
