"This will be one of the ministry's major objectives in civil affairs work for the following five years," he said addressing the 10th National Conference on Civil Affairs, which opened in Beijing on Thursday. In China, about 200 million people receive government assistance. The recipients comprise three major groups: families of martyrs and servicemen, disabled and demobilized servicemen, retired army officers, and veterans of the Red Army; childless elders, the disabled, orphans and poverty-stricken families; and victims of natural disasters. The rural and urban poor lived on just 400 yuan ($46) last year, while the average annual per capita in come of rural residents and city dwellers was 921 yuan ($105) and 1,400 yuan ($161) respectively. "The living conditions of the poor may be worsening for a time due to inflation, which will also make the government's social relief more difficult, the minister said. Meanwhile, the government anticipates problems in finding jobs for the tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers and large numbers of the disabled in the years ahead, due to the labour reforms and the intensified market competition among enterprises. One major way to ease the funding shortage and help the poor, the minister said, is to mobilize various forces to accelerate the development of public welfare projects. There are 43,681 public welfare institutions caring for some 724,000 individuals in China's urban and rural areas, but only about 2,000 of them are run by the civil affairs departments; the rest are financed by social organizations or individuals.
