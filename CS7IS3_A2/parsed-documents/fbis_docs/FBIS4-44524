The various major statements he has made concerning total reliance on the working class, giving full play to the role of the labor unions and similar topics are a scientific summation of the workers' movement and the work of the labor unions in our country, are the most formidable ideological weapon for the promotion of the healthy development of the labor movement and labor union work in our nation, and have become a major and integral part of the theory of establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics. The earnest study and penetrating research into Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on the working class and the labor unions is of extremely vital and immediate significance and profound historical significance as regards gaining a deep understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as regards the fundamental guiding principles of comprehensively carrying out the Party's basic line and wholeheartedly relying on the working class, as regards actively seeking out the new paths for the work of the labor unions which are imbued with Chinese socialism, and diligently creating new situations in labor union work, to come together and mobilize the billion workers to more closely unite around the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, to fight the hard fight, and win the great victory of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The book Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor Unions, edited and published by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), is one of the major foundations of trade union theory, and with major support and help from Central Document Research Office, the Central Archives and the news media, Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor Unions, is presented today to the reading public. This book is a selection of expositions made in various historical periods by Comrade Deng Xiaoping on the subject of the working class and trade unions, a total of 55 major pieces. Using the "Speech Delivered at the Ninth National Convention of the ACFTU" as the introduction to the entire work, the remainder is arranged according to historical periods, and incorporates 32 works written since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, 19 works from the period between the founding of the nation and the 3rd Plenum, and three works from the period before liberation. Of the 55 works included, 40 were taken from the first three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, three from Deng Xiaoping on Building the Party; four items appeared in the PEOPLES DAILY and the CHINA WOMENS DAILY newspapers; six of the works were published by the ACFTU; two works, "Outline of the Report Given at the Southwest Sector Cities Work Meeting" and "On the Correct Relationship of the Party with Mass Organizations" are here published for the first time. The introductory speech was given by comrade Deng Xiaoping as representative of the Party Center and the State Council at the Ninth Plenum of the ACFTU on 11 October 1978 when, with the bold vision of a proletarian strategist he revealed the great continent of China was about to enter the historical era of reform and opening up, and incisively pointed out that reform was "a great revolution" and clearly set forth the historical mission of the working class and the workers' movement, penetratingly explained that the work of the trade unions in the new era must be to educate and mobilize the workers to make contributions to the "four modernizations," that the trade unions must speak for and accomplish things for the workers, must struggle for the democratic rights of the workers, and lay an important theoretical foundation for opening up a new path for our nation's workers movement and for the work of the trade unions, which became the program of action for the workers movement and the trade union's work in the new period. Clearly one of the main themes running through Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor Unions is the ideology of completely relying upon the working class. The speech "Outline of the Report Given at the Southwest Sector Cities Work Meeting" published here for the first time, is the outline of a report personally scribed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in 1950 for the first cities work conference convened in the southwest sector. In this report outline, Comrade Xiaoping thoroughly explains how to rely on the working class. He says: first, from an ideological viewpoint one must realize the role of the working class, that if one does not rely on the working class, industrial production will be impossible and no advancement to socialism can be made. Secondly, we must organize the majority of the workers into the trade unions. If we neglect trade union work, our reliance on the working class will be without substance. Thirdly, be zealous in our concern for every aspect of the working class; take care of all their political, cultural, living and material benefits' requirements; do not lightly dismiss the "small matters" which are of benefit to the workers. Be on guard against the erroneous viewpoint of those comrades who rely upon them in times of difficulty but not when things are going well, who rely when they need them, and do not rely on them when they do not need them, who talk about relying on them but do not really think they must rely on them at all. Such errors must be corrected. Fourthly, relying on the working class must become the guiding ideology of the Party; it must pervade each and every department; it cannot be considered the responsibility of only the trade unions and the factories. These vitally important thoughts expressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping still have very real and practical applications, major theoretical implications and continuing historical significance under the new situation of reform and opening up. Wholeheartedly relying upon the working class has been Comrade Deng Xiaoping's consistent thinking. As early as 1956 in his report given on the revision of the Party Constitution at the Eighth Party Congress he elucidated the party's mass line. Speaking from the level of historical materialism, he pointed out: "Marxism has always held that, in the final analysis, history is created by the popular masses. The working class must rely upon the mass power of its own class and the mass power of the entire body of working people: only then can it fulfill its own historical mission." Since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has frequently spoke about the historical position and role of the working class, reiterating that "Through a long series of trials the working class of our nation has proved itself to be a revolutionary leading class steadfast in its stand." He has clearly pointed out that: "the working class is reliable." Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor Unions repeatedly emphasizes the relationship between strengthening the party's leadership and the labor unions carrying out their work in an independent and self sustaining manner. On the one hand he emphasizes that the mass organs should lay out their work in accordance with the overall work of the party, respect the party's leadership, and absolutely never support a work goal which is in opposition to party goals. On the other hand, he also emphasizes that the party committees should honor the independent nature of the mass organs, and should not run the union's show as they please without consulting them. We must not only avoid the tendency of the mass organs breaking away from the party's political leadership, but must also avoid the tendency of the party running everything. The present volume for the first time publishes the summation he gave at a meeting of high level cadre of the Taxing sub bureau on 20 February 1942 wherein he clearly stated that one of the major criteria for trade union work is "the question of the correct relations between the party and the mass organization." Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always paid close attention to the problem of democratic control of enterprises. In his "Outline of the Report Given at the Southwest Sector Cities Work Meeting" given in 1950, he specifically brings up the question about enterprises carrying out the "democratization of management" He is of the opinion that the democratization of management must take place within "reliance upon a union of workers and staff" especially it should come about in a form embodying the trade union, the workers management committee and the staff representative committee. If it is not done this way there can be no talk of democratization, since there would be no democratic content to it. In 1957 at the 3rd Plenum of the Eighth Party Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that "the congress of staff and worker representatives expands the democratic nature of the enterprise, is an ideal form which brings in the staff and the workers to join in management of the enterprise, staves off bureaucracy, and is one of the effective methods of handling contradictions among the people." In 1978 in his speech at the ACFTU's Ninth Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping reiterated: "All enterprises, without exception, must implement democratic management," "each enterprise's trade union should become a working organ composed of the staff and workers representative committee and the staff and workers congress." Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has taken as the order of the day the democratization of enterprise management as being one of the major components of reform of the enterprise management system. He has repeatedly emphasized one of the three major components of the reform of the political system is to "stimulate the enthusiasm of the lower levels, the workers, peasants and intellectuals to participate in management, so that the democratization of management can be realized." The nature of the socialist country and the basic socialist system determine that, no matter what changes take place in the enterprise system, we must always carry through with the thought of Deng Xiaoping, support and perfect the system of staff-worker congresses, and give full play to the role of the trade unions and democratic management rights of the staff and workers. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on the working class and the trade unions is large on content, incisive in exposition. Beginning with the inherent characteristics and historical mission, he reiterates the idea that the working class is the leading class of the revolution and calls upon the working class to display its glorious tradition of struggle and hard work and make its contribution to the realization of the four modernizations. He calls upon the working class to strive to grasp modern technological knowledge and management techniques, to act as vanguard role models in the reforms, emphasizing that the model workers and exemplary revolutionaries who appear among the masses of staff and workers are the models we study and the core about which we unite. He also puts forward the views that the intellectuals are one of the parts of the working class; and the working class in our country should strengthen its ties with workers across the world, and so forth. On the basis of a summary of the historical experiences of our nation's trade union work, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly points out that the trade unions are not something that we can do as well with as without, it should be an organization the workers can believe in, that speaks for the workers and does things for the workers, so that the broad masses of workers all feel that the trade union is indeed the workers' own organization. He believes that implementation of the four modernizations is the basic task of the trade unions in the new era and the quality of the work of the trade unions will influence the workers in the performance of their rights as masters of their house. He emphasized that the trade union organizations must keep closely linked to the masses, and must themselves be models of democracy. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches on the work of the trade unions clearly point out the path we are to follow, and are a formidable ideological tool for accomplishing trade union work in the new era. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics strive to find new paths for trade union work in the new era, and earnestly strive to create a new situation in trade union work.
