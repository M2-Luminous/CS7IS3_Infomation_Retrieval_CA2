Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-16MAR94-DPRK-ROK-U.S.-IAEA Pyongyang Appears to Seek Leverage on Nuclear Issue SUMMARY Pyongyang appears to be trying to grant the IAEA just enough access to its nuclear sites to prevent the collapse of U.S.-DPRK talks, a strategy that may be aimed at retaining maximum bargaining leverage with Washington. END SUMMARY Although Pyongyang media have not yet commented on the outcome of the IAEA inspection team's just-completed visit to North Korea, the South Korean news agency Yonhap on 16 March cited IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer as saying that although the IAEA inspection team was allowed to inspect North Korea's seven declared sites, it was not permitted to examine every item on its original agenda. Similarly, Seoul's KBS-I radio the same day cited the IAEA team as reporting that compared with past inspections, there had been "improvement" in inspection activities allowed during the IAEA team's latest visit. However, the team could not extract enough samples to prove definitively whether or not North Korea had diverted nuclear materials for uses other than what it had declared, according to the radio. Not surprisingly, Pyongyang is pursuing an equally minimalist strategy in its talks with South Korea. Pyongyang radio on 16 March accused Seoul of attempting to obstruct upcoming DPRK-U.S. high-level talks by blocking progress at the latest round of inter-Korean talks. According to the radio, at the latest round the North adhered to its "reasonable" insistence that the sides issue a joint communique declaring their basic intent to realize an exchange of special envoys at an early date. Pyongyang radio also asserted that the South had refused to accept the North's version of a draft agreement on procedural matters and claimed that Seoul is "deliberately" creating difficulties, bent on "putting the brakes" on DPRK-U.S. talks, tentatively set to start in Geneva on 21 March. Pyongyang seems to be calculating that by making limited concessions at the North-South talks, it can cast the South in the role of obstructing the planned talks with Washington. For example, according to Pyongyang radio accounts of the 16 March meeting, the North Korean chief delegate juxtaposed the North's "broad-minded and epoch-making" willingness to lift four demands that North Korea previously advanced in the talks to the South's "sanctimonious" rejection of North Korean proposals. Interest in Foreign Trade Despite its stance on IAEA inspections and North-South contacts, Pyongyang also seems to be tempering its hardline stance by carefully signaling that its long-term goal is to reach a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. To this end, the North Korean news agency KCNA waited until 15 March--the day a Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a threatening statement about U.S. preconditions on DPRK-U.S. talks--to publicize a set of free trade zone regulations that had been adopted on 21 February. The regulations concern the operation of foreign businesses within North Korean free trade zones. Similarly, the next day KCNA reported on regulations, also adopted on 21 February, for the implementation of the tax law on foreign enterprises. Both sets of trade regulations presuppose an influx of foreign investment into North Korea, an event not likely to occur without a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue. Implications Pyongyang media treatment of recent developments concerning the nuclear issue suggests that the North Korean leadership may believe that it has already given Washington enough incentives so that it would not be willing to risk the heightening of tensions on the Korean peninsula by breaking off U.S.-DPRK talks. Pyongyang appears to be trying to retain as much of its "nuclear card" and control over the inter-Korean issues as possible in order to enhance its position at any future bilateral negotiations with Washington.
