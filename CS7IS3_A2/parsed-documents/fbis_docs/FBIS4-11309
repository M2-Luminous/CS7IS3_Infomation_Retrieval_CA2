During debates at The Nation and the Emigrants Conference in this capital, the two parties also agreed that the U.S. blockade on Cuba is a obstacle on the path toward the adoption of practical measures to normalize ties between Cuba and its nationals abroad. Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the meeting, said the emigrants presented various proposals during the second day of sessions, among them a proposal to define the rights and duties of permanent residents in other countries. Other proposals include the creation of an emigrant visa, the possibility that those living abroad may study on the island if they pay tuition, and quick processing of paperwork for short trips to Cuba for humanitarian purposes. Another proposal made by the visitors was to establish Cuban consulates in various U.S. cities to better meet the needs of the Cuban community there. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said Washington already knows of Havana's desire to establish consulates in cities where most of the emigrants live. Robaina previously spoke about the official immigration policy and pointed out that it is impossible to resolve in a three-day meeting problems that have accumulated for three decades. He added that the conference is intended to hold discussions, to better understand each other's positions, and to initiate a process. According to Alfonso, the foreign minister noted that it is the Cuban Government's practice to keep people's feelings in mind before taking important measures, especially after 35 years of aggression and scars that have not completely healed. He added that any measures would initially include the identification of areas requiring atention, followed by the measures to be taken, and finally, a process to explain everything to the entire country. Another explanation was that it is impossible to attain the same rights and responsibilities for people living in Cuba as for those living abroad for different reasons, as it happens with almost all existing laws in the world. A total of 19 speakers, including 16 guests, spoke following Robaina's special appearance. Alfonso described it as a high-level dialogue. In the course of the dialogue, Robaina said the Foreign Ministry will now coordinate the work of all Cuban institutions responsible for handling immigration matters. The objective is to give systematic, efficient, and harmonious treatment to these problems, he said. According to the latest official report by the commission that organized the conference, the arrival of a new group of emigrants today brought the number of guests to 215 people from 29 countries.
