The French market, currently worth 260 MFF, is expected to double in the next three years. The distinguishing characteristic of FM AS/400 is the global nature of the demand (operation, maintenance and development, integration of software programs); hence the need for pooling know-how. Cisi will contribute its operational skills to the GIE. Boasting a turnover of 260 MFF in Facilities Management (out of a total of 1.52 billion FF), the SSII, which is also working with Bull on large systems facilities management, had decided to tackle the opportunities of the FM AS/400 market two years ago. It already has a few contracts to its credit (Bayard Presse, Cholet...). Soleri-Cigel, one of the foremost French AS/400 agents, can for its part claim expertise in development and integration of software programs specific to IBM minicomputers. Its sales from these products go as high as 120 MFF, out of a total turnover figure of 355 MFF.
