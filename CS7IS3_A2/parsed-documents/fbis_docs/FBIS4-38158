The next move the Clinton administration would very much like to see taking place in Washington soon is a Rabin-Husayn-Clinton meeting on the White House lawn. Such an encounter would also serve to inform the Syrians that they are running out of time. Al-'Anani, who is close to the king, willingly replied to YEDI'OT AHARONOT's questions. [Al-'Anani] The principle has been agreed on. What is left now is to find the right date. King Husayn told his hosts that he would meet with Rabin -- or with any other leader from the top Israeli Government echelons -- before a peace agreement is signed. Naturally, we expect progress to be made in issues pertaining to borders, water, security, and an entire series of topics that will be discussed later. [Shibi] Will we see Israeli ministers traveling to Amman to sign trade agreements in a year's time? Israeli civilians visiting there? Will you host the international economic conference? [Al-'Anani] To begin with, a preparatory conference will be held in Morocco in November. That will be the dress rehearsal for the events in Amman. If the debates make quick progress, I think everything you mentioned will come to pass. [Shibi] What message of hope can you convey to Israelis today? [Al-'Anani] I hope the talks we are about to begin will bear fruit. [Shibi] Will there be talks in al-'Aqabah and Elat? [Al-'Anani] Not necessarily. We have not decided on the final venue. There are other options, and we are checking them. The meeting may be held on both sides of the border in the 'Arava, with one negotiating team on the Israeli side and another on the Jordanian. [Shibi] Does Jordan accept Peres' formula according to which Jerusalem will be open in terms of religion but closed in the political sense? [Al-'Anani] We have received no detailed Israeli plan, but we are encouraged by what has been said so far. We will need to receive a detailed plan, and then we will respond accordingly. [Shibi] Are you satisfied with the aid you are about to receive from the Americans? [Al-'Anani] We have launched a process, and we encountered great new understanding on the part of the administration. They now understand Jordan's position, they appreciate our part in the peace process, and they are willing to support us accordingly. [Shibi] What did you get? [Al-'Anani] We were told to submit our requests, which will be screened by the authoritative ranks in State and other departments. [Shibi] Are you not apprehensive about the Islamic opposition in Jordan? [Al-'Anani] Each of us -- both Jordan and Israel -- has its own public and constituency to deal with. [end al-'Anani] It has been learned that Husayn asked Clinton for a $700,000 debt write-off. Clinton promised "that the request would be favorably examined."
