PTJ Director Jaime Abad visited the Presidency today concerning this matter. He met with Presidency Minister Ivonne Young to request a special allocation of 75,000 balboas to build the vault to store and destroy the drug. Abad said a large amount of drugs, confiscated in different operations, is being stored. [Begin recording] Abad: We are close to three tons of cocaine, and we are also storing marijuana. Ortega: Is there no way of getting rid of it? Abad: There is no way; there is no way. We have no room for it. There is, honestly, no room for it in the PTJ warehouse, which I insist is a warehouse and not a vault with extractors of contaminating gases. Our personnel are breathing those gases, contaminating themselves. They are showing allergic symptoms. This is not the most scientific method. As you may recall from the latest burnings, our detectives have to spread the substances with their hands when we incinerate drugs. We lack gloves and gas masks. Everything is done in a very rudimentary and totally archaic manner. [end recording] Compounding the matter, the incinerations done in the open air cause major ecological damage, incinerations the PTJ director described as a clear emergency. He added friendly countries such as Germany and the United States have been asked for assistance. Because there has been no response, an allocation for $75,000 balboas to build the vault to store and destroy the drugs will have to come from state funds. The legislative assembly and the executive branch will have the final word.
