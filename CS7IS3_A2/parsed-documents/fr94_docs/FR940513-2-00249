Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this notice does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this notice, as those policies and programs related to family concerns. D. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the Order. The NOFA will fund technical assistance and activities for resident management and other empowerment initiatives of public and Indian housing. It will have no meaningful impact on States or their political subdivisions. E. Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient Disclosures: HUD Reform Act Documentation and public access requirements. Pursuant to section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (HUD Reform Act), HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these documentation and public access requirements.) Disclosures. HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR part 12, subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) F. Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance. HUD's regulation implementing section 103 is codified at 24 CFR part 4 (see 56 FR 22088, May 13, 1991). In accordance with the requirements of section 103, HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.) G. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3531 et seq. ). Section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. Section 13 is implemented in 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of that part. Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD) (these are not toll-free numbers). Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office. H. Drug-Free Workplace Certification The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 701) requires grantees of federal agencies to certify that they will provide drug-free workplaces. Each potential recipient under this NOFA must certify that it will comply with drug-free workplace requirements in accordance with the Act and with HUD's rules at 24 CFR part 24, subpart F. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.853. Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437r; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). Dated: May 9, 1994. Joseph H. Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
