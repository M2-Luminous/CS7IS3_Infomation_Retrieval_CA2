Moreno and Garcia are certain the threats are the work of infiltrators from the Spanish secret service. Earlier this month the couple appealed against the Belgian decision to not recognize them as political refugees. [passage omitted] "They [the Spanish secret service] want to make the life of the Belgian Government so difficult it has to deport us from the country," they said. "But we know better. If the ETA is planning an attack, then it does so through its own channels. At the bottom of the threatening letter they always put the standard round stamp with the logo of the independence movement. Not some Arab signature or other." [passage omitted]
