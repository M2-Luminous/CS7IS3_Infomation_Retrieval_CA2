ACTION: Prohibition of retention. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting retention of Greenland turbot in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). NMFS is requiring that catches of Greenland turbot in the AI be treated in the same manner as prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary because the Greenland turbot total allowable catch (TAC) in the AI has been reached. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), October 5, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael L. Sloan, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Greenland turbot TAC for the AI was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and subsequent apportionment of reserve (59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 2,333 metric tons. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(9), that the Greenland turbot TAC in the AI subarea has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of Greenland turbot in the AI be treated as prohibited species in accordance with ยง675.20(c)(3), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 5, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 5, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25054 Filed 10&hyph;5&hyph;94; 1:45 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
