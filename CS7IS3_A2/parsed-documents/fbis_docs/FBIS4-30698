Investing Japan's technological and financial power in the project, the NLA aims to complete the project, which will establish a new industrial and communications base in cooperation with other Asian nations, around the year 2020. The NLA has worked out the plan in line with the National Land Development Council's recommendation that "it is necessary to work out a national land development plan that covers the Asia-Pacific region." The NLA plans to put the finishing touches on the project at a meeting of a research panel which will be established in June, with aim of incorporating the project in the next national land development plan. The project is to establish energy and power supply lines and optical-fiber information and communications lines by placing huge pipelines between Japan and the East Asian region, including Russia, South Korea, and China. According the plan, the pipelines, starting in Siberia, will run through to Japan via Sakhalin and will reach China via the Korean Peninsula. In addition to these pipelines, the NLA plans to place transport pipelines for raw materials. With the establishment of pipelines, it will be easy for Japan to obtain resources from Asian nations, and its supply of energy and raw materials will also be stabilized. The project, which includes the placement of high-speed, mass-storage communications lines, will also help promote and improve the international exchange of information.
