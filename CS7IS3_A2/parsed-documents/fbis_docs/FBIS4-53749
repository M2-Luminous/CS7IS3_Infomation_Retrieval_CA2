FBIS4-53749 "dreas099_n_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Vietnam Cooperation With European Union Reviewed Cooperation With European Union Reviewed BK2005121594 Hanoi Voice of Vietnam in English 1000 GMT 18 May 94 BK2005121594 Hanoi Voice of Vietnam English BFN [Station commentary] [Text] The ambassador of the European Union to Vietnam Mr. (Will Morgan) has said that the Union and Vietnam have potentials for development and cooperation. Here is our review of this relationship. Last year, the 12 countries of the European Union expressed interest in the development of cooperation with Vietnam. The European community has committed 40 million U.S. dollar technical aid to help Vietnam develop afforestation. Last month, the European Union Parliament approved the signing of a treaty of cooperation between the EU and Vietnam. EU member countries then advanced the draft frame agreement for the discussion of cooperation and investment in Vietnam. According to the EU Ambassador to Vietnam, in June, EU will continue the discussion of the draft agreement and it might be signed in October this year. These developments are positive signals for the development of economic relations between Vietnam and the EU member countries. At present, Vietnam has a big contingent of scientists, but is in short of capital. Once the agreement is signed, it will enable the operation of the European bank in Vietnam. That means Vietnam can obtain loans for economic development, and at the same time, Vietnamese and foreign scientists have opportunities for cooperation. Speaking with newsmen in Vietnam last week, Mr. (Will Morgan) said that the EU is expecting a long-term cooperation with Vietnam. The two sides will also establish an official committee between the EU parliament and the National Assembly of Vietnam. There are enough conditions for strong cooperation between Vietnam and the EU.
