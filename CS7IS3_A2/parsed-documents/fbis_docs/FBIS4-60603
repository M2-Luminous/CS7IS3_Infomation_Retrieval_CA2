With an area of 1,500 square kilometers (600 square miles), population of 60,000 and vast natural gas resources, the island off southern Iran aims to turn into a major industrial and offshore banking zone. Qeshm "can compete with other free-trade zones in the region and serve as a center for trade with Central Asian countries," said the managing director of the zone, Behruz Bushehri. However, the authorities have failed to attract major foreign investment since the island on the Strait of Hormoz, through which one-fifth of the world's crude passes, was turned into a free-trade zone three years ago. Western economic experts blame reluctance to invest in Qeshm on the lack of clear investment laws in Iran, saying the existing regulations do not provide adequate guarantees. Although officials on the island say potential foreign investors can sink up to 100 percent in a project, the Iranian constitution limits foreign ventures in Iran to 49 percent. Bushehri acknowledged to journalists that foreign investments in Qeshm would "not be insured by the central bank," whose guarantee most potential investors have sought. Guarantees would come instead from the Organisation of Free-Trade Zones in Iran, which oversees Qeshm, Kish (also on the Gulf), Chah Bahar (on the Sea of Oman), Sirjan (in Kerman Province) and Bandar-e 'Anzali (on the Caspian). Bushehri also confirmed that foreigners were not allowed to own land in free-trade zones. After having been used as a platform for importing luxury goods over the past three years, Qeshm now seeks to help boost exports and serve as a financial center in the region and a base for offshore banks. These ambitious projects could prove difficult on a sun-scorched island which up until recent years had been left abandoned. Except for a 108-room hotel under construction with Malaysian money, none of the joint-venture projects of the past three years have yet been launched, mainly due to lack of funds. Among the projects are a steel foundry with Japan's Kobe company, a power plant with Germany's Siemens, a cement factory with China and a fertilizer plant with India. A Qeshm official, who declined to be identified, admitted any competition with the free-trade zone of Jabal 'Ali across the Gulf in Dubayy, United Arab Emirates [UAE], would be difficult. He pointed to "sizeable investments made there by multinational corporations, which all have the green light from the United States." Washington, which fell out with Tehran when the 1979 Islamic revolution deposed the pro-Western shah, has imposed economic sanctions on Iran for its alleged support of terrorism. The Qeshm authorities, however, are gradually developing the island, having joined it to the nationwide electricity grid and built hundreds of kilometers of paved roads over the last two years. Work has also begun on the construction of an international airport, although plans to build a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) road and railway bridge to connect the island to the mainland are still on the drawing board. A project to build a deep-water port to cater for big ships has also failed to make headway. But while the authorities await foreign investments and economic prosperity for the island, the people of Qeshm are casting their eyes across the Gulf at Dubayy, the eldorado of the region. The port city in the UAE is the main source of smuggled goods entering Iran.
