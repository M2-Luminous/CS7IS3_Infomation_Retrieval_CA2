Qoroqi, one of our political correspondents, has prepared the following report on the development process in the Central Asian republics and the Caucasus: [Begin recording] [Qoroqi] Economic development in the republics of Central Asian and the Caucasus cannot be a phenomenon that is independent from the multifaceted socio-political-security aspects in these countries. The obstacles to these republics' development are linked with their past. Contrasts between the way the people and the government feel about the implementation of economic projects, as well as cash-flow shortages are among the main obstacles to development in these republics. (Formin), a specialist on regional affairs from Russia talked about the obstacles to development in Central Asia and Iran's role in the development of these countries: [Formin, in English with superimposed translation into Persian] Obstacles to the industrial and economic development of Central Asian countries are extremely extensive and diverse. The most significant of these obstacles is the economic instability in these republics and the complete dominance over these industries by the Russians. Because of their strong dependence on Russia for technological know-how, these countries are not able to sever their economic relations with Russia. The Islamic Republic of Iran's economic cooperation with these countries is of special importance to them because to them Iran is like a window to the free world through which they can expand their relations with the world. [Qoroqi] Kazem Sajjadpur, a professor at the International Relations College, also commented on the same topic and said: [Sajjadpur] Generally speaking, the unspecified nature of the security situation in these countries on all levels--on the individual, national, and regional levels--is the biggest obstacle to development. In addition, there is the economic element and the fact that their economic systems are extremely dependent on Moscow because of the former economic structure, which cannot be easily changed. At any rate, we should also view matters from a positive perspective too -- there is some interest in solving security problems and in moving toward development in these areas. In other words, it is not a matter of obstacles only. There is also an interest in solving these problems. [end recording]
