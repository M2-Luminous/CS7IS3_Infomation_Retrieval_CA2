FBIS4-13168 "drnes074_l_94013" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 ISRAEL `Peace Package' Offer to Syria Detailed `Peace Package' Offer to Syria Detailed TA1704080994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 17 Apr 94 pp A1, A10 TA1704080994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] [Excerpts] On 15 April, Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, received a draft offer for a "peace package" with Syria, to be given to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in order that he relay it to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Staff work on the formulation of the "peace package" with Syria was conducted by Major General Ilan Biran on behalf of Rabin. Biran, who over the past several months had no IDF [Israel Defense Forces] assignment, will assume duty as commander of Central Command today. Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States and head of Israel's delegation for negotiations with Syria, also participated in drafting the document. Parallel with the work on the "peace package" for the Syrians, the IDF has begun preparing a list of security demands Israel will present to the United States to compensate for the peace risks. The "peace package" with Syria presents the principles of the offered arrangement, and does not detail the depth of withdrawal and the time needed for its implementation. Israel will suggest to Syria that the details be worked out in direct discussions on the expert level. The "peace package" with Syria is made of four basic elements: withdrawal from the Golan, peace relations, security arrangements, and a timetable for the implementation of the withdrawal and the normalization. Among other things, the Israeli offer to the Syrians will include the following points: -- A commitment in principle to withdraw. The offer does not contain a pledge to fully withdraw from the Golan Heights. -- Full peace relations, including embassies, open borders, and economic ties. -- A gradual implementation of the withdrawal over years. -- Establishing normalization and relations between Israel and Syria right after the first stage of withdrawal, while the IDF still holds a significant part of the Golan Heights. -- A future discussion of water resources on the Golan. -- Security arrangements that will include demilitarizing zones, force reductions, warning stations; and the deployment of an international force to supervise the implementation of the arrangement. The security arrangements will be reciprocal, but not symmetrical: Syria will be asked to demilitarize a larger territory than Israel. Senior political sources yesterday said that the United States does not demand that Israel currently detail its stands beyond a general description of principles because Israel is way ahead of Syria in presenting its stands. Syria has not yet drafted a similar offer. The presentation of the basic components of the "peace package" was at the center of Rabin's meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington last month. Israel pledged to present the package to Secretary of State Christopher so that he relay it to the Syrians during his upcoming visit in the region. According to reports received in Israel recently, al-Asad is expecting the Israeli offer from Christopher. Parallel with the arrangement with Syria, Israel will demand that the United States bolster Israeli security, and assist in implementing and guarding the arrangement. Rabin discussed the issue with the heads of the U.S. Administration, and the issue was also broached in meetings Ambassador Rabinovich held with U.S. officials, but it has not yet been raised in contacts between the Israeli defense establishment and the Pentagon. Rabin will discuss the security demands with Christopher. Israel will not ask that military aid be expanded, only that its current level of $1.8 billion annually be maintained, as Clinton promised. Among the ideas raised in internal discussions were the placement of large amounts of U.S. arms and ammunition in Israel ahead of time; expanding the use by the 6th Fleet of the Haifa port; a deployment of armed U.S. Navy vessels along the Israeli coast to serve as the launching pad for intervention forces in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, and Africa; expanding Israeli access to U.S. warning systems and sophisticated armament. Israel will also demand that strategic and political coordination with Washington be tightened. [passage omitted] The offer for an arrangement with Syria recently drafted by the Foreign Ministry, which includes a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights as its working assumption, was prepared without any connection to the staff work prepared upon the request of the prime minister.
