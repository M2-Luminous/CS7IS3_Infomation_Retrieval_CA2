There was no Jordanian confirmation of the report. King Husayn brought President Salih and Vice-President al-Bid, as well as other Yemeni political leaders together in Amman in February to sign a reconciliation and reform agreement. However, the accord was not implemented and the king said last month that Jordan was leaving a joint military commission entrusted with separating the northern and southern army units.
