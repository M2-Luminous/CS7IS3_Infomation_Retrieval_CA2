It is known that holding Syrian-Egyptian consultations on hot regional issues has become a tradition in the life of the two countries. When these consultations rise to the level of a direct meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Mubarak, this emphasizes the importance of the topics under discussion. In fact, the region is close to making a decision on the resumption of the peace talks in Washington. The parties directly involved in the peace are expected to hold a joint meeting to discuss the issue of resuming the talks and to emerge with a unified Arab stand. Consequently, it is natural for the two sisterly countries -- Syria and Egypt -- to hold consultations on the highest levels to assess the peace process and future prospects in light of regional developments and contacts with the United States. It is common knowledge that the Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton has revived the world's hopes about the possibility of advancing the Middle East peace process. No progress has yet been made in this process due to Israel's intransigence and because the Zionist lobby in the United States has moved to disrupt any effective and influential U.S. role. The latest round of the Washington talks ended just as they started, without any significant results. Moreover, Israel has reciprocated the sincere Arab intentions with the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This was followed by President Clinton's reported commitment before Zionist organizations in the United States to keep unified Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 242 and the policies of the previous U.S. Administrations, which refused to acknowledge the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and insisted on considering it part of the occupied territories. Afterward, the U.S. secretary of state expressed readiness to visit the region, but he said that he would not put any pressure on Israel. This is despite the fact that Israel's procrastination and maneuvering have made it impossible to make any progress. After this, the Zionist lobby in the United States pushed the U.S. Administration to adopt extortionist stands defaming Syria and aimed at dissuading it from its principled stands on the aspired peace in the Middle East. All these issues and developments need meticulous Arab assessment. Syria has offered great services for the peace issue and frequently saved it from Israel's plotting. However, Syria does not negotiate for the sake of negotiations, but in quest for a genuine, just, comprehensive, and honorable peace that is based on the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions and leads to the return of Arab rights and territories. Syria has joined the peace process in the hope that the U.S. Administration will honor its pledges and play the role of a fair and impartial full partner. However, so far, pledges to play such a role have not been turned into tangible action. The talks are taking place in a vicious circle and Israel is committing massacres and crimes in front of the entire world. Meanwhile, the U.S. Administration refrains from condemning these massacres and crimes. Besides succumbing to the Zionist lobby, the U.S. Administration has also placed Syria on the list of terrorism. Syria adheres to the bases of a just, comprehensive peace as outlined by the Madrid conference, the UN Security Council resolutions, and the meetings of the Arab foreign ministers. Syria is not in the habit of giving in to extortion or relinquishing its own or other Arab territory or any national and pan-Arab rights. Therefore, Syria holds consultations with its sisters, in particular Egypt. As shown by modern and ancient history, Syria and Egypt are the backbone and main power of the Arab nation. The Arab people everywhere pin great hopes on coordination between Syria and Egypt and on their efforts to revive pan-Arab solidarity and unify stands. President al-Asad headed for Cairo proceeding from these bases and principles and in his quest for a pan-Arab position that maintains the Arab nation's rights and stresses its concept of a just, comprehensive peace.
