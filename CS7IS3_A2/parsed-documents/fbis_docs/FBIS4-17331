Kazannik offered to resign in February in connection with the release of anti-Yeltsin rebels after the State Duma proclaimed a political amnesty. Yeltsin accepted the resignation and appointed Aleksey Ilyushenko as acting prosecutor general. But Kazannik later changed his mind and the Federation Council, which appoints and dismisses the prosecutor, voted to reinstate him. To end the crisis Kazannik offered to resign again. The Federation Council now has to discuss the appointment of Ilyushenko. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was entrusted by the president to press for the appointment in the Federation Council.
