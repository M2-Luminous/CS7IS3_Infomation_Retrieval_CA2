It appears that the cover of darkness was not enough for the dawn visitors, for they deepened the cover of darkness with the cover of national dialogue (one layer of darkness upon another). The security confrontations with the MB in the past three years were characterized by partial and limited blows in various areas (the issues of the Dar al-Wafa' Publishing House in al-Mansurah, the Propagation Society in Bani Suwayf, the Salsabil case, the al-Sharqiyah case, and the case of the sports plot in Damietta to overthrow the regime by using a deflated soccer ball). But the recent confrontation marks a change in the security policy, because it was a comprehensive and widespread confrontation that included a number of governorates; it was a preparation for a bigger blow (as some are analyzing, calling for, and preparing for in government papers and magazines) similar to the blows of 1954 and 1965. We pray to God to spare the nation from the evils of this sedition. The regrettable thing is that the magazine AL-MUSAWWAR prepared us for this recent blow several days ago in its issue of Friday, 27 May, which went on sale on Wednesday, 25 May. The magazine promised to publish the al-Salsabil case's documents in its next four issues (step by step with security). In the same issue, the magazine published what it said were documents pertaining to the issue of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, which it had obtained through its security or government contacts, though the magazine's documents are not worth the paper they are printed on. The latest confrontation against the Islamic trend in general and the MB in particular began in the wake of the Lawyers Association's general elections at the end of 1992, in which the Islamic trend won a majority of seats. The progovernment writers' anger was aroused, and they appealed to what they called the "silent majority" to play a role in liberating the unions from the "Islamists." The result was the enacting of the "muddled" law of professional associations in February 1993. Union elections were held in accordance with this law, but the silent majority gave its vote to the Islamic trend and this in turn inflamed the pro-authority writers still further, resulting in the strikes by security forces. Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani's case set off the recent confrontation. The security organs used this as a pretext to deal a blow to the MB. But their attempt failed because the lawyers' recent action involved them all, regardless of their political affiliations. They did so to defend their association and the rights of its members in particular and Egyptian human rights in general. Going back to the Salsabil case, which was the focus of AL-MUSAWWAR's documents and which it began to publish in its recent edition, we find that the magazine notes that it will publish in its next edition the MB's secret plans to establish a party, as if the establishment of a party is a crime punishable by law and the MB's reputation has to be blackened. The MB has been trying through the judiciary to ascertain its legality for more than 25 years. Obstacles are placed in its way even though it is trying to operate publicly through a legal party it is seeking to establish. What is the crime in that? The MB is a major political faction and has a right to express itself through a party. If you, the pro-authority writers, are saying that it is a secret organization, then why do you not ask the authorities to let it be a public organization through the establishment of a legal party as part of the state's public order system, especially since none of AL-MUSAWWAR's documents indicate that the MB has used or even condoned violence? If we accept that the MB has a right to operate through a party that is being established, is it not also its right to organize its ranks? Was there a need, for example, to arrest the Nasirites before they declared that they wanted to form a party, on the pretext that they constituted a secret organization or a putative party? We in the Labor Party have always advocated the right of the MB and the Nasirites to establish their own parties. Now that the Nasirites have done so, there remains the right of the MB to operate through a legal party. Since its establishment, the Labor Party has consistently sought to renew its blood by changing its officials from bottom to top every two years through elections. Will the National "very Democratic" Party follow the example of the Labor Party and MB or will it be content to use the name "democratic" without content? AL-MUSAWWAR talks about a document that includes certain recommendations to the MB members should they be arrested. Assuming that these documents are true, we would like to ask if there is anything strange about this, particularly since the MB has been exposed to all this coercion since the late 1940s. What is strange about providing the MB members with certain legal information to confront the security agencies' fabrications and allegations? The AL-MUSAWWAR editorial touches on the MB's plans to penetrate the professional associations, trade unions, and student federations. It said that the MB and the Muslim streams are seeking to marshal their supporters so that these associations play a correct role on the national and professional levels. What did the ruling party do in this respect? Definitely nothing, because the trade unions and student elections take place in a true democratic atmosphere, which does not suit the National "Democratic" Party. We are writing this from the vantage point of the ranks of the Labor Party. What we are saying is right and must be said to back our brothers, who are working within the framework of legitimacy and the law despite the severe harassment and coercion facing them. Perhaps it is useful to recall what Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri said in his political statement before the Party's Sixth General Congress, and what 'Adil Husayn said in his latest article: That the MB is the closest political and Islamic group to us, and we have been in an alliance since 1987 under the motto "the Islamic solution program." There are certain differences in details between us, and that is why each party maintains its independent organizational entity. Confrontation with the Islamic reformation trends is erroneous and serves the schemes of the nation's enemies. The Labor Party has encountered severe coercion. After the Labor Party's political statement, which defined the party's Islamic identity, was issued at the Party's Fourth General Congress in January 1987, the security agencies began their war by trying to torpedo the party from within. The party's members, however, foiled the security agencies' plans and frustrated these subversive attempts at the party's congress in 1989. The Security agencies continued their subversive attempts, instigating divisions in the party's ranks. They then used certain security personnel as dupes every time the party adopted a correct national and Islamic stance on the regime's erroneous political positions. When the people got fed up with these dupes, the security agencies began to change their methods: In several governorates they began to summon the party's leaders and newspaper writers to the prosecution's office, arrest its members and incessantly coerce them. This fierce onslaught and human rights are indivisible. Therefore, all sincere national groups must confront this onslaught. What the Labor Party and the MB are confronting today will confront the Nasirite Party, the National Progressive Unionist Party, and the Wafd party tomorrow, and the others later. There is no need to recall the wisdom of the black bull, who said he was eaten the day the white bull was eaten. It is strange that the government is turning a blind eye to the external enemies and is daily creating new enemies out of the people's sons, as if all the people are its enemies or an enemy government is ruling the people. It is a short-sighted government that fights in all directions simultaneously: A war against the violent Muslim groups, against the depositors in the capital investment companies, against Egyptian workers abroad with the new tax law, against the trade unions with the unified trade unions law, against workers with the unified labor law, against our kinfolk in the countryside with the mayors law, against the university professors with the law on appointments of deans. O ruling Egyptian Government: Don't you have one wise man to make things right?
