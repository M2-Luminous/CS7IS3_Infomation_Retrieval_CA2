The non-acceptance of peace and agreement on cessation of clashes and territorial division as well as certain open encouragement (from the Moslem leadership) for the continuation of the war are the main characteristics of the Moslem religious-political activities in recent months, Gvero said in a statement to TANJUG. He also pointed at the fickleness of the Moslem negotiators, the deliberate ambiguity of their stands and their failure to keep their word and observe signed documents. The assistant commander of the general staff of the Army of the Bosnian Serb Republic, however, assessed that "political realists, which have increasingly more followers, such as Fikret Abdic and individuals in Tuzla, Zenica, Sarajevo and in other places have started to appear among the Moslems." He added that attempts, mainly unsuccessful, have been made to prevent these people by means of political terror and armed violence. "Clashes between Moslem formations in different parts of the Moslem-controlled territory are ever more frequent, fierce and on a broader-scale," Gen. Gvero recalled and said "the life of the majority of the Moslems, politically uninterested, is very difficult and rapidly deteriorating." Precisely due to this fact the Moslem authorities, as Gen. Gvero said, have been attempting to conquer Serb and Croat territories with arms in order to gain political points and calm the ever broader social rebellion. Speaking about the Moslem propaganda regarding the losses inflicted on Bosnian Serbs, Gen. Gvero said it was in fact "an attempt to prevent the pronounced erosion of the moral of the Moslem troops and population." "These propaganda attempts are sufficiently transparent that no one believes in them," he said and added that the Moslems should know to demand "responsibility from those who are plunging them into sure death and further unnecessary suffering while they themselves are getting richer on account of the war and have houses and foreign exchange savings abroad." "The Moslem people and the forcibly mobilized troops should know that peace could be achieved very quickly," Gen. Gvero said and underscored that "Moslem leaders, who from warm offices thunderously speak of war in which they push others, are guilty if there is no peace." "It is obviously an attempt to pursue policies and wage war according to religious canons," Gen. Gvero concluded and added that the Army and the leadership of the Bosnian Serb republic were "persistent in the struggle for peace," but that they will "surely and successfully defend Serb territories and interests until peace is achieved."
