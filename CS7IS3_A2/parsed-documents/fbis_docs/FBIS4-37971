The source said that through their cease-fire violations, those forces are jeopardizing innocent citizens' lives and seeking to destroy vital and strategic institutions and installations throughout the Republic. Referring to the wicked objectives the rebels seek to achieve through continued military operations, despite the state's genuine commitment and practical initiatives in this regard, the source explained that the rebels want to internationalize the issue in the service of treasonous stands. Meanwhile, the responsible source said the Government of the Republic of Yemen is amazed and disturbed by the U.S. State Department's official spokesman's statement, which is not based on what is actually taking place on the ground. The source said the legitimate forces have, in practice, proved their commitment to the UN Security Council resolution and that the rebels are taking advantage of this commitment to attack legitimate forces with all their weapons, something which is testified to by their military statements.
