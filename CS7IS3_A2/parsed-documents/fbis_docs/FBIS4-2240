Qian Qichen said: Disputes among countries can only be resolved through peace negotiations. The signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement on Autonomy shows that the Palestinian issue can finally be resolved through peace negotiations. He said: The Middle East issue is a regional conflict which has continued since World War II, and the road to peace is still long and tortuous. The Hebron massacre in February this year has demonstrated even more the urgency of resolving the Palestinian issue. Qian Qichen said: China resolutely supports the peace process in the Middle East and, as always, supports the just cause of the Palestinian people. Qaddumi thoroughly briefed Qian Qichen on the negotiations between Palestine and Israel and between other Arab countries and Israel and on the situation in the occupied territories. Qaddumi stressed: The safety of Palestinians in the occupied territories should be effectively guaranteed in accordance with the consistent resolution of the United Nations. The PLO will continue to make unremitting efforts for a political solution to the Palestinian issue. He said: Israel should withdraw its troops from the occupied territories as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the early implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement. Qaddumi thanked the Chinese Government and people for their consistent support for the just cause of the Palestinian people. After the talks, Qian Qichen and Qaddumi signed a Sino- Palestinian agreement on economic and technological cooperation. According to this agreement, the Chinese Government will grant the State of Palestine a 75 million yuan interest-free loan. Since the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement was signed in September last year, to support Palestine's reconstruction China has provided Palestine with a 30 million yuan interest-free loan, built a school for the state free of charge, and presented 410 tonnes of rice and 240 tonnes of sugar in gratuitous aid. This morning, the two foreign ministers also signed and exchanged notes on $500,000 in cash given to Palestine by China to support its reconstruction.
