FBIS4-58963 "drnes090_j_94018" FBIS-NES-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Prime Minister's Contacts Declared `Null and Void' Prime Minister's Contacts Declared `Null and Void' JN0905133494 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1200 GMT 9 May 94 JN0905133494 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] The House of Representatives held a session this morning under the speakership of brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar and in the presence of Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah. The foreign minister explained to the House the actions taken by brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, on his medical and tourist trip, as well as his contacts and telephone conversations abroad with Arab and other officials. These contacts included the Arab League secretary general, the UN secretary general, certain Yemeni ambassadors, and our Arab League permanent representative. The foreign minister explained that al-'Attas exploited his position as prime minister by holding these contacts and asking for an Arab League peace-keeping force, thus allowing for the violation of our national sovereignty and national independence, when what is taking place in our country is no more than a war against those who have rebelled against constitutional legitimacy and democracy. The foreign minister added that the advent of foreign troops to our country would undermine the sovereignty and independence of the country. He indicated that brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas is exploiting his position as prime minister in a manner that does not serve the homeland as much as it serves a party faction. Moreover, our Arab League permanent representative has called for peacekeeping forces without obtaining the Council of Ministers' approval, but at the request of brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who has not received the approval of the Council of Ministers or the Foreign Ministry. Had our permanent representative believed in the homeland's interest, he would not have received his instructions from the prime minister, who is on a tourist trip abroad. The brother foreign minister said the Arab League Council -- thanks to our national, candid, clear, and firm stand -- was satisfied with the adoption of a decision, whose most important point was the Arab League Council's reaffirmation of the statement it issued in March supporting Yemeni unity without reservation. The House then discussed in detail the illegitimate foreign moves and activities of the brother prime minister, who is abroad on a medical trip. The House members approved the following House draft resolution: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Resolution by the House of Representatives: During its session today, Monday, 29 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 9 May 1994, the House of Representatives discussed the moves and contacts made by brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, and the political activities accompanying them in his official capacity as prime minister although he traveled for medical purposes and was not assigned with any official mission by the Presidential Council or the Council of Ministers. Since his talks, contacts, and statements deal with domestic Yemeni affairs and violate Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, which states that the role of the chairman of the Council of Ministers is confined to implementing the Council of Ministers' decisions and the state's general policy in a coordinated and unified manner; and in view of what is entailed by these contacts and moves in terms of negative repercussions that are detrimental to the sovereignty, independence, and supreme interests of Yemen, the House has decided the following: 1. His contacts and statements are totally null and void due to their violation of constitutional legitimacy in accordance with Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen. Moreover, any contacts or moves outside the framework of the constitutional institutions by any official or politician in the state are considered null and void and entail no legal commitment whatsoever. 2. The executive authority should implement the House resolution, communicate it to other states and international bodies and organizations, and adopt the necessary measures in accordance with the Constitution. May God grant us success. Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam Khalid Karman, minister of legal and House of Representatives affairs, attended today's session.
