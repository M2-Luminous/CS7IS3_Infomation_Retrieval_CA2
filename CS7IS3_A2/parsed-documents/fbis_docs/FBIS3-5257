Loraine Davies reports: [Begin Davies recording] (Koni Santana) says that if, as Jakarta asserts, the people of East Timor have already freely determined their desire for integration, why is it so afraid of a referendum. He defies Jakarta to hold the referendum under UN supervision to establish the true wish of the East Timorese. He states the resistance undertakes to accept the outcome, whatever it may be, and also to give up their arms and themselves to the Indonesian authorities if the East Timorese vote for integration.
