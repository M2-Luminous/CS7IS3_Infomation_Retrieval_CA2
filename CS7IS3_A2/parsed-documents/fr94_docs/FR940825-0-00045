FR940825-0-00045 FR940825-0-00012 With regard to U.S. Highway 191, the NPS believes that a clear distinction must be made between these two sections, in part because there are non-commercial vehicles, such as those from cooperating highway departments or land management agencies, that at times transport hazardous materials through the park. Since the overwhelming public concern identified in the two environmental assessments is the concern about the potential environmental impacts of a hazardous materials spill along U.S. Highway 191 in the park, the NPS believes it is appropriate to manage all hazardous materials transports, including commercial and non-commercial, under section 7.13(a)(2). The last portion of this section, as worded in the NPRM, received no specific public comments; however, it received considerable discussion within the NPS. As written in the NPRM, it stated as follows: *␣*␣* provided, however, that the Superintendent may issue permits for the transportation of such substance or combination of substances, including hazardous waste, in emergencies, and shall issue permits when such transportation is necessary for access to lands within or adjacent to the park area to which access is otherwise not available. It was noted that the wording was dissimilar to that of section (a)(4) with regard to establishing terms and conditions of a permit. It was also noted that the phrase ``shall issue permits when such transportation is necessary to access to lands within or adjacent to the park area to which access is not otherwise available'' may be subject to differing interpretations by constituencies on opposing sides of the issue. The development of this regulation as it applies to U.S. Highway 191 has been very controversial locally and it has been the NPS's intent to resolve, rather than perpetuate, the ongoing controversy. It has also been and continues to be the intent of the NPS to allow that small proportion of operators who are delivering hazardous materials to the West Yellowstone area to continue to travel on U.S. Highway 191 through the park as they have done in the past, subject to terms and conditions addressing resource protection, safety and other concerns as appropriate. Therefore, it is the NPS's intent that these regulations not specifically prohibit the superintendent from issuing permits to operators of motor vehicles making local deliveries of hazardous materials to that portion of Gallatin County, Montana, that is south or west of the park boundary at Milepost 11 on U.S. Highway 191. Upon further legal review, it was felt that the original language in NPRM would have denied the NPS the discretion to continue this practice. The last portion of this section has been revised in the final rule as follows: *␣*␣* provided however, that the superintendent may issue permits and establish terms and conditions for the transportation of hazardous materials on park roads in emergencies or when such transportation is necessary for access to lands within or adjacent to the park area. These changes in wording from that which was published in the NPRM are meant to clarify, but not alter, the intent and substance of the regulation. Finally, one commenter suggested that NPS clearly set forth the requirements for a permit so that it is not left to the subjective discretion of the superintendent. This concern is discussed below in Summary of Final Regulations and Required Permit Criteria. Section 7.13(a)(3), which was identified as section (a)(4) in the NPRM, states that operators who are permitted to transport hazardous materials through the park are not relieved from complying with applicable state and federal hazardous materials regulations. This section received only one comment suggesting that the reference to 49 CFR Subtitle B was overly broad and that the reference should be to one specific section within the title. NPS disagrees with this commenter and believes that a broad reference is appropriate since it is the intent of this rule that all applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations related to the transport of hazardous materials by motor vehicles on public roadways are applicable in the park. Section 7.13(a)(4), which was identified as section (a)(2) in the NPRM, provides for the superintendent's authority to require permits and to establish terms and conditions for the operation of a commercial vehicle on any park road. This section, in part, replaces deleted Section 7.13(c), which established trucking permit procedures for emergency situations and for trucks traveling between the north and northeast entrances to the Cooke City, Montana, area. In addition, the deleted section also established a fixed permit fee schedule which is out-of-date and does not reflect current administrative costs.
