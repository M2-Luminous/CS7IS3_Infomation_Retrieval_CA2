At the first, Peterle spoke about current Slovene-Italian relations and commented on statements made by certain Italian politicians. At the regular monthly news conference that he held in the afternoon, Minister Peterle spoke about the Foreign Ministry's activities. Here is a report by Igor Juric: [Begin Juric recording] Minister Peterle first said that our state does not take the statements made so far as official stands as they were not made at an official level. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how interstate relations will further develop. He assessed the cooperation with Italy thus far as positive on the whole; our cooperation within nine state commissions as well as on the economy had been good. Soon after Italy's recognition of Slovenia, the issue of the succession of agreements with the former Yugoslavia had been settled. Within this framework, the question of the property of Italian refugees that some people are bringing up anew was settled. In this respect, Minister Peterle said that within the process of joining Europe, it is no problem for us to take on the obligation that foreign citizens should also have the right to purchase real estate, as we have never differentiated among people. Therefore, Peterle sees no reason for Italy to be placing further obstacles in the way of us joining European integration, as has happened. It is true that Italy always withdraws its statements in the end. Minister Peterle does not think that the new politicians might aggravate relations with us, as the European Union does not want to deal with any more problems. He sees Italy in the future as a strategic partner, with whom we will enjoy good neighborly relations that would set an example to others. As regards the initiative for Istria as a European region, Peterle said that Slovenia supports ideas on close border cooperation, but by no means supports an establishment of some kind of supra-state region. However, his opinion is that it is not right for the Italians to speak about the position of their minority in Slovenia and Croatia, as if there were no differences between the states. Namely, the position of minorities in Slovenia is established according to the highest European standards. At the afternoon news conference, Minister Peterle expressed pleasure that the Economic-Social Council of the European Union adopted a statement today saying that our state will be ready for full membership of the Union by the end of the century. As regards the talks in Pineta [about the Slovene demand for Bosnian refugees to be evacuated from Slovene holiday resorts to the Croatian Adriatic coast], Peterle said that his ministry does not have any instruments to help it transfer the refugees. The only thing that we possess is the Croatian Government's assurance. There has been a standstill in relations with Croatia regarding the border issue, as the other side is showing no real will to do anything. [end recording]
