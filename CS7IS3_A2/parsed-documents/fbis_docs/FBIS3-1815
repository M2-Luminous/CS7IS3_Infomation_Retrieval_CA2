FBIS3-1815 "drchi041_v_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-041 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Mar 1994 TAIWAN GATT Membership Impacts Negatively on Agriculture OW0103135894 Taipei China Broadcasting Corporation News Network in Mandarin 2300 GMT 26 Feb 94 OW0103135894 Taipei China Broadcasting Corporation News Network Language: Mandarin Article Type:BFN [From the "Hookup" program] [Text] The Executive Yuan has completed an assessment report about the impact which the nation's agricultural sector will have when the Republic of China [ROC] seeks to join the GATT. It was disclosed, however, that the results of the assessment are so negative that the government so far is afraid to publicize it. The assessment report was immediately recalled even after it was read by ministers and council heads attending a ministerial meeting called by the Executive Yuan not long ago. A scholar participating in the assessment pointed out that, in accordance with the assessment report, after the ROC joins the GATT, it will not be able to attain its zero-growth target in its agricultural development, and the nation may have negative agricultural growth -- and even a substantial decline -- for a long time to come. The scholar indicated that, since the bottom line set in the assessment report for opening up ROC's agricultural sector is one based on a relatively optimistic assumption, and yet the assessment results are still negative, he thought the set bottom line is merely a wishful thinking, considering the nation's eagerness to join the GATT by the end of the year, the U.S. side's unyielding attitude, and the lack of bargaining chips on the part of the ROC during the negotiations. Moreover, in view of the prospects that agricultural associations have planned to organize farmers to demonstrate in streets next month to demand the government to come up with measures to deal with agricultural problems arising after the ROC becomes a GATT member, (Sun Ming-hsien), chairman of the Executive Yuan Agricultural Council, indicated that ROC's countermoves will be adjusted periodically, based on the results of the negotiations, as well as the terms set for ROC's GATT membership. He indicated that he has begun dialogues with farmers for this reason.
