The two leaders pledged to exert joint efforts to promote bilateral relations to a new level. Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden have been in contact for several hundred years. Under extreme difficult conditions, our forefathers overcame obstacles and dangers in opening up trade routes between our two countries. After the founding of New China, Sweden was the first Western nation to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC. In the past several decades, the relations between the two countries have been generally good. Through common efforts, the two countries have continually expanded exchanges and cooperation in the political, economic and trade, science and technology, and cultural fields. With a profound sense of responsibility toward history, the leaders of the two countries shall cherish still more our hard-earned friendship and continue to expand the bilateral relations based on the efforts of our forefathers and leaders of the older generation. Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden are far away from each other, and have no conflict of basic interests. On the contrary, there are broad prospects for economic cooperation because the economies of the two countries are mutually complementary. China is carrying out large scale economic development and there is much in Sweden's advanced technology and management experience that we can make use of. During my visit to your country, I have personally witnessed Swedish entrepreneurs' strong desire to strengthen cooperation with China. There is great potential for bilateral cooperation. Our two countries should exert joint efforts to push bilateral cooperation to a new stage, which corresponds with the common interests and aspirations of the two peoples. Li Ruihuan said: Differences of views between countries are natural. Many problems can be resolved properly with the passage of time, and in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit; of seeking common grounds while reserving differences; and of common development. He added: We should work together to push bilateral relations to a new level bearing in mind the fundamental interests of the two peoples and long-range interests of the two countries. Bildt spoke highly of China's great economic achievements since the implementation of the reform and open policy, saying that it is important not only for China but also for Eastern Asia and the world economy. The Swedish prime minister said that bilateral relations between China and Sweden have developed rapidly in recent years. He hoped that bilateral relations will further develop. He also expressed Swedish support for China's reentry into the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade.
