Those figures represent the total of imports and exports combined. Putting it another way, Brazil exported goods and services worth a total of $5.4 billion to Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay and imported the equivalent of $3.3 billion from those countries. This means that Mercosur accounted for 14 percent of Brazil's total exports and 13 percent of its total imports last year. Brazil's trade surplus with Mercosur also rose: to $2.062 billion, or 11.64 percent more than the $1.85 billion recorded in 1992. The increase was due mainly to the flow of trade with Paraguay and Uruguay, since Brazil's surplus with Argentina was down by nearly $300 million to $1.02 billion in 1993. But Brazil's trade surpluses with Paraguay and Uruguay practically doubled from one year to the next, as is shown in the statistics from the Foreign Trade Secretariat (Secex).

Total exports to Argentina were $3.5 billion. Mechanical and electrical machinery and equipment--so-called capital goods--were in second place among Brazilian sales to Argentina at $738 million, an increase of 41 percent over the year before. According to the experts, that result shows how competitive Brazilian industry is in that it increased market shares despite Argentina's elimination of its import duty on capital goods for third countries [sentence as published]. The main item exported to Brazil by Argentina in 1993 was products of plant origin at $828 million. Half of that value represented products of the milling industry, including wheat. The second item on the list of Brazilian imports from Argentina was mineral fuels (petroleum and petroleum products) at a value of $520 million--a fantastic increase of 374 percent over the $110 million worth imported in 1992. The same statistics also reveal that Brazilian sales to Paraguay rose 76.8 percent in 1993 to a total of $960.6 million. At the same time, Brazilian imports of Paraguayan products increased 45.5 percent to $273 million, the biggest item being textile products (up 41 percent to a total of $161 million). Brazil's biggest exports to Paraguay are electromechanical machinery and equipment at $174 million and food, beverage, and tobacco products at $172.5 million. Brazilian sales to the Uruguayan market totaled $775 million (an increase of 50.7 percent), the main item being transportation equipment ($198 million). Brazil purchased $428.6 million worth of Uruguayan products in 1993 (up 26 percent), mainly products of plant origin at $152 million.
