The MOF [Ministry of Finance] permitted 250 blue chip companies out of 699 listed on the Korea Stock Exchange to issue to Americans the dollar-denominated DRs, taking the already -- circulating issues as security. With the U.S. trading of the Korean DRs, American investors will not need to bother to register with Korean regulators, get an identification card (ID) here and directly invest in Korean stocks on the Korea Stock Exchange even at the risk of currency fluctuation, the MOF said. The DRs traded in the United States are the same as their underlying stocks traded in Korea, except for the fact that DRs are certificates of home-country stocks. Thus dual prices for the single company issue may exist following the government permission of DRs in the United States. One major difference is that DRs are denominated in dollars and traded outside Korea but their underlying stocks are traded in Korean won on the Korea Stock Exchange. Holders of DRs can not exercise voting rights. Thus, Korean blue chip issues can be traded both in Korea and the United States, which will help local companies enhance their image and understanding of their products and services overseas. The DR issuance does not involve capital inflow into Korea. It helps foreigners holding Korean stocks liquidate their holding by issuing DRs to American investors in the United States. The MOF said local companies will be able to issue DRs within 10 percent of their outstanding issues, in keeping with the nation's 10 percent foreign ownership ceiling of individual issues. It said in line with the expansion of the foreign stock ownership ceiling, the government will raise the DR issuance quota, the MOF said. To bypass cumbersome disclosure and registration requirements in the United States, Korean firms will initially issue DRs outside the U.S. stock exchanges, meaning the trading of Korean DRs in the Over- the-Counter (OTC) market. But if DR issuers meet the U.S. disclosure and accounting rules, these Korean companies can list their DRs on the U.S. stock exchanges. The MOF said three major U.S. banks -- Bank of New York, Citibank and Morgan Guaranty Bank -- monopolize the DR issuance processing. Since the middle of the 1980s, a selected number of Korean companies have issued DRs in major foreign capital markets when they "newly" issued equities. When DRs are issued at the time of new share offering, the issuers can raise fresh capital from foreigners. But Korean companies have been prohibited from issuing DRs on the back of "old" issues now circulating in the domestic stock market. DRs are created when U.S. brokers buy the Korean company's shares in Seoul and deliver those shares to the Korea Securities Settlement Corp. (KSSC), the custodian bank, which then instructs the depositary bank (Bank of New York or Citibank) in Seoul to issue DRs to the U.S. investors. These DRs are freely traded just as any other U.S. stock. They are priced and quoted in U.S. dollars, are traded on either an exchange or the Over-the-Counter (OTC) market and settled according to U.S. standards, a Bank of New York official in Seoul said. MOF's Securities Policy Division Director Sin Tong-kyu said the government restricted the number of DR issuers to one-third of all listed companies in Korea because it does not want to spoil Korea's image when unknown small companies go bankrupt. Eligible DR issuers are those with net worth of more than 20 billion won or paid-in capital of 10 billion won, the MOF said.
