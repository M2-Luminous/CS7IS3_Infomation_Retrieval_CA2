The negotiations were expected to start this morning but, as is known, they were postponed because the Croatian side demanded that the number of attending reporters be higher than the number admitted in Zagreb. The Croatian side is demanding that five Croatian reporters and all Zagreb-based U.S. reporters come. Moreover, the reporters should be enabled to travel by car via the border crossing of Turanj near Karlovac. Letters were exchanged this morning, via the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], between the governments of the republic of Serb Krajina and the Republic of Croatia, thus bringing about a possibility of the negotiations taking place at 1600. As is known, the negotiations are expected to focus on economic issues. One of the contested issues, as demanded by the government of the republic of Serb Krajina, is the withdrawal of Croatian forces from western Slavonia, Mt. Velebit, and some other areas in keeping with an agreement signed on 29 March this year in Zagreb.
