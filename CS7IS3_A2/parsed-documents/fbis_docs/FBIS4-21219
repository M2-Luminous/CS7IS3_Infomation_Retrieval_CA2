April, 14, IRNA -- The law enforcement personnel have seized nearly five tons of narcotic drugs after armed clashes with drug traffickers and bandits in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan over the past two days, it was announced here Thursday. Commander of the law enforcement personnel, Brigadier General Reza Seyfollahi, said his forces also seized several firearms from the drug traffickers. He added that the haul included 4,700 kgs of opium and some 20 kgs of morphine. According to him, the amount of drugs seized from traffickers in 1992 and 1993 stood at 65 tons and 95 tons respectively. Referring to the admission of the U.S. Administration to its inability to fight drug trafficking at home, Seyfollahi said the campaign against narcotics in Iran is so tough and so serious that even the UN, which is under Washington's influence, has had to admit that Iran's campaign against narcotics must be a model for other countries to follow.
