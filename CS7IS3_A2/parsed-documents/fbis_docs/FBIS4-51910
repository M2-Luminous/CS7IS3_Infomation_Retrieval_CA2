Co. A civil panel of the Seoul High Court ruled Wednesday that Yang was not totally deprived of the right to express his will when he contracted to sell the stocks to Hanil, meaning the contract is valid. The face value of the 1.19 million Kukje Corp. stocks is 5.99 billion won (about 7.42 million U.S. dollars). The court decided that if a certain legal action is to be canceled or rendered invalid because it was committed under duress, such duress should be so strong that, as in Yang's case, the right to express one's free will should have been deprived totally. "But after examining the detailed process of handing the stocks over to Hanil, the court cannot judge that Yang's freedom to express his will was deprived perfectly. The contract is therefore valid," the decision read. Although the Constitutional Court ruled last July that the dismantling of the Kukje Group was unconstitutional because it came about due to unjust exercise of government power, the contract cannot be considered as being necessarily related to any abuse of government authority, the court said. "So the contract itself is not a legal action of an anti-social nature." Yang brought the lawsuit in April 1988, accusing senior government officials including then-Finance Minister Kim Man-chae of coercing him to sell all stocks in the Kukje Group's trade and footwear areas. Yang said the officials told him this was the wish of a high-ranking official in the Chon Tu-hwan government. Yang lost the first trial as the court ruled that he had not been under such duress as to be perfectly deprived of the freedom to express his will, prompting him to appeal to the high court.
