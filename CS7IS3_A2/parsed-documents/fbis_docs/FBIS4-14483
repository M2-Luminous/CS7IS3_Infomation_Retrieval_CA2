It had committed a string of serious crimes, including a murder on Finnish territory. In the last year or two reports of this kind have been filling the pages of criminal summaries more and more often. The criminal world is closely monitoring foreign capital's penetration of Russia's northwest border region. There are currently 7,285 joint enterprises registered in St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast. Foreign investment totals 7.5 billion rubles. According to information from Sergey Sidorenko, chief of the Regional Organized Crime Administration, around 20 percent of foreign business on St. Petersburg's territory is controlled by local criminal structures. Last year 1,576 foreign citizens -- tourists, businessmen from joint enterprises, diplomatic mission staffers, and students -- fell victim to criminal transgressions. A special militia service has been formed in the St. Petersburg and Oblast Internal Affairs Main Administration in order to ensure foreign subjects' personal security and the security of their property. Vladimir Karpankov, this subunit's chief, reported that it is responsible for protecting 494 facilities at which foreign citizens work. Five protection enterprises and four security services have been set up jointly with German, British, U.S., Belgian, Finnish, and Swedish criminal experts. The special service staffers admit themselves that foreign businessmen are reluctant to cooperate with local law-enforcement organs, preferring to come to an agreement with criminal groupings. There is information that some Finnish firms, for example, are paying racketeers up to 100,000 markkas per month. An increasing number of cases is coming to light where foreign businessmen, on coming into contact with the criminal world, are being actively involved in breaking Russian law. Thus, St. Petersburg criminal experts have halted the activity of the "LST-Metall" Russian-Finnish joint enterprise, which specialized in the duty-free export of aluminum abroad. Incidentally, the special services note that it is the foreign party which most often suffers when Russian laws are broken. The St. Petersburg Administration for Combating Organized Crime has detected the theft of 2.6 million bottles of liquor belonging to the Spanish firm "Codimport International." During the investigation it was ascertained that, in order to avoid paying taxes and to obtain maximum profit, an entire consignment of liquor was not registered at the firm's Moscow branch but handed over for resale to Russian "businessmen," who swindled their Spanish partners.
