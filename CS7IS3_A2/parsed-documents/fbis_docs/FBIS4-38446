The delegation was led by the Deputy Commander of Russia's ground troops, Aleksey Sokolov. As Interfax learned from the press service of the Georgian leader, the peace-keepers are to be stationed in the safety areas set up in Zugdidi and Gali Regions. As Interfax learned from a well-informed source in Georgia's Defence Ministry, the operation will involve about 3000 servicemen and begin in early June. The return of Georgian refugees to Gali Region is to begin about June 10, he said. No official source in Tbilisi agreed to comment on the course of the talks. In the meantime the Deputy Commander of the group of Russian troops stationed in Trans-Caucasus, Major-General Vasiliy Belchenko, told Interfax that the consultations on the deployment of Russian peace-keepers in Georgia "are proceeding with difficulty." "Even though an agreement on the deployment of troops has been reached in principle, there are some differences between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides," he said. "Evidently the events should not be anticipated," Belchenko said. "The results of talks must be divulged by the heads of state." As for the participation of Russian troops stationed in Trans-Caucasus in the upcoming operation, he said that "this question has not been settled yet. The present plans provide for moving troops from Russia." "If they prove to be insufficient, units from the group of Russian troops stationed in Trans-Caucasus will join in," the general said.
