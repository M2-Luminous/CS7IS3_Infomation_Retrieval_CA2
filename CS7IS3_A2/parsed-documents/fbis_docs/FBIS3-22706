After comparing these sequences with the Sabin 1 reference strain and with 15 strains from province Taiwan and other neighboring countries using the gene alignment program from the PCGene, two dendrograms were constructed. We found six independent genotypes among the Chinese viruses and 14 genotypes among the world viruses. This interesting finding strongly suggested that there were molecular epidemiological relationships among viruses from China and other countries.
