It has also been learned that Jordan is holding intensive contacts through other parties to release the Jordanian nationals held as hostages. Legal Jordanian sources said: What Aden has done is strange and a violation of international law. The sources added that the Jordanians are defenseless and have not participated in the war. Consequently, the sources said, the safety of the Jordanian nationals is the responsibility of the authorities in the south who should not restrict the movement of or arrest those Jordanians.
