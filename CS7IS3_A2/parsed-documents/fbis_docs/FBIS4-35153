The Brazilian Government is also requesting that Vietnam agree to the appointment of Italo Zappa as the Brazilian ambassador to Hanoi. President Franco has already authorized the opening of an embassy in Vietnam. Since late last year, Vietnam has expressed interest in expanding its relations with Brazil. Vietnam sent Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai first, and then Van Khai. In return, Itamaraty sent a trade delegation to Hanoi in April. On 23 June, Khai visited Sao Paulo to hold talks with representatives of Maxion [agricultural machinery manufacturer], the CBPO [Companhia Brasileira de Projetos Obras] construction firm, the Odebrecht construction group, the Brazilian Agribusiness Association (ABAG), Ericsson [manufacturer of telecommunications and lighting equipment], Braspetro [Petrobras International Inc.], Baldan, and Marchezan [manufacturers of agricultural equipment]. Vietnam is interested in purchasing agricultural machinery, including harvesters. Representatives of leading Brazilian construction companies attended a luncheon hosted at Itamaraty for Phan Van Khai. The Vietnamese market is potentially significant for Brazilian firms that are already established in Southeast Asia. The "chairman" of the Chinese company that is building the Three Gorges hydroelectric plant, the largest in the world, will arrive in Brazil on 4 July. Brazilian construction firms could form a consortium to participate in the Chinese project.
