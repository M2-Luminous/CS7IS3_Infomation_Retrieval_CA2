At a news conference in Kiev Monday, he pointed out that candidates of Rukh and the democratic bloc had been either elected or passed on to the second round of the elections in most constituencies of the Republic. "There is hope that the new Supreme Soviet will be better and it will be possible to structure it by creating factions and blocs," Chernovil said. He pointed out that these elections were more free and democratic than before. However, numerous violations which influenced the electors' choice in favor of the ruling party had been revealed, according to Chernovil. "Rukh will react calmly to any change in the timing of Ukrainian presidential elections," Chernovil was quoted as saying. He added that it was ridiculous to elect the head of the state without defining his legislative powers beforehand. However, Rukh insists that the election day must be set exactly so that either the old, or the new parliament could pass the necessary laws. At the same time, Chernovil spoke against granting the Ukrainian president extra powers. The Rukh leader believes that the results of the opinion polls in the Donets Basin and the Crimea will have no legal force. "If the leaders of the state hold firm and stick to the law, everything will take its course as it should in a democratic country," he said.
