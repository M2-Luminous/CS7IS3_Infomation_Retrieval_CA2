Why do you talk so little about it? [Occhetto] This is not true; we do talk about it. Italy's commitment was a fervid one and this is demonstrated by the victims of our information industry, to whom my thoughts go out. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] also declared itself in favor of the participation of the Italian blue berets in an international operation, precisely because of the exceptional nature of the situation and because of the need to strengthen and stabilize the truce. The condition being the request of the UN secretary general and the consensus of all the sides involved. I also recall that since we were at NATO precisely when the first air attack was launched, I stated that I agreed with the action. I only manifested concern over a possible counterstroke by the Russians. We continue to consider the mediation initiated by Moscow as being decisive in order to go ahead. [Correspondent] The Right still accuses you of being Bolsheviks, responsible for revolutionary crimes, and at the same time of not having offered any clear opposition to the kickback scandal... [Occhetto] There is in effect a contradiction here. I will let the historians judge our "Bolshevism." [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is the only one in Europe to talk of a "communist danger" in Italy... There could be some truth in the second accusation. During the laborious construction of Italian democracy there were cases of associationism, some were virtuous, others were not. The latter wet the wings of our capacity to act as an opposition, also because our political system was blocked. The PDS was born precisely in order to overcome the heart of this situation, by criticizing the system of straight proportional representation and fighting for a system of alternatives in which all the citizens can make a decision on the government and the prime minister. [Correspondent] What will happen in Italy if the Right wins? Or if nobody wins: How can a government be guaranteed? [Occhetto] I see a straight-out victory of Berlusconi leading him to the seat of prime minister as being difficult. Berlusconi himself knows, as I know, that the electoral tests are not positive for Forza Italia, so much so that he has started to talk of an institutional or constituent government. In any case, I hope that the progressives will be the central force, around which a solution can be built. Every day brings a new problem though and we will think about this after the elections. [Correspondent] Is there really a "diversity" between the PDS and the progressives on the moral issue? [Occhetto] We have never spoken of an "anthropological" diversity. But our reaction was different. With great frankness and honesty we apologized to the Italians and for a lot less than what the others did. And the trials will end up showing that we had no connection with the kickback scandal, a system that involved not only the politicians but also corrupt businessmen who distorted the market. We then supported the meritorious work of justice, even though there may have been excesses or errors. For 11 months we were nailed down by the episode of a single Swiss bank account that was not ours. One of our members was arrested and then freed by the court. We bore the series of difficulties in a Christian spirit. The most important task is really to clean things up. [Correspondent] If the progressive pole wins, will you be the future prime minister? [Occhetto] The victory of the progressives will bring with it the problem of presenting a prime minister and a team. It will have to be resolved with great wisdom, and with the attention focused on creating a climate of security, certainty, and tranquillity. There is no need to propose candidates now. Laws that do not exist should not be mimicked, like the election of the prime minister. I will not be involved in drawing-room games with people throwing themselves off the tower. What sense is there in saying "I will candidate myself"? Or to candidate [Prime Minister] Ciampi who said -- and did well to say so -- that he wants to remain above the fray? I have affirmed from the beginning that Ciampi remains a resource for our democracy. Proposing him now could mean damaging him. And I do not want to burn either Occhetto's or Ciampi's wings... [Correspondent] Do you consider yourself to be a better social democrat than your adversaries? [Occhetto] It does not take much to be more of a liberal democrat than Berlusconi. And I come from Turin, the city of Gramsci and Gobetti. Stalin is not part of my training. When I came up against him, of course not personally, I fought him, asking for the reinstatement of Luxemburg and Trotsky in "Nuova Generazione." I must say that Togliatti let me do as I pleased, he was fundamentally more "liberal" than people thought. Berlusconi is a liberal democrat who seems to have problems with the United Kingdom. It was in this very room that he got upset with a British journalist who reminded him of his television monopoly. He was to have appeared on "Milano Italia" [third channel TV program], but then said no when he heard that another British journalist was going to be there. The terror of the "perfidious Albion" was nourished by only one other person in Italy... [Correspondent] Rete and Communist Renewal have different positions on Ciampi, treasury bills, and NATO. How will the progressives explain this overseas? [Occhetto] I think that propaganda is of little interest overseas. The treasury bills issue has been built up. Even economists like Monti and Martino agree with [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti's thesis, which is not like speaking badly of the Madonna. We consider it wrong not as a matter of principle, but because realism tells us that this is not the path to take in order to fight the government deficit. I have reason to believe that, if we get elected, Communist Renewal would accept what was agreed upon at the progressive table. At NATO I had the feeling that no general considered Bertinotti's hypothesis of having Italy withdraw from the alliance as being realistic. [Correspondent] Would the Left be responsible for a possible advancement of the Right in Italy? And would you govern with Berlusconi? [Occhetto] The League has advanced in the north because we did not always do our duty. We should have broken up the town council alliances with [former Socialist leader] Craxi before. However, the real cause behind the growth toward the Right is the disintegration of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and its old system of power. After the victory of the progressive mayors it was natural for the Right to reorganize itself. But instead of a modern and civil Right, a worrying, ideological force has entered into the field. Even for this reason I rule out any government with Berlusconi. I think that the progressives will get the majority, and will present their government proposal to the president of the republic.
