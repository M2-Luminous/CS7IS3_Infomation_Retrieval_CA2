On the one hand, a large part of the media is defending a man like Herbert Wehner, who -- to be quite frank -- was a communist henchman. Because of his denunciations, he bears part of the blame for the killing of some of his former friends in Moscow by a shot in the neck. On the other hand, the same media absolutely condemn a man such as Hans Filbinger, who was quite certainly not a very agreeable fellow, either, because he signed death sentences in his capacity as a judge. One can surmise that he thought he had the law on his side. As a man who consciously experienced dictatorship as a young person, I can fully understand that the fear for their own lives goaded some people to regard their own salvation as more important than that of their friends. Very few are suited to become heroes in the shadow of the gallows. Still, those who failed the test should no longer be permitted to play a role on the political stage. If You Beat My Wehner, I'll Beat Your Strauss Had Wehner been a conservative, he would have been immediately dropped by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] as soon as the file on him became public. Yet, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] remains faithful to this denouncer, even after his death. And the CDU/CSU is acting remarkably moderately -- why? Is it afraid of a possible tit-for-tat? If you beat my Wehner, I'll beat your Strauss. Even though one cannot compare the behavior of the two late leading politicians, one is more and more tempted to suspect that Strauss was involved in treacherous activities. If somebody allowed a Stasi officer and arms dealer such as Schalck-Golodkowski access to ones Federal Intelligence Service [BND] files, he, at least, indirectly, favored the enemies of the FRG. After all these revelations, ill-feeling among the sinners of this country is rising. Are living leading German politicians bribable, some from Washington, others from Moscow? Rumors are sprouting. Is maybe even Genscher the man behind IM-Tulpe [informal agent Tulpe]? I refuse to believe it. Stasi agents may still even be sitting in the BND itself. We have long had Italian-like conditions. The Italian politicians have the Mafia on their neck, while in the case of ours, it is the Stasi and also the Mafia, that is extending its network across Europe. One gets ahead quite nicely again in this country wearing "red socks." The perpetrators triumph, the victims despair. The reasons for this nightmare are deeply rooted. They reach far into the past. Walk Upright! In the FRG there has not been any honest discussion of Nazism, in the new laender none of communism. Facts were dismissed in western Germany, facts are being dismissed in eastern Germany. The young people watch it and are ashamed of their fathers. Initially, the daughters and sons of Stasi -- and other communist -- officials saw their upright fathers only in long underpants, while now they see them stark naked in their moral shabbiness and whininess. After 1945, quite a few daughters and sons of high-ranking Nazi officials turned to the left in disgust -- one only has to look at the family backgrounds of the generation of 1968 -- while in the former GDR [German Democratic Republic], young people are now falling from one extreme into the other following ultras wrongly being described as right-wing. It is the task of our party to offer these young people -- particularly in the new laender -- a political home in a democratic constitutional party such as ours. Let us sum up: Large parts of the Nazi and Communist generation of fathers has failed in the face of history. They shunned discussion with their children. They were hiding behind the argument of having had to protect their existence. We are facing up to the necessary debate -- but not cap-in-hand. The exodus from Babylonian Captivity begins. We Republikaner are marching at the forefront and are setting the trend. And no Schnoor, no Birzele, no Uhrlau, including their auxiliary forces in the media, can stop us!
