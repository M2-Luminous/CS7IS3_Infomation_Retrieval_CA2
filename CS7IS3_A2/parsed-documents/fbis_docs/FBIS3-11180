To the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC), the Mexican people, the people and governments of the world, the national and international press, and brothers: The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG] of the Zapatist Army of National Liberation [EZLN] respectfully and honorably addresses all of you in order to state the following: The Federal Government, yesterday's usurper of the people's power, once again is lying about the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. The government says there are "agreements," when there was nothing more than a dialogue. Brothers, do not be deceived by their lies; the powerful now seek to usurp the truth, and they are trying to mislead you by saying that peace is only a signature away. How can there be peace if the ones who caused the war are still calling for the continuation of our poverty? The arrogance that dwells within the government palaces and the houses of the monarchs of commerce and property continues to call for war and for our genocide. They cannot accept that Indian blood might be equal to that of the white man. We seek to become part of the country, yet they continue to block our efforts, and now they repay the sacrifice of our dead with contempt and ridicule. If they speak with contempt, how can there be peace in these lands, or if they remain silent and murder our brothers? How can we ask our collective heart whether the time has come for peace to enter with dignity through the doors of our impoverished lands? They seek to corner us once again and force us to surrender. Through the destruction of our dignity they seek to force us to accept a peace that represents war to our people. We will not do it. We will not surrender. If they refuse a fair and honorable peace, then we -- the men and women of the shadows -- will once again dress for war. Our rage will now rise up from having been deceived. The machetes are once again being sharpened, and our lands will once again wreak of gunpowder. We are shadows of a tender rage. Our strategy will once again reverberate in the heavens and give shelter to the have-nots and the good men and women who understand that justice and peace go hand in hand. If they deny our rights, then our tender rage will enter their haughty mansions. We will overrun every wall. No door will remain intact, and no window will remain unbroken. No wall will be left standing. Our shadow will carry sorrow to those who call for war and the genocide of our race. More tears will be spent and more deaths will take place so that peace can sit at humanity's table. We, the shadows of tender rage, will once again raise our voice to drown out the lies. Our first "enough" was insufficient. The land will not blossom with the blood of our dead. The men and women of tender rage will have to march once again, our dead will have to rise once again, and the history of our broken hearts will speak once again. Let the deceit and lies cease. Let arrogance in the lands of Mexico perish once and for all. Let the men of women of the shadows, adorned in the dark clothes of tender rage, gather in order that we may silence so many lies. The powerful should no longer speak. From their lips come poison and decay. They must stop the lies and duplicity. It is time for our brothers who are following other paths to speak out and carry our grief to new horizons. We want to hear the voices of our brothers from the CEOIC. All of the Indians of this land must speak their minds. The impoverished peasants must not remain silent. The workers in the cities must shout. This warriors' song must be sung by teachers, students, workers, and all of those people who are diminutive in every sense of the word. Do not leave this heavy banner in our hands alone. Everyone must help carry it. Let us all change the land on which its shadow falls. Mexican brothers, do not forget this voice in the wilderness. The light shed by our dead is very remote. Let us add other lights. Let us end this shameful night once and for all. The time has come for a new dawn. Let the truth speak. Let its voice be heard now. Let it walk with brave footfalls. We, who have no face or past listen with open hearts and ears. Let the voice of everyone be heard. Let our men and women remain silent, and let this silence continue in the shadows of tender rage. [sentence as published] All of you must watch over our dreams so that nothing bad will happen to them -- so that black shadows will not threaten them. For you, brothers, our hearts continue to beat and our fire continues to burn, and we hope that everything will be well with you so that, in the end, this tender rage will prevail in these lands. Peace is not possible with deceit. Peace is born of freedom and is nurtured by justice. We are all worthy of democracy. Cheers, brothers of the CEOIC! Cheers, Indian brothers! Cheers, Mexican brothers! Walk without fear, lift your heads, and pick up your feet. Our weapons are already guarding your path... Freedom! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully yours from the Mexican southeast, [Signed] CCRI-CG of the EZLN [Dated] Mexico, March 1994
