He said there are no obstacles on Iran's membership in GATT. The secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce commented that voluntary exclusion from GATT does not imply any weakness on the part of any country. Rouher said in his talks with the Iranian officials in Tehran he had been assured that the Islamic Republic is committed to continuing its national development projects that it started four years ago, as well as play a more active role in international circles. In the same interview the Iranian secretary general of the (Iranian) committee of the International Chamber of Commerce Mohammad Mahdi Behkish said the Islamic Republic cannot do better than join GATT. He added that membership in GATT would benefit Iran and, among others, promote Iran's agricultural exports. The International Chamber of Commerce has 117 member states and is active in 132 countries. It has 16 committees in various areas including tariffs, banking, insurance, tourism, and transportation. Rouher is to leave Tehran later Wednesday.
