We are publishing the following interview without any editorial intervention. [Veleva] Mr. Stoilov, while vacationing at the "Sandanski" Hotel, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy managed to pay a brief visit to Salonika. What kind of business took you to the shores of the Aegean Sea? [Stoilov] We visited Salonika without a visa and without passports. There were approximately 10 of us, including the bodyguards, and they let us cross the border. We went there for negotiations with the government of certain people with whom we had arranged meetings in advance. [sentence as published] The Salonika police accompanied us at all times with their lights on, while, here in this country, we were met by Turkish bandits who were demonstrating against us. [Veleva] Do you really intend to become Bulgarian president, as Mr. Zhirinovskiy designated you? [Stoilov] Me, Bulgarian president?! This would be an insult for me. I shall become president of the Balkans (the Balkan peninsula -- TRUD editorial note). This will be followed by a great upheaval in Bulgaria. We shall throw all the parties that exist in the country today into the Black Sea. The plan is ready. There will be an upheaval of all parties that were guilty for Bulgaria's disintegration from 1944 until their capitulation. All those who have committed murders, who have sent people to concentration camps, who have interned them (mispronounces the word -- TRUD editorial note), who have altered streets and cities, who are guilty of laundering [waschen -- in German] -- all those people should be put on trial! All of them! [Veleva] How do you plan to become president of all the Balkan states? [Stoilov] Yes, I shall become president of all Balkans! You will hear about it. The plan is ready. [Veleva] Who is going to help you? [Stoilov] I shall do it all by myself! We do not need anyone's assistance. We have the strength. This is our problem. You will see. [Veleva] When is this supposed to happen? [Stoilov] Very soon. Macedonia's liberation, the annexation of Thracia, the seizing of Dobrudzha. All of these will become one state. Tsar Boris II, a Bulgarian who lives...in Madrid, remains the leader of all this. [Veleva] I have never heard of such a king living in Madrid. [Stoilov] There is a king...the son of King Boris. (He totally confuses the names -- TRUD editorial note) Well, it is actually King Simeon II. He shall be the king of Bulgaria as usual. [Veleva] Will he be subordinate to you? [Stoilov] No, he shall rule Bulgaria, while I rule the Balkans. [Veleva] Does it mean that Bulgaria will become a monarchy subject under a large territory ruled by a president? [Stoilov] Yes! Bulgaria was founded 1,300 years ago by kings, and many kings have sacrificed their lives for Bulgaria, and Bulgaria, created by kings, shall be a Bulgarian kingdom. Numerous parties exist in Bulgaria today, but he (the king -- TRUD editorial note) will come. I will take care of Macedonia and other states -- I mean territories that belong to Bulgaria but were taken from us. I will help to annex Dobrudzha and parts of other states that were taken.... Edirne, for example, as long as it has something to do with Yugoslavia and Macedonia. [sentence as published] How exactly the Balkans will be ruled with Bulgaria remains to be clarified in a personal talk with King Simeon II, who lives in Spain. We shall hold a conference with him. I contacted his secretary -- she speaks Bulgarian -- and after the New Year, I mean after the holidays, we shall hold such a meeting. [Veleva] How is the Bulgarian republic expected to turn into a kingdom? [Stoilov] This is.... It is related to a plan that we must await. It is a long-term plan, very long-term, indeed. There are many things we cannot tell you in advance because you are a journalist. If you were a politician, and if we were sitting in a room behind closed doors, and if you belonged to our party, we might reveal the whole plan to you. However, it is our own plan. We shall never leave the Balkans and the Bulgarians under different commands, with territories robbed from all parts. Bulgaria and Macedonia together shall be a great state. [Veleva] Are those plans of yours likely to provoke a military conflict in the Balkans? [Stoilov] We are so strong that no one would dare to do anything. In saying "we," I mean our party -- Mr. Zhirinovskiy's party! [Veleva] How did he react to his expulsion from Bulgaria? [Stoilov] He was not expelled from Bulgaria. They know that he is dangerous, for Bulgaria as well; hence, they have no right to expel him. He is my personal friend. I asked him to stay another five days, but he has his own program. They (the authorities -- TRUD editorial note) could never expel him. I have an Austrian passport and a Bulgarian passport. Me, being a citizen of Bulgaria, he can stay with me for another 100 years. This so-called provision that he must be expelled from Bulgaria is part of the propaganda spread by the other parties. [Veleva] Did you meet Todor Zhivkov? [Stoilov] No, but we would like to meet him. He is nicer than Zhelyu Zhelev. There was discipline under him, and he is not guilty. He was ruled by Moscow. [Veleva] I know that it is not a very decent question, but are you a rich man? [Stoilov] I have worked hard and I am a rich man, as a matter of fact. I have several millions, but I am not a billionaire. However, I do have a lot of money. I have purchased automobiles and apartments for my sisters, as well as my sisters' children. My house in Sveti Vrach, called Sandanski today, which was confiscated in the past, is being totally rebuilt. I am also building a house with four floors in the Pirin mountain, at a height of 1,300 meters. I usually visit Bulgaria once or twice a month, but we are starting on a world tour now. We have very important tasks. [Veleva] Was Mr. Zhirinovskiy very offended when he left Bulgaria? [Stoilov] He was very offended by Mr. Zhelev's policy because they [the Russians] have liberated Bulgaria from the Turkish yoke, which lasted 500 years, and no matter which party he belongs to, he is a Soviet man, after all. (In the meantime, Mr. Venedikov, who is the second man in command of Zhirinovskiy's party and future defense minister-designate, joined the conversation and stated as follows -- TRUD editorial note) [Venedikov] As soon as we take over the power in Russia, the fate of the whole world shall be predetermined. Everything will fall into place, as it is correct and appropriate for the peoples of all countries.
