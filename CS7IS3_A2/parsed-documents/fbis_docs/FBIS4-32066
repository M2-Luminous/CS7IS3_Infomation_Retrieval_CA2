As of last night, chetniks from the so-called Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina have been using howitzers to virtually destroy border areas in the Cazin Commune. Krivaja, Pjanici, Skokovi, Liskovac, Todorovo, and Golubovici are being targeted by the Serbian aggressor, who has, more and more, been substituting Abdic's treacherous paramilitary, which is in disorder. There have been many wounded civilians, some people have been killed, but nobody is assessing material damage any longer. Here is a report by Mirza Sadikovic: [Begin Sadikovic recording] This is why the Command of the 5th Corps made a statement again and the civilian authorities of the Bihac Region presented a new (?protest) about the open chetnik aggression, in fact carried out from another state, which the local UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members have been watching calmly. During the day, members of Abdic's treacherous phalanxes also continued their wild artillery attacks. Due to an energetic response by our fighters, they and their chetnik allies (?began) withdrawing artillery deeply into their territory, leaving a real wasteland in their wake. Following this morning's energetic responses by the 5th Corps units, a large part of territories has been liberated, and one more entire company from the 2d Brigade, the so-called Kladusa National Defense, has been caught and disarmed. Large quantities of ammunition, equipment, and armament that Abdic especially received from chetniks were confiscated on the occasion. [end recording]
