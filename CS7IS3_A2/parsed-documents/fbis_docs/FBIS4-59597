Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, who is currently visiting Syria, said that the message he sent to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih yesterday constitutes an initiative and contains elements that would guarantee an end to the crisis. In a statement to a MENA correspondent in Damascus, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the first thing that must be done is end the fighting between the brothers there, noting that the Arab League is holding intensive consultations and contacts with a number of Yemeni leaders on holding a national dialogue instead of continuing the internecine fighting. He refused to disclose the details of the initiative now, noting that replying to the initiative is now in the hands of the Yemeni leaders themselves. He stressed that the Arab League is eager to see the delegation now in Yemen succeed in its mission. The League, he said, has decided to consider its mission in Yemen to be open-ended. In the meantime, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid today received a lengthy report on the situation and developments in Yemen.
