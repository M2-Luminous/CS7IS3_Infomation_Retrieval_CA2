A malfunctioning occurred during the seventh test launching of the Arrow missile. The project directors believe that the malfunctioning is in the missile's ground control system and has nothing to do with the missile itself. Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David is here with more details: This morning's experiment was supposed to simulate the interception of a surface-to-surface missile with a chemical warhead. An Arrow missile, serving as the target, was launched from a ship far offshore at 1100 [0900 GMT]. During the countdown leading up to the launching of the intercepting missile, a malfunctioning occurred, which prevented it from being fired. A built-in self-destruct system was then used to destroy the target missile. It is believed that the malfunctioning occurred in one of the ground control system's computers and had nothing to do with the missile itself. Amir Oren, a commentator on military affairs, reported that sources at the Defense Ministry and Israel Aircraft Industries claimed that the experiment was unnecessary and was only carried out as a result of pressure from American experts also working on the project. Over the next few days, the project directors will continue to try and locate the problem and repair it. The next test launching is expected to take place in approximately six weeks.
