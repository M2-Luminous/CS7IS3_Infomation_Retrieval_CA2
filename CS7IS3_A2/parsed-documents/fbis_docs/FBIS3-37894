In an interview to ITAR-TASS he said that the discussion of Boris Yeltsin's message is put by deputies of the upper chamber of parliament on the agenda of its third meeting that opened on Thursday. The main directions of the consolidation of the Russian state indicated by the president will undoubtedly have an effect on a plan of legislative work that the chamber will endorse at its current meeting, the speaker believes. In an interview to ITAR-TASS, deputy of the State Duma, Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said that the presidential message should be used as the guide for adjusting normal mechanisms of market relations. Shokhin believes that the state authorities are capable of doing so. The problem of Russians who constitute the absolute majority of the population, 83 per cent, has been raised for the first time in the presidential message. Commenting on this section of the message, Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray told ITAR-TASS that "all politicians should be constantly aware that there is direct relationship between a sense of well-being of the Russian people and that of all other peoples in the federation". Shakhray said that the forming of the Russian nation should not be in the imperial spirit, at the expense of the interests of other peoples. The Russian state is a form of self-determination of all its ethnic groups with guarantees of the development of each of them. Regarding Russians' positions in former union republics, Shakhray said that Russia has juridical obligations to them, also under international law. As the successor of the USSR, Russia must protect citizens under its jurisdiction who live outside Russian boundaries. Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev believes that virtually every deputy went along with the Russian president's message to the Federal Assembly. It is now essential to embark on its implementation and to continue the economic reforms, he told ITAR-TASS on Thursday. Tatarstan's president supported the Russian president's attitude that decentralisation of russian economy is needed. He believes that important economic matters should be tackled locally.
