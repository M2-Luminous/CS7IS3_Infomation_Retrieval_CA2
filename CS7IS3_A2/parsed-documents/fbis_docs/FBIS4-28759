The official said: "The effects of abolishing the semiconductor accord will considered beneficial." Both countries are supposed to decided by the end of July whether or not the accord should be retained. The official added: "The accord sets a bad example, and gives the United States an excuse to impose sanctions against Japan." It seems, though, the Tokyo meeting faces heavy weather because the United States sees the accord as an example of a successful agreement between Japan and the United States. The main purpose of the Tokyo meeting is to see if progress has been made in allowing foreign companies make inroads into Japanese markets. Prior to government-level discussions, a meeting of specialists began on 13 June to calculate the semiconductor market share enjoyed by foreign companies in the February-March period in 1994. Japan has decided to look at the possibility of abolishing the semiconductor accord because it believes the United States should not "threaten us by hinting at the possibility of imposing sanctions on the grounds of market share."
