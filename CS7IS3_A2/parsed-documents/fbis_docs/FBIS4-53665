In recent years alone, more than 400 rural villages of calcium silicate brick houses have made their appearance in some 120 cities, counties and ri. Dwelling houses for more than 35,000 families have been built in these villages. Houses of this type are very convenient for rural life. Each flat has a floor space of 90 to 120 square metres. Cooking and heating are done by methane gas at the dwelling houses in many rural villages including Yongjin-ri, Kaechon City. The construction of calcium silicate brick houses in Korea began at the end of the 1980s. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, always paying deep attention to the betterment of the people's living, saw to it that calcium silicate brick production bases were built in Anju, Pihyon and Hamhung to more satisfactorily meet the increasing needs for dwelling houses, and wisely led their construction. Thus, the construction of calcium silicate brick factories with a total production capacity of 1,000 million bricks was completed successfully in two years. Comrade Kim Chong-il saw designs of calcium silicate brick houses in May, 1986. Saying it was the wish of the great leader President Kim Il-song and his own determination to enable all the people to live in such good houses, he stressed that such houses should be built on an extensive basis in Pyongyang and local cities and rural villages. As a result, peculiar dwelling houses have appeared in Pyongyang and provincial, city and county seats and rural villages.
