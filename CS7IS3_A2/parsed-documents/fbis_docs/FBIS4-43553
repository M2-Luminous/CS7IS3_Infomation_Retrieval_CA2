It was necessary to pass this law to begin construction of the already agreed upon "Transrapid" magnetic levitation vehicle link between Hamburg and Berlin. The opposition and the environmental organizations have criticized this rapid-transit link as superfluous from the point of view of communications and environmentally hostile. Therefore it is doubtful whether the Bundesrat, in which the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has a majority, will vote for the planning law. Transportation Minister Wissmann (Christian-Democratic Union) described the new link as a future-orientated transportation system that is an effective contribution to the problem of solving increasing transportation needs in an environmentally friendly manner. The construction of the first stretch of the magnetic levitation link is essential primarily to secure export chances of the technology involved. On the other hand, the SPD criticized not just the magnetic link itself, but the planning methods used. SPD Bundestag deputy Wetzel said the planning law is full of inconsistencies, and that citizens did not play an adequate part in the planning process. The construction of the magnetic link is to cost 8.9 billion German marks [DM], with the federation contributing DM5.6 billion to the construction of the route. The finished link is to be run on a private basis by the German Federal Railroad and Lufthansa, and is to be completed by 2005.
