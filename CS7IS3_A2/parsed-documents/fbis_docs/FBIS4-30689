Viewing the same province as a model case of developing inland areas, the MITI, together with Chinese Government officials, will study support measures, including reconstruction of old factories and agricultural technological cooperation. The MITI will send 50 officials -- specialists in such areas as trade, electric power, financing, and agricultural technology -- to the seminar. The population of Sichuan is about 120 million. Although it is the largest of all provinces, there is a growing gap in income between Sichuan and coastal provinces due to a delay in the development of basic industries in Sichuan. Public security in Sichuan is also worsening. Therefore the MITI also wants to improve business conditions for Japanese corporations by trying to correct the economic gap by cooperating with China in developing its industries. The MITI is saying that "the seminar will be the first step toward our full-fledged economic cooperation in the inland areas." The seminar will be held jointly by the Association for International Study and Exchanges, which is the MITI's extra-governmental organization, and China's National Economic System Reform Committee. Through panel discussions and subcommittee meetings on such topics as investment and industrial cooperation, and energy and environment, they plan to formulate support measures for the reconstruction of old facilities, including iron mills, and improving the efficiency of agricultural management in China.
