This is the most likely date at present. The alternative would be to wait until March 1995, but this would jeopardize the whole process of accession to the EU. This emerged after Saturday's [5 March] meeting between Prime Minister Bildt and the leaders of the No to the EU campaigns. Boths sides were very satisfied with the atmosphere at the meeting and the exchange of views. No to the EU would prefer a short campaign with a vote in June. "We do not believe that the Swedish people have the same burning interest as we do. It is also an issue of democracy, if people do not have the energy to involve themselves in the debate," Eva-Britt Svensson from No to the EU said, disagreeing with those who want to wait until later. Sten Johansson from Social Democrats against the EU prefers 19 June or March 1995 to the party line of 27 November. A June vote would also halt the planned Social Democratic congress on the EU on 18-19 June that he calls a "propaganda stunt." Up to this time, the Moderate Coalition Party's position has been 18 September -- the same day as the general election -- in order to make the referendum binding after changes to the Constitution. But as long ago as last fall the prime minister's aides were talking about a vote in June, and Carl Bildt is seeking a solution that all the parties and campaign leaderships "can live with." At present most things point to 19 June. The prime minister who met the party leaders last Friday will discuss the matter with them again on Thursday but does not think that it will be possible to reach agreement. He was cautious in his comments on Saturday, but it was clear that he is not happy about Ingvar Carlsson's proposal of 27 November. "You meet very very few people who think that November is a good time. I have really only met one." Carl Bildt and European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel stressed that they have long been the only people who assumed that there would be a full agreement with the EU on 1 March. The Social Democrats did not expect an agreement before this summer at the earliest or until after the election this fall. In the new situation they and the other parties must have time for "dialogue and reflection," at most up to the beginning of April. If it proves impossible to agree on 19 June as the date for a referendum, March 1995 appears to be the main alternative for a number of domestic political reasons -- the election campaign, the formation of a government, and the work on the budget. But this would make the agreed date for EU entry -- 1 January 1995 -- impossible and would therefore require renegotiation with the EU and this could wreck and halt the entry of all four countries. The government and the no side have agreed on two voting slips. "Our demand was that there be a democratic and fair vote involving two lines: yes or no to membership of the EU," said Hans Lindqvist from No to the EU. "The one alternative is yes to membership as it is defined in the agreement, the other is no," Carl Bildt said. If the Swedish people say no he does not think that there will be a new referendum on a new agreement, as in Denmark after Maastricht: "That possibility does not exist; the agreement is between us and 12 other countries. Regardless what sort of somersaults Swedish politicians might be willing to do, 12 other governments would never agree. If there is a no to this agreement, this will mean no to membership for the foreseeable future," Carl Bildt said. The government will make information available to the public and each side could receive around 25 million kronor for its campaign.
