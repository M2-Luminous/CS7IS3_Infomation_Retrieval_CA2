In the subsidy package agreed by the government the subsidy is about 5.5-6 billion Finnish markkas [FM]. According to Haermaelae, the sum is much the same as that proposed by the working group of officials, which the MTK calculated was FM700 too little per hectare. The MTK chairman points out that the subsidy of FM15 billion to be paid out in the first year of membership should not be seen in its entirety as an agricultural subsidy, because other food producers benefit from it too. The government agreed on domestic subsidies for farmers and the foodstuffs industry during negotiations that lasted throughout the night. If Finland becomes a member of the EU, the subsidy to be paid in the first year of membership will total FM15 billion, which is FM4 billion more than now. In five years' time, the domestic subsidy to be paid out would be about FM6 billion a year. The increase in the agricultural subsidy will be compensated to the taxpayers in such a way that a smaller value-added tax on food than planned will be payable; initially 17 percent and in three years' time 12 percent.
