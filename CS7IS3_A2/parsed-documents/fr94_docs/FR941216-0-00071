FR941216-0-00071 FR941216-0-00016 Name Changes EPA is changing the name of the American Shizuki/Ogallala Electronics Co. site in Ogallala, Nebraska, to Ogallala Ground Water Contamination. EPA is also changing the name of Lake Elmo Airport/Ground Water Contamination in Baytown Township, Minnesota, to Baytown Township Ground Water Plume. EPA believes these name changes more accurately reflect the sites. Public Comments EPA reviewed all comments received on sites included in this rule. The formal comment period ended on April 7, 1992 for sites from Proposal # 12; December 14, 1992 for sites from Proposal # 13; July 9, 1993 for sites from Proposal # 14; March 21, 1994 for sites from Proposal # 16; and October 24, 1994 for sites from Proposal # 17 with two exceptions. The comment period for Agriculture Street Landfill ended on November 7, 1994, and the comment period for Escambia Wood_Pensicola ended on November 23, 1994. Based on comments received on the proposed sites, as well as investigation by EPA and the States (generally in response to comment), EPA recalculated the HRS scores for individual sites where appropriate. EPA's response to site-specific public comments and explanations of any score changes made as a result of such comments are addressed in the ``Support Document for the Revised National Priorities List Final Rule_December 1994''. EPA received no comments for a number of the sites included in this rule. Statutory Requirements CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among'' the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain enumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to use CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for possible remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA has chosen not to place certain types of sites on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later determines that sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may place them on the NPL. The listing policies and statutory requirements of relevance to this final rule cover sites subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'') (42 U.S.C. 6901&hyph;6991i) and Federal facility sites. These policies and requirements are explained below and have been explained in greater detail in previous rulemakings (56 FR 5598, February 11, 1991). Releases From Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Sites EPA's policy is that non-Federal sites subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities will not, in general, be placed on the NPL. However, EPA will list certain categories of RCRA sites subject to Subtitle C corrective action authorities, as well as other sites subject to those authorities, if the Agency concludes that doing so best furthers the aims of the NPL/RCRA policy and the CERCLA program. EPA has explained these policies in detail in the past (51 FR 21054, June 10, 1986; 53 FR 23978, June 24, 1988; 55 FR 41000, October 4, 1989; 56 FR 5602, February 11, 1991). Consistent with EPA's NPL/RCRA policy, EPA is adding two sites to the General Superfund Section of the NPL that may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities, the Aqua-Tech Environmental Inc. (Groce Laboratories) site in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, and the Onondaga Lake site in Syracuse, New York. Aqua-Tech operated a RCRA Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF) under interim status until their RCRA Part B Permit application was denied and they were forced to close. The loss of authorization to operate qualifies this site for NPL listing. Onondaga Lake involves a RCRA subtitle C regulated facility which qualifies for NPL listing because of bankruptcy. Releases From Federal Facility Sites On March 13, 1989 (54 FR 10520), the Agency announced a policy for placing Federal Facility sites on the NPL if they meet the eligibility criteria (e.g., an HRS score of 28.50 or greater), even if the Federal Facility also is subject to the corrective action authorities of RCRA Subtitle C. In that way, those sites could be cleaned up under CERCLA, if appropriate. Economic Impacts The costs of cleanup actions that may be taken at any site are not directly attributable to placement on the NPL. EPA has conducted a preliminary analysis of economic implications of today's amendment to the NPL. EPA believes that the kinds of economic effects associated with this revision generally are similar to those effects identified in the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) prepared in 1982 for the revisions to the NCP pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA and the economic analysis prepared when amendments to the NCP were proposed (50 FR 5882, February 12, 1985). The Agency believes the anticipated economic effects related to adding sites to the NPL can be characterized in terms of the conclusions of the earlier RIA and the most recent economic analysis. Inclusion of a site on the NPL does not itself impose any costs. It does not establish that EPA necessarily will undertake remedial action, nor does it require any action by a private party or determine its liability for site response costs. Costs that arise out of site responses result from site-by-site decisions about what actions to take, not directly from the act of listing itself. Nonetheless, it is useful to consider the costs associated with responding to the sites included in this rulemaking. The major events that follow the proposed listing of a site on the NPL are a search for potentially responsible parties and a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine if remedial actions will be undertaken at a site. Design and construction of the selected remedial alternative follow completion of the RI/FS, and operation and maintenance (O&M) activities may continue after construction has been completed. EPA initially bears costs associated with responsible party searches. Responsible parties may bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS, remedial design and construction, and O&M, or EPA and the States may share costs.
