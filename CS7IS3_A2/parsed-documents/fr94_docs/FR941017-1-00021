FR941017-1-00021 FR941017-1-00001 (i) The Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion must be characterized by response spectra. The value of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion must be set to one of the following choices: (A) One-third or less of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion design response spectra. The requirements associated with this Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(I) can be satisfied without the applicant performing explicit response or design analyses, or (B) A value greater than one-third of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion design response spectra. Analysis and design must be performed to demonstrate that the requirements associated with this Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(I) are satisfied. The design must take into account soil-structure interaction effects and the duration of vibratory ground motion. (I) When subjected to the effects of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in combination with normal operating loads, all structures, systems, and components of the nuclear power plant necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the public must remain functional and within applicable stress, strain, and deformation limits. (3) Required Plant Shutdown. If vibratory ground motion exceeding that of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion or if significant plant damage occurs, the licensee must shut down the nuclear power plant. If systems, structures, or components necessary for the safe shutdown of the nuclear power plant are not available after the occurrence of the OBE, the licensee must consult with the Commission and must propose a plan for the timely, safe shutdown of the nuclear power plant. Prior to resuming operations, the licensee must demonstrate to the Commission that no functional damage has occurred to those features necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the public. (4) Required Seismic Instrumentation. Suitable instrumentation must be provided so that the seismic response of nuclear power plant features important to safety can be evaluated promptly after an earthquake. (b) Surface Deformation. The potential for surface deformation must be taken into account in the design of the nuclear power plant by providing reasonable assurance that in the event of deformation, certain structures, systems, and components will remain functional. In addition to surface deformation induced loads, the design of safety features must take into account seismic loads, including aftershocks, and applicable concurrent functional and accident-induced loads. The design provisions for surface deformation must be based on its postulated occurrence in any direction and azimuth and under any part of the nuclear power plant, unless evidence indicates this assumption is not appropriate, and must take into account the estimated rate at which the surface deformation may occur. (c) Seismically Induced Floods and Water Waves and Other Design Conditions. Seismically induced floods and water waves from either locally or distantly generated seismic activity and other design conditions determined pursuant to §100.23 of this chapter must be taken into account in the design of the nuclear power plant so as to prevent undue risk to the health and safety of the public.

In §52.17, the introductory text of paragraph (a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1)(vi) are revised to read as follows: §52.17 Contents of applications. (a)(1) The application must contain the information required by §50.33 (a) through (d), the information required by §50.34 (a)(12) and (b)(10), and to the extent approval of emergency plans is sought under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the information required by §50.33 (g) and (j), and §50.34 (b)(6)(v). The application must also contain a description and safety assessment of the site on which the facility is to be located. The assessment must contain an analysis and evaluation of the major structures, systems, and components of the facility that bear significantly on the acceptability of the site under the radiological consequence evaluation factors identified in §50.34(a)(1) of this chapter. Site characteristics must comply with part 100 of this chapter. In addition, the application should describe the following: * * * * * (vi) The seismic, meteorological, hydrologic, and geologic characteristics of the proposed site; * * * * * PART 100_REACTOR SITE CRITERIA 9. and 10.
