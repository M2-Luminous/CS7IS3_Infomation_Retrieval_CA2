At the same time it marks the adoption of the declaration of Russia's state sovereignty. Needless to say, one of the components of any state's sovereignty is national security in which the Russian intelligence service is involved alongside other special services and the Army. Can I ask you to flesh out the contribution made by the Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] to ensuring that the new Russia really is a sovereign state? [Trubnikov] Sovereignty is primarily security, protection of national interests, and an independent and active foreign policy. The intelligence service's role in all this is extremely important, despite not always being evident -- such is the nature of intelligence activity. The present transition period in international relations has been marked by rapid changes in all spheres of life. This affects Russia in particular. On the whole, the trend of world development is favorable to our country, but the range of threats remains extremely wide. Monitoring and assessing these threats is a central and key task of intelligence. At the present time Russia's interests, and primarily its security, are threatened by the appearance of "trouble spots" close to its borders. For the first time since World War II attempts are being made to revise borders on the European continent. The significance of economic and environmental security has increased. Needless to say, some of these problems have predominantly domestic roots. However, we can also see external factors which exacerbate these problems. The task of intelligence is to uncover these factors. On a day-to-day basis Russian intelligence agents supply information for subsequent decisionmaking by the highest organs of power. Primarily regarding issues of foreign and defense policy. In addition, the intelligence service's remit includes the country's economic security, scientific and technical progress, and the environment. At home and abroad analytical reports by the FIS have been an authoritative voice on major problems affecting international security: On the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and NATO plans. We intend to continue the practice of preparing these documents. Finally, the intelligence service not only obtains information; it also exchanges data with other special services on problems of mutual interest. These include information on the fight against terrorism, organized crime, and maintenance of the nonproliferation regime applying to nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction. The need for the Russian FIS and its contribution to the cause of protecting Russia's national security was underlined by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin when he visited FIS headquarters recently. His speech to intelligence operatives laid down future guidelines for all of us. [Semenova] Incidentally, since you touched on the issue of weapons of mass destruction. Russian and foreign mass media have recently carried sensational reports regarding the problem of the development of nuclear weapons in our country. In this sphere, it seems, all the "laurels" belong to the intelligence service, and our scientists merely give enthusiastic assessments of the information obtained by intelligence. [Trubnikov] This is nothing more than deliberate or not so deliberate repetition of old cock-and-bull stories about the Russians "stealing" the atomic bomb from the Americans. It was untrue 50 years ago and it remains untrue today. In fact, the development of nuclear weapons in our country has been the result primarily of our own scientific efforts and our own scientific leading lights such as Kurchatov, Khariton, Zeldovich, and many others. The atom bomb is not some simple mechanism which it is possible to look over and then copy back at home. If our own scientists had not been able to fully grasp the secrets of the atomic nucleus, they would simply have been unable to understand and assess the information on nuclear problems which our intelligence service managed to obtain. Today this is history, and there are frequently exaggerations in the way history is told: Sometimes silence is assiduously cultivated, whereas at other times, on the contrary, too much emphasis is placed. The intelligence service does not want "other people's laurels," as you put it. It is entirely satisfied with its own. And the service which intelligence provided in this case was to latch onto an important trend in the development of science and technology, a trend which had colossal military potential, and to obtain information which enabled us to speed up -- let me repeat, speed up -- work on developing nuclear weapons in our country. [Semenova] Thank you, I think your explanation dots all the i's and crosses all the t's, at the same time precisely indicating the intelligence service's role in developing science. This is especially topical at the moment. But in the former USSR Russia did not have its own security organs, including an intelligence service. Following the Soviet Union's disintegration how was the FIS formed -- on the "wreckage" of the USSR KGB First Main Directorate or, so to speak, from scratch? [Trubnikov] The FIS was not formed on "wreckage" or from scratch. Russia received a strong existing intelligence service: the First Main Directorate's material and technical and organizational base and its cadres. Furthermore, by that time Russia had already started to form its own security organs system. In March 1991 the Federal Security Agency was set up, which included counterintelligence and intelligence subdivisions. Many KGB and First Main Directorate staffers were sent to work in the Russian state security organs, and many of them now occupy leading posts in the FIS. At the end of 1991 the First Main Directorate and Russian intelligence subdivisions merged. [Semenova] How does the FIS differ from the First Main Directorate in terms of its structure and from other intelligence services in terms of its tasks?... Or are the general organizational principles the same for all the world's intelligence services, like the laws of society's development? [Trubnikov] The main difference is that the intelligence service has stopped being the quasi-state and quasi-party organ it was within the KGB framework. Hence all the changes: departyization, deideologization, organizational and functional autonomy, strict observance of the law, control from the legislative and executive branches, and such like. Of course, the ending of the Cold War and the emergence of new geopolitical realities set us new tasks. Certain new subdivisions were formed to tackle them: economic intelligence, monitoring the nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons, collaboration with foreign special services. On the whole our intelligence service has a structure which is typical of all modern special services. It is determined by the very nature of intelligence and by the nature of its activity, and includes the extractive apparatus, analytical subdivisions, and auxiliary services. [Semenova] What position does Russian intelligence occupy in the world "league table" of special services? [Trubnikov] When we start talking about which intelligence services are in the premier world league and what positions they occupy in it, then the leaders most frequently mentioned are the U.S. CIA, the Israeli Mossad, the British secret service, and Russian intelligence. We have always been in this league and I would like to believe that we will always remain in it. As regards the specific position, much depends on the parameters used to define it: the scale of activity, the size of the budget, the number of personnel, the professional standard of intelligence officers, their commitment to their duty, and how they turn their qualities into specific results. Our people daily prove their loyalty to Russia in their deeds. I believe that, if the cadre personnel of our "opponents" were put into the same conditions in which Russian intelligence now finds itself, few would survive. But ours serve and will continue to serve! [Semenova] Initially "civilian" leaders, mainly politicians, have also been appointed in other special services. But later they all received military ranks and already feel like real "military men." The FIS director is a politician and academician but has not become a general. Why? [Trubnikov] The FIS director's authority is determined not by the number and size of stars on his shoulder boards or the lack of same. The main thing here is knowledge, analytical and organizational abilities, a commitment to the cause, and attention to people's needs. Yevgeniy Maksimovich Primakov has all this, and without a military rank. [Semenova] Are there other academicians in the FIS? [Trubnikov] So far none of the FIS cadre staffers has received this academic rank. [Semenova] What currently attracts people to an intelligence officer's profession? [Trubnikov] Not ultrahigh wages at any rate. Our staffers' salaries are not the lowest but, like those of all budget-funded employees and servicemen, are considerably lower than in the private sector. But roughly the same situation exists in other countries. Young people are now coming into intelligence above all because this work gives them the opportunity to serve their country and to bring it benefit at our difficult time. An intelligence officer's profession allows a person to show himself as an individual, to realize his working, volitional, and moral qualities -- sometimes in extreme situations -- and to become a top-class expert. Our specialists in the fields of politics, economics, military matters, and science and technology are constantly abreast of the latest world events and achievements in the spheres of their activity. People now want to come into intelligence not because it is "advantageous" but because it is important and interesting. [Semenova] Spy -- is that offensive? Has the attitude toward intelligence changed, do people not continue to confuse it with a political police? [Trubnikov] We are dealing with cadre intelligence officers or agents. It is our Federal Counterintelligence Service which mainly deals with spies, because a spy is considered to be someone who works against our country, whereas we work for Russia. We do not engage in political investigation. In my opinion this is clear to an unbiased compatriot. [Semenova] If you started all over again would you become an intelligence officer? [Trubnikov] Of course!
