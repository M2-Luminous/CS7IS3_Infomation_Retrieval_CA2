The visit of the Vietnamese foreign minister is to prepare for the official visit by H.E. Vo Van Kiet, Vietnamese prime minister, planned for next month at the behest of the two Cambodian prime ministers. During the one-hour meeting, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen welcomed and highly appreciated the talks between Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, with H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam, concerning bilateral cooperation in economics, trade, science and technology, culture, and tourism. The two sides agreed on peaceful coexistence and improving cooperation and good relations as neighboring countries in order to create peace and stability in the region. Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen affirmed the government position on the issue of the border with Vietnam, saying that this should be resolved peacefully through mutual understanding and based on legal principles. Concerning the issue of Vietnamese residents living in Cambodia and some who have returned to live along the border, the two Cambodian prime ministers specified that a solution will be found which is acceptable to national and international circles. The two prime ministers stressed the difficulty involved in Cambodia's immigration law, soon to be promulgated, to ensure residence in Cambodia by immigrants because this matter is related to security problems caused by the Khmer Rouge group. In the past, Vietnamese immigrants had been the target of Khmer Rouge attacks. Concerning the Mekong River, the two prime ministers and the Vietnamese foreign minister will find a common solution to continue and facilitate navigation through Vietnam and Cambodia without hindrance. An appeal was made to Laos to cooperate in ensuring the Mekong's suitability for serving the economic progress of each country and to avoid harming the environment. Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen expressed their joy and told the Vietnamese foreign minister that the Cambodian Government is happy with the end of U.S. economic sanctions against Vietnam.
