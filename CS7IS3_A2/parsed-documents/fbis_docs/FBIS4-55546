On behalf of all my colleagues in the European Parliament, I thank you most warmly for your invitation. When I assumed my function as president of the European Parliament in January 1992 I knew that it would be impossible during my two and a half years mandate to visit all the countries with which the European Union enjoys positive European links. Nevertheless, I was determined to visit Romania. The European Parliament follows closely the relations with all countries neighboring the European Union and mainly those in Central and East Europe. Romania is no exception. Since the crucial events of 1989 and 1990 the policy of the countries in the European Union and the efforts of their governments and parliaments and especially of the European Parliament have been directed toward establishing and building a new political and economic structure in Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic countries, and the CIS. Developing, improving, and deepening economic and trade relations between the European Union and these countries has acquired a particular importance in 1994. On their part, the countries that were previously locked under Soviet domination in the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] and the Warsaw Pact now have the freedom to devote all their efforts to confront the challenges that the current situation presents. The architecture of East-West relations are generally characterized by a new spirit of cooperation. The days of isolation, confrontation, and mistrust are over. There is a determined political will of both sides to create relations based on friendship, partnership, and mutual respect. I hardly need to remind Romania, of all countries, how difficult and painful is the transition from the communist regime to a peaceful multiparty democracy and from decades of planned economy to a social market economy. This takes time, much patience, and great efforts. Romania in particular is confronted with great challenges and tries to implement reforms and at the same time to take care of the painful legacy of the past and the current social and political realities. The progress you have already made, in spite of all obstacles, deserves recognition and respect. The progress that you have yet to make deserves our understanding, support, and encouragement. This is why I said that I believed that it is important for me to come here to Romania, learn about your preoccupations first hand, and assure you of the European Parliament's continuous support for your efforts to try and take your rightful, integrated place in the European family. Your history is European and I am convinced that Romania's future is also linked to Europe. I am equally convinced that Romania and its people wish to confront challenges and wish to attain their goals. On its part, the European Union has recognized that it must find appropriate ways and means to help bring the European countries closer together in a broader association. This is where association agreements intervene. The association agreement signed between Romania and the European Union is a significant step in the right direction. Its realistic aim is to offer realistic assistance and support for the future, which is necessary for restructuring and which enables the creation of conditions for full integration. Over and above economic and trade policy aspects, the European accord has a new special characteristic that is mainly a political accord and dialogue on several issues. It supports the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights that each country that wishes to be associated closely to the Europe must pledge to respect. The European Parliament takes its responsibility and its role very seriously as far as restructuring of relations with the European Union and with the countries in the Central and Eastern Europe are concerned. As far as all the accords concluded with Central and Eastern Europe are concerned, we have made a very close and critical assessment of the results of relations between the European Commission and Romania. After a thorough debate and a serious assessment, we approved the European accord with a great majority, while being perfectly aware of the implications. Our parliament was the first parliament of the European Union which ratified the agreement with Romania. Since then, we put pressure on other parliaments in Europe as well, to follow our example. Delays in the ratification can only hinder those who must support this agreement. All European agreements mean much more than trade and financial assistance, no matter how important these aspects are. Full association also involves cooperation at social, political, and cultural levels. In this respect, the European Parliament grants special attention to its formal and informal relations with the parliaments of the countries in question. We look forward to achieving the establishment of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that is stipulated in the association agreement with Romania. Following one of the existing European delegations [words indistinct] in relations with Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, I am sure that this new structure will offer an extremely valuable forum for continuous discussions and for an increased mutual understandings between the two parliaments. The integration process [words indistinct], a strong European Union from the economic and political point of view, will be able to offer the countries in Central and East Europe the support that they need in order to achieve long-term economic stability and political security. The European Union has its own internal difficulties which generally appear on the road of a stronger integration. In spite of these internal problems that we have, to be a full member is an attractive proposal for those outside of it. On its part, the European Parliament has consistently spoken out for enlargement. This month, in our last session that we had before the European elections, we took a historical step, we cast a vote in favor of enlargement of the Union in order to include our friends from Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. This was a vote that confirmed the capacity of the European Parliament to answer with significant responsibility all the membership applications. Likewise, it confirmed our sincere commitment toward the principle of enlargement. At the same time, the European Parliament welcomed the decision taken by the Council of Europe on 22 June 1993 in Copenhagen, where the heads of state and governments showed the possibility for participation in the European Union of those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that signed or will sign association agreements. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled and the progress the Parliament asked for reported, we see that there is a possibility for a further enlargement, which is an positive act and which consolidates the European Union. The guiding principle in the geographic expansion of the Union should be accompanied by a corresponding process of establishing especially fundamental institutions. In order to be eligible for membership, those who submit the request have to fulfill a number of fundamental conditions, which are the following: a state based on freedom and the rule of law, a pluralistic democracy, a functioning social market economy, and the willingness to give up sovereignty [as heard]. In addition to these four basic fundamental preconditions, the following conditions are also necessary: adoption in full of the [words indistinct] the existing body of the community legislation, which came into force through the Rome treaty and [word indistinct] and adherence to the Maastricht treaty and all its objectives, which also includes the political goals of the treaty. History has taught us that the road forward must be through cooperation and integration and not through confrontation and separation. It is completely in our interest to cooperate with those who share our fundamental values of democracy, tolerance, and mutual respect. We should build structures that will allow us to achieve our joint goals, long term peace, and prosperity. Reaching the necessary agreements for stability with Central and Eastern Europe and Russia and the other countries in the CIS, Baltic states, and the Balkans is a precondition to create a new, broad European security structure. Only if we achieve this objective will it be possible to ensure that crises and wars like the one in the former Yugoslavia will not happen again. Our Parliament has welcomed the initiative taken by the heads of states and governments to move toward a European agreement regarding stability in Europe. The goal is to prevent tension and potential conflicts in Europe, to consolidate borders, and solve the problems of minorities in a spirit of tolerance and cooperation. Romania occupies a particularly sensitive geographical and strategic position, which is far from stable. Because of this, you have suffered directly from the negative economic effects of the terrible conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Also due to its position, your country could make a significant contribution to stability and peace in this region. Therefore, we noted in connection with Romania that it was the first of many countries that decided to accept Partnership for Peace made by the NATO and the Western Alliance at its January meeting. The engagement of Romania in this respect is clear and I congratulate you on it. The current conflicts in Europe and in other parts of the world demonstrate without any doubt that long-term peaceful coexistence and mutual cooperation is not possible unless the principles of tolerance, democracy, and respect for human rights are applied and are preserved throughout the world. The architecture of Europe will necessarily change to an ever greater extent as we are advancing toward a greater integration, a greater political union, and a more comprising enlargement. However, in spite of these changes, these fundamental principles and our commitments must remain firm. The future of Europe will ultimately depend on the success of our strivings. I am confident that Romania shares this commitment. I am sure too, that there is a political will in your country to make the necessary steps and to ensure that the future of Romania and of its people will be one of peace, democracy, and prosperity in the heart of an integrated Europe. You may rest assured that the European Parliament supports you and encourages you in achieving this goal. I can tell you, Europe needs Romania but certainly Romania also needs Europe. Thank you for your attention. [applause]
