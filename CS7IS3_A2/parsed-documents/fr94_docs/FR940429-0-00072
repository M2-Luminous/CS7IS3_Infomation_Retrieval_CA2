FR940429-0-00072 FR940429-0-00010 Change: None. Section 602.21␣Administrative and Fiscal Responsibility Comments: A number of commenters described the recordkeeping burden imposed by the proposed regulations as unduly onerous and in violation of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines that limit record retention requirements to three years. Several commenters indicated that the requirement to keep self-study reports for two complete accreditation or preaccreditation cycles was especially burdensome because of the large volume of materials typically included with these reports. On other issues related to this section, one commenter felt that, to avoid conflicts of interest, members of the agency's decision making body should not also be members of the agency's governing board. Another believed that the Secretary should not have authority to determine whether an agency's staff is adequate, knowledgeable, and competent. Discussion: With regard to the record retention requirement, the Secretary wishes to note that the requirement to keep records for two complete accreditation or preaccreditation cycles first appeared in the 1988 regulations governing the recognition of accrediting agencies. The NPRM for those regulations had initially included a provision for the indefinite retention of records. This was subsequently reduced to the current two-cycle requirement as a result of public comment on the recordkeeping burden. The Secretary also wishes to note that the specific comment about the burden of keeping self-study reports for two full cycles was made by negotiators during the negotiated rulemaking sessions for these regulations. As a result, the Secretary carefully monitored the review of self-study reports by Department staff members conducting file reviews at agencies' headquarters during the past year and has determined that only the most recent self-study reports are particularly useful to staff. Consequently, the recordkeeping requirement for self-study reports has been reduced to the most recent report only. With regard to the potential conflict of interest when the same individuals serve as members of both the decision making body and the governing board of an agency, the Secretary appreciates the concern but believes that agencies should be allowed the flexibility to determine the composition of these bodies that best suits their needs. Further, as all agencies are required to have adequate policies dealing with conflicts of interest, the Secretary believes there is adequate protection of the public interest. Concerning the issue of the Secretary's review of an agency's staff, the Secretary believes that the adequacy, knowledge, and capability of an accrediting agency's staff are appropriate factors to be considered in making a determination regarding whether the agency has the administrative responsibility to carry out its accrediting activities. Change: Agencies must keep only the most recent self-study report. Section 602.22␣Demonstration of Accreditation Experience Comments: Several commenters requested that accrediting agencies be required to demonstrate that their policies, evaluation methods, and decisions are accepted throughout the United States by recognized accrediting agencies. Their rationale was that acceptance by recognized agencies provided an important measure of an agency's reliability. Discussion: The commenters' rationale was presented to the Department by the non-Federal negotiators during negotiated rulemaking, and the Secretary acknowledges that demonstration of acceptance by recognized accrediting agencies can be an important factor to consider when evaluating an agency seeking recognition, particularly one seeking initial recognition. On the other hand, those interested in forming new accrediting agencies have expressed concern that this requirement imposes unfair hurdles for them and unduly stifles competition among accrediting agencies. The Secretary believes that agencies should not be required to demonstrate acceptance by recognized accrediting agencies but may certainly do so in their application for recognition, if they wish. Change: None. Section 602.23␣Application of Standards Comments: The Secretary received several suggestions for changes to this section. For example, one suggestion was to change the wording in §602.23(a) from ``[the agency] consistently applies and enforces written standards that ensure that the quality of education or training offered is of sufficient quality to achieve␣*␣*␣*␣the stated objective for which it is offered'' to ``[the agency] has written standards that it consistently applies to ensure that the education or training offered␣*␣*␣*.'' Another was to change the wording in §602.23(b)(5) from ``to ensure that its criteria and standards are appropriate and sufficiently comprehensive to evaluate the quality of the education of training provided␣*␣*␣*␣and are relevant to the education or training needs of affected students'' to ``to ensure that its criteria and standards are comprehensive and appropriate to the agency's objective of ensuring the quality of the institutions or programs it accredits.''
