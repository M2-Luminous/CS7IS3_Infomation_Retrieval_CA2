FBIS4-62343 "drsov094_a_94035" FBIS-SOV-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Contract for Sale of Migs to Malaysia Ready Contract for Sale of Migs to Malaysia Ready PM1305122594 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 13 May 94 First Edition p 2 PM1305122594 Moscow IZVESTIYA Russian BFN [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "MiGs Contract Ready But It Will Not Be Signed Tomorrow"] [Text] In yesterday's issue of IZVESTIYA our Washington correspondent, citing a statement by Arkadiy VOlskiy, reported that Oleg Soskovets, first vice premier of the Russian Government, had not arrived in the U.S. capital as planned to open an exhibition of progressive technology because he had flown to Malaysia to sign a contract for MiG-29 fighters. According to information I received from confidential sources, the vice premier is still in Moscow. The Russian-Malaysian contract for the sale of 18 light Mig-29 front-line fighter is indeed already ready and has been agreed by the participants in talks but it is to be signed in the near future, in the summer. A few details have to be sorted out. These details concern in particular the palm oil consignment which will go to pay for our aircraft. As we know, when he was vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy visited Malaysia and suggested selling our MiGs in practice mainly for palm oil. But the Russian Government rejected such terms for a contract and insisted on the currency equivalent. Now there is a decision. It remains to be approved. It is true that at the Malaysian side's request our aircraft builders embarked on unprecedented innovations in equipping the Russian fighter. Thus, the aircraft delivered to Kuala Lumpur will have installed on them "Takan" close-range navigation receivers which operate in tandem with the U.S. ground station produced by the same firm. The MiGs are being further equipped with "Collins" radio stations operating on the emergency frequencies used in Southeast Asia. The fighter will acquire the GPS-21 satellite navigation system which can get their bearings equally well from Russian and U.S. satellite signals. At the Malaysians' request all instruments on our aircraft will be recalibrated from meters and kilometers to feet and miles, which are used in that country. The Malaysian military pilots will train at our air force bases and in flying academies. And most important Russia for the first time together with Malaysia is creating a fundamentally new subunit there to service aircraft -- the technical service center, which will be able to help not only Malaysian military aircraft but also the fighter aircraft of other states. In the opinion of the exporters of our aviation equipment all this additional equipping of Russian fighter aircraft will help them integrate more easily with the ground-based airfield services of the Malaysian Air Force and will ensure their easier introduction into existing infrastructures and will consequently make the purchase of such aircraft cheaper and more accessible. Our MiGs have been the basic aircraft in this region only in India and Vietnam so far. Now, after the signing of the contract with Malaysia, it is not ruled out that the Russian combat aircraft will appear in other Southeast Asian countries. This breakthrough to new arms markets previously closed to Russia is regarded by specialists as a very great gain for Russian exporters of combat equipment.
