Luzgin and Retired Captain 1st Rank, Lecturer S. Smirnov, under the rubric: "Questions of Theory": "Electronic Support to Combat Command and Control"] [Text] Electronic situation coverage occupies a special place in the series of measures for the support of command and control of combat and everyday activities of naval ships. The sphere of its operation extends in space from the surface of the sea to its bottom, on the one hand, and to near space, on the other hand. At the present time, various guiding documents and official publications contain a certain inconsistency in the interpretation of the concept "electronic support", including the electronic situation coverage process as the initial component of this type of support. At the same time, there are certain theoretical and practical accumulations here. As a result, normalization of the existing views is becoming an urgent task. In our opinion, we can most graphically present the entire process of electronic situation coverage in the form of the structural diagrams that are depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3. Figure 1. A Graphic Algorithm of the It is customary to proceed from the fact that, as shown in Figure 1, this process objectively consists of the successive resolution of the following missions at any level of command and control (of a ship and its weapons, a task group, a task force, etc.): 1. Continuous surveillance of the surrounding situation, using electronic detection and identification systems, that consists of three stages -- target search, target detection and identification and also target tracking during a specific period of time. 2. Gathering information on the situation and the reciprocal exchange of information among task force (task group) ships and also with external sources via radio nets and radio lines of automated VZOI systems. There are two stages present here: Gathering information on the situation from internal ship sources and the reciprocal exchange of information with other sources. 3. Processing all initial information that has been obtained on the situation (What? Where? In what quantity detected?); contact plotting (electronic tracking) of target movement with detection of target motion and maneuvering and formation of the target history in MRO systems or in STsVS [specialized digital computer system] in BIUS [Combat Information Command and Control System] loops or in BITs of ships; identification of all information on the situation and depiction of models of tactical situations with their extrapolation for the immediate future. That is, operational data is divided into three stages -- initial, secondary and tertiary processing of information on the situation. 4. Analysis of the situation that has developed in the BITs of ships. (An assessment of mutual location, target motion and maneuvering, and detection of the composition of the enemy forces is the first stage; discovery of the operating tactics, the degree of threat and the enemy's intentions is the second stage). 5. A report from the BITs of ships and presentation of the initial and processed, analyzed information on the situation to the command authorities in graphic form on ARM [automated work station] screens; to the GKPs [Primary Control Station] of ships, the command posts of task forces, and to other command posts -- consumers of information on the situation. The initial abbreviated report with the information: What has been detected and is being observed, the numerical composition of the group targets and where they are located -- coordinate data; a more precise report with indication of certain target motion and maneuvering parameters; and, finally, a complete report with the addition of target tactical composition, the proposed nature of operations and the degree of threat, and revealed enemy intentions. Based upon the theoretical bases that assume the gradual nature of the resolution of each electronic situation coverage mission that is depicted in Figure 1, the algorithm reveals existing communications and dependence between the stages examined above and displays a definite symmetry in the dynamics of its implementation. Based upon the results of the electronic situation coverage, information processing support must be attained using the MRO systems, combat information command and control system loops, BITs equipment or PU-N recommendations. Taking these into account, the Primary Control Station and other command posts of ships or the task group or task force command post make decisions on the command and control of the electronic situation coverage systems themselves, electronic jamming systems, weapons systems, ships, task forces and coordinating forces. The process of carrying out each of the possible decisions also entails a number of consecutive conditional stages. The majority of these stages, in turn, require electronic support through the utilization of target identification and target designation systems and schemes, weapons fire control systems, electronic warfare systems, shipborne aircraft take off, flight, vectoring and landing control systems, diagrams and shipborne combat information command and control system loops, navigational radars, etc. The composition of the command and control missions, based upon which the recommendations indicated above can be developed according to the electronic situation coverage and also the primary stages of electronic support of the resolution of these missions is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Recommendations for Combat Consequently, based upon electronic situation coverage, we can totally achieve the required level of electronic support of command and control during combat and everyday activities of ships and task forces (Fig. 3) ONLY as a result of ALL of the examined processes. What has been set forth above is called upon to ameliorate to a certain extent the existing inconsistencies in understanding and interpreting the issues of "electronic support" and "electronic situation coverage". Figure 3. The Content of Electronic In conclusion, it is appropriate to point out that the examined provisions can be accepted as a sort of methodological basis of the scientific and academic discipline being formed -- "Electronic Support of the Command and Control of Ships, Their Weapons, and Coordinating Forces". In our opinion, this discipline must follow the content and patterns of the resolution of various electronic situation coverage missions and electronic support of combat command and control on the whole and, through its stages, the patterns of interrelationships and the dependencies of these stages. The development of recommendations of a technical and organizational context for the effective electronic support of combat command and control of naval ships and task forces must be its practical solution.
