The paper urges Washington to adopt an independent policy toward the Arab-Israeli conflict or to deal impartially with this hot issue, so as to champion justice, international legitimacy, and the UN Charter and resolutions, as well as its credibility as a superpower entrusted by the Arabs and the world, but not by Israel, to look for a political settlement. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 form the basis and foundation of this settlement, as well as the spirit of the initiative launched by the United States and the concept of exchanging land for peace. AL-THAWRAH says if the U.S. Administration does not champion all of the above principles and the commitments President Clinton reiterated at the Geneva summit with President Hafiz al-Asad, then the least it should do is not to side with the Israeli aggressor that has usurped rights and territory. It should also not provide Israel with a cover by extending military and political aid to it. This aid strengthens the leaders of Israel in their rejection of all the obligations of just and comprehensive peace and in continuing aggression and crimes, adhering to their occupation of the Arab territories, taking lightly the will of the international community, and violating its legitimacy and laws. The paper adds that U.S. support has been a major cause for increasing Israeli intransigence and arrogance. It has also encouraged Israeli practices, crimes, and attacks on Arabs. Today, this support is a direct cause for obstructing the peace process and Israel's not committing itself to its terms of reference. In conclusion, AL-THAWRAH urges the United States to support the peace process toward achieving a just solution, without favoritism or bias.
