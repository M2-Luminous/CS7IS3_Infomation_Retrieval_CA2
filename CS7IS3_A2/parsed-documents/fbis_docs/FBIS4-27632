[30 May] -- The bilateral relations between Malaysia and China have reached a new level of understanding and cooperation, and the two countries should take pride in the steady development, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said. He said in the last five years, bilateral relations had increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation. "I am confident this trend will be further reinforced in the years to come," he said in a two-page letter to Chinese Premier Li Peng on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. His letter was released by Wisma Putra [Foreign Ministry]. Formal ties were sealed in Beijing on May 31, 1974 by the late Tun Abdul Razak, then Malaysian Prime Minister, and his then Chinese counterpart the late Zhou Enlai. Dr. Mahathir paid tribute to Razak's vision and courage in making Malaysia the first ASEAN country to normalise ties with China. "I believe credit for the development of the excellent relations between Malaysia and China should also go to the pragmatic and outward-looking leadership of China," he said. He said the policy of friendly relations with neighbouring countries had encouraged positive developments in bilateral relationships, particularly in recent years. Both Malaysia and China could take pride in the steady development of mutually satisfying relations over the last two decades although links between them actually go back a long way in history, he added. Apart from the rapid increase in economic cooperation, trade, and investment, Dr. Mahathir said cooperation in other fields such as tourism, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people contacts would further encourage better understanding and friendship. Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi also sent a message on the occasion to his Chinese counterpart and Vice Premier Qian Qichen. Li, in a congratulatory message to Dr. Mahathir, said both China and Malaysia were developing countries with similar historical experiences and were now facing the great tasks of developing the national economy. "The seeds of Sino-Malaysian friendship sowed 20 years ago have now yielded rich fruits. I am convinced that the tree of our friendship that is being fostered will grow even healthier in the years to come." Noting Dr. Mahathir's three visits to China in recent years, the Chinese premier said the visits had promoted mutual understanding and trust and brought Sino-Malaysian relations to a new stage of all-round development. The economic and trade cooperation between the two countries had now made remarkable achievements, he said. "It has been proven by facts that the maintenance of friendly and good neighbourly relations between China and Malaysia is not only in conformity to the fundamental interests of the two countries, but also conducive to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the region." Qian sent a similar message to Abdullah expressing the hope that the existing strong relations between the two countries would continue to be consolidated in the future. "We highly regard your government for upholding justice and speaking out from a sense of justice in international affairs and promoting the political stability and economic prosperity of this region," he said.
