This was in apparent reaction to the recent swell in demands by mainly civil servants for their pension contributions to be returned to them before the April election. In a resolution adopted on Thursday, the sub-council said the demand for immediate pension payments had been precipitated by the "pre-emptive securing of excessive pensions and employment benefits by certain political office bearers". Another reason behind the demand for pension payments was that civil servants had been denied access by certain administrations to decision-making with regard to pension funds. "The Sub-Council on Finance wishes to reassure all concerned that their pension benefits are adequately protected in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993. Section 236 (5) of the constitution specifically provides that pensionable salary or pensionable salary scale of civil servants shall not be reduced below the levels applicable before the commencement of the new constitution. "Section 212 (6) of the constitution specifically protects the accrued benefits of members of official pension funds. In essence it provides that any amendments to pension benefits, which may be prejudicial to members, may not be instituted retroactively." The sub-council urged all concerned to exercise utmost restraint and called on affected people to consider their demand for immediate pension payouts. "Such a call is made especially in the light of the fact that the longer-term disadvantages to the individual and the country far outweigh short-term benefit that might accrue from an immediate pension payout."
