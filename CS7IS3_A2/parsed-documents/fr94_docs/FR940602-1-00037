FR940602-1-00037 FR940602-1-00013 (e) When a Jacob's ladder is used as the means of access to a barge being worked, spacers (bumpers) shall be hung between the vessel, barge, or other structure to which the barge is tied alongside, or other equally effective means shall be taken to prevent damage to the bottom rungs of the ladder. (f) When a Jacob's ladder is being used in such a manner that there is a danger of an employee falling between the vessel, barge, or other structure (pier), a net or other equivalent protection shall be provided. §1918.24 Bridge plates and ramps. (See also §1918.86). (a) Bridge and car plates (dockboards). Bridge and car plates used afloat shall be well maintained and shall: (1) Be strong enough to support the loads imposed on them; (2) Be secured or equipped with devices to prevent their dislodgement; (3) Be equipped with hand holds or other effective means to permit safe handling and; (4) Be equipped with side boards that are at least 6 inches (.16 m) high along the space bridged. (b) Portable ramps . Portable ramps used afloat shall be well maintained and shall: (1) Be strong enough to support the loads imposed on them; (2) Be equipped with a railing meeting the requirements of §1918.21(a)(2), if the slope is more than 20 degrees to the horizontal or if employees could fall more than 4 feet (1.2 m); (3) Be equipped with a slip resistant surface; (4) Be properly secured; and (5) Be equipped with side boards that are at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) high. §1918.25 Ladders. (a) There shall be at least one safe and accessible ladder for each gang working in a hatch. However, no more than two such ladders are required in any hatch. An effective means of gaining a handhold shall be provided at or near the head of each vertical fixed ladder cannot serve this purpose. (b) When any fixed ladder is visibly unsafe, the employer shall identify such ladder and prohibit its use by employees. (c) Where portable straight ladders are used, they shall be of sufficient length to extend 36 inches (.91 m) above the upper landing surface, and positively secured or held against shifting or slipping. When conditions are such that a straight ladder cannot be used, Jacob's ladders meeting the requirements of §1918.22 may be used. (d) When 6 inches (15.2 cm) or more of clearance does not exist in back of ladder rungs, the ladder shall be deemed ``unsafe'' for the purpose of this section. However, for vessels built prior to December 5, 1981, the ladder shall be deemed ``unsafe'' when 4 inches (10 cm) or more of clearance does not exist in back of ladder rungs. Alternate means of access (for example, a portable ladder) must be utilized. (e) (1) Where access to or from a stowed deckload or other cargo is needed and no other safe means is available, ladders or steps of adequate strength shall be furnished, and positively secured or held against shifting or slipping while in use. Steps formed by the cargo itself are acceptable when the employer demonstrates that the nature of the cargo and the type of stowage provides equivalent safe access. (2) Where portable straight ladders are used they shall be of sufficient length to extend at least 36 inches (.92 m) above the upper landing surface. (f) The following standards for existing manufactured portable ladders must be met: (1) Rungs of manufactured portable ladders obtained before [insert effective date of the Final Rule] shall be capable of supporting a 200-pound (890 N) load without deformation. (2) Rungs shall be evenly spaced from 9 to 161/2 inches (22.9 to 41.9 cm), center to center. (3) Rungs shall be continuous members between rails. Each rung of a double-rung ladder (two side rails and a center rail) shall extend the full width of the ladder. (4) Width between side rails at the base of the ladder shall be at least 12 inches (30 cm) for ladders 10 feet (3.05 m) or less in overall length, and shall increase at least one-fourth inch (0.6 cm) for each additional 2 feet (0.61 m) of ladder length. (g) Standards for manufactured portable ladders. Portable manufactured ladders obtained after [insert effective date of the Final Rule] shall bear identification indicating that they meet the appropriate ladder construction requirements of the following standards: (1) ANSI A14.1&hyph;1990, Safety Requirements for Portable Wood Ladders; (2) ANSI A14.2&hyph;1990, Safety Requirements for Portable Metal Ladders; (3) ANSI A14.5&hyph;1992, Safety Requirements for Portable Reinforced Plastic Ladders. (h) Standards for job-made portable ladders. Job-made ladders shall: (1) Have a minimum and uniform distance between rungs of 12 inches (30 cm) center to center; (2) Be capable of supporting a 250-pound (1100 N) load without deformation; and (3) Have a minimum width between side rails of 12 inches (30 cm) for ladders 10 feet (3.05 m) or less in height. Width between rails shall increase at least one-fourth inch (0.6 cm) for each additional 2 feet (0.61 m) of ladder length. (i) Maintenance and inspection. (1) The employer shall maintain portable ladders in safe condition. Ladders with the following defects shall not be used, and shall either be tagged as unusable if kept on board, or shall be removed from the vessel:
