"Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is making dealing with the issue more difficult. It will not be decided by diktat from Denmark," Carl Bildt said when he received reports of his Danish counterpart's remarks at the annual national conference of the Federation of Swedish Farmers in Karlstad yesterday. After a Danish cabinet meeting yesterday morning Nyrup Rasmussen had spoken of "the delay which has already affected the project" and urged the Swedish Government to reach a swift decision: "I would ideally like to avoid an expression like `weeks,' he said, wanting to talk more in terms of days if not hours now that SMHI [Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute] and its Danish counterpart, DHI [Danish Hydraulic Institute], had in their calculations confirmed a zero solution for water throughflow. "To be frank I am surprised that Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is holding press conferences about what is Sweden's business, before the Swedish Government has even been able to read the relevant material," Bildt said adding, in a travesty of "something rotten in the state of Denmark," that there is "something strange going on in Denmark." (A comment on a statement from Nyrup Rasmussen about changes in the planned construction of the bridge.) Yesterday afternoon neither the Swedish Environment Ministry nor the Prime Minister's Office had received the documentation which the Oresund Bridge Consortium had posted in Malmo on Monday. Carl Bildt and [Environment Minister] Olof Johansson are agreed in one respect about handling the issue in the future. It will be treated as an administrative matter -- hence the irritation with the Danes' stressing Sweden's political will to arrive at a swift decision. The Swedish Environment Ministry's strategy is to be pedantic and correct. "We do not want a complaint to the Supreme Administrative Court," said one of Olof Johansson's experts, who is "almost certain" that the professional fishermen in the area will appeal if the examination of the environmental effects of the bridge is not carried out to the letter. Olof Johansson himself said that he will not allow himself to be rushed and that the bridge issue is such that it ought to be decided in an election. There is, however, a sensitive point in the Swedish Government's future handling of the bridge question. According to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET, the Environment Ministry is going to want to send the new calculations of south-flowing water currents in the Baltic Sea back to the Water Rights Court. Reference is made here to the press statement of 13 January which states that the court's ruling will be of decisive importance when the government comes to reach a decision on the issue. Carl Bildt on the other hand has said that he finds it "difficult to see" why the issue must be brought before the Water Rights Court again. [passage omitted]
