The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] still insists on its way. Our correspondent Joao Ligio reports: [Ligio] The discussion of specific principles for national reconciliation entered its fifth week today with the same routine of exploratory contacts and no fruitful results. This morning, the Black Cockerel's men drafted a new text in which they accept the government's proposal, with the condition that the following is added: Three more provinces, three ministries, and three districts, all in the central plateau. This proposal was, however, immediately turned down by the mediator without the need to consult the government delegation. This afternoon, the mediator handed the parties the final version, which includes all principles, even those on which the parties disagree. The parties must present their reactions to this document by tomorrow, since the mediator is adopting a time limit for consideration.
