This is how he summarized his intentions for tomorrow's talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Council of Ministers, and the National Assembly: [Begin Poos recording, in French fading into Bulgarian translation] This is a working visit related to our bilateral relations. However, I have also come to Bulgaria in my capacity as acting chairman of the Western European Union. We will also discuss issues of European security. In response to our question whether the issue of violating the embargo along the Danube River will be discussed, Mr. Poos said that this is not the basic goal of his visit, but the issue will be discussed anyway. Nevertheless, we do not consider Bulgaria responsible for the recent incidents, he stressed. The guest said that at the last meeting of the Western European Union in Luxembourg on the ministerial level, it was decided to grant Bulgaria an enhanced status, which will practically make it an associated member of the Western European Union. Mr. Poos will also be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev tomorrow.
