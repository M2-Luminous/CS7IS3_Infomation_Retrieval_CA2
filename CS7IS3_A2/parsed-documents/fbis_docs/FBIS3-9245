The same sources said it was "99.99 percent sure" that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would not come to Prague this Sunday. Grigoriy Serebrennikov said it was "very unlikely" that the visit would take place this month. Asked what the missing hundredth of a percent could represent, Serebrennikov replied "Nothing, really." He said that Zhirinovskiy was concentrating at present on internal party problems and that on Sunday [20 March] and Monday he had engagements in Moscow. "He must have made a mistake," Serebrennikov said of Zhirinovskiy's announcement on March 14 that he would arrive in the Czech Republic for a two-day visit on March 20. The postponement of Zhirinovskiy's visit to the Czech Republic at the invitation of the far-right Assembly for the Republic- Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) was announced after a representative of the Liberal Democratic Party discussed the issue with a representative of the Czech Embassy in Moscow. Unofficial sources say the Liberal Democrats were warned that their leader's visit to Prague was considered by the Czech Government to be "extremely inappropriate," and that it intended to use the possibilities offered by Czech law. Zhirinovskiy's circles apparently took this warning as a signal that the same thing might happen in the Czech Republic as happened in Slovenia, where on March 6 Zhirinovskiy got only as far as transit at Ljubljana airport and was forced to return to Moscow a day later. Officially, however, the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party are not admitting the possibility that the postponement of the visit to Prague could be connected with the wave of disapproving reactions which the announcement of his visit provoked in the Czech Republic. The journeys abroad of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy since last December's Russian elections have been accompanied by a series of scandals. He was expelled from Bulgaria, Romania announced him an undesirable person and banned his entrance into the country, Germany refused to give him an entrance visa and Austria, France and Spain proceeded similarly. Zhirinovskiy does not need a visa to visit the Czech Republic, but only a diplomatic passport, to which as a deputy he has a right.
