Danilo Garcia, president of the Association of Cubans in the Dominican Republic, said the attempts to leave that country in fragile boats are a result of the U.S. refusal to grant them a visa to travel to Florida to join their relatives. Observers noted that the attempts by Cuban citizens to travel illegally to the United States are linked to the favorable greeting given to those who use those means, in spite of the serious risk to their lives.
