Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying, who will lead an ROC delegation to the 27th ADB board of directors meeting scheduled to open May 3 in Nice, France, said the name change was unacceptable and unjust. The unilateral decision to change the name deprived the ROC, an ADB founder, of its rights at the international banking institution, Li said. Li said he may issue the protest during the meeting either directly to the ADB board chairman, or in a statement when he makes an oral report. The ADB changed Taiwan's representative name from Chinese, Taipei into "Taipei, China" after Beijing joined the group in 1986. Taipei refused to take part in any ADB activities in protest of the insensitive and unfair treatment in 1986 and 1987. Taipei resumed its involvement with the ADB and returned to the annual board meeting in 1988 after President Li Teng-hui advocated more pragmatic diplomatic measures. The ROC mission protested the name change during a board meeting last year by placing a sign reading "under protest" above the "Taipei, China" designation.
