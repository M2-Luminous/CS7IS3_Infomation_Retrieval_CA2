The announcement was made in Brussels by the Burundi Embassy. Two weeks ago the Burundi parliament chose the Agriculture Minister, a Hutu, Ntaryamira to succeed President Ndadaye also from the Hutu people. He was killed in a failed coup d'etat three months ago. The constitutional successor was also killed in the coup. Due to the unsettled state of the country it was impossible to hold general elections. After the impasse the two Hutu judges of the Constitutional Court resigned. The other five, all Tutsis, have now been dismissed. The embassy says that Ntaryamira's nomination as president can now be ratified.
