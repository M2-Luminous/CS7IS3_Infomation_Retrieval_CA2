The population has hardly been gripped by the European election campaign. Voting intentions have mostly remained stable since April. A week before the election, voters remain uninterested and relatively undecided. This is probably the reason behind the differences in the forecasts published this week by the various polling institutes. This also means that these last polls -- any new poll is forbidden as of yesterday -- do not necessarily reflect the results of the 12 June election. Surprises are always possible in a 20-list election which should be affected by a high abstention rate. Not to mention the fact that many voters (40 percent according to the latest IFOP [French Public Opinion Institute] survey) may change their mind by election day. According to SOFRES [French Public Opinion Polling Company], the participation rate would be 53 percent. However, no one denies the possibility that the record abstention figure registered for a European election may be broken on 12 June: In 1989, the participation rate was 49.35 of registered voters. Indeed, the proportion of respondents who stated they were interested in the European election is lower than it was five years ago (54 percent as compared to 56 percent). As usual, potential abstentions are found mainly within younger and less affluent stratas of the population. Only one list seems to be benefiting from any real campaign momentum: that of Philippe de Villiers ["The Other Europe," anti-Maastricht list]. Voting intentions in its favor increased relatively steadily, from 4 or 5 percent in April to 7 percent in the latest BVA [Brulle Ville Associates] survey, 8.5 percent in the SOFRES poll, and even 10 percent in the IFOP survey. (Footnote 1) (BVA-France/Europe-1 survey from 1 to 3 June among 1,514 respondents. IFOP/JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE survey on 2 and 3 June among 818 respondents. SOFRES/TF-1 survey on 2 and 3 June among 1,000 respondents.) Mr. de Villiers' list is expected to pass easily the 5-percent threshold for entry into the European Parliament. It has succeeded in winning over many right-wing voters who opposed the Maastricht Treaty. It achieves its best results among older and nonsalaried RPR [Rally for the Republic] voters. Its supporters seem to be determined enough to confirm their voting intention on election day. Those who should be smiling on the evening of 12 June may even include Bernard Tapie ["Radical Energy," leftist list]. The latest polls credit him with 8 percent (BVA), 8,5 percent (SOFRES), or 9 percent (IFOP) of voting intentions. His MRG [Left Radical Movement] list no longer seems to be slipping, as was the case in late May. Mr. Tapie may benefit from his debate with [National Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen, in which he mostly had the upper hand. However, he may be among the main victims of a high abstention rate, since his electorate (young and blue collar workers) encompasses those categories that are the most likely to abstain. Competition from the "Sarajevo" list may also rob him of a few percentage points. The politician that stands to lose the most in this European election is Michel Rocard. Hindered by the presence of the Tapie and Chevenement ["Alternative Policy"] lists, his Socialist list is likely to fare particularly badly if polls are anything to go by: 14 percent (IFOP), 15 percent (CSA) [expansion unknown], 16 percent (BVA), or 16.5 percent (SOFRES). (These statistics, as those mentioned above, take into account the "Sarajevo" list led by Leon Schwartzenberg [which was withdrawn last week].) The Socialist Party is not even certain to improve on its disastrous result of the March 1993 parliamentary election (17.6 percent of votes). Truth be told, European elections have always been a tough test for the Socialists. The other "major list" headed by Dominique Baudis [majority's "Union" list] is less affected by electorate fragmentation. With 29 percent (SOFRES), 32 percent (IFOP), and 33 percent (BVA) of voting intentions, it falls short of the 39 percent of votes won by the UDF [French Democratic Union]-RPR coalition in the latest parliamentary election. It has been the main victim of the increasing success of Philippe de Villiers' list. At the outset of the campaign, some polling institutes saw Mr. Baudis' list pull in over 35 percent of votes. The latest polls give results perilously close to those of the list headed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1989 (28.8 percent). And anything below 33 percent would be a failure for the majority, which a year ago managed to conquer about four seats out of five in the National Assembly. Polls predict a relatively stable showing for the National Front. Anticipated results for Jean-Marie Le Pen's list are highly consistent: 10 percent (BVA) or 11 percent (SOFRES and IFOP) of voting intentions. The far Right would thus achieve results roughly similar to those of the 1989 European election (11.8 percent). The National Front's declining influence in the media does not prevent it from benefiting from the continued support of an electorate whose loyalty it managed to secure. The Communist list led by Francis Wurtz is credited with 5.5 percent (IFOP), 6.5 percent (SOFRES), or 7 percent (BVA) of voting intentions. The French Communist Party [PCF] would thus do no better than in the 1989 European election, when its list was headed by Philippe Herzog (7.7 percent of votes). The European election has traditionally been a difficult one for the Communists, who suffer, among other things, from abstention among the working classes. Polls indicate that the PCF is in an electoral stagnation phase, if not in one of decline. Jean-Pierre Chevenement may be in for a nasty shock on Sunday. With 2 percent (BVA), 2.5 percent (IFOP), and 3.5 percent (SOFRES) of voting intentions, his list is unlikely to clear the critical 5 percent mark. Moreover, voters attracted to this list are highly likely to change their mind. Mr. Chevenement cannot seem to attract "left-wing grumblers" the way Mr. de Villiers does "right-wing rebels." As for the Greens [list led by Marie-Anne Isler-Beguin], their position is just as serious. Credited with 1.5 percent (BVA), 2 percent (IFOP), or 3 percent (SOFRES), they are likely to suffer a veritable electoral rout. In 1989, they scored 10.6 percent of votes! They may even be humiliated by Brice Lalonde's ["Ecology Generation") list: Voting intentions for it are 2.5 percent (BVA) and 3 percent (SOFRES), but also 5 percent (IFOP). The environmentalist movement as a whole is likely to pay for its divisions by being kicked out of the European Parliament. Last is the unknown quantity that is the "Sarajevo" list. The about-face of its initiators complicate the job for pollsters. The latest surveys give 2 percent (IFOP), 3 percent (SOFRES), and 3.5 percent (BVA) of voting intentions to the list led by Leon Schwartzenberg. There is a possibility that it may fare less well than the list led by Andre Goustat ("Hunting, Fishing, Nature, and Tradition" list], which is credited with 2 percent (IFOP) to 2.5 percent (BVA and SOFRES) of voting intentions.
