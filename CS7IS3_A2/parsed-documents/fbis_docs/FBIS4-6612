"I think political reform has not been completed and there also are tax and economic reforms" to be accomplished, Hosokawa told reporters. "We have many problems... but all of us decided to support him (Hata) and to hold out," he said. Two weeks after Hosokawa abruptly announced his resignation over his allegedly shady financial deals, the ruling coalition officially chose Hata on Friday as its candidate for the premiership election in the Diet on Monday. Hosokawa had been under fire over allegations he had raised funds in dubious ways via a 100 million yen loan from scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group and purchase of shares of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. Sadatoshi Ozato, Diet Affairs Committee chairman of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said the LDP will continue grilling Hosokawa about his financial deals after he quits. The LDP is considering demanding that the Diet summon Hosokawa after his resignation to testify on his transactions, Ozato said. Ozato said suspicions about Hosokawa's finances deepened when the premier's aide said Friday that Hosokawa had failed to report to tax authorities his personal income of 29 million yen from stock and bond investments during a 10-year period from 1981. Hosokawa told reporters he had no intention of evading taxes and simply failed to report the income. He reiterated he will not resign as a House of Representatives legislator or head of Japan New Party, saying he is stepping down as premier to take responsibility for his personal finances.
