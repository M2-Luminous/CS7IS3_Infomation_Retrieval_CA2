Considering the serious and urgent nature of these documents, as well as certain special features of the present situation in Russia, we are citing them in full. Yu. Skokov had previously already carried on negotiations with the prime minister and the closest assistants of the president with respect to questions of guaranteeing the interests of domestic commodity producers. These discussions were held in a constructive spirit. It is not difficult to observe that certain provisions of the appeal of the FTR Council to the government were utilized in Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly. Appeal of the Council of the Federation of the Commodity Producers of Russia to the Government of the Russian Federation The Second Congress of the commodity producers of Russia, which took place in December 1993, defined the basic problems of domestic commodity production and formulated the immediate and strategic goals of the association of commodity producers. The position of the commodity producers with respect to questions of their cooperation with organs of state power is stated and demands regarding the creation of conditions ensuring such cooperation expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of Commodity Producers adopted at the congress. The indicated declaration was sent to the Government of the Russian Federation. On the instructions of the Congress the Council of the Federation of Commodity Producers considers it necessary to direct the attention of the government to the fact that the growth of negative processes in the sphere of commodity production which is going on at the present time threatens to cause a chain reaction of dramatic social, political and economic consequences. Tension in the economy has reached a critical point. Forced large-scale open and hidden unemployment can become the powerful detonator of a social explosion, since the state is not in a position to guarantee the protection of the basic social rights of the unemployed and there is no law regulating the relations of the unemployed with the state and fixing the duties and obligations of the state in relation to a person who has to all intents and purposes become a hostage of irresponsible experiments and political games. It is necessary, finally, to honestly say that the basic cause of the developing inflation is the catastrophic drop in commodity production. The methods of struggling with inflation being practiced can only lead to the complete collapse of the economy. The means of regulating the economy being proposed are inadequate for the state of the national economy and have led to the fracturing of the resources and commodities markets and those of financial and industrial capital, and to investment and payments crises. As a result complete collapse threatens the economy and disintegration and chaos the state. The Council of the Federation of Commodity Producers: --proposes that the Government of the Russian Federation conclude an agreement defining the procedure for the implementation of the Declaration of the Rights of Commodity Producers and the cooperation of the parties in developing a coordinated position in the tactics and strategy of the further reformation of the economy; --considers immediate consultations of the chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation with the chairman of the Federation of the Commodity Producers of Russia for the purpose of discussing and adopting an agreement and a joint plan of actions to be necessary; --insists on the promulgation by the government of a precise plan of actions for stabilizing the economy and preventing the destruction of technological and intellectual potentials; --considers it advisable for the agreement to be discussed in labor collectives and implemented in cooperation with the heads of administrations, regional unions of commodity producers and interregional associations for the economic cooperation of the subjects of the Federation. If the government does not see the need for a joint search for ways to get out of the crisis and for securing a qualitatively new system of interrelations with commodity producers, then the Federation Council thinks that the government has a right to reach such a decision. However, it should be kept in mind that the economic reforms begun in the name of democracy and a better life for the citizens of Russia should not become the next tragedy in the country's history, which imposes a special responsibility in relation to the people and to history on all who have taken the levers of power into their hands. The draft of an agreement of the Government of the Russian Federation with the Federation of Commodity Producers is attached. On the instructions of the Council of the Federation of the Commodity Producers of Russia Chairman of the Federation of the Commodity Producers of Russia Yu. Skokov Draft Agreement on the Cooperation of the Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia Recognizing the need to combine the efforts of the Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia for the purpose of: --formulating a stable system of commodity production and a stage-by-stage large-scale restructuring of Russia's economy on new principles and creating a balanced national economy on this basis; --retaining strategic and work-available resources, including the country's scientific-technical and technologicial potential; --setting up a national self-developing market oriented to the domestic commodity producer and creating new forms for the self-organization of commodity producers on the regional and interregional levels; --realistically achieving the social guarantees of all subjects of commodity production; --creating an effective system for the cooperation of the Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia in implementing economic transformations in the country secured by procedures for the coordination of the interests, principles, and procedures of joint actions; the Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia conclude the following agreement: Article 1 The Government of the Russian Federation recognizes the "Declaration of the Rights of the Commodity Producers of the Russian Federation" as one of the basic documents when developing the strategic course of economic reforms and the methods of its implementation.
