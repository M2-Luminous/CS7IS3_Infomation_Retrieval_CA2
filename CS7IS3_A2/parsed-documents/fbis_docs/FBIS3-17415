He told a meeting at the Moscow Institute of International Relations that behind those rumors was the wish to present the president and his people as a nest of vipers and make room for the arrival of new people. Shakhray believes that current political life is defined by a clash between the economic and political elites, above all between the Moscow, regional and industrial elites. Moreover, the regional and industrial elites seem to have united in the struggle against the Moscow elite which, he said, has concentrated 702000070040f Russia's capital in Moscow banks. Also, there are clashes between so-called speculative bourgeoisie which exports Russian raw materials, and national bourgeoisie which concentrates on Russian industry. Both of these elites are opposed to one another, which is extremely dangerous, too, said Shakhray. He stated that the Party of Russian Unity and Concord was among the initiators of the State Duma's resolution on political amnesty. He believes that the amnesty prevented a strong clash between the elites in April and May. Society has been given a breather at least until next autumn, said Shakhray. Speaking about the next presidential elections, Shakhray said that he would not run for presidency.
