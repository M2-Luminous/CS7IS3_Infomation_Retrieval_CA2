At a weekend [9-10 April] meeting in Athens the economics and financial politicians of the European Union [EU], who are oriented toward stability, even ignored the inclination of the summit to permit the Commission to go to the capital markets and to drastically increase the financing of the European Investment Bank [EIB], which is already rising rapidly. In the British delegation the catchword of a "new realism" in the EU was spreading, even though London Finance Secretary Kenneth Clarke did not claim to have coined this expression. Nevertheless, if Clarke and his Bonn counterpart Theo Waigel, as well as the central bank heads of the hard currency countries have their say, the time of great visions and, above all, of costly projects is over in the EU. In Athens the Commission wanted to ensure that the EIB is permitted to expand substantially the financing of cross-border transportation routes via the capital market, going even beyond the current, already considerable amount. The officials from Brussels spoke of about DM400 billion by the end of the decade. Apart from that, the Commission hoped to get authorization to raise loans in its own name, for the time being for DM16 billion per year. In December the summit ordered the finance ministers to benevolently examine whether the EU has need for additional financing. Waigel, however, noted categorically in Athens that such a need does not exist. The economics and financial politicians from Bonn are determined to prevent the Commission from going to the capital markets, because then, they are afraid, Brussels would open a second large-scale subsidy economy in excess of the already quite considerable EU budget. Waigel also questioned the connection between the investments in the "trans-European networks," which were outlined by the Commission, and economic growth. This connection had been established by Commission President Jacques Delors in the "White Paper on Growth, Employment, and Competitiveness." In Athens it also became clear that a vision like the monetary union cannot be designed on the drawing board and carried out like a construction project, as was attempted in the Maastricht Treaty. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer stressed that the majority of the member states are meanwhile pursuing a policy of stability outside the rules of the European Monetary System (EMS), since the EMS is practically no longer in force as a result of the 30-percent expansion of the exchange rate fluctuation ranges. However, it is still considered to be the business foundation of the monetary union in line with the Maastricht Treaty. No Central Bank Function Furthermore, Tietmeyer stresses that no member state has so far entrusted currency reserves to the European Monetary Institute (EMI). He once again made it clear that the institute, which was founded in Frankfurt at the beginning of the year, must not interpret the Maastricht Treaty expansively, which means it should not exercise any function that is similar to that of a central bank. It has to limit itself to the technical preparation of the future European central bank. Tietmeyer indicated that the EMI is not really the germinating cell of a future European central bank, but will remain a "think tank." In Athens it became clear that, in the end, it is those countries that unite for the monetary union which, independent of the Maastricht Treaty, have developed a strong currency on their own and come together in the common interest.
