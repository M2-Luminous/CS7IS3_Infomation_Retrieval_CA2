But Russia has recently indicated to the West that the settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue is impossible without Russian participation. As a traditional ally of the Serbs on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, Russia has always objected to armed threats from the West against the Serbs. After NATO's announcement of its ultimatum against the Serbs, some Russian officials made threats, saying that if NATO really carried out air attacks, a crisis would break out in the relationship between Russia and the West. Worrying about Russia's possible use of its veto in the UN Security Council, the United States insisted that NATO's ultimatum should conform with the relevant UN resolution. When diplomats from the 16 NATO countries discussed and decided the ultimatum, no one thought of notifying NATO's decision to Russia. Russian President Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Kozyrev were "extremely unhappy" about this. Thus, a "crisis" occurred in the relationship between Russia and the West. Under such circumstances, German Chancellor Kohl insisted on the need to take into account Russian efforts for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, regardless of U.S. objections. German mediation facilitated Russian influence on the Serbs and played a major role in preventing NATO from implementing its planned air attacks. The U.S. and Russian stand on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue began to change from antagonism to cooperation. On 17 February, Serbian leader Karadzic, and Churkin, the special Russian envoy on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, reached an agreement under which both sides agreed that Russia should send peacekeeping troops to Sarajevo, while the Serbs would withdraw their heavy weapons from the areas surrounding Sarajevo or would let UN troops control these weapons. Thus, the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis began a turn for the better. As reported, Russia did not inform the United States before it announced its agreement with the Serbs. Despite its dissatisfaction over what Russia had done, the United States could not but praise in public that Russia had made an "important contribution." When the Serbs began to withdraw their heavy weapons from the Sarajevo area, on the one hand Churkin claimed that the turn for the better in the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation was due to Russian efforts; on the other hand, he continued to criticize the West for threatening air attacks, while the United States attributed the change in the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation to NATO's "determination" and "leading role" of the United States. In the last few months, the United States and Russia have time and again engaged in disputes over major issues. At the end of last year, the U.S. Government considered accepting former nations of the Warsaw Treaty as NATO members, with the exception of the former Soviet Union. This evoked strong dissatisfaction in Russia. To alleviate its contradictions with Russia, the Clinton administration introduced a transitional "peaceful partnership" program. Not long after Clinton's visit to Moscow in January, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev stressed that Russia would maintain its military presence in the Baltic Sea. Obviously, this ran counter to the Russian commitment to withdraw its troops from the Baltic as soon as possible--a commitment made to Clinton while he was in Moscow. For this reason, the United States reacted strongly and demanded a Russian explanation. These disputes between the United States and Russia are not accidental. The United States has always been wary of developments in Russia, and its diplomatic strategy hopes that Russia will play a role which corresponds with U.S. intentions. Although Russia is experiencing economic difficulties and its international position is declining, it is not willing to act as a "co-star" in international affairs. This is even more the case when something involves its strategic interests.
