Havana Province, second only to Havana City Province, has a network of 470 aqueducts. The largest water supply problem is in Madruga Municipality and conditions are slated to improve in Santa Cruz del Norte Municipality. Despite increased efforts over the last year, and the help which the agriculture sector has provided to the schools, the main problems are found in boarding schools, where 54 pumps are in bad shape, with 29 of them no longer functioning at all. In order to alleviate this problem, Havana's school board established a program keyed towards installing water systems in those schools.
