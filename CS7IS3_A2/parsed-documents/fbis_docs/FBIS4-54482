Here is a report by Senada Cumurovic: [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] At the beginning of the radio link Sead Ohranovic said that it is mostly calm in Gorazde today although there are some chetnik provocations. A fighter of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was killed by a sniper bullet. [Ohranovic] Well, the chetniks have not withdrawn [words indistinct] 3 km and, in a way, we in Gorazde are not satisfied. There is now the problem, and an acute problem at that, of (?water), food, all that comes in the wake of the situation in which we find ourselves, and particularly the accommodation problem. [Cumurovic] This is how Ohranovic commented on the recent statement by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] spokesman Eric Chaperon that our forces fired on UNPROFOR. [Ohranovic] These reports are in no way correct. The chetniks have recently been using some ammunition, that is, explosive ammunition that has [words indistinct] to shoot behind one's back. Therefore, this is not true, and our forces are still positioned along the lines on which they were [words indistinct] the UN forces. It is exclusively members of the chetnik forces who are carrying out provocations in this area. [Cumurovic] As regards weapons, even after the ultimatum expired, the chetniks did not withdraw their artillery from the 20-km zone. As Ohranovic put it, there is confirmation that there is still some aggressor heavy artillery at Jabucko Sedlo, (Miljan), Mount Kozara, at the foot of Mount Kozara, and on the roads leading from (?Foca) and Pale. As regards the humanitarian situation, the food supplies are somewhat improved. [Ohranovic] However, the greatest problems that the citizens of Gorazde are now facing are is the accommodation of the population that has been streaming from the occupied regions into the town and the problem of water. We are seeking the best solutions here and are insisting that the international organizations help solve the problem. The International Red Cross has tried to do something and has brought some equipment to supply at least the hospital with drinking water, that is, water for cleaning. However, the problem of the entire town has still not been solved. We are working together with the international organizations to solve the problem, but this is nevertheless going slowly. Gorazde's people are having a real problem with water and are using the murky waters of the River Drina. [Cumurovic] Thanks to the packages of the International Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres, the supplies of Gorazde and its hospitals with medicines have been improved, Dr. Alija Begovic said. However, he indicated a major health problem. [Begovic] It seems that we are facing an epidemic of infectious hepatitis. We already have several cases of it in different parts of the town. In such unhygienic conditions, this will be fatal if something is not done urgently. [Cumurovic] In three days, 265 wounded people have been evacuated from Gorazde but the need for further evacuation is still great. At this moment, UNPROFOR teams are visiting villages in the commune in order to transport people to Gorazde and then further on. Besides, in the town itself, 400 to 500 wounded people are awaiting evacuation, Dr. Begovic said. Journalists have wanted to know about the situation in the villages of (Zupcici) and [name indistinct] where the aggressor has brought in Serbian people. This is what Ohranovic had to say about this: [Ohranovic] Yes, Serbian people have been settled in these villages that you mentioned. They are now living there under the excuse that these are their flats and their houses. [words indistinct] UNPROFOR to solve this problem but they have not helped us. [Cumurovic] Apart from the civilians, so-called Serbian police have been deployed in (Zupcici) and [name indistinct]. In fact, what is involved are aggressor's soldiers who had been destroying Gorazde and who have now just changed uniforms. At the end of the radio bridge, Ohranovic said that the security situation in Gorazde has nevertheless been stabilizing. A curfew between 2100 to 0400 has been introduced and life is returning to normal. [end recording]
