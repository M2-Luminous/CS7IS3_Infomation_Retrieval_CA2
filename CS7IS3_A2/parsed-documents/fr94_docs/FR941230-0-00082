FR941230-0-00082 FR941230-0-00017 Comment: The minority report opposing the regulatory amendment stated that the Council's Stock Assessment Panel (SAP) and Council staff repeatedly noted inaccuracies in the data sets, particularly the age-length keys. As a result, the stock assessment has a high level of uncertainty that was not considered by the Council at its September 1994 meeting in discussing the need for a 43-percent reduction from 1993 harvest levels. The minority report also noted that a Council member described his own analysis of the available data that indicated a 15-inch (38.1 cm) size limit, combined with a six- or seven-fish bag limit, would achieve a 43-percent reduction in recreational harvest. A letter from a charter vessel and headboat association claimed that the NMFS data are inaccurate and that the red snapper resource is in much better condition than suggested by the analyses. Response: The NMFS stock assessment has undergone extensive peer review. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (Center) and the Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) found that the assessment is based on the best available scientific information. NMFS concludes that the issues raised in the minority report do not change the conclusions reached by the assessment. However, NMFS agrees with the need to continually update the stock assessment data base used in formulating management decisions. Appropriate updates to the data base will be made as warranted. NMFS is aware that the current virtual population analysis (VPA) utilizes catch by age, by assigning ages at length, and is initiating research that will result in improved age information for the VPA. In the interim, the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires use of the best available scientific information, which is the NMFS assessment. The alternative analysis by a Council member was not accepted at the meeting as being based on the best available scientific information. NMFS concludes that the referenced alternative analysis did not account for changes in mean weight, increases in the number of participants in the fishery, or non-compliance with the regulations. Comment: The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment also noted that preliminary harvest estimates for 1994 were discussed by the Council as an indication that recreational harvest rates are increasing. However, these estimates were based on only 6 months of data and probably are not indicative of the whole year. There have been increases in numbers and size of red snapper landings for 4 years, which show that the resource is not stressed. Response: The increases in the number and size of red snapper are expected and indicate that the resource is recovering, but the stock assessment shows that the stock remains overfished. The stock assessment also shows that unless the recreational harvest is constrained to its allocation, the prescribed recovery schedule will not be achieved. The status of the overfished resource will continue to be updated as more complete harvest data become available. Comment: The Council minority report opposing the regulatory amendment claimed that new information indicates that red snapper may live longer than originally assumed, possibly as long as 55 years. This information indicates the generation time and recovery period could be extended, allowing a less restrictive allowable catch level. Moreover, drastic changes in the red snapper measures are inappropriate, given the current recovery schedule. Response: NMFS assessment scientists have recently evaluated the effect of changes in generation time on red snapper recovery periods. This evaluation was based on newly acquired information and was presented to the Council and its Reef Fish Management Committee during their November 1994 meetings. In response, the Council requested that the SAP and SSC review these analyses. These efforts are designed to enable the Council to make objective, risk-adverse decisions. In the interim, however, red snapper management decisions must be accomplished using the best available scientific information.
