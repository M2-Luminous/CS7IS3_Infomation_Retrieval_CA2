Mergers required to register in a simplified form (details omitted) Section 2. Classification standards in administrative procedures for regular registration of mergers -- mergers corresponding to any of the following categories will be subject to vigorous examination. These categories are set for the purpose of classifying and inspecting cases which may violate the Antimonopoly Law, but cases fitting the description of the following categories do not necessarily mean that they actually violate the Antimonopoly Law. (1) The market share of the merger will either be: 1) Above 25 percent; 2) more than 15 percent and will be number one in the market; and 3) number one in the market, and will lead the number two and three groups by more than one-fourth of the total share of the merger. (2) The market share of the merger will be number one, two, or three in the market, and the total share of the top three groups will be more than 50 percent. (3) There will only be seven or fewer groups competing in the market. (4) Either one of the merging partners has total assets of more than 100 billion yen, and the total assets of the other partner are over 10 billion yen. Section 3. Factors to be taken into consideration when examining merger applications -- a final decision will be made by taking comprehensive factors into consideration, depending on whether the form of the merger is horizontal, vertical, or mixed. (1) Horizontal mergers -- mergers that may be questionable under the Antimonopoly Law are mainly horizontal mergers; in such cases, 1) below will be given the most importance, a) under 2) will be given secondary consideration, and b) to d) under 2) will be of a supplementary nature. 1) Market share after the merger -- market share after the merger, the resulting overall position of advantage in the market, and its relative position compared to its competitors; and a comparison of these three factors to that before the merger to see the degree of change; and import volume will of course be taken into consideration. 2) The situation of competition in the market where the merger will be doing business -- past trends and future plans will both be taken into consideration: a) The situation of competition in the market concerned. b) Business conditions in the market concerned. c) Overall business capability of the merger. d) The nature and environment of the market concerned. (2) Vertical mergers -- in principle, factors to be considered for vertical mergers are similar to those cited for horizontal mergers, with the following included as additional considerations: 1) Degree of closedness of the market concerned. 2) Degree by which barriers to market participation are increasing. (3) Mixed mergers -- for mixed mergers, in addition to factors cited for horizontal mergers, the following will also be taken into consideration: 1) Potential competitiveness among the merging groups. 2) Position of advantage after the merger. 3) Degree by which barriers to market participation are increasing. Section 4. Shortening of restriction period -- Japanese companies cannot enter a merger less than 30 days after a merger application is filed. However, cases satisfying the following conditions will have a shorter period of restriction: 1) When it is evident that competition will not be restricted as a result of the merger. 2) When there are valid reasons to shorten the period of restriction.
