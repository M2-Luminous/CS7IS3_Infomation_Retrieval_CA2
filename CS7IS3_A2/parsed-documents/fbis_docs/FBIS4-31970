FBIS4-31970 "dreeu117_c_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC _O_Review of Military Developments _O_Review of Military Developments 94P20872A 94P20872A CSO [Editorial Report] Several recent Czech periodical articles have provided information on developments in the Czech defense industry. New Military Jet Victor Kucera, research and development director of the Czech aircraft manufacturer Aero Vodochody, provided details on his company's new L-159 multipurpose light combat aircraft in an interview published in the 19 April issue of the military journal A REPORT. Kucera said that the L-159 will come in one- and two-seat versions, both with good fuel economy, advanced avionics, and the capability of operating over chemically contaminated terrain. The L-159 prototype is slated for production in 1996, and the aircraft is scheduled to be available for delivery by the end of 1998. The initial manufacturing run is estimated to be about 100 aircraft, most of which will be acquired by the Czech Air Force. The plane will meet international criteria, including NATO compatibility, and will be available for export. Its maintenance and operational procedures, weapon systems, and ammunition will correspond fully to Western standards. Kucera noted that the L-159 is a substantial upgrade of Aero Vodochody's proven L-59 series. Even though the L-159 will reach a maximum speed of only Mach 0.82, due to construction techniques and a wing design that facilitate cheap and rapid production, the new plane, according to Kucera, should perform better than the MiG-21 and the MiG-23. The L-159 will not be very well suited to dogfights, but it will have strong defensive capabilities, including multipurpose radar and the most modern passive and active defense protection available. Kucera described the L-159 as being very similar to the British HAWK aircraft. He said that four L-159's will cost no more than one U.S. F-16. Defense Procurement Contracts The efforts of the Czech armed forces to modernize and achieve NATO compatibility have led the Czech Defense Ministry to seek bids by suppliers of various types of military hardware. According to the 19 May issue of the Prague daily LIDOVE NOVINY, approximately 40 companies are currently competing for contracts. Requests for proposals have been issued for an all-terrain vehicle (for which Mercedes is competing with the U.S. Jeep Corporation and Prague-based Avia), a new combat aircraft (for which the Czech company Aero Vodochody is developing a prototype), guided missiles (for which the French firm Matra is seen as the primary bidder), infantry weapons (pitting the Czech Arms Plants [Ceska Zbrojovka] against the Swiss firm SIG), tractors (which may be obtained from Tatra), and communications systems (which Italy's Marconi and Germany's Dornier would like to provide). LIDOVE NOVINY notes that the big sums involved in large-scale defense procurement have raised the issue of potential bribery. The paper writes that, while some Defense ministry officials dismiss this possibility, other ministry employees claim that the first signs have already appeared in the form of expensive restaurant-bill payments by representatives of defense contractors. The new chief of Army logistics, Frantisek Veprek, told LIDOVE NOVINY that even such behavior by procurement officials is unacceptable. As an example of measures that have been taken to forestall bribery attempts, Veprek pointed to the division of labor among three offices that work on contract bids: one prepares contracts for bids, another evaluates bids, and a third approves proposals. Foreign Training Approved The Czech parliament has approved a government proposal that would allow Czech Army units to be sent to foreign countries for training and, conversely, allow foreign military units to train with the Czech armed forces in the Czech Republic, according to the 30 April RUDE PRAVO. The liaison training will be limited to 30 days and 700 troops for Czech units traveling to foreign countries, and foreign units in the Czech Republic are to be limited to a stay of 21 days and are not to exceed 5,000 troops at any one time. New Generals SVOBODNE SLOVO of 9 May reported that President Vaclav Havel has promoted three Army officers to the rank of general. Ladislav Kozler, chief of the Defense Ministry Foreign Relations Department, and Josef Dufek, commander of the 4th Air Defense Corps, were named major generals, while Colonel Rostislav til, the commander of Czech troops detailed to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia, was given the brevet rank of major general for the duration of his service with UNPROFOR.
