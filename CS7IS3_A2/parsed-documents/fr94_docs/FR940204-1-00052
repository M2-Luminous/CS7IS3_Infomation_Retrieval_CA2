FR940204-1-00052 FR940204-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 4 Definition of ``Passenger'' for Purpose of the Coastwise Laws AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Withdrawal of proposed changes of position. SUMMARY: This document withdraws proposed changes of position with respect to the definition of the term ``passenger'' for purpose of the coastwise passenger statute. Customs has concluded that it is not appropriate to change its position at this time inasmuch as it will consider changing the definition of passenger contained in 19 CFR 4.50(b) as part of a proposed revision to 19 CFR part 4 which will occur as a result of the recent enactment of title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act the ``Customs Modernization Act''). EFFECTIVE DATE: February 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerry O'Brien, Office of Regulations and Rulings, Carrier Rulings Branch, 202&hyph;482&hyph;6940. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 14, 1991, Customs published a notice in the Federal Register (56 FR 40283) proposing to change its position with respect to the definition of ``passenger'' for purposes of the coastwise passenger statute (46 U.S.C. App. 289). Customs stated that it was considering the revocation of its position that: (a) Persons transported free of charge as an inducement for patronage or good will are not passengers; and (b) persons transported free of charge who are less than substantially connected with the operation, navigation, ownership, or business of a vessel are not passengers. The effect of these proposed changes of position would have been that persons considered to be passengers as a result of the changes could not have been transported between coastwise points or in the coastwise trade unless they were transported in United States coastwise-qualified vessels. The proposed changes of position would not have effected any actual change to the specific wording of the definition of passenger contained in 19 CFR 4.50(b). Customs will consider proposing an amendment to the definition of passenger in 19 CFR 4.50(b) as part of a proposed revision to its vessel regulations which Customs expects will occur as a result of the recent enactment of title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103&hyph;182; the ``Customs Modernization Act''). In view of the enactment of the Customs Modernization Act, and the many regulatory changes which will occur as a result, Customs believes that it is not appropriate to go forward with the proposed changes of position at this time. Accordingly, the proposal is withdrawn. George J. Weise, Commissioner of Customs. Approved: December 30, 1993. John P. Simpson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
