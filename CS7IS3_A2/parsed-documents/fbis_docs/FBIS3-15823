Filatov told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [9 March] that indeed he met Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's representatives during his latest visit to the North Caucasus. At that meeting Filatov expressed Russia's viewpoint on the necessity to sign with Chechnya a powers-sharing treaty as it had been done with Russia's another ethnic Republic of Tatarstan. But no response from Dudayev has followed as yet, Filatov said.
