All four of the wage index options significantly reduce the number of boundary problems, as seen in Table F. Not only would the number of boundary problems be reduced, but the boundary problems that do remain would be smaller, especially for the M50 wage indexes where the average difference is 0.067 for both the simple and refined reclassification methods. As indicated in Table E, these wage index options produce wage index values that would more closely resemble a hospital's own wage level, as was expected. Table G demonstrates that the new reclassification methods would likely affect a larger number of hospitals than the current system. Whereas in the current system, we estimated that only 362 hospitals qualify for the wage index reclassification, under the M25 wage index the simpler reclassification method would lead to 411 hospitals being adjusted to their nearest neighbors' average hourly wage. The refined reclassification method under the M25 wage index would make it possible for 250 hospitals to use the nearest neighbors' average hourly wage, 161 hospitals to use both the nearest neighbors' average hourly wage and hours weight, and 110 hospitals to use just the nearest neighbors' hours weight. We show the effects the four new options would have when compared to the estimated 1995 post-reclassified system against the current 1994 pre- reclassified values in Table H. We plan to continue our evaluation of these new wage index options in the coming months and are soliciting public comment. We will continue to accept comments on these wage index refinements until August 31, 1994. We will respond to these comments in the FY 1996 prospective payment system proposed rule. Comments on this issue should be sent to: Lana Price, Director; Division of Hospital Payment Policy; 1&hyph;H&hyph;1 East Low Rise; 6325 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, Maryland 21207. While we believe the alternatives discussed above offer much promise with respect to refining the hospital wage index, we do not believe that sections 1886(d)(2), (3) and (8) of the Act authorize a hospital-specific wage index scheme that combines each hospital's own wages and the wages of other hospitals in its MSA or Statewide rural area using different hour weights. Moreover, the MGCRB provisions under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act contemplate wage index reclassifications from one area to another that cannot be reasonably implemented consistent with these alternatives. Therefore, before we could implement these alternatives, legislative changes would be necessary to allow the Secretary greater flexibility in refining the hospital wage index. Again, we invite public comments on these issues by August 31, 1994, so that we may consider them in our continuing evaluation of wage index refinements.
