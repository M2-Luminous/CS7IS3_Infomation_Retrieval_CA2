This is a "milestone in trade policy," Rexrodt said in a government statement delivered in the Bundestag on Friday [22 April]. Thus, the average customs rate for trade with industrial goods will decline from 6.3 to 3.9 percent. Particularly successful is the agreement about the liberalization of services. Here Germany, as the largest exporter of services, benefits most since services alone amount to one-quarter of Germany's overall exports. In this field are working one-third of the 7 million people employed in exports. Rexrodt affirmed his intention to bring the GATT follow-up institute, the World Trade Organization, WTO, to Bonn. However, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland are also interested in being the headquarters of the new international organization. According to the economics minister, tasks still remaining for liberalization are the opening up of financial services and ocean traffic, and a multilateral steel agreement. On behalf of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Uwe Jens stated that the agreement comes more than one year too late. What is urgently needed is, above all, an active labor market policy in Germany in order to push ahead with reducing unemployment and promoting employment.
