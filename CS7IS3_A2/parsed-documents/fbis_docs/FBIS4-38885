This was stated by Syarhey Kalyakin, secretary of the PKB Central Committee, at a news conference held by the PKB leadership. According to Kalyakin, Vasil Novikaw will participate in the first round of the elections -- this has been decided by the PKB Central Committee. Kalyakin also noted that "if the situation changes, it will not be ruled out that Novikaw could form a bloc with one of the following three candidates -- Kebich, Dubko, or Lukashenka. Such a bloc is by no means possible with Paznyak or Shushkevich. Commenting on the slogan of his presidential campaign -- "To return to the people that which they have been deprived" -- Vasil Novikaw stated that "in the first place, it is necessary to restore social guarantees and rights which were achieved during the Soviet period. It is necessary to return to a great, powerful state, great friendship among the people, and real people's democracy." The presidential candidate called the presidency "a foreign body in Slav civilization" and noted that given a victory of left forces at the presidential and parliamentary elections, it would be quite possible to propose eliminating the presidency. Novikaw stated that as of today, he has almost completed his team for changing the current government in the event of his election victory. However, according to Novikaw, even now, the government includes "specialists and honest people whom we know and will keep at their posts."
