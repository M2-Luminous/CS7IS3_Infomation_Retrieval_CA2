FR940610-0-00127 FR940610-0-00023 (c) Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred after December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983. Except as otherwise provided in §25.2512&hyph;5(b), the present value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions transferred after December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983, is the present value of such interests determined under this section. If the interest to be valued is dependent upon the continuation or termination of one or more lives or upon a term certain concurrent with one or more lives, the factor for the present value is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 6 percent a year, compounded annually, and life contingencies determined for each male and female life involved, from the values that are set forth in Table LN. Table LN contains values that are taken from the life table for total males and the life table for total females appearing as Tables 2 and 3, respectively, in United States Life Tables: 1959&hyph;61, published by the Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service. Table LN and accompanying factors are set forth in former §25.2512&hyph;9 (as contained in the 26 CFR Part 25 edition revised as of April 1, 1994). Special factors involving one and two lives may be found in or computed with the use of tables contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication 723, entitled ``Actuarial Values I: Valuation of Last Survivor Charitable Remainders'' (12&hyph;70), and Internal Revenue Service Publication 723A, entitled ``Actuarial Values II: Factors at 6 Percent Involving One and Two Lives'' (12&hyph;70). These publications are no longer available for purchase from the Superintendent of Documents. However, a copy of each may be obtained from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS Publication 723/723A), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. The present value of an interest measured by a term of years is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 6 percent a year. Par. 29.
