"According to present information, insufficient care was taken by the organisers of the march to prevent violence and to discipline participants," Mr de Klerk said in a statement in Pretoria. "There can be no excuse at this critical stage in the political process for provocative and potentially violent actions such as we have seen today (Monday). It not only endangers the elections and reform process, but also the very fabric of society," he said. Mr de Klerk called on all political leaders to exercise control and restraint over their followers, to ensure there was no repetition of Monday's events and to avoid any action which could lead to violence. "The time has arrived for the urgent consideration -- by the Transitional Executive Council, government, the Independent Electoral Commission and others -- of additional measures or steps which can prevent a repetition of what has happened today and on recent similar occasions. The government intends discussing these matters with the relevant institutions. Obviously, such measures or steps should not prevent political parties from campaigning peacefully and democratically," he said. He expressed his condolences to the families of the dead.
