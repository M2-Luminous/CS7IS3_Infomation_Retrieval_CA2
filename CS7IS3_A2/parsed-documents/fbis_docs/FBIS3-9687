The meeting took place at the level of chairmen and deputy chairmen of the coalition parties and movements. Representatives of the Hungarian Coalition took part in it as well. At a short, improvised news conference held this evening, we learned the following about the Coalition Council meeting: [Moravcik] "We have discussed only one theme so far, and that is the preparation of the government policy statement. It is indeed a very serious matter, with the economic program in its focus. "As you know, the talks on a standby loan were suspended because the previous government was unable to accept the conditions that were set additionally. So far, economic development has been different from what was envisaged when the budget was drafted. It means that our starting points now are worse than the starting points of the previous government, which has caused a whole range of problems we have to resolve this week. Which means that we have to concentrate on solving them this week. "Today, we had to make an important political decision as to whether we should apply for a standby loan [from the IMF] and whether we would use the time allowed us to establish certain development trends. Our decision was positive in both cases, which means, yes, we will apply for a standby loan, and we will want to establish certain development trends. Naturally, this will require some unpopular measures. We are considering what specific measures to take since there are a number of possibilities." [Announcer] Asked whether the government had decided to implement major restrictive measures in the social sector at the cost of their endangering the preelection position of the coalition partners, the prime minister said: [Moravcik] "We will have to adopt all measures once we have considered the acceptability of their impact on the social sphere. This will require enormous effort on our part in order to find a certain balance. We will have to do this by 12 April, when we are to address the parliament [with the government policy statement], or even earlier because we are to submit the policy statement to the deputies on 6 April." [Announcer] With regard to the state budget, Jozef Moravcik said: [Moravcik] "If we want to get a standby loan, we have to respect the 4-percent limit. That is the key issue. We want to gain a better position in international currency relations. The standby loan does not only mean that we will get a credit of tens of millions of dollars. It also means an assessment of our financial credibility, which we need if we are to communicate with the financial world." [Announcer] The congresses of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and of the National Democratic Party were held on Saturday [26 March]. Asked whether the government's deliberations today take account of the results achieved by the supreme bodies of these two parties, Jozef Moravcik said: [Moravcik] "We focused on what I have just told you."
