Answering a question on these appointments at a news conference held at the Presidency today, Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, the president of the Republic of Somaliland, said this system was similar to the U.S. type of government. For this reason it had become necessary to divide the Finance Ministry into two sections: the Treasury and the National Budget section. Likewise, the president clarified at the news conference that the ministry had not been abolished, but that it had been divided into two. In the same vein, he said the finance minister had not been sacked but that his resignation had been accepted. Speaking about the disarmament campaign, the president said the program was proceeding in all regions of the country and the capital was the one place in which the government had put pressure for the program to be carried out. It was proceeding well despite snags in some areas. On the event which took place at the general command headquarters, Egal said no order was given by the government to fight the group stationed there, but that the national Army was defending itself after it came under fire and its food was looted. The president also said the people were expressing their feelings about disarmament and that they should choose in the interests of the country and the people. Lastly, the president spoke about the situation in the country. On the conference to be held in Mogadishu on 15 April, the president said there was no framework whatsoever for Somaliland participation. He also said he had met the leaders of most of the organizations attending the meeting. He made it clear that the position of the Republic of Somaliland was based on the wishes of the Somaliland people and the decision had been made at the conferences of Burco and Boorama.
