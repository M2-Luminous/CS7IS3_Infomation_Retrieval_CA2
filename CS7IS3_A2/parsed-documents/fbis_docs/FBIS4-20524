The meeting was chaired by Mr. N. Roulet. There was agreement on COST's policy on possible enlargement. Almost as a precursor to this, the Committee decided on participation from non-COST countries in its 78 ongoing actions from: -- the Cluj-Napoca Technical Research University of Rumania and the Radio Research University of Rumania and the Radio Research and Devlopment Institute from Moscow in Action 235 (Radio propogation effects on next-generation fixed-service terrestrial communication systems); -- the University of Melbourne in Action 240 (Techniques for modelling and measuring advanced photonic telecommunication components); -- the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism of Izmiran (Russia) in Action 238 (Prediction and Retrospective Ionospheric Modelling over Europe (PRIME). The Committee also had an extensive exchange of views on the different sectors in which COST is particularly active. These included materials science, biotechnology, transport and telecommunications. It was also decided to establish two working parties on procedures and the ways of improving the methods of this cooperation system. These will report to the next meeting of the Committee. One working party will examine the suggestions for improving the procedures, while the other will review the actual role of the Senior Officials Committee. Eight new actions were decided upon, including: -- continuous speech recognition over the telephone (COST Action 250); -- management and information application development (COST Action C4). On the central issue of the meeting, enlargement, the Senior Officials decided that: -- COST should retain its identity as a dynamic mechanism for enhancing scientific and technical collaboration across Europe; -- COST will continue its policy of openness along the lines of the Ministerial Resolution of the Vienna Conference; -- Each request for participation as a full member will be examined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the manageability of the COST system; -- Such requests will be considered on the basis of mutual benefit and institutes of research of the countries concerned should be encouraged to participate in individual actions. The participation in individual COST actions will be the appropriate way to evaluate scientific interest and mutual benefit before a decision on the entry of a new member; -- A COST Ministerial conference in 1996 could be a framework to confirm possible decisions of the COST Senior Officials Committee concerning the enlargement of COST. If that is the case, the countries concerned should be invited to participate as observers at COST after the decision of the COST Senior Officials Committee; -- Cost will continue to inform non-COST countries about its activities.
