The social security financing system presently rests on the contributions of 3.5 active citizens per retired worker, a situation already responsible for large state deficits. However, were the system to continue unchanged, prospects are even more disquieting, given that in 60 years, barely 1.3 percent of active workers will pay the costs for each retiree. This means that in the year 2050, each worker will bear alone the almost entire amount a retiree costs. Within this scenario, the system's financial burden may "grow 7.5 times," from 300 million contos distributed in 1990 in old age pensions to almost 2.3 billion contos, meaning that the system's deficit will rise to "unconscionable heights." This is the point of departure chosen by the authors of the book Financing Retirement: The Contribution of the Insurance Sector to reach alternative solutions. [passage omitted] They advocate the adoption of a mixed, noncompulsory system at the company or individual level, leading to the accumulation of funds whose management may be entrusted to entities specializing in this type of activity, such as, for instance, insurance companies or pension fund managers. While three other types of theoretical solutions are possible, "their practical applications entail difficulties": pensions can be reduced, the retirement age can be pushed back, or contributions can be increased during a worker's active life. Despite the fear expressed by the specialists with regard to the first two solutions, given the Portuguese social reality of "small pensions with companies increasingly resorting to early retirements," the government did not hesitate to postpone the retirement age and modify the basis for computing retirements, an initiative that resulted in smaller pensions in a number of cases. The new social security law also increased the contributions of self-employed workers.
