A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said Pyongyang was notified that Washington wanted to continue nuclear dialogue and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board meeting hinted its wish to conduct inspections to guarantee continuity of nuclear safety in an interview with the Korean Central News Agency. The spokesman added that such position was very good, drawing a great contrast with former angry and threatening statements from Pyongyang and hinting a change in its position on the nuclear issue. "This (statement) is very meaningful change. It raises the chance of resolving the matter through dialogue," a senior government official said Sunday. Although the statement was in the form of an interview and not an official announcement, it said there was no change in North Korean position to approach the nuclear problem through dialogue and urged Washington to act if it really wanted settle the matter by dialogue. "It is a great change from the Foreign Ministry statement on Jan. 31 that threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if the United States continues to demand fullscope nuclear inspections," the official noted. Both Seoul and Washington cautiously view the statement a remarkable change in the attitude of the Stalinist country. In Washington, visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu observed that the statement has raised the possibility of resolving the nuclear matter to some extent.
