The St. Petersburg voter expressed his attitude toward the unprecedented farce and direct insult to elementary moral sensibilities which bore the name "Elections-94." Not one of the possible deputies to the City Assembly could work normally. The ballot boxes, which in many precincts were left for the night unsealed and without protection, raise doubts about the legitimacy of any of them and make inevitable the litigation they will be involved in with their rivals who were undeservedly defeated. The only way official authority, which is bankrupt in the eyes of the people themselves, can be saved would be to immediately cancel all the results of the voting on 20 March as not expressing the position of the voters. That is if you consider it in terms of jurisprudence. And as for real life... Let this endless reading on the radio of endless lists of names of candidates remain only as a nightmare in our memories. Let us have nothing but a memory of the 15 (!) electoral blocs made up of such mutually exclusive individuals that you automatically grab your head and ask outloud: "When were we deceived? Throughout the four years before these elections or just during the past two months of the election campaign?" How can a bloc which bears the proud name of "Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg" and claims to represent democracy "on behalf of and on instructions from" all St. Petersburg, appeal to the mayor and request, beg from him, two or three more hours of voting, another 2-3 percent of the vote? Has our voter really been denied his rights once again and been unable to see anyone but people who think about only one thing--about power--and aspire to only one thing--to power? How was it possible to conduct such an election campaign--without once appearing before the voter, without communicating with him even once? Which psychologists and other specialists in waging election campaigns advised the candidates to do this? It is up to us to make sure that such a thing never happens again. We must make sure that the billions of rubles and hundreds of thousands of dollars thrown at this phantasmagoric spectacle will find a better use. For now we must live with the powers we have. "Do not count your chickens before they hatch"--even we will not manage to put the cart before the horse. And another useful thing to remember. All discussion to the effect that some local authority we have elected in St. Petersburg will independently solve all of our problems is a fiction. As long as the present topsy-turvyness continues in Russia, local authorities will be needed for only one thing--to come another step or half step closer to the big Moscow trough that feeds all the cities, villages, and field camps of the boundless Rus with the ruble as it loses its value. Perhaps our voter has understood this as well.
