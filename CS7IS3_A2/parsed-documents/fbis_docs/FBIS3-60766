Now let us hear the entire course of the plane hijacking yesterday. The following is a report by Chien Ting-yuan: The hijacked plane belongs to Fujian Airlines of the CPC with serial number Yun-7/3447. It was piloted by Captain Shen Shang-ming. The plane carried eight crew members and 42 passengers, including three Taiwanese compatriots. [passage omitted] According to suspect Luo Chang-hua, the Kanchou city government wantonly dismantled people's houses in the past 10 years and his two houses were expropriated four months ago. He could not find appropriate authorities to make appeals and he felt discontented. Therefore, he decided to hijack an airplane. [Begin recording, presumably Luo Chang-hua] Their action hurt the interests of hundreds of thousands of families. I did this to show them. In other words, I will request Taiwan, namely the legitimate government of China -- a government which advocates humanitarianism, freedom, and a legal system -- to demand the CPC authorities refrain from continuing their persecution of the people. They should protect the people. It is so written in the Constitution, but in fact the people cannot have such protection. [end recording] Luo Chang-hua said that he spent 20 days planning the hijacking. He knew he might be repatriated. He said that even if he was repatriated he wanted to tell about this unreasonable fact to the Republic of China Government. Luo Chang-hua said that he carried iron nails with him and that he would commit suicide if his hijacking attempt was unsuccessful. He hoped that his young son could be handed over to his sister-in-law who is in Taiwan for care. [passage omitted] As to the little hijacker, Luo Wang-huan, he has already been handed over to Luo Chang-hua's sister-in-law, who is a resident of Taiwan, for care. Regarding the 10th hijacking of a mainland airliner, our government intentionally lowered the official level in handling the case. Interior Minister Wu Po-hsiung made a formal statement in the capacity of convener of the policy group for dealing with disasters or damage to airplanes in nonmilitary airports and ships in nonmilitary ports. In his statement, he clearly stated that hijackers are considered people who illegally enter Taiwan and will not be allowed to apply for residence in Taiwan. The government will not rule out that at an appropriate time in the future, plane hijackers will be forcibly repatriated. Besides, our side also expressed that, in the future, we will more carefully investigate and interrogate people on-board hijacked planes. This statement explains for the first time our government's clear stand that hijackers will not be allowed to apply for residence in Taiwan. Meanwhile, our side stressed that, in the future, we will make more prudent and detailed investigation and interrogation and may (?detain) people on hijacked planes. [words indistinct]
