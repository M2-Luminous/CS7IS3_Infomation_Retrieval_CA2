FR940902-0-00062 FR940902-0-00010 Direct Appeals by SDA's Several commenters suggested that §627.480(h) should be revised to provide the right of a direct appeal by an SDA, especially in those instances when a State chooses not to appeal. However, the initial and final determination process utilized by the ETA Grant Officer imposes a sanction on the direct recipient of funds from ETA, and it is that recipient that ETA holds liable for the sanction. If the entity upon whom the sanction is imposed chooses not to appeal, there is no dispute between that entity and ETA. If an appeal of a Grant Officer's final determination is taken, affected subrecipients are permitted to intervene in the proceedings. An SDA has the right to appeal any adverse determination against it within the State appeal system. Audit Resolution Section 627.481 is not changed from the interim final regulations. One commenter suggested that §627.481(a)(1) should permit direct recipients to have 6 months within which to submit their resolution report. The Department believes that to do so would mean that the recipient's audit would not be resolved with its awarding agency within the 6 months required by the OMB Circulars. Another commenter suggested that the title for the paragraph at §627.481(c) should be State level audit resolution. However, this paragraph also applies to resolution beyond the State level (e.g., the resolution of a service provider audit by an SDA). A third commenter suggested that the regulation at §627.481(c) should mandate that audit work papers be accessible to the auditee. Since these audits are procured by the auditee, it is within their purview, and not the Department's, to include requirements concerning work papers in their agreement with the auditors. Closeout One commenter suggested that waiting 3 years (the full period during which funds are available for expenditure) to close out a grant that can be closed in 1 to 11/2 years is confusing and unnecessary. It was also stated that this provision should allow closeout to occur as soon as all of the funds are expended or within 90 days after the end of the funding period. A second commenter suggested that the word ``timely'' is a subjective term and that the provision should require closeout to occur within 90 days after the end of the funding period, unless the deadline is extended. This same commenter indicated that the regulation should be clear that closeouts are based on year of appropriation. Several of the comments indicated an apparent misunderstanding that §627.485 applies to subrecipient awards. In fact, this provision is intended to inform the direct recipients of the Department's intention to close out each annual grant agreement within a short period after the availability of the funds has lapsed. The Department has determined that it is much more appropriate and less confusing to close out all of the annual JTPA grant agreements (described at §627.405 as the funding document for an individual program year's funds) at the same time. One commenter suggested that the language in the last sentence of paragraph (b) should allow for additional revisions, as long as there is a good reason that is adequately documented; further, the commenter suggested such revisions could be handled through an increase or decrease in the ``carryover'' amount. The first sentence of the paragraph allows for a 90-day period within which revisions may be made without a requirement for justification. The second sentence allows the Grant Officer to extend the period for revisions if the recipient requests an extension and provides a justification for same. The Department sees no need for any change to this provision. Also, at the end of the three-year funding period, there are no ``carryover'' funds, only funds for which the three-year availability has lapsed. These funds must be returned in accordance with paragraph (c) if they have been drawn down, and will be deobligated by ETA. Later Disallowances and Adjustments One commenter stated that the final rule should identify the period within which the Grant Officer has the authority to disallow costs. Such an action is not necessary. If an audit or review is conducted while the records are still available in accordance with the requirements of §627.460 (i.e., 3 years after submittal of the final expenditure report for the funding period) and there are unallowable costs, then the Grant Officer can disallow those costs. Collection of Amounts Due One commenter indicated that this provision must acknowledge that there are processes at the local level which impede collection of disallowed costs and which prohibit collection efforts by the Federal Government (or State) during the time when the State (or local) collection actions are in process. Other sections of these regulations (e.g., §627.485) contain provisions which allow recipients to request additional time to complete such a process. However, once a Federal debt is established against a recipient, it is that direct recipient which the Department holds liable. The provision is not changed.
