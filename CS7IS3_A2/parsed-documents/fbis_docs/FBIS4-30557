In this regard, the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] is assuming a negative stand. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also showed his strong will to set target figures. But, many EPA officials are of the view that "since prices are determined by market mechanisms, including relations between demand and supply, it is difficult to set targets for the future" (according to a senior EPA official). Under such a circumstance, in which the people are increasingly calling for a revision of the price difference, the EPA, whose role is to keep an eye on prices, just cannot publicly oppose the idea of setting such goals. Therefore, it seems that the EPA is in anguish. Revision of the price gap became a policy task of the Hata administration in lieu of a "plan to double actual income," which was introduced in late May. The prime minister submitted the plan to double actual income with an aim to lower prices of goods 20-30 percent. However, the plan has fallen through because the EPA opposed the idea of setting goals for lowering prices. At that time, the prime minister instructed the EPA to buckle down to the task of narrowing the price gap between Japan and other countries. The EPA was also determined to study actual measures to revise the differences at a meeting of the Price Stabilization Policy Council (an advisory organ to the prime minister), which is composed of representatives of each economic sphere. On the other hand, at the Administrative Reform Council Promotion Council working-level meeting held early this month, the prime minister explained his positive view of setting medium-range target figures for narrowing the price gap. At the meeting, attendees expressed their views, saying: "We should aim at reducing price differences to half in five years and publicly announce this goal." It became such that "Numerical targets," which the EPA tried to annihilate, emerged under another form. The EPA is positive about mapping out measures to revise Japan's traditional business practices, which are causes of the price gap, and improve industrial productivity. However, it is against the idea of introducing concrete numerical targets. Economists, who work in the private sector, criticized the plan to double the actual income, saying it is "unrealistic." It seems that the EPA does not have influential supporters as far as the issue of setting targets for revising the price gap is concerned. The government started to map out measures to revise the price gap by holding a general meeting of the Price Stabilization Policy Council. However, it seems that heated debate will be held at this meeting too over the issue of setting target figures.
