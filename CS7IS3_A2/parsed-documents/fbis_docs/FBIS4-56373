A transitional stage that is to be concluded on 1 January 1995 with the institutionalization of the World Trade Organization (WTO)--which will replace GATT in the settlement of problems arising from international trade in goods and services--began there, too. Having signed on this occasion the Final Declaration of the Uruguay Round launched in Punta del Este [Uruguay] in 1986, the representatives from 124 countries burst into applause. During the transition to the WTO, a Preparatory Committee will once again have to make great conciliatory efforts to harmonize different demands on issues such as labor regulations, regional agreements, relations between trade and monetary policies, immigration, countries' external debts, trade practices, and even the alleviation of poverty. Several bilateral agreements, which were signed at the very last minute, provided for the mutual granting of compensatory concessions to member countries or groups of member countries. Abreu said that following lengthy negotiations "there are absolutely no victors nor vanquished." He underscored that countries had made concessions to one another "which obviously vary in importance according to the blocs involved." Achievements by Uruguay Uruguay--which already has a rather open economy--did not have to make specific bilateral concession to other countries. Nevertheless, the results of the meeting fell far short of the expectations Uruguay and the other Cairns Group (exporters of nonsubsidized agricultural and livestock products) member countries had concerning the opening of international trade and the reduction of subsidies to production. Notwithstanding this, Uruguay obtained several specific trade benefits, and will be able to take advantage of the gains derived from the greater global opening established by the new regulations. The main achievements for Uruguay are: Concessions by the United States -- Tops [preceding word in English]: 50 percent tariff reduction. -- Plain weave textiles: 30 percent tariff reduction. -- Garments made of woven fabric: 20 percent tariff reduction -- Knitwear: 10 percent tariff reduction. -- Cheese: 10 percent tariff reduction. -- Beef: An annual quota of 20,000 tonnes; a maximum 10 percent tariff will be levied on beef exports, which will materialize once the country is certified as free of foot-and-mouth disease. -- Corned beef and salted beef: Zero tariff is maintained. -- Dressed meat: Up to 75 percent tariff reduction. Concessions by the European Union [EU] -- Beef: A 2,000 tonne increase in the Hilton quota assigned to Uruguay, which now totals 6,300 tonnes. -- Mutton: Quota is increased from 5,220 to 5,800 tonnes with zero tariff. -- Dairy products: General increase in quotas and tariff reduction in nearly all products. -- Textiles: Up to 14 percent tariff reduction. Rice Market -- Uruguay will be able to vie for a share in the 380,000 tonnes that Japan agreed to import as part of a general opening and in the 150,000 tonnes the ROK is going to import. This quota for both countries will be increased to 1.1 million tonnes in six years. General Benefits Uruguay's exports will benefit from the global opening of and boost in trade that is expected to take place worldwide in several aspects: -- Tariffs: Tariffs levied by the EU on agricultural and industrial products will go down by 35 percent and 42 percent respectively. Tariffs levied by the United States on agricultural and industrial products will be reduced by 34.2 percent and 37.5 percent respectively. Tariffs levied by Japan on agricultural and industrial products will be cut by 43.5 percent and 77.5 percent respectively. -- Domestic Price Support: A 20 percent progressive reduction in domestic support prices by industrial countries over a period of six years and a 13.3 percent reduction by developing countries. -- Subsidies to Exports: A reduction in budgeted allocations and volumes of 36 percent and 21 percent respectively by industrial countries and 24 percent and 14 percent respectively by developing countries. -- Nontariff barriers: Quotas, statistic or variable rates, etc., will be quantified as tariffs and will be progressively reduced by 36 percent in industrial countries and by 24 percent in developing countries over a period of six years. -- Animal and plant health agreement: Codes to regulate the control of animal and plant health are signed, thus preventing the implementation of discriminatory measures that act as nontariff barriers. -- Consolidated tariff: A maximum level of 35 percent is set.
