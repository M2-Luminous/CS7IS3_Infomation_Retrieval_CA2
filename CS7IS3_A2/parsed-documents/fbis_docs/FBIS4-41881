Our Special Correspondents Report From the Abkhazian-Georgian Border"] [Text] Gali-Sukhumi-Gudauta -- During the afternoon of 24 June two battalions of the 145th Motorized Infantry Division, having completed their march from Batumi, arrived in the vicinity of Zugdidi. They therefore came under the command of the eastern monitoring zone headquarters and took custody of three checkpoints and 10 monitoring and observation posts. Restoration work is continuing on the railroad bridge across the Inguri river. Let us remind readers that similar work has already been completed on the road bridge. In our view, the following fact is pretty significant: All the work is being carried out, let us stress deliberately, by Russian peacekeepers. It is hard for the authors of this report to shake off the feeling that the local authorities on both sides of the Inguri have acted in line with the principle "here come the Russians; they will do everything themselves." That is in fact how things have turned out. In our view, the situation in the western zone is somewhat more complex. Whereas the Zugdidi area has been practically cleared of Zviadist detachments, on the other bank bandit formations and detachments of marauders are running amok and shipping out booty by the truckload. The bandits have stepped up their activities because in the next few days the border will be closed, thus putting a stop to their "business." Incidentally, a word or two about the border along the Inguri. Until the mountain passes were opened, it stretched for 82 km. We were informed by Abkhazian Defense Ministry spokesman Valeriy Gumba that with the opening of the passes its length increased to 100-110 km. In our view, this point needs to be noted. First of all, and most important, up to now there has been no political decision on the border. This gives both sides a pretext for defining where the border is as the prevailing situation dictates. Second, the border as understood in the conventional sense does not exist. There is no border strip and no barbed wire. There is the river, and that is the border. In spring, when the snow started to melt in the mountains, the Inguri changed its course, and 13 Abkhazian guardsmen found themselves...on the Georgian side. Their punishment was short and brutal. Russian peacekeepers should be prepared for the fact that in certain border sectors, which it would be impossible to control even with all the available forces (a task which has not actually been set), there could occasionally be armed clashes. Our two mobile groups have been deployed on both sides of the Inguri to deal with this eventuality. The western monitoring zone headquarters are located in Gali. Its "patch" comprises two checkpoints and 17 monitoring and observation points. Mine clearance in the deployment area in this region has been completed. This situation "in the west" is also complicated as a result of the following factors. Under the agreed plan -- which we have reported on -- a 12-km security zone completely free of weapons is to be established on both sides of the Inguri. This is the first inconsistency. Some time ago the Abkhazian authorities promulgated an edict allowing people to keep weapons. As far as we know, this edict has not been repealed and apparently there are no plans to repeal it. Consequently the likelihood that the principle "have gun, will shoot" will operate is fairly high. We can even predict where this might happen. In the Kodori canyon, which is not a zone for which the Russian peacekeeping forces are responsible. Unburdened by the cares of having to guard the border, the commanders of Abkhazian and Georgian armed detachments are concentrating their forces in the Kodori canyon. According to information at our disposal, literally the other day a big detachment of Svanetians [Georgians] entered the canyon under the command of Emzari Ketsmariani. It is not hard to predict the future course of events: If the tempo of the political settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict does not match the urgency of the moment, then the currently shaky peace could be blown to pieces right here in the Kodori canyon, deep in the rear of the Russian peacekeeping forces. A decision was made 26 June to carry out a peacekeeping operation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. We were informed by Major General Vasiliy Yakushev that he plans to complete the peacekeeping forces' engagement before 3 July.
