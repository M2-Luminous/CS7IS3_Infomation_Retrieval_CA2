At a provincial meeting on planning work, provincial party Secretary Lu Rongjing made the above remark while hearing reports given by responsible comrades from the provincial planning committee. Wang Yang, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee and vice governor, also gave a speech at the meeting. Lu Rongjing pointed out: As a result of microeconomic regulation and control, our province realized sustained, rapid, and healthy development in its economic and social undertakings this year. Not only did cadres at all levels and the broad masses of people understand and support these undertakings, but the CPC Central Committee and the State Council also fully endorsed our achievements. Planning committees at all levels had a lot to do with these achievements. In speaking on planning committees' work next year, Lu Rongjing called for integrating the CPC Central Committee's guidelines with Anhui's actual situation in three areas. He said: First, we should study the new environment and the new situation, be in control of the intangible but dynamic changes of the market environment, make good forecasts, and continue to improve Anhui's microeconomic regulation and control to promote our province's economic development, especially development in agriculture and village and town enterprises. Second, we must pay closer attention to the key projects in our province so as to expand the chances for Anhui's economic development. Third, planning committees themselves must become more successful to accommodate the new situation. Lu Rongjing said emphatically: The basic way to solve Anhui's problems in economic development lies in reform. The reform measures to be launched by the CPC Central Committee will involve all quarters. In addition to the reform of the planning system, all other reforms are related to planning committees. While quickening the pace of reform, we must advance firmly and steadily to make substantial progress and ensure the smooth launching of all supplementary reform measures. While holding discussions with planning committee directors at the prefecture, city, and county levels and with leading cadres of major enterprises, Wang Yang pointed out: While enforcing the central authorities' microeconomic regulation and control, we have further defined local authorities' responsibilities by delimiting their rights, responsibilities, and benefits. Because of this, local authorities have in a way become more capable of regulating the economy, and this will help central and local authorities to bring their initiative into play. Planning committees must work hard to solve problems -- problems which have arisen in development -- through reform and must bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in Anhui. Wang Yang urged planning committees in our province to intensify their reform of the systems governing investment and interbanking loans, and to blaze a new trail in the rapid raising of capital. We should first draw up regulations, properly divide up responsibilities, and define powers for managing investment for infrastructure, competitive projects, and public welfare services. We should start this work next year and perfect the regulations when we do the job. After the investment system has been reformed, we should do everything possible to open more channels for raising capital. We should also manage well state-owned fixed assets, better manage the inventories of enterprises which are in better shape, and save a group of enterprises which is in distress.
