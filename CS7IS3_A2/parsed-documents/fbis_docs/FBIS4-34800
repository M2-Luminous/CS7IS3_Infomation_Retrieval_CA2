This has been confirmed by Carlos Menem's concern in achieving the quiet approval of the constitutional reform, and by Cordoba Governor Eduardo Angeloz's concern in gaining an advantage through the unification of the upcoming elections. Angeloz will certainly be the UCR [Radical Civic Union] presidential candidate. There are three political directions that can be noticed during this World Cup month, and which outline the national electoral future. First, Angeloz's Radicals are fully engaged in playing a leading role to defeat their probable contenders in the party's primaries, such as Senator Fernando De la Rua and Deputy Federico Storani. Second, Menem's Peronists are moving the chess pieces of the upcoming elections with the goal of fully polarizing the people's hopes, thus preventing the run-off election system that truly represents a "fearsome hell" for them. Third, Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez's Grand Front [FG] is actively engaged in probing the spirit of other parties, with the goal of forming a broad alliance that will allow it to challenge the Peronists. Storani and Peronist Senator Jose Octavio Bordon have been included in the FG's immediate plans. UCR President Raul Ricardo Alfonsin has been included in the FG's future plans. Current politics, and the hide-and-seek game played by many leaders who are attempting to hide what is obvious, may be interpreted based on these three directions. The Governors' Silence The president has peevishly imposed upon himself the painstaking and severe task of making his most cherished dream come true as soon as possible: the approval of a constitutional reform that will allow him to become a candidate again. This task involves preventing any action that could delay or obstruct the Constituent Assembly's progress. Therefore, the attempt to include a clause allowing the governors to be reelected without the requirement of resorting to provincial conventions was quickly scrapped, after the proposal created a controversial atmosphere that threatened to spread to the entire Constituent Assembly. The proposal was shelved, but not dismissed. Menem, as any other politician, is aware of the fact that if a weapon is not of any use today, it will probably be useful tomorrow. After spirits were calmed with the removal of this proposal, it did not take long before the governors demanded increased revenue sharing in the federal tax system. The first to scream blue murder was Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, who believed that his adjustment and stability program would be seriously jeopardized by the hopes harbored by the governors, led by a "hardliner" like La Pampa Governor Ruben Marin. Marin was supported by the Radical Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi. Economy Ministry officials secretly and almost stealthily contacted prominent Peronist leaders (Alberto Pierri?), asking them to intercede with the Peronist governors. Therefore the presence of Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde at the Federal Revenue Sharing Commission, with the goal of talking with the governors, was not a coincidence. Although no one explained the reason for Duhalde's visit last Tuesday evening, everyone believes that the Buenos Aires governor -- undoubtedly, the most powerful Constituent Assembly member -- is attempting to prevent the Peronist governors' insurgency over the distribution of the tax cake. Duhalde also has the official title of national Justicialist Party [PJ] president, which allows him to issue some instructions from the high command, like the duty of remaining silent so as not to stir up the constitutional reform's internal atmosphere. Although a concealment effort is being made, the explicit order is as follows: "In order to win the upcoming elections, the economic program must not be touched; if the governors keep bothering with the tax issue, everything will go to hell..." The Radicals' Roar Eduardo Angeloz keeps harping on the need to unify the presidential elections, without concealing his goal of making full use of the advantages that he may receive in the run-off or "ballotage" [preceding word in English] system in the upcoming elections. Angeloz's equation is simple: With the "star" governors -- "winners" [preceding word in English] like Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega, Santa Fe Governor Carlos Reutemann, and Entre Rios Governor Mario Moine -- unable to run for reelection, with the resulting accumulation of votes it is better to compete under a unified system because the "influence" effect will be minimized. Menem believes quite the opposite, even though he has remained silent on this issue. As the Cordoba governor has not noticed any sign of solidarity from Alfonsin, he has just talked with Alfonsin in an attempt to achieve Alfonsin's commitment to pressure the government to achieve the unification of the elections. In a nutshell, Alfonsin told Angeloz that the following political and technical problems exist for the unification of the elections: - Menem's presidential term of office would have to be extended for six months (from July to December), which is specifically banned by the current constitution. The 1853 Constitution states: "The president and vice president will discharge their duties for six years..." - The governors' terms of office would have to be reduced. This would involve meddling in the autonomous provincial system, paving the way for another highly dangerous meddling: the direct reelection of the "winners" or "star" governors. It is being said that Alfonsin will "not move a single finger" to promote the unification of the elections unless the entire UCR leadership specifically asks him to do so through a document signed and certified, in order to prevent "poor" memories later. Alfonsin is actually attempting to have his party understand that it must not spend any effort on these elections, but wait for the possibility of achieving alliances or preparing to regain power by the turn of the century, in 1999. Thus far, Alfonsin is keeping -- at any price -- the UCR presidency, a privileged position for reaching agreements and devising future strategies.
