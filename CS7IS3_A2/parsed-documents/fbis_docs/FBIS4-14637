He said that the last $15 million were remitted on Thursday. Landik noted that from now on Ukraine plans to pay for Russian gas once a decade. Landik also said that the Ukrainian president would issue a decree soon on setting up the open joint stock company Ukrneftegaz with a controlling package of shares belonging to Ukraine. He added that Kiev "can consider Russia's stake in privatization of Ukrneftegaz not more than 30 percent." According to Landik, Ukraine intends to offer its participation in privatization of oil and gas extraction enterprises in Russia. "Thus, nobody can reproach us that we are selling off Ukraine," he said. Landik said that in April "the government will still be warning Ukrainian enterprises about the possibility of cutting off Russian gas supplies, and then the Russian Gazprom, not me, will cut off supplies." It is expected that talks on gas supplies between the government delegations of Ukraine and Russia will resume on April 10.
