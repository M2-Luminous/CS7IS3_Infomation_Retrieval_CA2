Several days ago, they signed and published an open statement, saying that they had "deliberately" left Beijing for a few days and calling on the U.S. Government to extend the MFN trade status to China. However, the statement, which is being circulated, has not been confirmed by Wang Dan in person. The full text of the statement is as follows: 1. Under pressure from the current situation, we are deliberately leaving here for a few days. 2. We strongly call on the U.S. Government to extend MFN trade status for China. [Signed] Zhou Duo, Wang Dan, Min Qi [Dated] 9 Mar 1994 As U.S. Secretary of State Christopher arrived in Beijing, Wang Dan and the others were in other parts of the country. This ties in with what they said in the statement, that is, they left Beijing "under pressure from the situation." It is understood that Christopher had submitted a list of political prisoners to judicial departments in Beijing askine for their release. This list included the names of Wang Juntao, Ren Wanding, and the three dissidents detained recently--Yuan Hongbing, Wang Jiaqi, and Zhou Guoqiang. The U.S. Secretary of State is paying this special visit to Beijing to gauge the human rights situation at a time when the National People's Congress and China People's Political Consultative Conference sessions are being held. It is not easy for the Chinese side to find any reason to prevent Christopher from making contact with democratic activists, therefore the abovementioned "arrangement" have been made. The sources estimate that Zhou Duo, Wang Dan, and Min Qi will return to Beijing in about 10 days.
