[passage omitted] [Krejci] The Czech Republic has a deficit on the clearing account with Slovakia. What do you see as the reason for this happening? [Klaus] There are many reasons. First, the partition of Czechoslovakia disrupted various cooperative ties that ordinarily exist within a single economy. Another factor is the fact that the Slovak koruna devalued in relation to the clearing ECU. Moreover, the import surcharge was introduced. These three moments combined represent an increase in the price of Czech imports to Slovakia and, vice versa, a reduction in Slovak exports to the Czech Republic. That, of course, leads to an increase in the flow of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic rather than vice versa. The third important factor is that imports to any country are a function of the development of the gross domestic product of that country. The correlation between the two quantities is obvious according to direct proportionality: The richer the country is, the more it buys. The reciprocal is also valid -- the poorer the country is, the less it buys. That is the third reason leading to the demand for Slovak, and foreign goods in general, being higher in the Czech Republic than vice versa. The fourth reason is a certain conscious decision, on the Slovak part, of the type: "We have a deficit, something must be done about it." That gives rise to a certain psychological atmosphere that leads some Slovak firms to simply not shop on the Czech market. Only fifth is the issue of administrative problems and the renowned certificates. There is not such a genius who could weigh the effect of all these factors precisely. Only a few of them can be directly affected by the Czech Republic. [Krejci] Can or will the Czech side undertake something? [Klaus] We are not likely to introduce any artificial import barriers. Nor can we create in Slovakia a greater demand for Czech goods. At most, we could do something about the exchange rate of the koruna within the framework of the clearing account. These are very minor measures, however, with a long-term rather than an immediate effect. A while back, when Slovakia devalued and introduced the import surcharge, everybody wondered why a turnabout in the trade relations did not occur the next day. I spoke then about the so-called "J" curve, according to which the balance of payments will worsen before it begins to improve. That is precisely the phenomenon that took place. After the devaluations and import surcharges, the problem of the Slovak trade balance continued to worsen a while, and now it began to improve. If we did something similar regarding Slovakia, the short-term effect would not be at all favorable, and good results could come only in the long run. [Krejci] During the recent Sudeten German Days, German Government representatives also demanded that the Benes Decrees be abolished. Views are even being expressed in our country that the decrees were inhumane, first and foremost, because they proceeded from collective guilt. What do you think of the Benes Decrees and of their possible annulment? [Klaus] The Benes Decrees were a reality of the era in which they evolved. At the same time, it is confusing to describe them as the Benes Decrees, because the issue involved a government resolution that the president of the republic then signed. This also involved edicts with which the victorious World War II powers agreed. However, it was mainly the Czech and Slovak public at that time that applauded them enthusiastically. It is impossible to assess slightly differently today -- half a century later -- this or that phenomenon. The Benes Decrees had certain consequences. The idea that it is possible to undo them somehow is incomprehensible and alien to me. It simply cannot be done. [Krejci] How, then, do you assess the demands from the German side to abolish the decrees? [Klaus] I do not know if it is possible to say "from the German side." Let us assess them as partial German demands. Are we to allow these few people to dictate to the Czech Republic Government what it should have on its agenda, where we should go or not go? It seemed curious to me that Mr. Otto von Habsburg said, with reference to me in an interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES, that my rejection of a dialogue is an expression of the weakness of my arguments. This is not true, however. Many people recall how, a year ago, I said that I will participate cool-headedly in any dialogue. Perhaps, since they do not want to hear them at a distance, I could sell them my arguments from close by. You know very well that the government coalition has come to the conclusion that a direct dialogue will be rejected in this country. I fully respect this. However, I can say on my own behalf that I would take part in it cool-headedly and that in no way would I be afraid of it.
