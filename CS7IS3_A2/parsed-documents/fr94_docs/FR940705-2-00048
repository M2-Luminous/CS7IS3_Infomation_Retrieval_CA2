FR940705-2-00048 FR940705-2-00028 3. Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;624&hyph;000] Take notice that on June 23, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), 540 Westheimer Court, Houston, Texas 77056&hyph;5301, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;624 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) (18 CFR 157.205, and 157.211) for authorization to construct a new delivery point to enable Texas Eastern to deliver natural gas to GATX Terminals Corporation (GATX), end user. It is stated that it would enable Texas to make natural gas deliveries to GATX under Texas Eastern's blanket certificate issued on November 5, 1982 in Docket No. CP82&hyph;535&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Pursuant to Section 157.211 of the Commission's regulations, Texas Eastern requests authorization to install a new delivery point in order to deliver natural gas under the agreement covering service for GATX under Rate Schedule IT&hyph;1 of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Volume No. 1, and that Texas Eastern's existing tariff does not prohibit the additional volumes. Texas Eastern states that the peak and average day deliveries at the point would be 5,000 Dth per day. Texas Eastern states that the installation of the delivery point will have no effect on Texas Eastern's peak day or annual deliveries. Texas Eastern submits that its proposal will be accomplished without detriment or disadvantage to Texas Eastern's other customers. The delivery point to be installed by Texas Eastern includes the installation of two 2-inch taps on Texas Eastern's 12-inch Line Nos. 1&hyph;C and 1&hyph;R at M.P. 2.63 in Richmond County, New York. The approximate cost of such facilities is $551,500 and would be 100% reimbursable by GATX. It is further stated that GATX would cause to be installed a dual 2-inch meter station, including 50 feet of 4-inch pipeline between the proposed Texas Eastern taps to GATX's proposed meter station and electronic gas measurement equipment. Comment date: August 11, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing. G. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
