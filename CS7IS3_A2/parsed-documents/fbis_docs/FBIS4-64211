The proposal -- contained in confidential six-page document seen by THE OBSERVER -- is the most radical to emerge from a series of 33 defence studies aimed at reducing the 24 billion pounds sterling defence expenditure by 1 billion pounds sterling over the next three years. THE OBSERVER understands that if the plan wins ministerial and Cabinet approval the squadrons would pull out of Germany by April 1996, the deadline for the latest round of defence cuts known as `Front Line First'. Sources say the proposal has already cleared its first hurdle, gaining the reluctant acceptance of senior members of the Air Staff as the least painful option in the face of the threat of `acute cuts'. One source said: `Senior officers I have spoken to have given their support to this plan. The feeling is that there is no downside to this proposal except in conditions of service for RAF personnel.' NATO would have no power of veto, although it would probably insist that the withdrawn squadrons remain earmarked for NATO operations. RAF sources emphasised that fighters could defend NATO's eastern borders just as effectively from bases in Britain as from bases in Germany. Disclosure of the plan to leave Germany -- which would see the withdrawal of almost 80 fighter aircraft and 6,000 personnel -- is the latest in a series of leaks on deliberations over the shape of Britain's armed forces, despite efforts to prevent word getting out about possible cuts under consideration. A wholesale RAF withdrawal would come after the United States's decisions to scale back its military commitments in Germany. It would also allow the closure of a number of British airbases in Germany under the last round of cuts, Options for Chance, particularly Laarbruch and Wildenrath. Detailed discussions about the future of the RAF squadrons in Germany first emerged two years ago in the aftermath of the collapse of communism. According to one senior RAF source: ``It was a plan that gained quite a head of steam when Germany was threatening to pull out of the Eurofighter programme and there was a feeling we sould be beastly to them. Then when relations with Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl warmed it was quietly dropped. ``Now it has been picked up again. The Treasury is keen because of the money it will save. It is an expensive business keeping the RAF overseas, and bringing them back to Britain would help with foreign currency and the costs of keeping the bases running and the families abroad. ``As far as the RAF is concerned it would make sense as it is becoming more and more difficult to carry out low-flying exercises in Germany because of local protests, and it would take the pressure off other areas of spending. ``In terms of the international situation, things have come on a long way since the reunification of Germany and there is a feeling that if we did need to go back it would not be that difficult.'' The biggest problem facing the RAF would be where to put the returning aircraft and personnel, with British bases already overstretched. The review of the RAF's overseas commitments follows pressure to reduce the overall number of front-line squadrons by 15 per cent to around 22 squadrons. Under the proposal, the remaining squadrons would be increased from 12 to 18 aircraft -- the NATO standard size for a squadron. There is a widespread belief in both the Treasury and in the other services that the RAF -- which escaped the worst of the cuts suffered by the Army and the Navy in Options for Change -- is vulnerable.
