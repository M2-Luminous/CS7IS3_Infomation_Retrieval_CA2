FR941125-2-00043 FR941125-2-00032 [Docket No. RP95&hyph;47&hyph;000] Southern Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Petition for Clarification or Waiver of Tariff Provisions November 18, 1994. Take notice that on November 15, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing a petition for clarification or a temporary waiver of Section 23.2 (Credit Mechanism for Interruptible Transportation Revenues) of the General Terms and Conditions (Section 23.2) of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1. Southern states that waiver would allow Southern to defer making the revenue credits required by this section of its tariff until such time as the fixed cost allocation to the interruptible transportation (IT) rate is established with finality. In view of the Commission's order dated March 16, 1994, in Southern's Docket Nos. RP92&hyph;10&hyph;006, et al. 1 which requires that any change in the IT level of throughout made in the upcoming hearing in Southern Docket No. RP93&hyph;15&hyph;000 be applied retroactively, Southern states that it would be premature to make revenue credits at this time. 1 66 FERC Â¶61,302. Southern states submits that such a clarification or waiver of Section 23.2 is warranted because the amount of fixed costs allocated to IT service are now subject to revision retroactively and thus the appropriate credits cannot be accurately calculated at this time. Given this uncertainty, Southern states that the Commission should waive compliance with this provision of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff until such time as the necessary components for calculating such credits are final and ascertainable. Southern states that a copy of the filing is being served on all of Southern's customers. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29018 Filed 11&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
