It has not paid off; instead, with each passing day the stakes have increased to a point where the poverty of conscience is bordering on ennui. The impatience of the major powers in the shambolic [as published] Bosnian peacekeeping operation to consign the tragedy to remote memory has left them questioning themselves about how little they can get by with in dealing with the Bosnias of the future. With their default over Bosnia more or less a done deal, the NATO countries at their summit last week hastened to reassure themselves that the Atlantic alliance could still uphold lofty principle on elaborate pretense alone. For while the post-Cold War world resolves its geopolitics in the absence of a clear definition of friend and foe, it is pretentious to assume that self-interest is anything less than paramount. Both France and Britain, the main participating nations in the Bosnian peacekeeping presence, have hinted that that interest would not be further served by exposing their troops in an inconclusive conflict. Those troops might be withdrawn if no agreement is reached by the spring -- it would be pointless to stay on when the injustice of the carve-up plan has been conceded as a given. The Bosnian Government cannot accept the residue of their country as offered so far, and have no choice but to keep on fighting. With its back against the wall, it had been prepared to yield up to two-thirds of its territory in return for a face-saving and economically viable peace. Between immolation and a humiliating vestige of their former sovereignty, the Bosnian Muslims are making the only dignified choice. Having stayed neutral on the terms of a peace settlement, the Europeans see no point in turning their token gestures into sitting ducks. Apart from the extremist elements, the Bosnian Muslims know that they cannot win back all that they have lost. The realists hope to regain the bulk of central Bosnia and wrest by force the minimal concessions that they had thus far failed to obtain by negotiation. The greatest irony of the West's dereliction over the Bosnia issue is that the basis for their inaction has not come to bear -- the conflict did not end quickly. It is now safe to conjecture that had the arms embargo been lifted, the fighting would have taken less time to come to a truce, with an eventual deadlocked armistice. No matter how tense such an armed stand-off might have been, it would have been wrought at less suffering. Ethno-religious rivalry exacts greater attrition the longer it is left to fester. The sooner an impasse is reached with reasonable grounds staked out, the more amenable will the combatants be to a practical detente. Such "what if's" will no doubt keep historians busy in time to come. What would make them busier still is the external and incidental costs of the international community's betrayal of principle. It is already obvious to most Muslims worldwide that their interests are incompatible with those of that community's Western leaders, vaunted principles notwithstanding. The scale of Bosnia's neglect might be small enough to be easily forgotten. But the religious sectarianism with which that conflict was fought will be remembered for a long time yet.
