According to a senior official at the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), nuclear power now accounts for only 0.5 percent of the country's output. The 300,000 kilowatt Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang province is celebrating the second anniversary of its trial operation. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong, with two 900,000 kilowatt generating units, is to start commercial production next year. ``That means China's nuclear power generating capacity will be 2.1 million kilowatts,'' said CNNC Deputy General Manager Zhao Hong. Work has begun on the second phase of construction at the Qinshan facility, which involves four 600,000 kilowatt generating units powered by nuclear reactors, Zhao told XINHUA. CNNC also plans to continue construction at the Daya Bay plant, which will install two more generating units, each with a capacity of 900,000 kilowatts or greater, he said. Coastal provinces such as Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hainan and Shandong are ``interested in nuclear power plants,'' and are making pre- construction preparations or conducting commercial negotiations. Nevertheless, Zhao said, the development of nuclear power in China has to be ``appropriate'' in scope and speed because nuclear reactors are expensive. To cope with this problem, he said, CNNC welcomes foreign investment to supplement domestic funds from the central and local governments and Chinese bank loans.
