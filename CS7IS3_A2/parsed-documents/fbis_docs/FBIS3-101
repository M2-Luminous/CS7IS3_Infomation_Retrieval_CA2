He said he would organize the preparation and distribution of one million leaflets instigating a national strike of all institutions of learning if the two men were not released within a week. The leaflets, he said, will start circulating in Nairobi, and then spread to all parts of the country. The strike itself will start next Monday. Mr. Wandati was arrested last week in Lugari [western Kenya] at a FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy] Kenya campaign rally allegedly over statements he had made earlier. Dr Adar was picked up by police from his Spring Valley residence on Friday night. [passage omitted]
