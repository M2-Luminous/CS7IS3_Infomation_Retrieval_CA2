In expressing an opinion with respect to the extent of a measure, which, according to THE MIAMI HERALD newspaper has been approved by the U.S. Department of State and is currently being evaluated by President Bill Clinton, Graciella Chailloux from the U.S. Studies Center told PRENSA LATINA that Washington's blockade against Cuba will never change. For the past 35 years, she recalled, the White House has attempted to economically suffocate Cuba, and what the newspaper reported in no way provides solutions leading in that direction. Lifting some travel restrictions to Cuba and easing the way to information exchange is merely part of a plan they intend to implement in order to influence Cuban civilian society and encourage real political intervention which the Americans, she indicated, would consider given the excellent results in Eastern Europe. The real intention, according to the researcher's personal opinion, is to encourage implementation of the Torricelli Bill, as this instrument relates to interfering in Cuba's internal issues. Likewise, Nicanor Leon Cotayo, Cuban journalist, writer, and researcher, believes that lifting restrictions to Americans traveling to Havana will only be a minor alleviation to the official violation of U.S. citizens' constitutional rights. Leon emphasized the highly selective nature of the authorizations granted -- mostly to U.S. officials. In this respect, he pointed out that more than an opening headed toward encouraging an improvement in bilateral relations, there would seem to be a more general intent aimed at less contructive objectives. In this respect, he added, it is important to point out that those persons who would be allowed to travel to Cuba do not include individuals who would cooperate with the country's economic or scientific development. Leon, author of several books on the blockade against Cuba, emphasizes that the eventual U.S. Government measures constitute a small favorable step within the context of American-Cuban relations.
