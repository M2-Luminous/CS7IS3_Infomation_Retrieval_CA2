I understand that you recently visited Japan, Russia, and Germany and returned home last week. Will you explain the results of your visit to these countries? [Defense Minister Yi] As you mentioned, I visited Japan, Russia, and Germany for 10 days from 25 April to 5 May. The results of my visit can be summarized into the following three points. First, my visit to Russia was the first occasion for an ROK defense minister to visit Russia. As you know, the Russian Federation is the successor to the former Soviet Union, and the treaty for friendship and mutual assistance it concluded with North Korea is still valid. My talks with the Russian defense minister were ultimately aimed at discussing measures for preventing North Korea's erroneous judgment and for deterring its provocation. I am not certain whether it is an appropriate hypothesis or not, but suppose that the minister of the People's Armed Forces of North Korea visits Washington and meets with U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, and they reach an agreement on a certain issue and sign an accord, I would certainly be uncomfortable. My talks with the Russian defense minister to exchange views on issues pertaining to security in Northeast Asia and the world were primarily designed to seek agreement on measures to prevent North Korean misjudgment and provocation. Second, as you know, the most urgent issue at present is the North Korean nuclear problem. Our stand toward this issue is just. In other words, we maintain that North Korea must return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] system at an early date for a solution to the problem. North Korea must also show the transparency of its nuclear issue. For this, it should allow complete inspections of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and mutual inspections between North and South Korea so that the transparency of the nuclear problem can be displayed to the entire world. Meeting with the defense ministers of these three countries, I noticed that they shared the completely same view on this issue. In particular, my Japanese counterpart stressed that the North Korean nuclear problem is not only the problem of the ROK but also that of his own country, and Germany also has a similar view. Third, my visit can be reviewed based on working-level exchanges. Military exchanges can be categorized into two parts; first is manpower exchange and second is material exchange. We agreed to expand manpower exchanges. In other words, we agreed that by giving opportunities to core members of each country's Armed Forces to visit the other countries, we should encourage them to have a good understanding of the development of the military science and military theories of the other countries. This can be described as part of the results of my visit. I would like to emphasize to the people at this point that the defense and security of the ROK assumes the ROK-U.S. security system as its main axis. Therefore, my recent visits to these countries do not mean an alienation [sooe] from or neglect of security relations with the United States. [Reporter Yi] Reporter Pak, as you know, North Korea unilaterally informed the UN Forces that it will withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] in Panmunjom and will withdraw the Polish mission from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. As a result, people suspect the true intention hidden in its abrupt act. Will you tell us about how the recent North Korean moves have been reported by the news media? [Reporter Pak] Yes. Although it can be hardly described as a strange act, North Korea has certainly shown abnormal acts one after another from some time ago, thus straining the position of our side. North Korea began to show such an act on 28 April. In a Foreign Ministry statement that day, North Korea abruptly proposed to the U.S. side that the present Armistice Agreement be replaced with a peace agreement in order to prevent a war from occurring on the Korean peninsula. Such an abrupt act by North Korea continued on the next day, too. Colonel Kim Hyon-ki, senior secretary of the North Korean side of the MAC, proposed to Colonel Chilton of the U.S. Army, senior secretary of the UN Forces side of the MAC, to meet him as a representative of the U.S. Army, not as a representative of the MAC. Needless to say, the U.S. Army, in a reply message, stressed that it refuses the North Korean side's proposal stressing that the North Korean demand violates the Armistice Agreement. Nevertheless, North Korea soon sent a unilateral message that it will withdraw from the MAC and that it will also withdraw the Polish mission, a North Korean side member country of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. [Reporter Yi] Was it true, reporter Pak, that the North Korean side deployed armed soldiers within Panmunjom? [Reporter Pak] Yes, that is true. It was the afternoon of that day. While shifting the guards in the joint security area at Panmunjom, the North Korean side brought in this area about 40 soldiers who were armed with individual weapons including rifles and helmets. The Armistice Agreement stipulates that officers may carry out their mission by carrying a pistol but soldiers are not permitted to arm themselves. According to the UN Forces Command, this was the first time since the incident of the brutal slaughter of American soldiers with axes took place in 1976. On the afternoon of 30 April, North Korea staged a special air exercise. North Korea had about 20 fighter planes take off that day and stage an exercise of attacking simulated enemy planes. In addition, the North Korean planes flew toward the South farther than during the regular exercise, and approached the area 27 kilometers north of the armistice line, which is designated by our Army as the last security boundary line, thus making our Army tense. Because of this situation, our home ministry requested each broadcasting station, including KBS, to stand by for emergency broadcast. As a result, a very strained situation was created, just for a while. [Reporter Yi] Mr. Minister, I believe that you have received a series of reports on such moves by North Korea, as reporter Pak explained. How do you observe these situations and how our Army coped with them? [Defense Minister Yi] I will add some explanation on the background. The situation North Korea is facing today is, in a nutshell, that North Korea is suffering three kinds of hardships. These are, as we all know well, economic difficulties, shortages of food and oil, and international isolation. The communist and socialist forces who supported North Korea in the past have all disappeared. Third, the hardship of decision making. If North Korea is fully opened, its present social system can hardly be maintained and if it does not open itself, it will continuously suffer its present economic difficulties. Thus, North Korea is faced with the pain of making a decision. In order for North Korea to resolve these triple hardships, it is using the nuclear card. In other words, with this nuclear card, it is trying to evade international isolation, to gain some economic assistance, and to maintain the survival of its political system. Each of these situations, pointed out by reporter Pak earlier, are psychological tactics to be implemented by using the nuclear card. What has appeared clearly in North Korea's attempting to overcome such pains by using the nuclear card is its intention to isolate the ROK. In other words, North Korea is persistently trying to directly contact the United States and isolate the ROK. Therefore, all the situations that took place recently can be regarded as a move to isolate our ROK from joining in the resolution of the problems. However, we need not be embarrassed by such a psychological trick and strategy, if I may define it as such. As defense minister, I am thoroughly aware of what is happening in North Korea, including the movement of troops, material, and equipment, as well as the type of exercises and other things. I regret that I cannot tell you all of them because they are military secrets. All this comes to my attention through the joint 24-hour intelligence surveillance system between the ROK and the United States. In conclusion, I would like to point out that although North Korea is resorting to psychological tactics, it has no intention to trigger systematic provocations. Even if North Korea embarks on a systematic provocation, I will notice it immediately. [Reporter Yi] What is the present status of the issue of resuming the Team Spirit exercise? [Defense Minister Yi] I will briefly explain first about the nature of the Team Spirit exercise. It would be the 18th holding of the exercise if this year's Team Spirit exercise was held. This exercise is purely defensive with no offensive nature. If a nation has an army, it should conduct training for its army. It is quite natural. However, with a view to joining the nation's great strategy for a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem, we have postponed four times under two conditions. During talks with U.S. Defense Secretary Perry who visited our country last month, we agreed to resume the Team Spirit exercise in November if positive progress is not seen in resolving the North Korean nuclear problem. There is no change in our position. [Reporter Yi] Let us direct our attention, reporter Pak, to the internal affairs of our Army. Accidental discharges of weapons and other accidents occurred in succession recently in the Army. What do you think the reason for this is? [Reporter Pak] As you pointed out, various accidents, including accidental discharges, have taken place in the Army recently one after another. On 3 May, a college student participating in reserve forces' training was killed by a bullet fired from an M-16 rifle, and last Saturday, four days later, three civilians were severely injured by the accidental firing of a mortar shell in the mortar firing range. Besides, three soldiers who were repairing an iron fence were killed by a mine explosion. The problem is that none of these accidents were clearly explained and revealed. It is only 10 months ago that some 20 officers and men of the active and reserve forces were killed by the explosion of an artillery shell at the artillery firing range in Yonchon, Kyonggi Province. Another accident of an artillery shell landing in the playground of a high school followed late last year. Each time, the military authorities repeatedly stated that they would do their utmost to prevent further accidents. But their statements resulted only in the repetition of accidents. In view of proper weapons management being the basic safety principle in the Army, the recent accidents involving weaponry arouse the people's concern with the possible easy-going attitude of the Army. [Reporter Yi] People are worried that such accidents may be an outcome of relaxed military discipline. Needless to say, the people trust and love the Army. However, viewing the accident at the reserve forces training site, the people suspect that the military might have attempted to conceal or not reveal the complete truth about the accident. What is your plan to prevent further accidents, including accidental discharges of weapons, Mr. Minister? [Defense Minister Yi] I, as defense minister, want to ask the pardon of the people. At the same time, I express sincere condolences to those who were victimized in the recent accidents, as well as to their bereaved families. I would like to point out at this point that the military and police are conducting a joint investigation of the accident. Based on the result of the investigation, I will thoroughly call to account those responsible for the accident and will see to it that appropriate follow-up actions are taken. One thing for which I seek the people's understanding is that the Army is a group of young men who live together while handling various dangerous equipment and materials. Statistics from the accidents that have occurred over the past 10 years show a noticeable reduction in overall accidents. I will see to it that military discipline be further tightened among soldiers and those concerned. [Reporter Yi] I hope that the military will continually enjoy the people's love and trust. Thank you, Mr. Minister, for joining us despite your busy schedule.
