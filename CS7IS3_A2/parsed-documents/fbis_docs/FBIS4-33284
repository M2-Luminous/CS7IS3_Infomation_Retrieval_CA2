The outages will therefore follow a pattern similar to what has happened lately. The Electric Union made this announcement this evening. This entity of the Basic Industry Ministry added that the situation in June is not as critical as during April and confirmed that Cuba continues to receive the necessary spare parts and equipment to conduct projected maintenance programs. From 2-8 June, the average power output projected is 1,420 megawatts and the projected demand will peak at times at 1,835 megawatts. In other words, there will be deficit similar to that experienced in the last few weeks. The Electric Union also announced that a light maintenance program is scheduled to be conducted on unit No. 4 of the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Electric Plant in Cienfuegos. This is one of the two 150-megawatt generators this plant has under repair. The repairs are expected to take four days.
