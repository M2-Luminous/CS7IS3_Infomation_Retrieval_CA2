Vsevolod Aleksandrovich Generalov began his labor activity as a worker at the lead-zinc combine in Ust-Kamenogorsk. He graduated from the Metallurgical Faculty of the Kazakh Polytechnical Institute. He was an operator, a smelter, a furnace attendant, a foreman, a senior foreman, and a shop chief. In the hot shop he was molded not only as a production manager, but also as a scientist. Vsevolod Aleksandrovich headed the Scientific Research Institute of Nonferrous Metallurgy and was elected general director of the Tsvetnaya Metallurgiya Scientific Production Association. He is candidate of technical sciences. In the evening, on the eve of our meeting, I saw in the first television program the frames of an old newsreel: the construction of Magnitka's first blast furnaces. Against their background the affectedly cheerful voice of a huckster was selling Magnitka's shares. I devoted several years of my life to this city near the Ural River and to the celebrated metallurgical combine. The out-of-town editorial staff of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA worked there during the construction of the "2500" cold-rolling mill. We published MALAYA KOMSOMOLKA. A cast plaque on a pedestal--Shop imeni KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA--is in memory of our work. Viktor Filippovich Tomchuk, one of Magnitka's first volunteers, often dropped in on us, the out-of-town editorial staff. He was building the railroad to the future combine, then worked in its shops, and at the end of the 1960's, when we became acquainted, he spent every leave at Magnitogorsk's new construction sites. He "took part in unpaid mass work," as Tomchuk liked to say. With what shares can he be paid for all those unselfish years? And carpenter Isayev, who, according to his proud testimony, went through all Magnitka's mills? And thousands of their contemporaries--founders of the most powerful metallurgical combine in the world? Will the same that has occurred with Uralmash, with the Gorkiy Motor Vehicle Plant, and with the industry's other giants, which are now being pulled apart, not happen with Magnitka? "Magnitka," Vsevolod Aleksandrovich, having heard my tirade, said patiently, "is one of the few enterprises, part of the shares of which, in accordance with the government decision, remains under federal ownership." [Andriyanov] What part? [Generalov] A total of 22.3 percent. In other joint-stock companies--in the sector 75 percent of the enterprises have already been transformed into joint-stock companies--no blocks of shares remain under federal ownership. After a closed subscription is conducted among members of labor collectives, where 56 percent of the shares are bought out, the remaining 44 are sold on the securities market, including 29 percent of the shares, at voucher auctions. The value of enterprises was determined at the prices of 1 July 1992, incidentally, like the nominal value of the voucher. Therefore, I share your alarm: In practice, enterprise funds are being distributed through voucher auctions. In many cases what workers and engineers acquire is much less than the share that falls to the buyers-up of vouchers. [Andriyanov] It happens that vouchers are brought in bags. [Generalov] They are not always bought up by those that participate in voucher auctions. Therefore, fights, and by no means of local significance, often are going on there. And, seemingly, quite unexpectedly the control block of shares of key enterprises passes to strange hands. How many criminal incidents with directors and other workers of enterprises, if their positions did not coincide with the interests of new owners, have already occurred! Foreign firms often participate in voucher auctions through figure-heads. They do this not always in order to invest funds in production development. Interest in the elimination of a competitor on Russian and world markets is not ruled out. [Andriyanov] In order to solve problems of reconstruction and development, many of the sector's enterprises need state support. [Generalov] Now, according to the new privatization program, from 25.5 to 51 percent of the shares of enterprises in a number of sectors can remain under federal ownership for 3 years. Unfortunately, plants of the metallurgical complex did not get on this list. Enterprises acutely need the block of shares, which would remain under federal ownership, during the establishment of financial-industrial groups and holding companies. In this case shares are the tool for the combination of the interests of enterprises and realization of joint investment programs. Later the sale of shares of such associations is possible at investment, not voucher, auctions, the winners of which will invest real funds in the development of enterprises. [Andriyanov] Information on protests by metallurgists in connection with the transfer of part of the shares of nonferrous metallurgical plants to the Roseltrans Company has appeared in the press. What is the essence of the conflict? [Generalov] In a number of metallurgical enterprises, in accordance with the directive of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, it was proposed that the block of shares temporarily remaining under federal ownership be transferred to the Roseltrans Joint-Stock Company, which was being established. What is Roseltrans? Let me try to figure it out. This is a company, which intends to produce electric locomotives. However, what does the Norilskiy Nikel Concern have to do with it? Or the Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Plant? Or the Kolchugino Plant for the Processing of Nonferrous Metal? Or the Gayskiy Ore-Dressing Combine, which received an instruction to transfer part of the shares to the authorized capital of Roseltrans. This combine mines ore and produces concentrates for nonferrous metallurgical enterprises. It would be logical to establish an association of enterprises connected through technological cooperation. [Andriyanov] Why holding companies and financial-industrial groups are being established slowly in the sector? [Generalov] This is not quite so. Plans for the establishment of a number of financial-industrial groups and holding companies in metallurgy have now been prepared. A holding company, ALKUR, was established on the basis of joint-stock companies of the aluminum industry in Sverdlovsk Oblast. The formation of large companies envisages the participation of consumers of metal products. A pilot project for the establishment of financial-industrial groups in the aluminum industry is being prepared. In metallurgy the establishment of financial-industrial groups and holding companies is more necessary than in other sectors. First, in order to maintain intrasectorial technological cooperation ties from ore mining to the output of finished metal products. Second, the consolidation of material and financial resources will provide opportunities for the modernization of production and for a better utilization of production capacities. However, existing, including antimonopoly, legislation limits these opportunities. [Andriyanov] Vsevolod Aleksandrovich, precisely in what? [Generalov] People say that monopoly is arising. However, all over the world large corporations operate in metallurgy--in ferrous metallurgy and in aluminum, copper-nickel, and other subsectors. The concept of "natural" monopoly, to which metallurgy pertains, exists there. This is due to the attachment to ore bases and to the specific technological features of production. The establishment of large conglomerates and corporations, sometimes with the participation of the state, makes it possible to efficiently utilize natural resources, to successfully compete on the foreign market, and to establish a strong frame for the national economy. Our competitors abroad are increasing production and capturing markets, while Russian metallurgy has reduced the production volume by 40 percent. Not only the drop in demand, but also the rupture of economic ties, has had an effect. The situation cannot be worse. [Andriyanov] Russia has already fallen back to fourth place in the world in steel production. [Generalov] Russia's proportion in world steel output in 1993 dropped from 9.3 to 8.0 percent. Japan holds first place--99.6 million tonnes. China has moved up into second place--88.7 million. Then there is the United States--87 million. [Andriyanov] However, your metallurgy has begun to lag not today? [Generalov] Of course. For many years it developed extensively. Capital investments were allocated mainly for an increase in production volumes. Obsolete and worn out equipment remained there. For years the coefficient of fixed capital replacement was 0.9 to 1.2. This is lower than the technically and economically substantiated level by a factor of 3 to 4. Now more than 60 percent of the steel and one-half of the rolled metal products are produced on antiquated equipment. [Andriyanov] Where are we going? [Generalov] Without urgent measures for the retooling of metallurgy, protection of the domestic market, and regulation of the rise in prices of energy resources and transport Russian metallurgy will cease to exist. [Andriyanov] However, we are advised to buy metal, like grain, abroad. They say that this will be cheaper. [Generalov] This is totally unjustified economically, not to mention the fact that national security cannot be guaranteed without its metallurgy. For example, in order to import 10 million tonnes of rolled steel products, 3.5 to 4.0 billion dollars will be needed. On the domestic market the same quantity of rolled metal products can be bought for 600 to 700 million dollars. U.S. experience is also significant. About 20 years ago America made an attempt to orient itself toward the import of metal products, abandoning large financial investments in the modernization of its own metallurgy. However, even with its vast export opportunities the United States was forced to return to the revival of its own metallurgy on the latest technical basis. It engages in it very successfully. Steel output in the United States, having dropped from 103.8 million tonnes in 1980 to 67.8 million tonnes in 1985, began to grow again. [Andriyanov] As is well known, the Government of the Russian Federation adopted the Federal Program for the Retooling and Development of Russia's Metallurgy designed until the year 2000. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA discussed it in detail. [Generalov] We are grateful for this to the newspaper. There is no modern state without metal. The consumption of finished rolled metal products and steel pipes is sharply declining in Russia. At the same time, metal products, which ensure the vitality of the state economy, remain unclaimed. They include transport metal, rails, and wheels (a 30-percent reduction in consumption), pipes for gas lines and wells (30 percent), bearing steel (40 percent), and cables (20 percent). The consumption of nonferrous metals is being reduced. [Andriyanov] As far as I know, in our country the per-capita consumption of aluminum is one-tenth of that in the United States. At the same time, we are reducing aluminum production by 500,000 tonnes in 1994. How to understand this? [Generalov] We are being forced out from the foreign market, which we have barely entered. They say that, as a result of the increase in the export of aluminum from Russia in recent years, its price has dropped sharply. However, this is only part of the truth. Aluminum production has increased in a number of countries and the "credit" for the decline in the prices of this metal is joint. [Andriyanov] Discriminatory practice with respect to Russian producers continues on the world market. Nevertheless, metallurgists have been able to increase the export of foreign metals. [Generalov] The export of ferrous metals has doubled, totaling 3.5 to 4 billion dollars. One-half went to Asian countries, 33.9, to Western Europe, and 4.9 percent, to America. The share of finished products has increased in the export structure. The export of nonferrous metals has declined, totaling 2 billion dollars, that is, half a billion less than in 1992. The reduction was due to the rise in prices of energy resources and fuel in the second half of 1993. In the fourth quarter the Government of Russia revised export duties, which made it possible to partially restore the efficiency of the export of metal products. On the whole, however, only 10 to 15 percent of the domestic metal products can compete on the world market. And so, there is no end of the work to be done here.
