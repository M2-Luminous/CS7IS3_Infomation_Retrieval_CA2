There is wide range of consensus on ways of settling the Bosnian conflict following the agreement which was signed in Washington and the Zagreb talks involving the Russian side. Kinkel and Kozyrev are convinced that, even after the Hebron tragedy, areas for Palestinian-Israeli contact have emerged. Bonn will support us over cooperation with the G-7, the European Union and the Council of Europe. Kinkel noted that there were two reasons for the visit: firstly, the meeting of the mixed commission on the return of cultural treasures and, secondly, preparations for the May visit by President Yeltsin to Germany.
