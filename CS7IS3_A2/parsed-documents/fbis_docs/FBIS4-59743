[passage omitted] One minister told AL-HAYAH that "since the political crisis erupted in Beirut Damascus has avoided taking part in the campaigns or focusing light on the dispute, either through its official media services or sources in Lebanon." The minister adds: "We had thought that the Syrian vice president would head directly for Beirut after his return from Johannesburg, or that the three leaders [president, prime minister, and Chamber of Deputies speaker] would go to Damascus to search for a solution to the crisis. I was surprised by the Syrian leadership's announcement the moment the crisis started that it has nothing to do with the conflict and that it prefers not to intervene in favor of any party. Damascus believes that for the three leaders to reach an understanding is the guarantee for bringing an end to the political conditions resulting from the prime minister's seclusion. It will make no move as long as the estrangement among the three leaders persists. It continues to stress the need to reach an understanding and an agreement, saying that it will support such an agreement." [passage omitted] A leading Lebanese figure who visited Damascus recently says that "as the Syrian leadership is preparing to receive Christopher -- if the date of the visit is not changed -- it refuses to exploit what is happening among its most prominent allies in Lebanon, as though it wants to send a message to Washington to the effect that it is capable of getting hold of the Lebanese card in both thick and thin." The leading Lebanese figure adds: "For this reason, it has decided not to intervene to exercise its mediation ability and to bring an end to it, lest it is said it is behind the crisis. Besides, the regional concern, with which it is preoccupied fully, prompts it to control the situation, especially as the dispute is among allies." [passage omitted]
