The Army advocates turning Cinciberlant [Commander in Chief, Iberian-Atlantic Area] into an integrated command, and has in mind assistance for infrastructures. The United States will be looking at Tancos. Madeira and the Azores are the only Portuguese territories formally coming under both a national and a NATO military command. Their respective integrated commands answer to the Armed Forces chief of staff, who appoints them, and the Cinciberlant, who in turn comes under Saclant -- Supreme Allied Commander. As far as the mainland territory is concerned, there has recently been a situation of dichotomy. The Iberlant command, which from the setting up of the alliance's military structure held responsibility only for the territory's maritime defense, has for several years had an Air Force "antenna," and forms the link with Saceur -- Supreme Allied Commander, Europe -- as far as air defense is concerned. Defense of the "ground" remains a wholly national responsibility, which is not the case for any other member of the allied military structure on this side of the Atlantic. The alliance treaty says that an attack on any one of the member countries is an attack on all of them, but it also states that the defense of their respective territories is primarily a national responsibility. That is, it pledges assistance, but in terms of "reinforcement." All the European countries in the allied integrated military structure are covered by plans to that effect, and the forces assigned to each of them are known, except for Portugal. And for a simple reason: They do not exist, despite Portugal's having units assigned to the ground defense of its allies (the Separate Mixed Brigade and the Airborne Brigade). Portugal, a founder of the alliance which has always been a member of its integrated military structure, thus finds itself in a situation almost comparable with that of France and Spain, which, not belonging to that structure, have introduced into it the idea of a "NATO a la carte." The situation stems from the strategic stance adopted by Salazar (to be in it, without being in it...), which, in a scenario of a limited to the integrity of the mainland territory, had two other instruments: The Iberian Pact and the ZIC [expansion unknown] Agreement, which linked Madrid and Washington, was in force until Spain's entry into NATO and envisaged an operations area which covered Portugal. The situation is also partly a result of the Army's involvement in Africa from the beginning of the sixties. Today, following the experience of taking part in meetings at the headquarters of Saclant (Norfolk), under which the Azores and Madeira come, and the increasing presence in NATO's command bodies in Europe, the Army has "woken up." It advocates the mainland territory's incorporation into a NATO command. It also advocates that Cinciberlant, which currently has air-sea characteristics, be turned into an integrated command in the "full" sense of the term. NATO's new military structure has already been redesigned. NATO's Atlantic command experiences no changes; the Channel command, which used to cooperate with the European command with respect to air defense, disappears; and it is in the last-mentioned command (Allied Command Europe) that changes are noted, as well as an increase in Britain's responsibility in the northern areas. The center command (Commander in Chief, Allied Forces, Central Europe) acquires responsibility for air defense over the Baltic. This structure has already achieved consensus in NATO but is not yet official. In allied military circles, it is maintained that the Portuguese initiative, if it materializes, is unlikely to be taken into account now, owing to the delay with which it comes about. In Portugal, the last word will rest with the government, and, in particular with the defense minister, under whose aegis studies are taking place. In advocating the mainland territory's incorporation into one of the NATO commands, the Army has in mind not so much the assigning of allied forces for its defense as securing financial assistance for infrastructures such as the bases of Sao Jacinto or Tancos, which it has just received from the Air Force and where it has installed the new Airborne Brigade. "Why should the Italian command, under which the brigade comes for NATO purposes, benefit from all the assistance? Why does use of the brigade have to pass previously through Italy?" an Army general asked, talking to DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. In that officer's opinion, the mainland territory's incorporation would make it possible not only to secure funds to which the Army does not have access at present, but also for Portugal to be viewed in a different light in the alliance, owing to a "total presence." However, according to a well-placed source, there are those at the Defense Ministry, whose minister has not yet made a pronouncement, who maintain that the initiative could help destabilize the traditional Portuguese geostrategic position in the transatlantic axis. It is asserted there that the solution to the Army's needs could be found in another way: The United States will certainly be looking at Tancos in the framework of its plans for the forward defense of its own interests.
