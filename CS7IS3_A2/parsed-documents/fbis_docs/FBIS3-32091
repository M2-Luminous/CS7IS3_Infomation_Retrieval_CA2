He also tabled a resolution condemning the justice minister and the attorney general. Pindling claimed that new evidence had surfaced in the abrupt resignation of the Jamaican judge. Additional information, he claimed, has convinced the opposition that the 17-month-old government, through Justice Minister Janet Bostwick, interfered with the judicial process. Pindling, former prime minister of 25 years, also claimed that Attorney General Orville Turnquest presented a misleading position in a television interview, and that Ingraham misled parliament in a communication on the matter. Ingraham branded Pindling's allegation an "outright lie." He said he had no problem with such a debate and offered to change the House of Assembly's agenda on Wednesday and Thursday to accommodate the PLP. "It is dead wrong for Sir Lynden Pindling to seek to mislead the Bahamian public and bring into contempt the judicial system," Ingraham said. The government, he continued, was completely satisfied that it acted in the best interest of the people and consistent with its oath of office to uphold the laws of The Bahamas. Rowe resigned in December after the Ministry of Justice, through the registrar of the supreme court, told him that it was not prepared to facilitate his presence in Nassau to hear an appeal challenging the lawfulness of a commission of inquiry appointed to investigate allegations of misuse of public funds under the former Pindlng regime. The appeal was lodged by Maurice Glinton, lawyer for Phillip Herman Bethel. The inquiry was told that Bethel indirectly received a substantial amount of maoney that had been paid by Boeing of Canada as commission on the sale of Dehavilland aircraft to the state-owned Bahamasair. Bethel is the son of Philip Bethel, a former Bahamasair chairman and PLP minister. During the recent hearing, Justice Vincent Melville, chairman of The Bahamas Court of Appeals, stated that he was telephoned by Justice Rowe last December 4. Justice Rowe informed the president that he had an application for Glinton. Justice Melville said he informed Justice Rowe not to deal with the matter as there was someone in The Bahamas who could deal with it. Glinton had flown to Jamaica to get Justice Rowe to entertain his application. Ingraham said that the chief justice of The Bahamas has always dealt with applications of appeal since the court of appeal was established in The Bahamas 28 years ago. Ingraham said that his government was sworn to uphold the laws of The Bahamas and not to allow anyone "under any cloak" to subvert the laws of the country.
