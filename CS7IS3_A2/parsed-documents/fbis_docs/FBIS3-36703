Compared to previous plans for resolving this issue, as well as the "sale" of the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to decrease Kiev's debt for energy-carriers and granting the Russian side rights to a long- term lease of the Sevastopol naval base and virtually all of the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure, these proposals envisage Russian laws in force on the territory, which is leased. The proposals have been prepared for the meeting between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, which Boris Yeltsin requested of Leonid Kravchuk in a personal letter on 15 January 1994.
