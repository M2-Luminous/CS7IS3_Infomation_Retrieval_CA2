Granted following a proposal by Foreign Minister Willy Claes and Erik Derycke, secretary of state for development cooperation, this aid will be distributed through nongovernmental organizations, principally the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders, the communique states. Mr. Claes also welcomes the decision by Ayala Lasso, UN high commissioner for human rights, to visit Rwanda shortly to look at how the United Nations could help safeguard human rights, the communique continues. The high commissioner's proposal to devote a special session of the Human Rights Commission to human rights violations in Rwanda, which had also been suggested by Amnesty International, is supported by Belgium together with the decision to send permanent human rights observers to the region. Finally, Belgium is examining with its European Union partners what concrete measures could be taken to aid Rwandan refugees and protect threatened persons in Rwanda.
