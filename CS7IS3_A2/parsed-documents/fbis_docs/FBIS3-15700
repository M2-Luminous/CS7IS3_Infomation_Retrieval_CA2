Meanwhile your IZVESTIYA correspondent has been able to elucidate that a compromise regarding future cooperation between the branches of power has nevertheless been reached at recent meetings with the leaders of the two Federal Assembly chambers, I. Rybkin and V. Shumeyko. Consequently two groups comprising deputies and experts from the presidential apparatus are currently working on a draft new State Duma decree. Presidential aide G. Satarov described the significance of the forthcoming document (there may actually be two) and the objectives of the work. [Kononenko] Georgiy Aleksandrovich, whose initiative was it to adopt yet another decree in pursuit of the end which enabled the organizers of the revolt to leave Lefortovo? [Satarov] The president's, of course. He mentioned this in his letter to the State Duma dated 26 February, i.e. the letter he sent on that sad Saturday. In that letter the president expressed his regret at the form in which the amnesty decree had been adopted, and also set out two proposals. The first suggested additional work on the amnesty decree with a view to making it conform fully with the Russian Federation Constitution and legislation. The second proposed adopting a memorandum on a system of forms, criteria, and a mechanism designed to make politicians liable for ensuring civil peace and harmony. At the present time the outline of a joint memorandum envisaging the liability of individual parties and all branches of power for their actions and the situation in the country is being sketched out. [Kononenko] Did the president's 28 February meeting with the parliamentary chamber leaders provide the impetus for this cooperation? [Satarov] You could say that, since the preliminary agreements were finally coordinated at these meetings. First of all it was decided to set up working groups comprising representatives of the president, the lower chamber, and the Prosecutor's Office to formulate a supplementary State Duma decree. Second, agreement was reached on future working arrangements with the aim of insuring against a repetition of similar explosive situations; specifically, such situations should be discussed beforehand at the level of working groups when formulating extremely important decisions and draft laws. Third, they agreed on the need to minimize the damage to the sociopolitical situation caused by the amnesty decree. [Kononenko] By what means? [Satarov] Political and juridical. It was decided to explain to those who have benefited from the amnesty that they should not view the State Duma decree as some sort of political victory and that their earlier forms of activity are currently not needed by society. At I. Rybkin's suggestion, this task should be carried out by the factions of the lower chamber. Moreover, the General Prosecutor's Office is obliged to warn those who have benefited from the amnesty that they could be penalized if they break the amnesty terms. Finally, they should be notified that the appropriate services will be carefully following their every move. In the event of the slightest infringement of the law, both the president and the State Duma intend to clamp down on them in an extremely resolute fashion. We will not allow anything to get out of hand, and we will not tolerate any lawlessness that could lead to an explosive situation. [Kononenko] So are tabs currently being kept on the released prisoners? [Satarov] We have been watching them ever since they left jail. [Kononenko] During consultations over the last few days you have met with rank-and-file deputies and senior office-holders in the State Duma. Do you not get the feeling that those who voted for the amnesty are now rethinking certain points? [Satarov] One can note a certain alarm, a realization of the fact that they have made themselves hostages to the released prisoners' behavior. [Kononenko] At a 28 February briefing you announced that the president has a short-term action plan. A television address has not been ruled out. But for the time being he has taken no steps. [Satarov] We are talking about planned rather than extraordinary actions. For example, a list of priority legislative initiatives has already been sent to parliament along with a timetable for their submission. A plan of measures designed to resolve urgent social and economic problems has also been prepared, and so forth. [Kononenko] Ye. Gaydar has called on democrats to rally round in the face of the threat to civil peace in Russia. Do you share his view? [Satarov] Absolutely. The fact is that the establishment of a democratic state is far from completed, and in the current situation revanchists will always be tempted to exploit this fact. We need to consolidate the state -- as the president said in his message -- and ensure a democratic basis for the reforms.
