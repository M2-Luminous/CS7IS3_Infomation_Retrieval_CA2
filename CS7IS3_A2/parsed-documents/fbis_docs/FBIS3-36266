Aleksandr Glukhov, director of the European Department, has been appointed Russia's ambassador to that country. Author Chingiz Aytmatov, Russia's former envoy to the country, has received an offer from the Government of Kyrgyzstan to become ambassador to Brussels. The author, however, stated that his permanent residence is in Moscow and that he is in fact a citizen of Russia, while his artistic plans require his and his family's presence in Luxembourg. Apparently Aytmatov has obtained a residence permit to live in that country.
