He asserted that he had never before acted "with such overt disinterestedness," as he was not aspiring to any office. He made it clear that he intends "consolidating in 1994 what we began back in 1983." During a 15-minute speech broadcast by "Cronica TV," Alfonsin pointed out that "we want to ensure for the benefit of posterity a Constitution that will be a guarantee of justice, security, appropriate institutional order -- a Constitution that will not only be in force during the life spans of all those of you who are now listening to me, but surely those of your children and your children's children as well." Alfonsin, who is running as first UCR candidate for Buenos Aires in the Constituent Assembly elections, reiterated that he is not pursuing "any sort of personal interest." He put an end to any possible speculations by stating that he would in no case run for the presidency on the UCR ticket in 1995. Underscoring the value of political stability, Alfonsin gave the example of "what is happening in other countries" that are torn by social upheavals "despite the fact that everything seemed to be going like clockwork," thus alluding to the situation in Mexico. First, Alfonsin defended the idea of "pacts" in political life. He pointed out that this word derives from the word "peace," and stressed that some pacts "have been instrumental in solving many fundamental problems confronting countries from Latin American and other latitudes." To that effect he recalled the Fixed Point [Punto Fijo] Pact in Venezuela following Perez Gimenez's dictatorship, the Pact of Bogota after the death of Gaitan, the Pacts of La Moncloa in Spain in the wake of Francisco Franco's death, and the pact made in El Salvador between guerrillas and the government, which led to the 3 April elections. He also referred to Argentine history in recalling the "preexistent pacts" mentioned in the 1853 Constitution, which "were not made between people who voted for different parties at the polls, but rather between people who had charged one another with lances; between warlords commanding irregular armies of gauchos, who decided to organize our nation." Alfonsin upheld the argument that our country had been in "great danger" some months ago, a danger which could have ended with the reinstatement of the "incompatible refusals and tremendous confrontations" that generated the "climate ripe for coups d'etat" that had disrupted the constitutional order. Alfonsin asserted that the federal government "accepted the proposals" made by the UCR, which opened the door for the first constitutional amendment by consensus of the century. Among the most significant achievements of the agreement reached through the Olivos Pact, he highlighted the attenuation of the presidentialist system "to preclude any hegemonic pretension, any authoritarian slant, any encroachment upon the judiciary or upon Congress." Alfonsin emphasized the figure of cabinet chief, who "will be in charge of the administration, the implementation of the budget, the appointment of public servants, and the management of administrative resources, and will have to report -- as in any parliamentary system -- to Congress at least once a month." Alfonsin added: "We have also limited the power of issuing urgent and necessary decrees and the possibility of issuing partial vetoes and carrying out an intervention in the provinces when Congress is in recess. We have also prevented the transfer of powers from the legislative to the executive branch that would have excessively overloaded our presidential system." Alfonsin also emphasized the achievement of having changed the system to appoint judges through the formation of the Council of Magistrates and the mechanism for their removal through a judgment jury. "There is nothing that bothers a nation more than corruption," Alfonsin indicated, approving a preventive role in this area. This will involve assigning a constitutional status to the Office of the Comptroller General, which will be headed by a man or a woman appointed by the main opposition party. Alfonsin also explained the necessity of attempting to secure "a majority of UCR Constituent Assembly members" as "there are 15 approved points of paramount importance" on which there are disagreements with the proposals raised by the Justicialist Party. Among these disagreements, Alfonsin emphasized the federal system, municipal autonomy, environmental protection, defense of users and consumers, and the forms of semidirect democracy such as, for example, the referendum.
