The objective is to accommodate its large warships, particularly the Navy's 1,200-ton patrol vessels. He stated that Australia's northern region will definitely remain as the most important and strategic base for its Armed Forces. Apart from this, the development of infrastructure for its Navy will enable the country to launch more effective maritime operations. A before the announcement, Defense Minister Ray stressed that Indonesia is a "key nation" for Australia, in its strategic alliance, along with the other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. He presented a 75-page doctrine on security which for the first time unfolded the regional security situation since the end of the Cold War. He said other nations should first override Indonesia as an effort toward "assuring" the region's security. This means that our national and regional defense will be able to endure and suppress any ideological or physical threat. In December 1993, Australia's neighbor New Zealand, viewed with less importance the security in its northern region. According to their Defense Minister Gerald Hensley, his country's military was more concerned over the huge purchase of weapons by Asia-Pacific countries. He believes that these countries will continue their arms build-up at an annual rate of U.S.$131 billion until 1995. He also stated that by the end of the decade, the maritime network SLOC (Sea Lanes of Communication) [preceding expansion in English], which connects New Zealand and the rest of the Asian countries, will be patrolled by 1,800 modern Navy patrol craft, three dozen submarines, and 200 modern warships. Presently, most Australians believe that Indonesia forms a "threat from the north" and which still harbors a secret ambition of attacking the country. Whether we like it or not, we must accept this -- the same suspicion we had regarding China as our threat from the north. Australian and New Zealand officials are relentlessly embarking on diplomatic efforts toward forging more cordial relations regarding the Asia-Pacific region's security issues -- particularly with Indonesia. Australia and New Zealand, as the only "white group" in the region, have indicated their desire to lessen their dependence on the West, especially the United States and Britain. In this context, we observed that the ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand and the United States) military pact has become less effective. The two nations have increased their military cooperation through FPDA (Five Power Defense Arrangement), which also groups two other Asian nations -- Malaysia and Singapore. We also know of Australia's series of foreign policies which point to its good intentions of being identified as one of the countries belonging to the Asian grouping which undertakes the task of hastening the peace process in Cambodia; proposing reforms in APEC through cooperation [preceding word in English] toward becoming a community [preceding word in English]; advocating the desire of establishing an Asia-Pacific peace group to carry out the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security; and urge Australia's formidable opposition party, the Labor Party, to induce Prime Minister Paul Keating into fostering military cooperation with ASEAN. Currently, Australia has also become one of the potential countries selling weapons to Asia-Pacific countries. Indonesia -- along with South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia -- are attracted and are considering purchasing the diesel-powered Swedish designed Collins class submarine. As the Australian Navy is also operating this submarine, it could be considered that the sale is one of the efforts in the sale of "standard" military weapons to the region, a proposition currently being discussed by the region's major governments. Apart from this, Australia has a vision to become the Asia-Pacific region's submarine production center. Australia and Indonesia held their joint land military exercises in 1993 involving a number of their special task forces personnel. The two countries also held a 10-day joint naval exercise in August 1993. Two thousand personnel, 14 warships and six fighter aircraft from the two countries participated in the exercise -- the biggest joint military exercise held over the past 10 years. A joint air exercise was also conducted in November 1993 in Sumatera where Australia's F-18 Hornets and Indonesia's F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft participated. Following this, an annual bilateral meeting on defense cooperation was held in Jakarta centered on restructuring defense relations with Indonesia. The restructuring is aimed at establishing a formal defense cooperation structure similar to that which Australia has with Malaysia and Singapore. It is also understood that Indonesian troops will be invited to participate in the upcoming land military exercise to be hosted by Australia in north Australia. Even though criticism was hurled at the Indonesian Government by the Australian press, Indonesia-Australia defense cooperation, nonetheless, continues to remain intact since 1986. The time has come for Australians to eliminate all their suspicions about Indonesia being a potential threat given the above facts. Meeting with the visiting Australian Navy chief, Al Beaumont, at Bina Palace last year, President Suharto gave the assurance that Indonesia poses no threat to its neighbors and has no intention to threaten any other nations as this is in accordance with its defense and security policy. The assurance was issued within the context of Indonesia's purchase of 39 former East German warships which spontaneously created undue concern even though such a purchase was in line with Indonesia's need. It is true that the regional security situation is unpredictable during the post-Cold War era. Therefore, this will be the first occasion where ASEAN nations can freely and openly discuss issues pertaining to regional politics and security during the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in June in Bangkok. During the session, ASEAN foreign ministers have the opportunity to meet and hold discussions with their dialogue partners, including Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, known for his active participation in discussions on politics and security. This will be a good opportunity for Australia to grasp and assimilate political and security nuances in the Asia-Pacific region which will not be restructured by any Western influence. It can be clearly perceived that the Indonesia-Australia bilateral security cooperation continues to remain good. Australia's participation in the ARF has also indicated that it will greatly benefit by understanding "Asian trends" -- that is, if it still desires to be integrated into the Asian region. But all this will still prove inadequate until the Australian Government can convince its people that the Indonesian Government is not expansionist. We have been waiting for a long time for such a declaration. Such an announcement will enable us to further smooth and improve existing bilateral relations and defense cooperation.
