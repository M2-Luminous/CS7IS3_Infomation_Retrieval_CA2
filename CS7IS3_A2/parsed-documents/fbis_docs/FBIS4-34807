This is reported in an official communique disclosed by Fernando Reyes Matta, Chilean Foreign Ministry Cultural and Information Affairs Department director. The text of the communique states: "Through its Foreign Ministry, the Cuban Government has offered guarantees to the Chilean Government that these people will not be subjected to reprisals because of their illegal entrance into the consulate building. It also made assurances that this incident would not be used as an aggravating circumstance in any possible pending cases that these persons could be prosecuted for." The communique adds: "Before their departure from the Chilean Consulate, the eight persons handed a declaration to the Chilean consul general, Ambassador Patricio Pozo Ruiz, in which they state that they are voluntarily leaving the consulate office. They also express their gratitude for the treatment they received during their stay." The Chilean Government's official declaration concludes by stating: "In addition to expressing its satisfaction over the resolution of the situation affecting our consular mission and the cooperation rendered by Cuban officials, the Foreign Ministry wishes to explain that the consulate general offered protection exclusively for humanitarian reasons; and therefore under no circumstance should this action be interpreted as a granting of asylum, which was uncalled for in this case." Chilean President Eduardo Frei and Cuban President Fidel Castro had discussed the situation created by the entrance of eight Cubans into the Chilean Consulate in Havana during a meeting held within the framework of the recent Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena, Colombia. During a news conference, Castro stated that the issue was subject to the negotiations undertaken by the foreign ministries of the two countries. In Santiago, official Chilean sources had stated that the situation could continue because in view of the previous occupations of the Belgian and German Embassies, the Cuban Government had announced it would not issue exit permits. There was hope, however, of finding a solution prior to Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's visit to Chile, which is scheduled to take place in August.
