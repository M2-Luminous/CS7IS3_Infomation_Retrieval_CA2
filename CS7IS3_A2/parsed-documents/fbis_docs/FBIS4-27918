This is a report compiled by an advisory committee for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry by the Basic Issues Subcommittee of the Council for Industrial Structure (chaired by Kotaro Tsujimura). The report designates 12 areas as new and growing markets: housing, information/communications, energy, environment, medical/welfare, circulation/distribution, life culture/leisure, improvement of urban environment, international exchange, utilization of human resources, support for business, and new technology for new products. It also recommends further deregulation and strengthening of the policy to promote competition in each of these fields. Moreover, it proposes a shift of the industrial structure away from one dependent on export industries, such as automobiles and household appliances, to one determined by domestic demand. It points out that the smooth transfer of labor among industries is also indispensable and seeks an active policy for mobility in the labor market. The Council for Industrial Structure is scheduled to complete its final report on 16 June. Preceding that, the Council's Basic Issues Subcommittee will hold a joint meeting on 31 May with the Special Committee, which is in charge of administrative arrangements for the final report, and will firm up the outline. What is noteworthy in the report's content is that the industrial policy, which up until now has centered on the supplier (enterprises, public corporations, and so on), is changed, and a new consumer-oriented point of view is adopted. As for the hollowing of industries, with the premise of a high yen and the correction of the domestic-overseas price gap, it takes the position that we should not worry excessively about it. That is because "the move, to some extent, to overseas as an alternative to importing (hollowing) is a structural adjustment itself." On the whole, the report proposes that policies are necessary for: 1) macroeconomic measures which are centered around front- loaded enforcement of improvements in social overhead capital; 2) microeconomic reforms such as deregulation, correction of the domestic-overseas price gap, and so on; and 3) smooth restructuring (restructuring of enterprises), improvement of the capital procurement market for the growth of new industries, and so on. If these were to be realized, the real growth rate for the Japanese economy would be about 3.2 percent annually until the year 2000. Thereafter, it would be able to maintain about 2.4 percent, and the ratio of the current account surplus to the gross national product (GNP) would be held to between one and two percent. As for housing, among the new/growing markets, it sets a target for housing costs to be reduced to two thirds of the current figure (90,000 yen [Y] to Y120,000 per square meter) and space to be increased by 30 percent (to 40 square meters per person). This will be done through a review of zoning regulations and promotion of the introduction of imported residential buildings which, in turn, will result from reform of construction standards. As for the utilization of human resources, to accomodate the aging population and women's new role in society, the principles of of the Employment Stability Law's prohibitory regulations which govern employment agencies are to be reviewed. And at the same time, the type of jobs to which human resources can be allocated are to be increased. Further, the tax laws which involve severance pay and annuities, which have been disadvantageous for people who change jobs, are to be reformed. And a diverse employment situation which also includes non-long term and nonsecure employment is to be developed, and fluidity in the labor market is to be advanced. The report takes up deregulation as a significant subject among new industrial policies. In addition to housing/land, information/communications, and import promotion, which the Headquarters for Administrative Reform Promotion is now studying, the report points out that the field of finance/securities/insurance should be examined. Besides deregulation, it mentions the promotion of competition. It calls for examination of Anti-Monopoly Law violations as possible causes for a demand to cease undesirable practices under terms of the Unfair Competition Prevention Law. Furthermore, it advocates review of prohibitory rules for bonafide share-holding companies and of merger regulations. Further, it seeks to improve the corporation partition provision of the Commercial Law, and to simplify procedures for the merger/transfer of operations. As for the nurturing of new industries, it says that reform of the finance/capital market is indispensable for diversification of capital fund procurement measures.
