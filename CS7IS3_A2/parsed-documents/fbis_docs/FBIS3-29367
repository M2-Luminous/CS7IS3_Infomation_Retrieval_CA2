The move is to be taken on President Kim Yong-sam's instruction that public servants learn management expertise from the business circles in light of the need to increase the nation's competitiveness, the official said. Five teams of officials are being sent to the training centers of such companies as Samsung, Kolon and Lucky-Goldstar. The first eight-member team attended the Samsung Training Center in Yongin, Kyonggi Province, on Feb. 14-16. They listened to lectures on business survival strategies, new administrative skill, and ways to increase competitiveness in the world market along with other participants from private companies and government bodies. "The lectures' contents seemed somewhat unfamiliar, but they were still helpful," an official said.
