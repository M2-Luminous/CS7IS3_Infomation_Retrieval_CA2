A whole host of articles in various mass media sources have been devoted to the catastrophic situation in the Russian Navy and its level of combat effectiveness. The article by Captain First (Retired) Ilya Kolton is the culmination of this long history, which reveals not only the criminal negligence on the part of the Navy leadership in the matter of ensuring the combat effectiveness of Russian nuclear submarines, but also the monstrous bureaucratic red tape at all levels of power today. In Place of an Epigraph: If a wily and perfidious leadership, showing no consideration for the well-being of the fatherland, wanted, for its own gain, to reduce our Navy to the point of possible annihilation, even it could not place it in a position any more contemptuous or any more impotent than the one in which it is today. Vasiliy Golovnin (1776-1831), Russian seafarer, participant in an around-the-world voyage, and, from 1823 onward, chief naval quartermaster. The use in the 1950's of nuclear-powered devices on submarines by the United States and the USSR allowed them to conduct lengthy secret operations under water. It is this which predetermined their role as a nuclear missile carrier and became a component (the naval one) of strategic offensive arms. However, by the end of the 1960's, this key combat asset had been lost by our nuclear-powered submarines. The main reason -- the unacceptable, if not criminal, negligence on the part of certain home-grown scientists, designers, and the Navy leadership -- that is, all those who preside over naval shipbuilding -- in respect of the problem of reducing the underwater noise levels of nuclear-powered submarines, their main detection factor. On the other hand, the United States and the countries of NATO, applying the principle of complex acoustic design to their nuclear-powered submarines, which meant according absolute priority to the underwater noise level over all other combat characteristics (speed, depth of submergence, and so on), reduced the noise levels of their nuclear-powered submarines tens of times over and thus improved their detection range hundreds of times over [povisili v sotni raz dalnost vzaimnogo obnaruzheniya]. They developed a whole series of models of torpedoes and mines with acoustic self-guidance systems, plus a whole range of other important measures was implemented pertaining to combat our submarines on the basis of their high noise level. As for us, knowing, as we did, from intelligence reports the direction in which the United States' submarine strategy was developing, we stuck with the old principles of submarine building expounded back in 1742 by Yefim Nikonov, who was the first person to create a "hidden vessel" and test its submergence and navigability under water in the River Neva. Our guys, failing to alter the philosophy of submarine building since that time, as if out of bloody-mindedness continued to design noisy submarines. Breaching laws and the methodology of testing, they fraudulently supplied and continue to supply the fleet -- with the consent of the naval commander in chief -- with unbattleworthy floating targets which are both unreliable and dangerous to use. In this way, the combat efficacy of the Navy has been brought to the level of the absurd. We did not want a sensation on this subject in the open press. There was, after all, a real possibility of resolving this problem on a bilateral basis without humiliating the military-industrial complex, the Navy, and those who served and serve it faithfully. Indeed, 1990 even saw the conclusion of just such an alliance with Admiral F. Novoselov, deputy naval commander in chief for shipbuilding and weaponry, and we supported nuclear-powered submarine projects, but, clearly, this move did not fit into V. Chernavin's plans. So we were forced to enter into open discussion with V. Chernavin in the press, at times making use of officially classified information which, in point of fact, was really being kept secret from our only own people. After this, we made repeated appeals to all state authorities, including the newfangled Russian Security Council (Yu. Sokolov, V. Rubanov, V. Manilov, Yu. Nazarkin, B. Ilin), with a single request: That we might be given a chance in their presence to defend the truth in honorable battle. However, even for these people, directly answerable under the Law "On Security" for the country's defense capability, this venture was unsuitable. Nobody from among the state officials noticed our pointed, revealing articles in newspapers and magazines, giving the impression that they had never read them. But then came the "first sign" which we had been patiently awaiting -- V. Chernavin's article in PRAVDA 9 February this year entitled "Paper Boats in the Sea of Life." The former navy commander in chief came down angrily on the conclusion that "our nuclear submarines, the basis of the Navy's nuclear might and a component of the strategic nuclear forces, are a sham. They are merely a maneuver to show that our country does still have a combat capable fleet. We go to sea, churn up the waters in the ocean, but this is as effective as beating the air. Missile-armed submarines cannot in principle bear any combat significance or effect any combat service.... The Americans are hundreds of times superior in terms of detection range. The upshot is that they, secretly tracking our missile-armed submarines from the first to the last moment they are at sea, stick with them, as if they had a dog on a lead...." In the article V. Chernavin described this, albeit bitter, truth as a "monstrous lie." But it is this bitter truth which has been communicated in the open press and in dispatches to the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR KGB since as far back as 1974 not only by me, a mere mechanical engineer who, in V. Chernavin's words, is unfit to discuss the problems of naval strategy, but also by admirals and top nuclear-powered vessel commanders with a conscience and a feeling of responsibility toward their people. Incidentally, while V. Chernavin was floundering emotively in the airy "strategy" of conducting underwater warfare, submarine experts in the United States condensed actual underwater strategy to ensuring the secrecy of the actions of their own submarine forces, which was sufficient for our submarine forces to find themselves in the role of a blind and deaf boxer striving to win a fight against the invisible man. Unlike V. Chernavin, Fleet Admirals G. Yegorov and N. Smirnov, Admiral N. Amelko, Vice Admirals R. Golosov, V. Kruglyakov, and Ye. Chernov, Captains First Rank A. Alekseyev, Yu. Beketov, A. Gorbachev, V. Zhukovskiy, V. Zaznobin, V. Loboshinskiy, G. Melkov, A. Khraptovich, and many others, bravely sought to extricate our submarine forces from this humiliating position, and to ward off the unprecedented damage being inflicted on the Navy, society, and the state as a result of huge accidents and catastrophes involving weaponry and military hardware. But in vain. They were prevented by V. Chernavin. They were distanced from vital naval affairs. Unfortunately, it is an old Russian custom that such people are needed only at times of war and extreme difficulty. K. Simonov put it well in a poem entitled "Aleksandr Suvorov": "In peacetime, we are like estranged sons, but in wartime we are all brothers together!" In times of peace, the people leading the dance are people like V. Chernavin. You didn't have to be a great strategist to organize the 1987 "spectacular" -- the naval operation described by him in the article "Paper Boats in the Sea of Life," which, in his words, "...seriously worried the Pentagon and prompted questions of a highly pertinent nature in the U.S. Congress...." It is clear to the submarine engineer and the schoolboy alike that this naval operation was designed to disinform. Judge for yourself. Five missile-armed submarines were earmarked to take turns carrying out alert duty at sea for one year. To fulfill the prescribed task, which was part of a plan to use on a rota basis one missile-armed submarine at a time, the naval commander in chief sent all five to sea at once. The question arises: How will the naval commander in chief carry out the task of defending Russia and the CIS countries from the sea for the other 80 percent of the year if the division's annual sortie quota for missile-armed submarines, and unreliable ones at that, is completely used up? Let's cite a few excerpts from documents testifying to this very real state of affairs. Top Secret: From a letter from Academician A.P. Aleksandrov and Fleet Admiral G.M. Yegorov to the USSR president: "As practice has shown, over recent decades every one of our missile-armed strategic submarines has been under constant and clandestine surveillance affording a high level of readiness to destroy them on order, which leaves no grounds to believe it possible that the task of Russia's defense, even in restricted coastal regions of military action, can be effected." Thus, in his article, V. Chernavin tries to mislead the public, and first and foremost the Russian Federation Security Council, by mentioning the apparently high combat potential of our naval strategic nuclear system: "The success of this operation meant a great deal in terms of my international prestige too. NATO strategists had to be aware, with the departure of the former commander in chief, Admiral of the Soviet Fleet S.G. Gorshkov, who did so much to bring our ships out into the expanses of the world ocean, that not only does his successor not intend to surrendering the positions acquired, but will play a new, more profound and more acute game..." The gravity of this stance is not only that V. Chernavin is concerned about his prestige in the United States and his own country all at once, but also fact that, to the detriment of the country's defense capabilityity, he takes the urgency out of the problem of the struggle to increase the combat efficiency of the actions of our submarines. Top Secret: From Security Ministry files (N. Golushko) to Russian Federation General Prosecutor V. Stepankov. "The crux of the problem resides in the fact that the elaboration of areas of development of hydroacoustic complexes and self-guidance systems for underwater weaponry, appraisal of the effectiveness and principles of a decision on new designs for nuclear submarines, the elaboration of comprehensive programs for antisubmarine warfare, and, finally, the actual planning of combat operations involving calculations of the optimum force configuration, is directly linked with the need to have a precise knowledge of the characteristics of the noise levels of our own submarines and those of a probable opponent. Any distortion of information in this sphere will cause tremendous damage both in the matter of developing weapons and military hardware for the Navy and also in that of planning its combat activity and, ultimately, the country's defense capability." To this day, V. Chernavin's objections to the introduction of proposals opening the way to ratifying START II without damaging the country's defense capability do not add up and dispel doubts about the objectivity of our conclusions on the point of this "acticity" by V. Chernavin. After all, these proposals remove the deficiencies of the naval component of START II in the shortest possible space of time and with minimum material outlay. They were supported by the submarine engineers of the Northern and Pacific Fleets, scientists, and designers, and they were substantiated by the results of interdepartmental reconstructions and tactical exercises in the period from 1982 through 1986. The experience gained was analyzed by the departments, and in 1985 it was approved at the Navy Military-Technical Council and recommended for introduction on nuclear submarines. However, through the efforts of the Navy commander in chief, everything sunk into oblivion. Top Secret: From Security Ministry files (N. Golushko) to Russian Federation General Prosecutor V. Stepankov. "At the same time, it should be noted that Navy Commander in Chief V.N. Chernavin, who, since as far back as 1974, has had a negative attitude toward these proposals for reasons known only to himself, through his 1987 directive declined to introduce them owing to their low effectiveness and potential danger in questions of nuclear submarine survivability...." (This refers to the introduction of proposals guaranteeing the secrecy of the actions of nuclear submarines -- I.K) Furthermore, in a bid to please V. Chernavin, the USSR Defense Ministry Inspectorate for the Nuclear Safety of Nuclear Installations defined these proposals as potentially dangerous. In the experts' view, the conclusion drawn by the inspectorate (Vice Admiral N. Bisovka) was "highly unconvincing, contradictory, and, in point of fact, aimed at discrediting the proposals." Meanwhile, V. Chernavin was speaking out indignantly during the 1993 election campaign ("Civic Union") in respect of "the country's decrepit defense," and he felt no responsibility for the collapse of the Navy, in which, back in the pre-perestroyka era, he had played an active part. Both the loss of strategic parity at sea and the possibility of restoring it with minimum outlay in the shortest possible space of time, to which V. Chernavin objected so strongly, were subsequently repeatedly borne out by Academician A.P. Aleksandrov and Fleet Admiral G.M. Yegorov in letters to the USSR president and USSR defense minister, in a comprehensive survey by the Russian Federation Security Ministry sent to the Russian Federation general prosecutor, in a letter from Fleet Admiral G.M. Yegorov and a group of admirals and naval officers to Marshal of Aviation Ye.I. Shaposhnikov, and in an article entitled "Road to Tsushima" (LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, 01.09.92). The USSR KGB, the USSR Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office also made repeated appeals for this problem and the Navy's proposals to be examined by the highest authorities. Top Secret: From a letter from Deputy General Prosecutor N. Shakleyin to Vice Premier G. Khizha. "...Expressing alarm on the subject of the circumstances listed, Kolton raises the question of imposing order in the matter of supplying the Navy with ships and weaponry, abolishing erroneous decisions by administrative organs, and also calling guilty officials to account.... "...The repeated incidence of accepting into the effective strength of the Navy ships and vessels with imperfections and defects is confirmed also by materials at the disposal of the prosecutor's oversight body.... An evaluation of information cited concerning the military-technical policy conducted in recent years, as well as the technical level and combat readiness of the Navy, goes beyond the bounds of the competence of the bodies of the Prosecutor's Office. At the same time, leaving these questions unattended may lead to serious consequences.... "...The former USSR Prosecutor's Office submitted an appeal on this score to the USSR Cabinet of Ministers 23 July 1991, and to the chairman of the Interrepublic Economic Committee 20 November 1991, but with no result...." This request was also heard repeatedly in appeals by ordinary citizens to B.N. Yeltsin and other officials -- R. Khasbulatov, G. Burbulis, A. Rutskoy, Yu. Skokov, Yu. Petrov, N. Trubin, V. Stepankov, V. Panichev, V. Barannikov, S. Stepashin, A. Piskunov, V. Ochirov, L. Sharin, A. Lapygin, A. Kotenkov, I. Shalatonov, P. Grachev, and others. However, all the appeals were examined merely in a cursory manner, with unfounded negative conclusions, or else they were not examined at all. One hazy area is the fact that a large section of state officials, including some from the Russian Security Council who are directly responsible for the country's security, shied away in panic not only from a decision but even from familiarizing themselves with this problem, as if they feared getting burned, and immediately forwarded the documents for conclusion by the main culprits: Fleet Admiral V. Chernavin, general designer I. Spaskiy, Academician Gaponov-Grekhov, and others. Once there, this issue was resolved one-sidedly, tendentiously, and with blatant falsehood and cynicism, refuting the positive results of reconstructions and tactical exercises, the experience of testing and using Naval ships -- that is, the truth. You do not have to look far for examples. Here before us is the conclusion of Academicians I. Spasskiy (USSR Supreme Soviet deputy from the "Red Hundred") and S. Kovalev (both, incidentally, heroes of socialist labor, the latter twice over), two of the most authoritative general designers in the military-industrial complex, prepared by them in 1985 for my report to the Navy commander in chief on supplying the Navy's combat complement with non-combatworthy submarines. Under the stamp "Top Secret," the two academicians expound what is actually not secret information: "...For the first time in many years of work developing submarines we have run up against the fact of representatives of the apparatus of the Navy Standing Commission for State Acceptance issuing a document which is unprecedented in terms of lack of objectivity, incompetence, and crudeness. We hope that the appearance of this document is an accident determined purely by subjective factors.... I. Kolton's statement that the efficiency of the actions of the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarines is incommensurably higher than ours is unfounded and tendentious.... Statements by the author such as 'industry, with the consent of the Naval Main Directorate for Components Supply, is setting norms for noise levels which lower the requirements of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers' are a gross lie insulting to the collectives of the bureaus and the construction plants. They also discredit the work of the author's colleagues who accepted these nuclear submarines, and of the Navy command, which is apparently ignorant about the level of secrecy of the actions of our nuclear submarines.... Considering the aforestated, designers at the Central Design Bureau deem unacceptable the practice of the appearance of documents of this ilk, as they harm the great and complex work to reduce the noise levels of nuclear submarines which is constantly being done by the shipbuilding industry." It seems appropriate to remind these academicians of an old saying: "Jupiter, you are angry -- that means you are not right." And indeed, both academicians lied. They lied. And seven years later, the very same I. Spasskiy was forced to admit to MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent Yu. Teplyakov (no. 48 1992) that: "Our submarines are dozens of times less efficient than the Americans' in terms of noise levels. At high speeds, they are defenseless...." But even in admitting part of the truth, the academician nevertheless continued to lie. Why is it only at high speeds that they are defenseless? They are defenseless at low speeds, at which a missile-carrier's main task has to be carried out. Considering our distorted system for weapons and military hardware supplies, it is possible to some extent to sympathize with these academicians. But what can be our attitude toward statesmen who should monitor and control this process? I will cite an example. In September, for the purposes of checking the activity of the USSR KGB, including in respect of the aforementioned problems of the Navy, B. Yeltsin appointed a commission under the leadership of S. Stepashin, and I got the chance to expound my view to this commission. The documents submitted by me contained substantiated proof that the USSR KGB leadership, upon receiving objective information acquired with great difficulty by their subordinates, presented it for specific ends to the higher authorities in the interests of lobby groups in a mode transformed as required by them. At that time S. Stepashin and his commission (A. Kotenkov and I. Shalatonov) successfully, and over a long period of time, hid the problem of the Navy's combat effectiveness from the Russian Federation president. It could not have been otherwise, if the president failed to react to the crime of the century. Again, my repeated appeals afterwards to S. Stepashin and A. Piskunov had no effect, as the documents were returned to me, and they ignored the instructions of the Seventh Congress of People's Deputies, at which I had appealed on this issue. It is an interesting fact that people who have concealed the Navy's ills have made steady advances in the service and have risen in the ranks in a way that even D. Yakubovskiy never dreamed of. For example, A. Kotenko and I. Shalatonov, patrons of the military-industrial complex and of V. Chernavin, dilettantes who displayed no special qualities at all, made breathtaking strides in the space of a year in terms of ranks and posts. Furthermore, Rear Admiral I. Shalatonov, chief of the defense, security, and internal affairs department of the State Legal Administration under the president, is acting in an utterly strange way, as a provocateur. He intercepted a letter I sent to B.N. Yeltsin (the eighth to go unanswered) on problems of the country's defense capability and safeguarding the security of military activity! He has been beating about the bush for a year now and, apparently, has no intention at all of reporting it to the head of state (although he swore to do so). Moreover, the secret document I gave to him for signing, exposing the military-industrial mafia, has not come back. Evidently, he has hidden it from the president, together with other documents relating to questions of the country's defense capability and the security of military service. The very people who had a profound grasp of these problems, that is, Yu. Boldyrev, V. Bakatin, and A. Alekseyev, people prepared to expose the military-industrial mafia, were removed from their posts. Top Secret: From a Security Ministry (N. Golushko) report to Russian Federation General Prosecutor V. Stepankov. "Competent specialists note that all the evaluations made by the Mavy, military-industrial complex, and scientists in response to appeals to the authorities by A.P. Aleksandrov, G.M. Yegorov, and I.B. Kolton during the 1988-1990 period, as a rule grossly distort and frequently falsify positive results obtained in trials and tactical exercises in the 1982-1986 period, and are intended in the main to confirm the invalid decision made earlier by navy Commander in Chief V. Chernavin, set out in the 1987 directive. "At the same time, specialists believe that the results of interdepartmental trials and tactical exercises and combat practice makr it possible to draw the valid conclusion that there is an urgent need to present proposals primarily for tactical situations where their positive properties could have a significant impact on making the combat use of the Navy more effective. "Specialists believe that the solution of this key naval problem in this way would fully meet the demands of the new defensive doctrine and conform to the principle of reasonable defense sufficiency." V. Chernavin, acutely aware of the impending danger, was always able to duck responsibility and had the ability to "make himself scarce," to use the colloquial expression. This ability of his was strikingly manifested during the incidents involving the loss of the nuclear-powered missile-armed craft in 1986 and the nuclear-powered submarine "Komsomolets" in 1989 and in the 1991 political crisis. But he did manage to do something for himself: He organized some jingoistic pamphlets singing his praises, and a six-part movie is being shot in the United States on our nuclear fleet. And who is the chief hero of it? You guessed. The activities of V. Chernavin and his "pals" seem extremely conservative to us: the way they seek close contacts with the military-industrial complex and impede any positive process in the Navy if the introduction of its results runs the risk of dissatisfaction on the part of or loss of contacts with "useful people" who helped them up the ladder of power. A poor outlook, to be frank. V. Chernavin, with his talents, reminds one of the story of General Kuropatkin, who was appointed commander in chief of the Manchurian Army by Nicholas II. The general was honest with the emperor, telling him that the lot had fallen upon him precisely because Russia was so desperately short of talented cadres. Modern-day Admiral of the Fleet V. Chernavin is incapable of thinking in this way. Having left the grand office of commander in chief of the Navy, V. Chernavin is compensating for the loss in the area of public "recognition" of his talents. He is an honorary member of the "Sharkhan Stars" [name as transliterated] international union of submariners in the United States and a member of the union's journal's editorial collegium in the FRG; he is a respected figure in the Russian Federation president's team and in the Russian Government -- director (for the moment) and member of the collegium of the State Maritime History and Culture Center. He is also president of the "Okeanotekhnika" association; he is president of the union of navy submariners; he is a member of the board of the Naval Aviation Check Investment Fund... When one analyzes this story, the inevitable question arises: Who is calling the tune? The military-industrial mafia, extracting credits for dangerous, third-rate projects that reduce to naught not only the the country's defensive capability, but its economy as well? Will our rulers heed the people's cri de coeur on this occasion, heed the truth about the Navy on the eve of its 300th anniversary celebrations?
