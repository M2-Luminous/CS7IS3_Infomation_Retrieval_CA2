Youth and Experience Argued in the Far East About the Middle East"] [Excerpts] The Vladivostok airport was the venue for yesterday's meeting between Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Their discussions had been expected to center on the Balkans. But recent events introduced some changes: The Kozyrev-Christopher meeting in the Far East was preceded by their urgent trips to the Middle East, thus the interlocutors paid considerable attention precisely to the problem of getting the Arab- Israeli talks back on track. According to an official version, the Vladivostok meeting is supposed to "have plastered over the cracks" that have run across the building of Russo-American relations. Despite the upbeat tone of the joint statement, more cracks may develop soon. [passage omitted] The meeting in Vladivostok has revealed some differences -- this time around, those of the sides' approach to the Middle East settlement. The Russian Foreign Ministry head arrived for the meeting from the Middle East without calling at Smolenskaya Square [ministry's headquarters in Moscow]. The upshot of his talks with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunisia on Friday was the Palestinians' agreement in principle to return to the negotiating table. The Arabs, for that matter, demanded for themselves guarantees of security via an international presence on the Israel-occupied territories. Having backed the PLO's demands, Russia also thought that the talks could only be resumed after the Arabs and Israel agree on the question of guarantees. The United States spoke for an immediate resumption of the talks. Remarkably, its actions in recent days were emphatically independent from Moscow. On Sunday, Christopher stated that U.S. efforts to get the Palestinian-Israeli talks resumed were successful. He made this statement after, having been overcome with curiosity to know what Kozyrev had been talking about, he phoned Israeli Premier Rabin and 'Arafat on Saturday night. Already yesterday, U.S. Middle East settlement coordinator Dennis Ross arrived in Tunisia for urgent consultations with the PLO. Literally hours after, it was announced that an Israeli delegation was also leaving for Tunisia to join in the consultations. That is to say, there is an obvious rivalry in Middle East peacemaking between Moscow and Washington. [passage omitted] Incidentally, local observers did not pass over the fact that the heads of diplomatic agencies did not meet in the local Negotiations House but at the airport -- and at the Americans' request. The formal reason was a banal shortage of time. According to rumors being whipped up in Vladivostok, however, Christopher had decided to respond to the hurt caused to ex-President Richard Nixon in Moscow.
