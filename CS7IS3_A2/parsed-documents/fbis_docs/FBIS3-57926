The seizure was the result of a long investigation of acquaintances of Murat Kaplan, a major Belgian criminal who is now behind bars and, as is well-known, had escaped from Saint-Gilles Prison on 3 May 1993. He fled with the help of two accomplices: Patrick Haemers, who was recaptured first, and Basri Bajrami, who is still at large. Murat Kaplan was recaptured in Zellik on 15 May. The discovery of this arsenal, which was only made possible by the close surveillance kept on Kaplan's girlfiend, clearly shows that the 31-year-old Kaplan, who is of Albanian origin, heads a well-organized gang. Did his "friends" hope to use the arms in support of Kaplan's umpteenth escape from prison? Kaplan is nicknamed the "prince of escapes?" Kaplan is no longer the gentleman burglar, which he had been for some time. He is one of Belgium's most notorious criminals. The arms discovered supposedly were used during an attack on the Laeken police station, a reprisal for the the arrest of Philippe Lacroix. At the time of the attack, Kaplan had not been captured.
