FBIS4-52913 "dreas094_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 South Korea DLP Demands Government Clarify Position on Nuclear Issue DLP Demands Government Clarify Position on Nuclear Issue SK1605052294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0500 GMT 16 May 94 SK1605052294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] demanded Monday that the government clarify its position on the North Korean nuclear row as the national policy on that issue is being clouded by remarks made by former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung in the United States. At a meeting of senior party postholders, presided over by Chairman Kim Chong-pil, the ruling party decided to urge the National Unification Board (NUB) to issue a clarifying statement on Kim Tae-chung's remarks, DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin said. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, told the meeting he could not understand Kim Tae-chung's reasons for making remarks that create uneasiness at a time when the entire nation is striving to resolve the nuclear dispute. Kim Chong-pil added that Kim Tae-chung's comments cannot be understood by the people, Pak said. THE WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Kim Tae-chung as saying Saturday that even if North Korea possessed two or three atomic bombs, it wouldn't be much of a problem compared with the United States' 20,000 nuclear warheads. The DLP is expected to make a formal request that the government clarify its North Korea policy when the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee meets in plenary session on Thursday. Pak said Kim Tae-chung's remarks, which "sounded like" support for North Korea's possession of nuclear bombs, were akin to pouring cold water on international efforts to stop Pyongyang from developing atomic weapons. More than a few people have doubts about Kim Tae-chung's reasons for making comments that are irresponsible and unthinkable to South Koreans, Pak said. Meanwhile, the main opposition Democratic Party accused the ruling party of taking Kim Tae-chung's remarks out of context and distorting them. Deputy spokesman Sol Hun recalled that Kim Tae-chung, the Democratic Party's former chairman, has in the past said many times that North Korea should not have nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Kim Tae-chung's latest comments mean that even if North Korea possessed two or three nuclear bombs, it could not use them against the Western world, which has numerous nuclear arms. Kim only wanted to stress that it is foolish for North Korea to possess such weapons, he added. Despite that fact, "part of the press has picked up on the erroneous report (by the U.S. newspaper) and carried it as though it were true," he said. "Then the DLP spokesman turned it around and distorted it, saying it was something a South Korean couldn't even think of saying, etc." The Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation stated that Kim Tae-chung made the remarks in order to stress the foolishness of North Korea's developing nuclear arms, as possession of such weapons would only bring about self-destruction.
