According to the Cologne Institute of German Economics (IW) industrial production in eastern Germany "is growing." The Hamburg Archive for World Economy [HWWA] talks of a "continuous recovery process." According to the HWWA, the GDP of the new laender will probably grow by 7 percent in 1994 (7.1 percent last year). However, progress will continue to depend on "major financial transfers from the west." According to the analysis of the Hamburg researchers, the construction trade, which increased its production by well over 10 percent in 1993, continues to be the most important economic force. First, the demand from public and industrial sectors dominated in 1993, then it was the housing construction sector (increase by 70 percent). "However, the upswing, which was at first almost exclusively concentrated on the construction sector and private services, has broadened with the stimulation of industry." Last year, the processing trade produced about 10 percent more. In the opinion of the IW, the plastics-processing industry is the winner of the structural change in the past three years: Output more than doubled. Production increased by more than 50 percent in steel and light-metal construction, the cement industry, building materials, and cold rolling mills. The production share of the 10 best branches of industry increased from 30 to 55 percent, it was stated. The leather industry suffered the sharpest decline: According to IW calculations, the volume of goods decreased by 84 percent from 1990 to 1993. Another 11 branches had to cope with production losses of more than 50 percent: Among them there is also the machine-building industry (- 65.2 percent) and the electrical industry (50.0 percent). IW economist Karl Lichtblau says that the reason is "the economic decline in the west and the stronger orientation to the world market, in contrast to the construction sector, for example." According to the HWWA, investments by enterprises in eastern Germany increased by 13 percent in 1993, but they lost dynamism, as compared to 1992 (20 percent). The unit labor costs of collectively agreed wages, which amount to about 80 percent of the western standard, are too high because of productivity, which is 50 percent lower, it was stated.
