After President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos had failed Finance Minister Emanuel Carneiro's 1994 economic program, Prime Minister Marcolino Moco went to Parliament to inform it that the government would not be able to present this year's program of action by 20 January. Gustavo Costa, our correspondent in the Angolan capital, provides the details: [Begin Costa recording] Yesterday, Prime Minister Marcolino Moco met with the MPLA deputies to the National Assembly to explain the government's inability to produce its 1994 program by 20 January.

In view of this scenario, the Angolan head of state had no option but order a new government program from Pedro Morais, secretary of state for planning. The keynote of that program should be liberalization, to allow President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to garner dividends from the talks he will personally direct when an Angolan team attends the Paris Club meeting scheduled for February. Even though there has been no announcement concerning Finance Minister Emanuel Carneiro's dismissal, the fact that the Angolan head of state rejected his program considerably undermines the role of the Finance Ministry.
