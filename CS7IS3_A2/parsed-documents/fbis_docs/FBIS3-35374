Furthermore, it has backed down from what it agreed on in the DOP. As far as Rabin and his negotiating teams are concerned, dates are no longer firm nor sacred. Withdrawal has become a redeployment of Israeli forces, settlements require military protection and safe roads protected by the Israeli Army, and so forth. In fact, this Israeli policy has relied on the absence of Arab-Palestinian coordination and is trying to deal with the Palestinian side unilaterally. It has also relied on the PLO's internal conflicts, bad planning, lack of a negotiating authority, and confusion between overt and covert negotiations. This has caused the cancellation of many national constants and the suspension of others to an unspecified date. The security agreement is the best evidence of this. This stage, in which the Israeli tactic coincides with the policy of economic siege and inhibiting our people, prompts us to reassess our support for the political process and to review all its aspects as having been planned and not spontaneous. The decision to seal the occupied territories, bar Palestinian workers from earning their livelihood, accelerate land confiscation, boycott Palestinian agricultural products and prevent their export, increase roadblocks, intensify tax collection campaigns, and close off Jerusalem -- all these are just an economic war. This war has been abetted by some Arab states which have not only cut off financial aid to our people in their distress, but have also refused to transfer funds donated by our sons working in those states. We exclude the Libyan Jamahiriyah and Iraq because they have been subjected to an international blockade. Because of the perils that this stage holds for the cause and struggles of our people, the PPSF, which supported the PLO in the peace process, believes that the peace process has deviated from its track and has canceled many agreed on national constants. The PPSF affirms that its consent was conditional on preserving the national constants and improving the Palestinian negotiating performance. But what has happened in the security agreement signed in Cairo indicates that the situation is becoming worse and that Israel is blackmailing the Palestinian negotiators. Therefore, the PPSF demands the following: 1. That the Palestine Central Council be convened to review every agreement that is signed and send its recommendations to the Palestine National Council [PNC]. 2. That the PNC be convened to review all agreements that have been signed and either approve, amend, or reject those agreements on democratic bases. 3. That a negotiating authority be formed to determine all constants and lines that must not be overstepped by any negotiator. 4. The release of Palestinian prisoners before any new agreement. If, however, the current approach continues, the PPSF will reassess its stance toward the entire peace process.
