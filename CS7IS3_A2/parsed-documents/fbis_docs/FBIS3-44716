Statistics show that in 1993 the telecommunications sector reported a sales value of more than 6.8 billion yuan and more than 1.6 billion yuan in profits and taxes, doubling the figures for the previous year. There are now 18 high-tech telecommunications enterprises in Shanghai, ten of which are joint-funded ones. They cover wire and wireless telecommunications, satellite telecommunications, transmission equipment and terminals. A senior official in charge of the sector said that the partnership of major foreign corporations was a major cause of the rapid development of the industry. In 1993 the telecommunications sector agreed upon seven projects altogether with the Siemens company of Germany, Ricoh of Japan and AT&T of the U.S. They involve a total investment of 200 million U.S. dollars. When completed, these projects will increase their output value by six billion yuan. The Shanghai Ricoh company alone will add two billion yuan. It is planning to turn out 400,000 fax machines a year.
