The committee is aimed at activating environmental protection steps in all aspects of society on a civilian level. A ceremony observing the formation of the committee was held at the Press Center, central Seoul, Tuesday afternoon and the president of Songgyunkwan University, Chang Ul-pyong, was elected chairman of the panel. ``We, as a civilian-level committee, plan to cope with the Green Round negotiations, which may serve as the largest trade barrier to South Korea after the Uruguay Round talks,'' the committee said. The committee plans to work out a comprehensive environmental protection plan and present it to the government, cooperate with foreign environmental organizations, and attend a civilian-level environment congress in Manchester, England, in June. Nearly 40 environmental scholars are participating in the committee, which will study the process of negotiations in specific areas under the Green Round talks.
