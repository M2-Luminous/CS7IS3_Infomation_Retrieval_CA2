Can we be content with the statement by Timothy Wirth, the State Department adviser on population affairs [title as published], in which he said that the statement citing President Clinton on Jerusalem was distorted and that the U.S. stance has not changed. This stance means that the fate of Jerusalem must be negotiated. Why wasn't this statement or correction made by the White House or the U.S. State Department, which are the parties concerned with explaining stances relating to foreign issues? The successive U.S. Administrations have adopted a clear position on the issue of Jerusalem, which, from the Arab point of view, is considered to be one of the most important issues triggering the Arab-Israeli conflict. This issue will remain a bone of contention unless a settlement is reached guaranteeing the Arab rights in this holy city and preserving freedoms for religions there without relinquishing the religious and political rights of its Arab and Muslim population. In all the negotiations and talks since the signing of the Camp David Accords, the U.S. stance on the Jerusalem problem has remained firm: Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories. The disputing parties should settle things through negotiations. Accordingly, the American Embassy has remained in Tel Aviv and has not moved to Jerusalem. During the U.S. presidential election campaign, Bill Clinton made statements in which he pledged that Jerusalem would be the capital of Israel. The Arab world did not bother much about these statements and considered them to be electoral promises the value of which would end with the election result. But at his recent meeting with AIPAC's [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] senior figures, President Clinton seized the opportunity to emphasize that the United States considers united Jerusalem the capital of Israel, thus violating all previous U.S. stances. Regrettably, President Clinton's statement has not aroused enough attention among the Arabs. No Islamic or Arab country requested an explanation or clarification of the new position, which followed the Hebron massacre and came when the peace efforts were stumbling. The only comment was made by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, who declared that if this statement means a new U.S. policy toward Jerusalem, Egypt differs with it. The question now is: Has the United States changed its position on Jerusalem? Does the U.S. abstention from voting on the clause on Jerusalem in the UN Security Council resolution reflect a new stance? This is the required clarification.
