Chernomyrdin's entourage is discussing a future candidate for finance minister. B. Fedorov's track record in this position has not only been coming under fire recently, but he is also being blamed for the results of the recent Russian parliamentary elections where the votes of the "marginals" bloc "formed" by the finance minister were of decisive importance for the defeat of Russia's Choice. Few in the Russian Government dare to ignore Russian Federation presidential edicts the way B. Fedorov regularly does. The latest such example is B.N. Yeltsin's decision on repaying last year's debts to the defense complex in the first quarter of 1994. Judging by the reaction to the Russian Federation edict by the Finance Ministry under B. Fedorov, military enterprises will have to whistle for their 3 trillion rubles as they continue to go hat in hand. While the Defense Ministry is once again going to be singled out as the one to blame, the Finance Ministry stays in the shadows. Moscow military men are known to have recently pinned on him the label of an "unsinkable aircraft carrier of the United States of America!?" But now there have emerged serious signs of dissatisfaction with B. Fedorov also on the part of the United States. Strobe Talbott, "the top man in the United States in charge of stability of relations with Russia," has admitted to a narrow circle of people around him that the gamble on B. Fedorov was a mistake. Things have reached a point where his seat in the World Bank, regarded until recently as being "reserved for good" for him, was taken by someone else, and the Americans seem no longer to be trying to pitch direct links with B. Fedorov, as they would not like to take part of the blame for the state of the Russian economy. It is not ruled out though that Fedorov has simply become a fall guy in the clash of two economic strategies residing together in the Russian Government. To fell this guy would be 90 percent of his opponents' victory.
