Commenting on the resignation of the Belarusian parliament speaker, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes: "Specialists and politicians will repeatedly examine the results and consequences of Stanislav Shushkevich's resignation. "But the first conclusion can be drawn even now: The actual omnipotence of one political force has been again regained from this time. The parliamentary majority led by premier Vyacheslav Kebich will not have any more 'a whipping boy' in the face of the former speaker. The party of power headed by the government will be now obliged to assume full responsibility for the republic's future." The same newspaper deals with the Azeri-Armenian conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh in another article. "While Moscow and Yerevan continue to make conjectures on how Aliyev (Eds: the Azeri president) managed to consolidate the army in such a short period of time, Baku continues to keep mum and is in no hurry to refute reports by some Russian media that Afghan mujahideen make up the core of the renovated army. "Moscow's insistent call to stop combat operations put a difficult dilemma before the Azeri leader: either to make concessions and agree to talks with the Armenian side, or to ignore the Russian side's diplomatic pressure. "In the first instance, Aliyev risks to lose support of Azeri population, in another, to force Moscow to look for other methods of pressure on the present Azeri leadership.+ NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Aleksandr Dzasokhov, member of the state Duma (lower chamber of the Russian parliament) from North Ossetia, who says: "The state Duma has gathered a motley, and nevertheless, political elite of the Russian state, especially from Moscow. "If this is the case, it should conduct affairs in a responsible way, as an elite should do. This is especially important, since a democratically elected parliament is being formed for the first time. "This is the start of a truly multi-party system, and parliament will be responsible for how it will work." According to the TRUD newspaper, "social tension at mines of the Kuznetsk coal basin has become dangerous from the beginning of the new year. Workers refuse to go to work in some or other mines. "The reason for such a sitution is not only months-long delays with payment of wages and unfulfilled promises by the government. Lack of funds prevents miners from purchasing the most necessary equipment to carry out mining operations and (what's the most dreadful thing) to ensure labour safety." The IZVESTIYA newspaper focuses on the rouble's rate. "Relative stability of the rouble over the past few days," the newspaper writes, "gave a brief respite to all money dealers. There is a chance now to cast a retrospective glance and to draw some conclusions. "The most important of them evidently is that times have passed for good when the government could artificially fix an exchange rate between the rouble and the dollar. The situation is quite different these days: The rate of the national monetary unit is now among the main indicators of the efficiency of the government's activities." The same newspaper runs an article by state Duma member Vasiliy Lipitskiy advocating an amnesty to members of the state emergency committee and detainees of the Lefortovo prison (eds: members of the State Emergency Committee engineered an abortive state coup in 1991. They are now on trial but released from prison. Lefortovo detainees started a state coup in Moscow in October 1993 and are under investigation now). "Such an amnesty, in Lipitskiy's opinion, could draw a line under the past and become a step to national reconciliation," the newspaper notes. The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes about breakdowns and emergencies in the Russian federation last year. "The year 1993 witnessed over 1,200 serious breakdowns and emergencies in Russia, which claimed the life of 1,100 people. "The unstable social and economic situation in the country indicates that the number of breakdowns, disasters and other emergencies will be at least the same this year," the newspaper notes. The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper examines the problem of piratic fishing by foreign ships in Russian territorial waters. "The solution of the piratic fishing problem faces the following question: Will Russia be a powerful state which will be reckoned with by close and distant neighbours?" asks the newspaper. "The process is reverse for the time being," it adds. The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA newspaper carries an interpellation by legislator Vasiliy Starodubtsev advocating the interests of Russian peasants. He notes: "Peasants have no hard currency on their bank accounts as well as villas in California. "Their homes are here, and they will do their best to survive and to feed urban population. But if, God forbid, hunger strikes any place, the blame will fully rest with Misters Gaydar, Fedorov and other enemies of the Russian countryside.
