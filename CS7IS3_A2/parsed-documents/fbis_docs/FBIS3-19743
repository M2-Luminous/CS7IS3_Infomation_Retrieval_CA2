The general reaction in Ankara to Ocalan's call has been that he is faced with serious difficulties on the military front and is trying to buy time for his organization before embarking on new attacks. In a message sent on Sunday [13 March] to a two-day Kurdish Conference organized in Brussels, Ocalan, indicated that "they would be open to all recommendations for a settlement whether these came from the state or from international organizations." Ocalan, whose organization has been waging a bloody separatist war in Southeast Anatolia, claimed "they did not have an absolute aim of dividing Turkey." He added that "propaganda" attributing this aim to them "did not reflect their true policy." "I want to indicate that we would be party to any solution which is based on the notion of dialogue with the Turkish State, and which takes into consideration in a democratic manner the legitimate demands of our people, and which aims at attaining results to this effect" Ocalan said. He added that they had from the beginning of this dispute been open to proposals for a settlement, and said "from the beginning we were ready to discuss any alternative including that of federation on this basis." Ocalan went on to declare that "in the event of a mutual ceasefire to be monitored by international observers they would not be the side complicating matters." "I am announcing that in the event that the basis for a political solution and free political activities is prepared, we will open completely the path to ending the armed struggle" Ocalan said in his message read out to the conference by Kani Yilmaz, the representative in Europe of the ERNK, [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan] a PKK affiliated organization. The response to Ocalan's message in Ankara was short and dismissive. Analysts point out that both President Suleyman Demirel's and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's reply to Ocalan's call was merely a repetition of a position held for years. Namely that "there can be no bargaining with terrorists," that "the roots of this terrorist organization will be wiped out" and that "they are only making this call for a ceasefire because they have been cornered." Analysts also indicate that the timing of Ocalan's proposal for a ceasefire and a political solution makes it difficult for the Government to respond positively to this call. They cite the fact that there is talk of a wide ranging military operation against the PKK planned for the coming days, and probably for immediately after the local elections on March 27. They say this makes it more or less impossible for the government to even consider Ocalan's call. Analysts also add that Ocalan's call itself "smacks of no more than a tactical move." They say this move appears to be planned to capitalize on the fact that Turkey is being cornered by the West following the lifting of the immunity of pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) deputies and their subsequent detention. Ocalan is clearly aiming to tighten the political screw on Turkey even further because he knows the Government in Ankara can not respond to his call in a positive manner. There is also the view among analysts that Ocalan through this call of his is also signalling that he will be ordering an all-out attack in the coming days. This view has it that Ocalan is opening the door to the argument that he has offered the hand of peace but that it was rebuffed by Turkey leaving him no choice but to fight on. There are also questions about whether there is any practicality to a ceasefire. Especially when it is recalled that the PKK broke its unilaterally declared ceasefire last year by massacring unarmed soldiers in civilian garb hours after they had been discharged after completing their military service in the Southeast. These questions mount when it is wondered how Ocalan can order an across-the-board ceasefire when it is known that there are large numbers of maverick elements within the PKK which looked on the previous ceasefire with great suspicion. When it is considered that these elements are not after anything short of total Kurdish independence this also casts serious doubts on Ocalan's statement that they do not aim to divide Turkey and are basically after a political dialogue. As for the two-day Kurdish conference in Brussels held on Saturday and Sunday the common view to come out of this was that there was the need for a democratic solution to Turkey's Kurdish problem. The majority of foreign speakers addressing the conference place the blame for the continuing war with the PKK on Turkey. Analysts say this probably acted as a catalyst in prompting Ocalan to appear conciliatory and open to a dialogue in his call for a ceasefire and a political settlement. Despite these political overtures, though, analysts say the signs now are that the sides are preparing to draw their swords and are predicting more violence in the coming days.
