He emphasizes the three new fundamental factors that have appeared recently on the scene, all of them, he adds, are goals "that we have worked toward and that we have all gone out to achieve." The first is the dissolution of parliament following the referendum and the new electoral system, and the beginning of the "new political and institutional phase in the life of our democracy, which is one of the fundamental aspects of the birth of the PDS," a "new phase in the reublic, with the arrival on the scene of new alliances and the end of the political parties that featured in the first republic." The second novelty is the "perfect timing" with which the progressive alliance appeared at the end of the legislature. Occhetto sees in this political event "the signature of the constituent phase that we have spoken about so often in the last few years, imagining that it would not have been possible to give an advance indication of the subjects that would have taken part." The third determining event is the end of the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. Another consequence of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and a confirmation of forecasts that the breakup of the old DC would have occurred. "The moment of truth for Catholic politicians," added Occhetto, "came closer and closer...." [Leiss] Let us start from here. In response to your aperture toward Martinazzoli, the Catholic philosopher and member of the PPI [Italian People's Party] Rocco Buttiglione has accused the PDS of wanting to reconstruct the "associationistic system that created Tangentopoli [the kickback scandal]." How do you judge this response? [Occhetto] I find it very curious. It comes from a certain confusion of ideas that I did not expect to see in a man whose ideas I have always valued. As well as his thesis on the need to create a bipolar system, with the church placing itself over and above the alternatives, thereby giving the Catholics freedom of choice between the progressives and the conservatives. I am continuing to move in this sense. I would therefore invite Buttiglione to reexamine his judgement more calmly and with knowledge of the facts. I do not see what associationism there is in asking, before the crisis of the grab-all DC party and its need to branch out into two elements -- one looking toward the right and the other that should be looking toward the left -- the People's party, or rather the Catholics who have been all involved in politics in the DC to date, to choose to govern with the right or the left. I do not see any associationism in a left-wing party leader hoping that Catholic forces will choose to govern in a transparent manner with the left. Instead associationism was represented by the existence of a party that consisted of center, right, and left, and that was associated in governing a country strongly occupied by satellite forces. [Leiss] But are your not afraid that Segni will drag Martinazzoli into an accord with the [Northern] League? The meeting between the referendum leader [Segni] and Maroni of the League has already been set for Monday.... [Occhetto] I have not given the People's Party a blank check. My reasoning is very much based on the fact that the People's party must reclaim itself -- not so much as far as votes are concerned -- but by really abandoning all the compromises with the old political order if it is to to govern with the progressives. I am not only referring to those who are under investigation, but to the moving forces of a phase of the republic, a direct expression of the occupation of the State and of associationism. Then what is needed is a distinct clarity regarding the alliances of the other side, not ambiguity. Instead I see the People's Party trying to save the "grab-all" aspect, to keep people like Mattarella and Rosy Bindi who are looking left together, and those who are making eyes at Segni, who in turn, is making eyes at Bossi and Berlusconi through a third party. This would end up disguising the same problem. That of a party that wants to contiue to keep its hands free. This would worry me if I were Buttiglione. [Leiss] Well then, are you afraid that in the end, as Giorgio Galli says, after the elections the various fragments of the Catholic political world currently on the scene will reconstruct the moderate politics of the old DC? [Occhetto] They can try to form a center to invite the left to an associationist solution. But we will oppose this and we will fight to win a majority for the progressives. [Leiss] But why is it still difficult to expect Martinazzoli to make a statement before the elections, thereby revealing his right side and opening up a hemorrhage of votes that could be lethal for the PPI.... [Occhetto] But then Martinazzoli would have to play the role of the force that is not forging alliances with anybody right to the end. From a moral point of view it would be an important decision but one that he could regret. I have appreciated and continue to appreciate his no to the League and to Berlusconi. But I also see the risk of unproductiveness as far as providing a response to the problems of the country is concerned. In an system that is no longer associationist and in which things are done openly before the citizens, if Catholic citizens consider being able to govern with the left a value, and perhaps a historical opportunity, then it is worth loosing the votes of the right. If, on the contrary, governing with the moderate is considered to be more important, then it is worth loosing the votes of the left. In a nutshell Martinazzoli must give Catholic voters a distinct and clear choice. [Leiss] Martinazzoli must not take part in right-wing "orgies." But the leftists are also being criticized for having created a pole of forces that are very different. Does the distinction between an electoral accord and a government agreement under discussion at the "progressive table" clarify things or confuse them? [Occhetto] In the current situation, with great extenuating circumstances over the choices of government for the country, and with a law that does not allow for a second turn and the "desistement" mechanism, it is very important for the citizens to know immediately that they have a valid tool to prevent the new and the old right-wingers from getting all the seats. And that a wide range of democratic and leftist forces that have not been compromised by scandals, that favor development, solidarity, and work, and that oppose the wild free-trade, have this objective. [Leiss] And what about the government platform? [Occhetto] we have formed a work group to formulate well-defined and detailed proposals. We feel it is our duty to undertake the responsibility of defining a clear-cut government platform for the democratic reconstruction of the country. I think this is what is expected from us, with the workers, businsessmen, and the manufacturing sector of the country. And for this very reason I have scheduled meetings at NATO headquarters, and with London investors over the coming weeks. Even Europe is waiting to see what kind of government platform the Italian progressives can draw up. [Leiss] What driving ideas will be at the center of the programs? What will be the opposition to the free trade manifesto that the right-wingers, despite their divisions and confusion, are in substance already advancing? [Occhetto] We intend to take in the proposals that have already come from the Social Christians, Democractic Alliance, and the Greens in this phase. The basic driving idea is that recovery and efficiency can be combined with solidarity, with a development that takes account of employment and environmental compatibility. I contest the fact that the other line-up has a government platform. It seems to me that they are promoting a free-trade propoganda only to discredit the PDS and the progressives. These are idealogical banners that no longer have any meaning. [Leiss] Let us make an example and play a game. If Occhetto was prime minister, what proposals would he make to Agnelli and to the trade unions regarding the Fiat crisis? [Occhetto] I would try to make the government favor solutions like those adopted by Volkswagen in Germany. Or by Olivetti in Italy. I would propose solidarity contracts. Not mobility lists [thoses workers who are available for other employment before final dismissal after 2 years] that fatally become the precursors of deindustrialization. A more courageous industrial policy is needed for Italy. It is precisely here that the difference of the progressive line-up lies. There must be a strategy for recovery that follows along the lines of what the Ciampi government has done. But by enrichening this with a new and original policy on work and employment. [Leiss] Will the generalized reduction of working hours be a distinctive feature of the progressives program? [Occhetto] Yes. But there will have to be two sides to this policy. The other will consist of innovative choices to create employment and development. This will be achieved through program accords and agreed-upon modifications to working hours. Without forgetting that such a strategy will have to be compatible in Europe. [Leiss] The right-wingers are evoking a "Liberty Pole": Is Segni their strong point as a possible candidate for premier? How will the progressives react? [Occhetto] Actually, the first real act of liberty was when Montanelli was fired using methods that I would call a little "Rumanian." What a "liberty pole!" As for premiers, if there were to be direct elections, I think we should first have a sort of "primary" election. And I would accept the result. But as I have often repeated, this law does not exist in Italy. In other European systems the leader of the majority coalition party that wins the elections is generally assigned this role. In our situation there is no sense in imitating a nonexistent electoral system. We must be careful not create contradictions. [Leiss] Now there is talk of Ciampi no longer being the progressives' candidate, but the new president of the republic. You have said that he remains a "democratic reserve for the country..." [Occhetto] I do not think anybody said this. Ciampi has placed himself above the sides even in this final and very delicate phase of transition. We appreciated this very much. But in the future, nothing would stop me from independently providing a list of the best names for a "democratic reserve" that is important for the country, if I were asked for advice concerning the composition of the government from the Head of State. [Leiss] Regarding the Head of State. In Strasbourg you referred to an attack, a "plot" against Scalfaro. [Occhetto] I confirm that an international band is focusing all its efforts against the Head of State because the president of the republic has always acted in a coherent and legitimate matter when facing the problem of Italy's transition. We cannot question Scalfaro's behavior just because of the questions put to him by a student, thereby exaggerating the accusations made by people like Broccoletti, who is at the center of the degeneration of our political life. [Leiss] But judicial proceedings are underway. Are there exceptions? [Occhetto] No we have always respected the investigations and verifications carried out by the courts. We have never made any exception, for nobody. Accepting unfounded scandals, that are generated to damage a decisive electoral campaign by resorting to "plague-spreader" methods as stated in Manozni's "Colonna Infame" is a different matter.
