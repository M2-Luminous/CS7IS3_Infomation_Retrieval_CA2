Mieno told the House of Representatives Budget Committee, "I think the downturn is about to end, and the environment for economic recovery has almost been completed." He cited progress in inventory adjustments, the effects of the government's fiscal and monetary measures and economic recovery overseas as favorable factors. Mieno, however, took a cautious view of recovery, saying it remains to be seen whether the bright signs will continue because of uncertainty over the yen's exchange rates against other currencies and employment adjustments.
