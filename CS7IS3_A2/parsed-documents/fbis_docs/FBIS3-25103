THE HERALD, Zimbabwe's main daily newspaper, on Tuesday morning quoted senior Zimbabwe Government sources as saying that Mengistu, who was granted political asylum in Zimbabwe nearly four years ago, was to meet personally at 2PM Tuesday with none less than Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira to be told to "shut up or get out". The angry reaction against the man once seen as one of President Robert Mugabe's closest friends follows a long, rambling letter by Mengistu published in Harare at the weekend in which he claims to have been called by his countrymen to "rescue my country" from the government of President Meles Zenawi. A Zimbabwean Government spokesman on Monday night sharply attacked Mengistu, dubbed "the butcher of Addis Ababa" for alleged massacres of thousands of people. Information Director Bornwell Chakaodza said Mengistu's statement was "regrettable" and that it threatened to undo the rapport between Zimbabwe and Ethiopia. THE HERALD, widely regarded as a government mouthpiece, said Mr Shamuyarira would express the government's "extreme displeasure" to Mengistu over what was a serious breach of his conditions of asylum, which were that he would be allowed to live here privately with his family but was forbidden to engage in any political activity. The newspaper spoke of high-level meetings at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, where Mengistu's statement was discussed with indignation by officials. It said Mengistu would be told "in no uncertain terms" that Zimbabwe respected the wishes of the Ethiopian people in electing President Zenawi. Mr Mugabe and Mr Zenawi had met twice and relations between the two countries were now "cordial". As rebel forces of Zenawi's Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) converged on Addis Ababa in May 1990, Mengistu fled his country. His departure followed 13 years as head of one of the bloodiest regimes in recent African history, which imposed Stalinist policies that wrecked the thriving economy under former Emperor Haile Selassie. He landed in Harare and was granted asylum by Mr Mugabe, a favour that has repeatedly embarrassed the Zimbabwe premier, as human rights groups condemned him for giving refuge to a man regarded as a mass murderer, who should be sent home to face trial. Over the years Mengistu has become a lonely man, a virtual prisoner in his government villa in a diplomatic suburb of Harare, deserted first by his wife, Werb Anchi, and then his bodyguards.
