In the protest filed with the CNN's Seoul Bureau, the Information Ministry said the CNN was abetting the "theory of war crisis in Korea" through "misleading and exaggerated" reports on the reality of the Korean peninsula. The ministry strongly asked the CNN to stop filing similarly exaggerated and misleading reports. The protest said that the CNN, for instance, covered the routine civil defense drill of last June 15 in a way that made it appear as if the South Koreans were preparing for a war in earnest. This was the first time the Seoul Government filed a formal protest with major American press media. An observer said that such inflated reporting by the CNN apparently stemmed from their policy to make the Korean situation another opportunity to expand their influence. The CNN very profitably covered the Gulf war, he added.
