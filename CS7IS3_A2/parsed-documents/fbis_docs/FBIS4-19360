Will Gro Harlem Brundtland achieve what has until now been almost unthinkable? Is it at all possible that stubborn Norway will vote yes on membership in the European Union [EU]? "Sure it's possible," says the mighty Gro. With the EU's internal crisis as background noise, she is going to travel around the country to get skeptical people to vote yes -- just as the negotiators in Brussels did and just as she herself did in 1972. Then Gro Harlem Brundtland was no activist during the "civil war" and she only publicly announced her 1972 position for the first time in 1990. But it is not typically Norwegian to be Gro and it is not typical of Gro the practitioner of realpolitik to be a doubter. She has an almost frightening iron will, resoluteness, and energetic power. The prime minister's large meeting room is opened for us, a room free of intimate atmosphere: There are 12 empty chairs around the big conference table. There is a watchful press spokesman carrying a cassette tape recorder -- which is frequently used ever since reporter Geelmuyden's statement that the prime minister merely chatters. Perhaps the press spokesman can do the interview as well, so we can take in the view instead. We have windows looking out onto the rooftop terrace, where all the world's guests are photographed with "madame," the woman in the brightly colored clothes. Red is the fiery woman's color. Gro loves red. She makes her entrance and kicks off the black, high-heeled patent leather shoes; we have more than half an hour, a whole eternity. Norway is now seriously being devastated by an EU struggle. But for Gro Harlem Brundtland, this is not the beginning, just the beginning of the end, because the Europe process has already been a marathon. First there was the European Economic Area [EEA] concept that we never became familiar with. The EEA process alone took five and a half years. "It's hugely demanding to work with such processes. It requires long-range thinking," she says. Many people have completely forgotten that the EEA was also about to fall through. But when we ask Gro about The Big Disappointment, she cannot avoid the EEA breakdown in Luxembourg in the summer of 1991. That led to a major defeat for Gro, the Labor Party, and the European project. "Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jacques Poos, interpreted the situation in such a positive way that we thought an agreement about free market access for fish was in place. Here at home we were scolded. Political opponents exploited the situation for all it was worth. We learned that you can't take such statements for granted. You have to get up early in the morning." Hard work, more hard work, and yet more hard work is her political recipe -- and her dogma. For Gro, stamina has an intrinsic value in politics and in life. Like so many Social Democrats, Gro was born into politics. She has rarely asked the question whether the choice was the right one because the choice was obvious. It is just as obvious to work systematically to achieve political goals. But the systematic thinker also takes chances. She sent avowed opponents to Brussels to negotiate a Norwegian yes vote. From the 15th floor in the Government Building, she kept in contact by telephone with negotiators Gunhild Oyangen, Grete Kundsen, Jan Henry T. Olsen, and special advisor with special status Jonas Gahr Store. But they were able to fend for themselves. "I consciously kept in the background." "No fish" Olsen was a particularly big gamble. But Gro fell for him four years ago when he delivered a "dazzling speech to the Fishermen's Association." In any event, if Norway does not become a member of the EU, it will not be Olsen's fault. He behaved like a duck in water. Little, if anything, in Gro Harlem Brundtland's Europe mission is accidental. With Thorbjorn Jagland as the central strategist, every step is carefully planned, from the EEA process to the Labor Party's big consultation and the prime minister's promembership speech in the fruit-producing town of Ullensvang on 4 April 1992 in which she said that Norway could still give up a fish. At the eleventh hour Gro could also phone her political friend of many years' standing, Spain's Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. "Personal contacts are important to build up confidence. If people you know from before know you can be depended upon, you can pick up a phone and in three minutes get down to brass tacks. I have known Felipe Gonzalez since 1975, before Spain became democratic and he was in exile. We established an ideological companionship that means today we are colleagues. ``But there are limits to how much personal relationships can exert an influence. Fisheries policy is an important and difficult national issue for Spain, just as it is for Norway. Neither one of us wants to destroy the respect we have at home. Job number one is to take care of national interests. But when we know one another well, it's also possible to proceed without ceremonial phrases. I said that we couldn't do anything more than stretch out the EEA fish. So Gonzalez knew that that was the reality.'' When Jacques Delors was told that the Norwegian negotiators had the backing of the prime minister, he too knew that this was true. Just as now Gro Harlem Brundtland can use her network of international contacts that has been built up since 1974, when Norway's youngest, freshest cabinet minister was given the task of running an OECD conference on the environment. "I remember thinking we couldn't let this possibility slip away from us, and that I had to prepare myself well. That was also how I immediately got an international challenge. At that time as well transnational and interdisciplinary contacts were important. First I approached the Spanish environment minister and went systematically to work." [Engesland] I can believe it. Have you never been particularly troubled by nerves? [Brundtland] I don't get nervous, but it's not out of arrogance or a lack of respect for my tasks. I don't want to be paralyzed by nerves. My recipe is to prepare myself as best I can. Indeed unprepared situations can throw her off balance and unleash that famous red-hot temper. As at an improvised news conference in Arhus, when the prime minister thought she was supposed to speak about Nordic cooperation while the reporters were only concerned about the book dealing with intelligence, Vi som styrer Norge [We Who Run Norway]. Then Gro flew into a raging protest. The hard-as-nails Gro-Kare duels taught her to control her temper, but she can still be a fury and cut off an opponent with razor-sharp retorts or silence them completely. This is the language of power, even if Gro would deny that herself. [Engesland] What do you think about Anne Enger Lahnstein's role in the EU debate? [Brundtland] I'm thinking of the country's future. That is all the "yes queen" has to say about the "no queen." [Engesland] What role do you want to play yourself? [Brundtland] I am the prime minister. No one can deny that, she laughs cleverly. As prime minister, Gro must be be somewhat cautious about being too strong an exponent, but all the same, is it tempting to let everything go now? [Engesland] You have stayed in the background during the last round of the negotiations. But will the Labor Party, Thorbjorn Jagland, and Gro Harlem Brundtland now roll across the country? [Brundtland] No, we'll take it at a quiet pace. This is not an issue for one or two people. In this instance there are many of us. All the same: Gro is at the top now and strongly convinced of her own ability to persuade. She is Norway's most powerful woman, she is the most dominant political leader since Einar Gerhardsen. Will she be able to do what Trygve Bratteli could not? Or will the power elite once again stab her in the back? Finally Gro says that a no vote from a majority of the people will not be a personal, only a political defeat, and that she will not resign. But the fight over the EU has also divided the Social Democrats, and god only knows how an internal struggle has torn the Labor Party to pieces before, in 1972 and during the struggle for power in 1979-81 -- that pushed out Reiulf Steen and brought Gro in. In her time the Social Democratic movement has been threatened by an identity crisis and ideological disintegration, by tension between the state and the market, and between the national political leadership and ungovernable international forces. Gerhardsen the younger came back from oblivion, he talked about the good, old values and went into the television studio with Socialist Left Party [SV] leader Erik Solheim. In 1982 Rune Gerhardsen was her personal secretary, but he could not keep up with Gro's pace very long. Ten years later he was the opposition incarnate. The Labor Party was down low in the opinion polls. But it was a personal tragedy that led to the dramatic retirement in 1992 -- not any uproar on the outside. Gro Harlem Brundtland bears a great sorrow. She lost a son, and for a mother there is nothing worse. A prime minister can trust few people, and now she protects herself more than ever. So the individual with feelings within her is increasingly thrown into the solitude that follows the life of a top leader. Time with her family and outdoor activities are essential. She is now going to the mountain where she will spend her Easter vacation to relax with her family. [Engesland] What will you read over the Easter holiday -- more EU documents? [Brundtland] I'm going to read Jostein Gaarder's philosophical novel Sofies verden [Sophie's World]! [Engesland] So might you reflect on which classical philosophers fascinate you the most? In Steinar Hansson and Ingolf Hakon Teigenes's book Maktkamp og mannefall [The Struggle for Power and the Slaughter], it is implied that there is a less than flattering connection between you and Plato. You have frequently said that there is a close connection between the doctor and the politician. The doctor prevents disease and heals suffering whereas the politician prevents social problems and corrects biases. Plato also believed that statesmen should take responsibility for society the way the doctor does for the patient. Aren't you in danger of becoming elitist? [Brundtland] No, be reasonable. What nonsense! she snorts. I haven't read Plato from A to Z, but in any event what is not possible in a democracy is not having leaders. Power cannot be decentralized as long as no one makes decisions. It's also quite wrong to give the impression that some politicians here at home represent the people and that others do not. If any party is close to people's everyday lives, it is the Labor Party. It is right to observe that the choice of a career tells a lot about someone's personal leanings. I became a doctor because I liked to be with people, I liked to do things, to help. I also think that I have always had the ability to make contact with people. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland is a remarkable blend of toughness and tenderness, of uncompromising resolution and generous care. She does, however, direct little irony towards herself. Nor will she ever become a big popular orator. The torrent of speech wears at the wits of every reporter with a feeling for proper quotations. But political journalists are nonetheless seen more frequently as "Gro's court" than as a counterweight to her. Because no one can challenge Gro's or the Labor Party's position in the government because the opposition in the Storting is so divided and weak, because there are so few experienced leaders on an international scale in our little country, and, because she reigns so sovereign, she is also becoming next to impregnable. Today Gro is no longer called the chatterbox from Bygdoy, nor is she called the "Green Goddess," but everyone is still on a first-name basis with her and she increasingly behaves like the country's grandmother -- commanding and compliant. The battle over Norway and Europe will be a historic one. The big question is whether the leadership of the Labor Party will make close contact with the sentiments in the hearts of the people. Gro is pleased to be traveling northward. But will the skeptical people in northern Norway vote yes just because grandmother says they ought to?
