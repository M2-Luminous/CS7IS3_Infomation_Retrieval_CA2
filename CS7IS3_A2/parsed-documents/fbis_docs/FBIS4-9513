It ensues neither originally nor today from the citizen's interest, which is why this argument should not be overestimated or misused. It originates--and this origin can be felt to this day--from the conflict between the interest of the center (the king, the president, the assembly, the parliament, the government, or a conqueror or occupier) to enforce central power uniformly, effectively, and with the requisite dose of integrity, irrespective of how the wielders of the central power took hold of that role (whether by conquest or by means of democratic elections) and the interests of citizens with ambitions who are convinced that they have less administration (power) than they should. Experience confirms that, on the one hand: --Mistakes, errors, or weaknesses of the center influence the stability of the whole and have often been an important or even the decisive cause of its demise (because they always get into contact, often clash, and occasionally get into conflict with neighboring wholes). --No reform of the whole's arrangement is permanently satisfactory because it is not and, by its very nature, cannot be perfect. --The only thing that is constant and permanent is the incessant reform of administration and the endless search for a perfect model, even if this search always moves within bounds that are very inaccurately labeled as centralization and decentralization. On the other hand, experience shows that, no matter how praiseworthy the intentions to transform the administration organizationally may be, they always produce a provisional arrangement and not "the final word," from which follows, on the one hand, that there is no need for any overhasty action and, on the other (or on the same?), that it is necessary to responsibly and conscientiously consider what is really unbearable and what is functional about the administration, for whose reform one is calling. The risk in giving such advice is that you can be immediately asked, as minister and as deputy chairman of the party that at the moment has the greatest share of power in this state, in whose interest you are cautioning restraint. The only thing I can say in response--because I will not furnish a single piece of evidence to back this up--is that it is my right as a citizen of this country, one, moreover, with a lifelong career as a civil servant. I admit thereby, seemingly at variance with my introductory words, that, in a civic society, the organization of the country's administration does affect the citizen: He wants to be represented and "served" by good, accessible, intelligible, and competent bodies that are not too costly to run. The target of a civic society (which we carry in our heads and against which we gauge the attained reality) is the idea of a sovereign citizen who decides, precisely in the interest of his individual sovereignty, to tolerate, by means of indirect (representative but controllable) democracy, only as much power above himself as will allow him to be a sovereign citizen and individual in this world. The formation of lands (regions) is laid down in our Constitution and the current dispute concerns only their size and role. The fact that any internal state arrangement is unsatisfactory--for which there are authentic as well as demagogic arguments--permanently exerts an influence. We have no shortage of ambitious people (which is so good that, as is often the case, it becomes bad at times). We all speak from positions in which we find ourselves and in the name of the chances that present themselves. What unites us is the experience and conviction that the state administration can and must be better than it is now. And because there does not exist a single solution to this task, politics gets a hearing. Personally, I do not believe that it is in the citizen's interest to have above himself more, rather than fewer, tiers of power, that it is in the citizen's interest to have a weak state, and that, under Czech conditions, having a large region is a suitable way of bringing the state and the citizen closer to each other and the best way of bringing the country's administration closer to the citizen. State and Communities The territory of the Czech Republic is administered by the state and by the communities. The state is represented by the head of state, parliament, government, the heads of central bodies of state administration who are not headed by a minister, the heads of bodies of state administration who do not operate nationwide (such as the director of the Labor Office, the Agriculture Ministry's Regional Department, or the Road Administration and Maintenance Authority), and the chairmen of district offices as the "uniform" body of state administration in a given territory. Communities are administered through their elected representatives, besides which they perform, with their staff, some duties of state administration in their territory (the so-called authorized communities perform these duties on the designated territory of several communities). There are many reasons for the citizen to administer and to be administered by only the community and the state. The "dividing line" is visible and historically stable here, although I hasten to add that even here it is not beyond dispute. It is not only changing but also oscillating [prolina se], most probably in mutual interest. Size of the Communities For the division of administration between the state and the community to be balanced, competent, and, hence, satisfactory to the citizen, the community should be of a certain size that will guarantee its qualification potential [kvalifikacni potencial] and, last but not least, also the necessary financial resources. This prerequisite is not met in our conditions. This inevitably complicates and restricts a uniform and broad delineation of communities' powers (the sole authentic bringing closer of the administration to the citizen). It is extremely difficult uniformly to devolve the widest possible powers to communities with a population of more than 100,000 (of which we have seven in the Czech Republic) and, simultaneously, to communities with a population of under 200 (of which we have 1,621 in the Czech Republic, which is 26 percent of all communities). Of the 6,196 communities in the Czech Republic, 4,946--that is, a full 80 percent--have fewer than 1,000 inhabitants (do not let these communities be angry with me, but, personally, I would regard this number as the absolute minimum). Without discounting the "Moravian issue" and the traditionalists' argument of a return to the land arrangement [zemske usporadani], I personally believe that the project of regions--that is, the idea of inserting a regional tier between the state and the community--is to a large degree a result of the large number of small communities in the Czech Republic. The large number of small communities makes administration solely from the level of the state and the community more controversial and the need for a regional tier more urgent and justifiable. At the same time, it is evident that changing this situation cannot be an ephemeral administrative ambition but a matter of long-term development. Why Region There are at least two reasons for the citizen to administer and to be administered by not only the tier state and the tier community, but also the tier region. The outcome of the discussion on regional arrangements depends on which viewpoint we prefer and which is stronger and more urgent. The first argument is based on the assertion that the state (the government, the parliament) is too remote from the citizens, who live in diverse (mutually unrelated) conditions, for it to be able to fulfill so many of its powers "from Prague." It is being said, in support of this argument, that even today the state is addressing this problem by establishing outlying regional workplaces of individual central bodies of state administration, whose task is to perceive and respect local conditions and local differences more distinctly than the center can. A subject of polemics is whether there should be more such "feelers" at the "regional" level (that is, whether there should be about 10 of them) or at the "district" level (that is, whether there should be several dozen of them). My reply in this respect is unequivocal: Because the main burden of state administration is carried by the district office and the other special (not uniform) local bodies of state administration (regardless of whether their number exceeds, or falls short of, the number of districts) are only a divergently justified supplement, the district represents even today the prevailing local dimension of state administration. Therefore, we should base our considerations on the assessment of the functionality of this tier (and its size). The second argument is that the community is too remote from the state. The idea of a citizen deciding by his (electoral, civic) vote who will administer Zadni Lhotka with its 60 residents and the Czech Republic with 10 million inhabitants (and nothing in between) is a strong motive for the establishment of regions. The citizen's interest undeniably reaches beyond the borders of (particularly small) communities. If a citizen is to entrust the administration of everything "beyond the community" to the state, he is raising the, in my opinion justified, question of whether the "power above him" is not too far away and too insensitive to his civic situation, to which belong "everyday issues" such as transportation to the nearest city, the retail network, health-care establishments, higher-level schools, and so forth. The community (in its Czech shape) is mostly too small to ensure his needs and demands, while the state is too big and too remote to ensure them with a feeling for local conditions. The attentive reader will surely have noticed that, actually, we are not dealing with two problems but with two views of the same problem, according to the example of the "half-full" or "half-empty" glass: A view "from the center," which is "only" being decentralized and parceled out with the establishment of regions and the view of the citizen (community), who (which) feels the need to influence matters "beyond the community" more directly than through the medium of the government or parliament. A solution to this "clash" has lain thus far, above all, in the district office (a small government with limited powers, whose application is restricted to a certain territory) and the district council (an assembly of representatives of communities of a given territory), which is, in my opinion, the most controversial element in the present system of administration of the Czech Republic, an element that is the furthest from the ideal of functional perfection. What Is a Region? It is time to try to express wherein the planned regional arrangement differs (of course, according to the ambitions of individual proponents) from today's district-based administration of the country. This is difficult because, according to the final shape chosen, it can differ from it either in quantitative terms only (that is, the decisionmaking horizon of the region in the sphere of administration would be expanded) or in qualitative terms as well (that is, decisionmaking would differ from region to region). We might call the first option, rather imprecisely, decentralization (decisionmaking according to, and within the framework of, uniform rules, while paying heed to local conditions), while the other comes close to the term parceling (decisionmaking according to different rules). The prevalent idea is that the regional body (unlike today's district office) would not decide at the state's behest (that is, according to uniform, centrally controlled and sanctioned rules), doing so only with greater sensitivity [than the district office] (that is, with greater ability to differentiate between specific situations), but that, within the framework of jurisdiction that will be vested in regions by law, it will decide with irrevocable and specific powers. This idea arises from the thesis that the region will also have its own property--that is, that, apart from state, community, and private ownership, there will also be regional ownership. This can best be illustrated by an example coming, as in most cases, from transportation. Should the law on regions transfer into regional ownership--for example, today's state third-class roads and local railroad tracks--regional bodies will decide which of these roads and railroads will be abolished, which will be built anew, which will be repaired today and which later. I have deliberately chosen a (seemingly) politically neutral example, one that is realistic and even probable (incidentally, in the sphere of road repairs we almost find ourselves in this situation already). Nevertheless, from the national point of view (from the point of view of the citizen of the Czech Republic), even this example is not free of risks. The decision to abolish (or even only temporarily close) roads because the region does not have the money to repair them right now will, to a greater or lesser extent, also influence the transportation possibilities of the inhabitants of other regions. Let me point out that I do not cite this example as an argument against regions but exclusively for the sake of illustration. A region--let us attempt a nontraditional definition--is a partial territory of the state, with its own administration in designated areas, above which are the laws of the Czech Republic (of course, these laws must not be in conflict with the regions' powers; on the other hand, the regions' legislative initiative is foreseen--that is, the possibility for them to submit draft laws to parliament). In conformity with the regions' powers must be, self-evidently, also their responsibility and financial provisions. Let me cite an example regarding responsibility: If responsibility for transportation services on their territory is vested in regions (that is, responsibility for citizens being able to use public transport to get to work, school, the doctor, and so forth), something the new law transfers to district offices (in their capacity as state bodies, however, and not as bodies of regional administration), no one should any longer address any complaint to the president or the minister of transportation that some bus route has been abolished because, in a consistent regional arrangement, neither of them can do anything for the citizen in this matter. The complaint will have to be addressed to the appropriate regional "minister of transportation" and regional deputy. However, for the region to be able to bear final powers and responsibility (independent of the state and the community), it must avail itself of a firm and stable flow of financial resources. There is, however, one snag in this, the preservation or elimination of which must be thought through very consistently: If a uniform nationwide system of taxation, coupled with the necessary flow of resources into the budgets of communities, regions, and the state, is to be preserved, this can only be accomplished by means of "apportionment" (percentage share) of taxes according to fixed rules and a uniform nationwide tax policy. Otherwise (for example, in the event of regionally divergent taxes being levied in the interest of ensuring the region's autonomy), the "solidarity principle" (responsibility of the rich for the poor) would be abandoned within the framework of the state and replaced by citizens of the region [sentence as published]. A citizen of the Ostrava or Most area (should they become regions) would have to pay more in taxes than a citizen of the Pardubice region, for example, so that his "regional government and parliament" can live up to their responsibility for the region, even if those "needs of the region" came about as a consequence of activities (such as coal mining) benefiting the state as a whole. Those who consider the claim exaggerated that the regionalization of the Czech Republic beyond a certain very fragile limit amounts to the parceling of the Czech Republic with all its consequences are not playing fair with the citizens of the Czech Republic. To claim that the regionalization of the state is not possible and that there exist no reasons in its favor would be equally insincere. Quite the contrary, there do not exist any absolute reasons for, or obstacles to, any solution whatsoever; what exists, however, are absolute consequences arising from every solution. After decades of centralist obfuscation, the idea of "introducing transparency" is only understandable, justified, and popular. Its immediate and definitive realization is naive, however, and, what is more, dangerous. We can let ourselves be inspired today by the regionalization of Austria, U.S. federalism, or the territorial division of Great Britain. In all of these cases, we encounter long strings of historical events that led to the situation that exists today. These examples confirm that everything is possible when it is necessary for historical reasons. They do not confirm, however, that all "models" are equally beneficial. The exact opposite is the case. These models are the consequences of historical development, which have retained up to the present a certain strength that needs to be respected. From this viewpoint, only "Moravia" has any certain legitimacy in our conditions. Because of the subtlety of this issue, however, I do not want to assess it in this place. I can only say that Rajhrad [in Moravia] is as dear to me as Svata Hora [in Bohemia] and Wallachia [Moravian region] as dear as Sumava [Bohemian region]. The legitimacy of the Hradec Kralove-Pardubice, Zatce-Louny, or (to stick to my Sumava) Prachatice-Vimperk rivalries is not, historical reminiscences notwithstanding, of such a nature as to warrant the formation of regions. The legitimacy of the South Bohemian or the West Bohemian Land is nonexistent, in my opinion, and almost grotesque. While Carinthia or Bavaria are historical phenomena that, for reasons that I am unable to assess, are reflected in the regional arrangement of Austria or Germany, the lands of the Czech crown are a phenomenon that will not be negligible even in the third millennium. When contemplating the possible uniformity of a united Europe, we do not express our apprehensions as West Bohemians or as Central Europeans--and, as far as I am concerned, I am not expressing these apprehensions as a West Bohemian by birth, a Praguer by residence, or a South Bohemian by sentiment--but as citizens of the lands of the Czech crown. with our legacy, historical burdens, and inspirations, with which we want to enrich Europe while preserving ourselves as a single and differentiated whole, as a Europe of Greeks, French, Scots, and Norwegians, but not, for God's sake, a Europe of East Bohemians and South Moravians. What To Do With the Regions Today We live in the year 1994. We are winding up the transformation of our economy and want it to hold its own in contemporary Europe. Our citizens are exposed to changes that, in some social groups, are at the edge of tolerability. We want to turn slaves of communism into proud and honest entrepreneurs, duped workers into self-confident authorities in their respective fields, kolkhoz farmers with no responsibility into efficient providers of food for the nation, and servile (and unpopular) bureaucrats into kind administrators of this country. I am convinced that, in the effort to tackle the issue of the country's regional arrangement too rashly and radically, we are taking upon ourselves a disproportionately heavy burden. Insufficient preparation, ambition-filled impatience, and short-term political calculations are driving us into conventional solutions following up on the "traditions of regional national committees." Because we will probably not find the courage (apparently by right) to abolish districts, a costly three-tier system will come into being. This system had been challenged (in my opinion rightly) even under totalitarianism (under conditions of the much larger Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, where three tiers were more appropriate than in today's Czech Republic). Even without regions, owing to the influence of the new roles of the state in a democracy and in the period of transformation, the state administration employs more people now than it did before November [1989]. In spite of this, I am convinced that both conditions and reasons exist to take the first step toward regionalization, a step that, on the one hand, would lead to decentralization (the bringing of the state administration closer to citizens) and, on the other, to the "de-etatization" of some decisions, with the aim of greater respect for local conditions and differences, without at the same time exceeding the tolerable extent of risks, to which I have attempted to draw attention, and without causing an excessive growth of costs. The solution lies in today's district arrangement. Next year should be used to amend this system. At some places it appears to be appropriate to merge districts and in other places to partition them. The extent of corrective action should not cause a "great shock." 1. In the first step, the territory of the district will become a region. 2. A law will define the regions' powers, which should be broader than those of today's districts. 3. The subsequent year will be devoted to the practical and organizational preparation, to adjustments to the system of taxation, the budget system, and so forth. 4. The elections of 1996 will establish regional self-administrative bodies with, let us say, seven to 20 regional deputies. The adoption of this proposal is based on two prerequisites: a) The large number of regions, which is evidently in contrast with the idea laid down in the Constitution. b) The perception of the region as an entity centering on the regionally warranted allocation of mostly centrally acquired (that is, acquired according to uniform rules) financial resources. I regard the first point as a serious problem--the large number of regions will not do away with the problems of management. A solution would lie in a reduction of the number of regions to approximately a third. This, however, cannot be a realistic task for a year or two, if we do not want to put off regionalization completely. It can, however, lead to another step, which, in my opinion, will depend on whether it will be accompanied by the concentration of communities. Such a concentration would simultaneously make it possible to expand community administration. Objections to the second point can be expected only from those who suffer from the illusion that the region can be not only an independent administrative entity but also an independent economic entity, which spends on its territory resources that it itself has generated. Small regions expose the naivete of such an expectation more than big ones. There is no room here for a more comprehensive argumentation against this idea. The disruption of the "solidarity principle," on which the state is based (as is, in the "downward" direction the community, and in the "upward" direction Europe), is not only selfish from the human point of view but also dangerous from the point of view of the state's integrity. It follows from the perception of the first regionalization step that the region would allocate resources rather than own and dispose of regional property. In Conclusion The train of regional euphoria has been set in motion, and it is difficult to jump onto it while it is moving. It already has its political dimensions, with risks of labeling, and is driven by a certain distribution of political forces. It could really happen that we will be parceled out and will engage in disputes about connecting the East Bohemian and North Moravian highways, in the same way as we are currently engaging in a dispute about a bypass around Plzen. I would only like to protest emphatically against the view that the formation of large regions will bring the administration of the country much closer to the citizen. Plzen bureaucrats and West Bohemian deputies are as far away for the inhabitants of Kvilda or Bozi Dar as are Prague bureaucrats and Czech parliamentary deputies. I concede, however, that the perspective from Plzen, Pardubice, or Olomouc may be different. By pointing out that the reform of the territorial and administrative arrangement is not a "task to be resolved before the next elections," but an eternal task, I wanted to call for circumspection and for the phasing [fazovani] of all amassed ambitions.
