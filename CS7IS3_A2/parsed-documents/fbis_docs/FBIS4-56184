This is what the commander in chief of the Haitian Army, General Raoul Cedras, stated during an interview by LUMIERE NOIRE magazine. In this interview, the head of the Haitian Army recounted the facts which allegedly led to the 30 September [1991] coup d'etat. [words indistinct] to explain [words indistinct] that President Aristide had stirred up. He has always tried to push the institutions to the limit through the streets in order to get rid of any counterpower, eliminate some people, and terrorize possible opponents. He has always been a leftist militant. Even after he came to power through election, he was not able to differentiate between his revolutionary fervor and his new status as head of state, states Gen. Cedras, who advances three reasons for the attitude of the international community after the coup d'etat: The principle of respect for elections means that if a president has been elected, he has the right to (?fulfill his mandate until it expires). He left on 30 September [1991]. The OAS immediately met to condemn Haiti without analyzing the situation first. I have noted that all the presidents who urged the OAS to take those measures -- Perez of Venezuela, for example -- were members of Socialist International, Gen. Cedras explained. The third reason put forward by the head of the Haitian Army is solidarity among presidents because, even though there are three powers in a state of law, it is nevertheless the executive that prevails, Gen. Cedras explained. Gen. Cedras says he is not in power. I am not at all interested in assuming power; I rely on the men of this country to find a solution. Power for power's sake is not an end in itself, but implies first the sense of responsibilities. In this conversation with LUMIERE NOIRE, Gen. Cedras also advocated the creation of a political center. It will be necessary, Gen. Cedras said, for the middle classes to take charge of (?one another), to play a political role in the noble sense of this word, to ally themselves in promoting a candidate of consensus and progress with a precise agenda and who can establish the sense of state, of national interest; all that would put an end to the personal ambitions of some and the external interferences of others. We must give rise to the emergence of a middle class that will be able to assume legitimately a new democratic power cleansed of all excesses. Gen. Cedras appeals to the conscience of international opinion, of all honest democrats who have been misinformed. The truth is that in Haiti we had an electoral coup d'etat [words indistinct] through the ballot and opposed to any kind of organization and to all institutions lacking an agenda, lacking a code of ethics, and whose sole policy is to sow division and to give rise to hatred among the various components of the population by inciting [people] to murder, Gen. Cedras explained. In the same magazine there is an interview with former Haitian President Leslie Francois Manigat, who spoke of an international coup d'etat within the scope of the situation in Haiti.
