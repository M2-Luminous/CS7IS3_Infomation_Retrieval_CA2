PLO Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah said the committee decided at its meeting last night to continue its suspension of the talks with the Israeli side and not to resume them before securing adequate protection for the Palestinian people. A high-level Palestinian source said that Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks and 'Arafat's political adviser, will leave for Washington within hours on an assignment from the PLO leadership to explore the aim of the U.S. invitation to move the talks to Washington. The source added that Sha'th will explain to the U.S. Administration the Palestinian side's concern over the failure to meet a request to provide protection for the Palestinian people under occupation. The official described the U.S. stance as bad and said it was worse than the Israeli position. Ghawshah said that the PLO Executive Committee has rejected the Israeli proposals and offers because they do not meet its basic demand of providing protection for the Palestinians. He added that the PLO also rejected the Israeli proposals to resume the negotiations because there are new realities and the circumstances created by the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron need radical remedies. Ghawshah declared: We are waiting for Israeli measures that will deal with the essential problem which is the settlements. He noted that the PLO has not yet made a decision whether to accept or decline U.S. President Clinton's proposal to move the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to Washington and that this issue is under intensive discussion among the Palestinian leaders to explore the aim behind the proposal, whether it will give impetus to the peace talks, and the possible role that the United States can play in these talks. Ghawshah added that the PLO decided to conduct a series of consultations and communications with the Arabs and other concerned parties. Head of the PLO Political Department Faruq Qaddumi and Fatah Central Committee member Abu-Mahir Ghunaym are due to visit Damascus today for discussions with Syrian officials about the peace negotiations. An envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin is also due to arrive in Tunis later today to discuss the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. 'Arafat earlier sent a message to Indonesian President and the president of the Nonaligned Movement Suharto asking for an urgent and immediate meeting of the movement's Palestine Bureau or Presidency Bureau to discuss the implications of the Israeli massacre, possible international protection for the Palestinians, disarming the Zionist settlers. 'Arafat also sent a message to Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, current chairman of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO], asking for an urgent meeting of the ICO chairmanship bureau to discuss the implications of the Israeli massacre of the Palestinian citizens, the need to provide international protection for the Palestinians, and disarming the settlers. The PLO Executive Committee will continue its discussions of the position that it will adopt on the peace negotiations and the U.S. proposal to move them to Washington. It has been learned that the Palestinian leaders will not make any decision until the Security Council issues a resolution about the Hebron incident. It has also been learned that during last night's meeting sharp arguments took place and diverse attitudes surfaced. A considerable number of the Executive Committee members demanded that the negotiations continue to be suspended, and perhaps boycotted. This group rejects the U.S. proposal to move the talks to Washington unless the Palestinian demands are met. Meanwhile, 'Arafat and several other members urged patience before making a final response to the U.S. proposal, suspending the negotiations for a certain period, perhaps for a week, but not boycotting them so that it might be possible to resume them after the Palestinian anger cools down. The Palestinian public is demanding a boycott of the negotiations and even abolishing the agreement reached with Israel. 'Arafat, who wishes to resume the talks on condition that several Palestinian demands are met, is in a difficult position after Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon declared they were boycotting the Washington talks to protest the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. They said they will not resume the talks until after the Palestinians do so.
