Privalov: "Russia's Khvalynskoye Line"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Today the interests of various states, including those that have been recently formed, are once again beginning to clash on the water area of the Caspian Sea. Therefore, the strategic and economic significance of the Lower Volga and the Caspian are once again dramatically increasing, making them Russia's toehold in this region. Currently, the Caspian , from an at one time "internal" sea, the shores of which still recently belonged to a total of just two countries, is being transformed into a sea with a complicated international legal regime. First of all, this has been caused by the need to delimit the territorial waters and the economic zones among the sovereign states that have been formed on its shores. And although today Russia has been left with a total of 770 km of coastline, it needs to be defended. However, there are still no borders that are precisely defined by treaties and, therefore, there is no proper order. This is the second reason. At the present time, a mass of Russian goods and minerals are exported along the Volga through Astrakhan. Even cases of the export of weapons and other military equipment have increased -- there is a war going on nearby. Furthermore, due to the lessening of monitoring by Russia in the northern Caspian, fish and seals are being caught on an ever increasing scale here and, if this unlimited "fishing" continues further, the Caspian's wealth will be substantially reduced in several years. Take just sturgeon. The Russian fish hatcheries located in Astrakhan and in the oblast are exclusively involved with their restoration. It turns out that Russia is breeding valuable species of fish and the other states are catching them. And this is far from all of the reasons why this region is increasingly acquiring the characteristics of Russia's southern coastal "outpost" on the Caspian. Add to what has been said that the process through which the Caspian region states are acquiring their sovereignty is naturally accompanied by the creation of institutes and all that is inherent to them, including armed forces with navies. Already right now the Iranian Navy contains 62 ships and the Azeri Navy has 15. Both Kazakhstan and Turkmeniya plan to have their own navies. Under these conditions, the role of the Caspian Flotilla is once again increasing for Russia. However, after the transfer of some of the flotilla's ships, bases, and infrastructure facilities to the former union republics, its forces have been significantly reduced. Furthermore, it has lost more than a third of its officer personnel: part went to Ukraine, part to Belorussia [Belarus], others have remained in Azerbaijan or have been released into the reserve. Losses of warrant officer cadres exceed half of their former strength. The state of the flotilla's surface combatants and ships also leaves a lot to be desired. But despite everything, the flotilla exists, is developing infrastructure in new basing locations and is even expanding. In connection with this, the seamen need to resolve a mass of problems that are not characteristic to them. The redeployment has proceeded with difficulty and, first and foremost, due to the time factor. The time periods in which the Caspian Flotilla was transferred to new locations is not proceeding in any comparison with the planned time periods for the withdrawal of Russian troops from other regions. And it was vitally important to create at least the minimal conditions for its basing. However, there was practically nothing at the new locations. In the first stage, in 1992, there was a catastrophic shortage of buildings, wharf frontage, housing and financial support. The Russian Government, recognizing the significance of defending this region, has rendered substantial support to the flotilla. Both the President and the Prime Minister have visited it. The Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus Aleksiy II also consecrated this ground. The leadership of Astrakhan Oblast was prepared and met the seamen as it could. Only that person who knows all of the difficulties of rebasing can really assess the work done by them. The seamen's families have been mainly housed in Astrakhan itself: because it is practically impossible to build houses in very short periods of time under current conditions, they found a solution in leasing some of the dormitories from fishermen, VUZs [higher educational institutions], and other organizations. Plots of land were allocated for the flotilla. The issue on the transfer of the fishing boat repair plant to the military seamen is approaching resolution. Some ships came to Astrakhan to a not altogether empty place; one of the flotilla's battalions was already deployed there. Its base was the foundation for the further development of the needed infrastructure. But there's still a great deal of work in this direction. In accordance with the plan, by 1995 the flotilla must become a full-fledged combined formation that is capable of accomplishing all of the missions assigned to it. At the present time, this plan is being made a reality. So, for example, last year the flotilla had already obtained a number of ships and this year several crews left for their delivery and acceptance from industry. Other, including social, problems are also being resolved. In the social aspect, the construction of a separate garrison, normal housing, outpatient clinics, and a modern hospital are planned... At the present time, some of the flotilla's ships are based at Zolotoy Zaton. It's supposed to be a location with a developed infrastructure but it has its own difficulties. Approach routes cause a great deal of concern. Unfortunately, for the time being they are ordinary dirt roads which can be utilized only in the dry period of the year because the first rain makes them impassable. And this is practically the link to the world: both fuel, food, spare parts and other consumable materials are delivered using them. Wastes, garbage, and spent POL [petroleum, oil, lubricants] are carried off on them. Not everything is satisfactory with the supply of electric energy and steam, especially in winter. Sometimes we have to drive the boilers and diesel engines of surface combatants and boats because of this, thereby reducing the period of their service. One more problem that is new for the flotilla consists of the fact that the Volga freezes during the winter and therefore some of the ships need to be transferred to more southerly areas so that they can accomplish their missions and where we also need to provide living conditions for them. In the process, icebreakers are needed and the issue of obtaining them is very urgent for the flotilla. Furthermore, some of the flotilla's forces are located at Makhachkala. The situation there, as we know, is much more complicated than in Astrakhan and its repercussions are being felt in military posts and garrisons and there is an outflow of the Russian-speaking population from there. Officers and warrant officers are justifiably concerned about the safety of their families and they don't wish to serve in that situation. There are also not only cases of threats directed at the seamen and at their family members but also cases of direct hooligan attacks. And a tragedy occurred quite recently even in Astrakhan: Senior Lieutenant Yu. Plodiyenko, who saved his comrades at the cost of his own life, died at his combat post. Under these conditions, it is difficult for the flotilla command authorities to resolve the very complex missions that face them today because the flotilla is practically being reborn all over again. And the fact that this has become possible is due first of all to the contributions of the people who are serving here: the warrant officers, officers and admirals. Right now the hardiest have remained at it and those who were "weaker" have left it in hard times: they have either left for the other navies, they have remained at their old places or they have bid farewell to the navy. Because Captain 1st Rank S. Pashkin and Captain 2nd Rank V. Filozop, who proved himself to be a hero in the emergency situation and who has been submitted by the command authorities for the order "For Personal Bravery", Captain 3rd Rank A. Gushchin, Senior Lieutenant A. Doronin, Senior Warrant Officers V. Ovchininkov and V. Dovgopolov enjoy such high prestige in the flotilla. Seamen from other fleets are also expressing the desire to serve in the flotilla. The flotilla command authorities are resolving the problem of cadres, that is so complicated for the entire Navy, by quite aggressively enlisting women for military service, the fraction of which is reaching 6-7 percent in some units. But then again, assessments of their service are very positive and the experience of foreign navies attests that the female social stratum in the army can total 10-12 percent without damage for combat readiness. The gray-haired Caspian is uneasy. Strong northerly winds frequently sweep over it, bringing fierce storms with them. Covered by steep waves, the sea becomes threatening and dangerous. Unfortunately, today "storms" of another kind are blowing over the Caspian today: storms sowing disunity, destruction and, at times, even death. And since there are now several owners on the Caspian, they will have to work together to resolve problems and issues that arise among them. And it is better to do that using a friendly, peaceful method on a treaty basis. History has completed its latest loop. The Lower Volga is once again becoming one of the regions where Russia will have to urgently solve a mass of problems. Once again, Russians will hear the words that they have become familiar with since childhood -- Volga, Astrakhan, and Caspian. Once again Russians must set up border posts there, guarding the peace, calm and great wealth of Rus. Let's hope that this time our outposts will be durably placed. Russia is great and there is nothing more to hand over! COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1994.
