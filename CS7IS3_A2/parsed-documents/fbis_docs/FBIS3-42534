At first glance at the interior of the institute you feel a slight disenchantment: the old walls and the decrepit furniture have nothing in common with those nickel-plated, shiny Hollywood surroundings which you involuntarily visualize when the word "space" is mentioned. However, one should not be surprised by the fact that heroic figures in spacesuits are not strolling along the corridors of the institute in spacesuits, but by the fact that Belarus space has received state funding at all. This happened this autumn. The first funds, allocated by the Belarus government for four months of research, by space standards was modest: 350 million rubles. Boris Beregov, the deputy director of the institute, chairman of the republic Space Council, had few hopes for that. This, to be sure, has not been reflected in that uncommon stubbornness with which he has confronted all possible government agencies, striving to obtain support for the ill-understood, costly and little-profitable program. Under the conditions prevailing in impoverished Belarus Boris Beregov achieved the most significant miracle. Despite the existence of a republic council, for the time being there is neither a centralized leadership nor a uniform clear-cut program for the several institutes, enterprises and laboratories working in this field. They all, independently of one another, are engaged in development work, approximately half of which is for the needs of the republic and half for participation in the CIS intergovernmental program for investigation and use of space. The Soviet Union and Europe have carried out parallel military development work which later, also in a parallel fashion, has experienced conversion. As a result, in some respects our level was higher, in other respects that of the West was, but neither Europe nor America in the immediate future will become our clients. With respect to third countries, they (such as the recently arriving Indians) have already expressed their interest in Belarus research. However, as Beregov acknowledges, this is inadequate for the sale of our developed products -- it is necessary to broaden and somehow further improve our products. The production relationships of the countries of the former USSR, which are linked to ours, is a different matter. They have proposed the purchase of systems developed in Belarus, which are inexpensive in comparison with European products. In addition, the specialists who are installing, repairing and adjusting equipment are readily available. We, in turn, are interested in the former Soviet republics for the very same reasons. Around Beregov's desk, as in the good old days, there is a gathering of Russian, Ukrainian, Baltic, Uzbek, Turkmen and Tajik specialists. Belarus scientists are participating in the work of the CIS Intergovernmental Space Council. Its activity is organized on the principle of the European Space Agency. All the countries participating in one project or another are contributing resources to it proportional to their gross national product. But money is not being directed to some abstract treasury, but to research in one's own territory. For example, funding was recently obtained for the work of the Institute of Heat and Mass Exchange of the Belarus Academy of Sciences for study of the thermal insulation of satellites and spaceships. Providing the Russian agency with their results, our specialists receive information on the research carried out in other countries which are members of the agency. Now there is partial funding for work on developing the MK-94 multiband camera for satellites of the Resurs system and payment is being received for work on developing special apparatus for studying the ozone layer. And nevertheless, what reason does Belarus, with its poverty, have for spending money on space? After all, government expenditures on space research are not paying for themselves in any, even superhighly developed country of the world. "In actuality, such research seems suspicious to all who recognize only direct profit," says B. Beregov. "They do not understand that by not sensing the Earth's surface more is lost than is saved in the funding of this work. When in the spring the Pripyat has overflowed and the Polesye has been inundated, the only thing which we could do, insofar as I know, was to go out into the disaster regions and estimate the inflicted losses. But if we had organized a systematic procedure for the collection of information from special radar satellites it would be possible to trace in advance how the water is spreading and accordingly, make predictions. Proceeding on the basis of this information, the government would take measures knowing precisely what had to be done: construct dams or dig trenches, relocate or not relocate the people." Using satellites it is possible to predict the weather and crop yields, find minerals and evaluate ecological conditions. Incidentally, the sole space research in Belarus in which the entire world is interested is probably related to the consequences of Chernobyl. Having survived the accident, we became a unique region where it is possible to monitor the fission of radionuclides, their propagation and their effect on the environment. "With what is space science in Belarus now occupied?" "We have developed special system for processing the information received in sensing the Earth. After all, it is insufficient simply to have photographs in our hands. In order to assess the content of an image it is necessary to use special mathematical methods. We are buying equipment and developing mathematical methods and technologies for the processing of images and are adapting equipment for solving definite problems. We are doing all this by order either of organizations in Belarus or those countries which are interested in such work."
