The meeting took place between visiting North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Yi In-kyu and his Russian counterpart, Vice Minister Aleksandr Panov, on May 12-13. On the loggers issue, the source said, Yi reiterated the Pyongyang stand that North Korean law, too, should be applied to their loggers in Siberia because he argued they are not simple foreigners but workers engaged in a specific duty agreed on between the two countries. Vice Minister Panov was said to have rejected the North Korean demand, stressing that all foreigners staying in Russia are subject to human rights protection under Russian law regardless of the purpose of their stay in Russia. As they failed to iron out their difference, the two officials decided to seek a compromise agreement during the meeting set to take place in Pyongyang shortly to discuss the question of concluding a new logging agreement. Also at the meeting, Yi complained South Korea tries to induce some of their loggers in Russia to defect to South Korea, asking Russia to foil the scheme. Panov rejected the North Korean argument, telling them to produce the evidences, if any, of such scheme, the source said. On the nuclear question, the Russian vice minister advised North Korea to accept international inspection of their nuclear facilities, the source said. He also urged Yi to see to it that his country accept a meeting of eight countries Russia had proposed to discuss the nuclear issue. In reaction, the North Korean said that his country's policy is to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue and that they would affirmative study the idea of eight countries meeting once the idea takes a concrete shape. In the economic area, the two sides agreed to take a set of steps to reinvigorate their hitherto sluggish economic cooperation. The measures they agreed included the promotion of joint-venture schemes and industrial partnership in the far east area of Russia, and staging of economy-related meetings often. The North Korean vice minister further expressed concern about South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's visit to Moscow last April. Vice Minister Panov said Yi's visit was part of military exchanges between two neighboring countries, the source said.
