"I laughed when I saw my name among the (coup) plotters", Mikhail Poltoranin, a former aide of the president and currently the chairman of the State Duma commission on information policy, told TASS on Tuesday. The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA said last week Poltorainin and several other top officials were involved in plotting to oust the president. The office of the Russian prosecutor general said it was checking whether the report corresponds to reality and threatened to bring criminal charges against the newspaper if the information turned out to be false. Poltoranin said that the report was "especially silly", all names listed there were politically incompatible and plans unrealistic. He said he was confused by the fact that the Russian press paid so much attention to the report. "Only limited and incompetent people can get on such a bait", he stressed. On Monday another "plotter" denied his involvement in the "coup". First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets asked the prosecutor's office to clear up the accusations against him. Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov was also on the list. He was the first to deny the allegations in a Sunday TV interview.
