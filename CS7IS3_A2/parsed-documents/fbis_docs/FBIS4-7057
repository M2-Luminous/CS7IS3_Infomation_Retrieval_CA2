The proposal was put forward by Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak at the ministerial meeting of the Third Conference on Sub-regional Economic Cooperation organised by the Asia Development Bank [ADB]. Mr Suphachai stressed that the subcommittees would not serve a bureaucratic purpose. Their function would be to "see to it that the recommended projects in all sectors are implemented in due time". He said later there should be subcommittees on all areas of economic cooperation manned by experts. Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma and south China are discussing and in some cases have started cooperation in transport, energy, environment, trade and investment, human resources and tourism. Mr Suphachai said the sub-regional plans were "widely known in the outside world". "Responsibility rests on our shoulders to keep the momentum of this effort and to agree to move ahead with certain projects as soon as we can," he said. "There is no choice here but to succeed." Besides the sub-regional subcommittees, the deputy prime minister proposed three other points towards what he called a strategy for success. Firstly, he urged sub-regional states to start with projects that are "most feasible, least costly and therefore eligible for concessional financing". Secondly, he called on participants to agree on "fair terms" for the use of infrastructure network. "The aim which must always be kept in mind is to make this network a most efficient means of economic development and not an end in itself," he said. Lastly, he urged encouragement of stronger cooperation among the private sector. While governments should offer the right framework and facilities, business people ultimately would be doing the work. Elaborating on the first point, he drew attention to the transport sector and cited the so-called East-West Corridor, an overland road link between Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. In the energy sector, he welcomed the shift of emphasis from self-sufficiency to a more integrated approach. He urged a well-planned energy management system for the sub- region and serious consideration of the possibility of a grid connection. On the environment, he expressed concern over air pollution and marine oil spills and noted a need to standardise legislation. He offered facilities at Thailand's Environmental Research and Training Centre, set up with help from JICA [expansion unknown] of Japan, for sub-regional training in monitoring, impact assessment as well as management. In human resources, he spoke of Thai Government plans to set up a centre for training in agriculture, health, finance, the hotel industry and development planning in the sub-region. He also welcomed the recommendation that health co-operation include HIV/AIDS prevention and malaria control. In tourism, he supported the idea of promoting the sub-region as one rich in nature, culture and diverse life-styles, and backed the proposal for a sub-regional tourism forum. Mr Suphachai emphasised Thailand's "strong commitment" to sub- regional cooperation by pointing out that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai chairs a national committee specifically set up to oversee this development. Vietnam's Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet reaffirmed Hanoi's commitment. He expressed hope for early translation of projects into reality and confirmed that Vietnam supports meetings to "remove obstacles and bottlenecks". ADB president Mitsuo Sato said sub-regional cooperation was "an important building block of both national and regional development". Countries of the Greater Mekong Sub-region now need to turn ideas into viable projects, strengthen the institutional basis for cooperation and find ways of mobilising necessary resources for project implementation. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific [ESCAP] offered information assistance in terms of trade, investment and energy, and spoke of undertakings for the sub- region in the tourism, transport and environment sectors. In tourism, ESCAP is undertaking, with funds from the Japanese government, a study of tourism development in the Mekong River area, and plans to hold a sub-regional seminar on the subject either in Kunming or Bangkok early next year. In transport, ESCAP is continuing work on the Asian Highway, the Trans Asian Railway and the Trans Asian Land Transport Infrastructure. In environment, ESCAP in cooperation with the ADB, is implementing a project on coastal and marine environment management in the South China Sea which includes coastal areas of Cambodia, China's Hainan province and Vietnam.
