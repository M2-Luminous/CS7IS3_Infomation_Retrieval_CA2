The alliance is pleased at this development. At the same time, Russia's membership in this cooperation project, to which 20 Central and East European countries have already signed up, does not mean an end to a dilemma for NATO and now also for the European Union (EU): How to reconcile the legitimate endeavors by the countries of Central and East Europe to join the West with a relationship with Russia that acknowledges that country's specific and special importance? This is a very real dilemma, one that is papered over but not solved by the PFP. The PFP gives the impression that the United States, West Europe, Central and East Europe, and Russia share the same interest in a new political and security order in Europe. In fact that is most certainly not the case. To start with, the countries of Central and East Europe want to join NATO and the EU as soon as possible. Russia, on the other hand, wants to retain the old dividing line of the Cold War era for as long as possible, and continues to claim a sphere of influence in East Europe. With respect to a balance of power, it is perfectly understandable that Russia is seeking to maintain the earlier status quo for as long as possible, until it is again economically, politically, and militarily stronger. But NATO and the EU have no interest at all in keeping Central and East Europe in a kind of no man's land for an indefinite period as this would then threaten to once again become an area of conflict between the Russian sphere of influence on the one hand and Germany as the major Central European power on the other. The consequences of that could again prove disastrous. Russia is perhaps trying to play Germany off against its NATO and EU partners. But such a power play, totally rejected by the German leaders, would not only be damaging for NATO and the EU, but also for stability throughout the continent. Russian membership in the PFP does not solve this dilemma. And the PFP will in fact be counterproductive if it continues to keep alive the illusion that NATO's and Russia's interests are one and the same. A clear formulation of differences in approach, aims, and interests would not amount to a "lack of respect" for Russia, something that Russia is always so quick to claim. On the contrary, a realistic approach would provide the basis for a mature cooperation, the limits to which would be clearly set. One of these limits must be that Russia should no longer be entitled to use a veto against countries that are still wrestling with the legacy of 40 years of Soviet occupation. It is good that the West is not giving the weakened Russia a free ride. But massaging the bruised Russian ego, and this is largely what the "special status" recently awarded to Russia among the G-7 is all about, does not boil down to policy-making. The same criticism applies to NATO and its PFP. It also applies to the EU which is to hold a summit in Corfu next week. With EU enlargement, Russia's so-called near abroad is also increasingly the EU's near abroad. And that calls for an EU policy that is more than the wishful thinking of which the PFP is indicative.
