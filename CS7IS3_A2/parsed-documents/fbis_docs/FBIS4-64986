And yet these two countries have seized the opportunity and joined the Partnership, thus taking a step that would have been unimaginable a few years ago. From the Finnish angle, this move no longer seems spectacular because Helsinki abandoned the concept of neutrality that it felt obliged to pursue because of the Soviet Union's proximity a long time ago. At that time, the Finns' freedom of decision only went as far as the border of Soviet interests. At the same time, by doing business with the Soviets, Finland developed into one of the most prosperous nations in Europe. Today, Finland is struggling with its worst industrial crisis for decades. The Finns are seeking a way out of this crisis by orientating themselves westward. On the other hand, Sweden's policy of neutrality was not created out of necessity, but out of a conviction that this was the only correct path to take. Neutrality was Sweden's second pillar, the first being the welfare state. Many Swedes still recall proudly that neutrality protected the country against war for hundreds of years. But today there is not enough money to maintain the Army, so the Swedish military is pleading for closer links with NATO. Neutrality, too, has lost its purpose since the end of the Cold War. The welfare state has already shrunk, and now Sweden is bidding farewell to its second fundamental principle. It is to be expected that Sweden will gradually abandon its neutrality for the purpose of joining NATO.
