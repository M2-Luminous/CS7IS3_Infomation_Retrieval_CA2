FBIS4-19497 "drweu076__a94012" FBIS-WEU-94-076-A Daily Report 20 April 1994 ANNEX Germany Death of BfV Official in Libya Still Not Clarified Death of BfV Official in Libya Still Not Clarified AU1904161294 Hamburg DPA in German 1134 GMT 19 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1904161294 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to a spokesman, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] does not yet know any details about the circumstances that led to the death of a BfV official and his wife in Libya. The BfV spokesman affirmed on Tuesday [19 April] that the terrorism expert and his wife were found with serious injuries in Libya on 10 March, two days after he had entered the country by car. On 9 April, a few days after his wife's death, the BfV official died of his injuries in a hospital near Tripoli. As the spokesman added, the official had told his office that he would go on a five-week vacation to Cairo. Since the beginning of the 1970's he had taken various vacation trips to Arab countries. He also knew that the BfV prohibits any trip to Libya. Bonn security circles called it unlikely that official Libyan bodies might have been involved in the death of the BfV official. This would contradict the efforts of the Libyan state leaders for good relations with the FRG. In addition, it is assumed that in such a case it would have been theoretically possible to make the German official "disappear." The fact that the injured couple was not robbed of any valuables and that their car was found undamaged speaks against a robbery. Perhaps, the Germans were involved in a conflict for a so far unknown reason. Speculations that the official was doing research on his own -- perhaps regarding the bomb attack on the Pan-Am plane in 1988 over Lockerbie -- have been called "absurd and pure imagination." There are "other and more effective ways" to do that, it was said.
