The talks were attended, in the status of invited party, by the representatives of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldovan Republic. Our correspondent reports that the observers of the CSCE mission to the Republic of Moldova are not attending the negotiations. According to a statement made by the leader of the Moldovan delegation, Anatol Taranu, the previous rounds resulted in the elaboration of a number of documents that could serve as a solid base for the establishment of the status of the 14th Army. The positions of Moscow and Chisinau diverge regarding the deadline of the pullout of that army, Radio Moscow reports, adding that the Russian party considers that the pullout could be carried out solely after the Dniester region is granted a special status. According to the same source, the leadership of the secessionist [Dniester] republic fears that Moldova might eventually unite with Romania. According to a report broadcast by Radio Moldova, the situation of the [Ilie] Ilascu group [imprisoned by the authorities of the Dniester republic] has become alarming. Ilie Ilascu has been put under an informational blockade, as he is not allowed to receive newspapers or possess a radio set, while his wife has been again denied access to the prison. According to the same source, the personal safety of the other four members of his group is endangered, as other detainees have access to their prison cells and they are assaulting them. The health condition of the entire Ilascu group is also precarious.
