Two goals have priority for 1994: an increased business volume, and cost reduction. Jean-Marie Descarpentries, Bull's CEO, is said to have begun by asking his dealers to produce 4 billion FF in 100 days! He has even supposedly found his war horse: ISM, the distributed systems environment for manufacturing management. Trying to save 3 billion FF in 1994, the Bull CEO presumably will bring about a reorganization and a reduction in the number of locations, as well as measures favoring more part-time work and salary reductions. This program is becoming increasingly harder to negotiate with the unions, which walked out on the management team on 4 January on the grounds that some representatives had not been invited to the meeting. The agenda would have included a discussion of employee layoffs at the Villeneuve-d'Ascq plant, and the startup of Athesa, FM subsidiary of Bull. Nevertheless, it is now a given that Athesa TSP will take over the internal computer operations of Bull (about 750 MFF business volume), while the Athesa International holding company prepares the opening of a subsidiary in Great Britain in the near future. Athesa France, meanwhile, has just landed an initial contract for 20 MFF with the Caisse Centrale du Batiment for the Paris region.
