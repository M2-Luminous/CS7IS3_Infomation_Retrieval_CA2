FBIS4-16075 "drsov072_i_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 CENTRAL ASIA Kazakhstan Siberian Cossacks in Kazakhstan Protest to Nazarbayev Siberian Cossacks in Kazakhstan Protest to Nazarbayev LD1304110094 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1007 GMT 13 Apr 94 LD1304110094 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The friendly association of Siberian Cossacks in Kazakhstan has forwarded a protest to President Nursultan Nazarbayev due to the "soft genocide" with respect to the Cossacks living on the territory of this Republic and violation of Russian-speaking population rights pursued by the Kazakh leadership. The document states that the republic denies the fact of existence of a multi-million Cossack population in Kazakhstan. The arrest of Boris Suprunuyk, one of the leaders of the Russian community in North Kazakhstan who repeatedly spoke against the infringement of the rights of the Russian-speaking population in Kazakhstan was the major premise of this statement. The document underlined that the Cossacks are ready to hold a dialogue with the authorities regarding the provisions of registration of the Cossack communities and granting an official status of a public organization to Cossacks, however, "the Republic associates the notion Cossacks with separatism." The statement, in particular, reports that during the celebration of a Moslem holiday in the Cossack villages of Pokatilovka and Topolevka in the Taldy-Kurgan region the Kazakh nationalists destroyed the house of one of the leaders of the Cossacks threatening to cut all Cossacks. The interior forces blocked these populated centers and nobody was allowed to the place of this incident. In order to learn the details of this incident a delegation of Cossacks headed for these Cossack villages from Taldy-Kurgan, but the employees of the State Road Inspectorate detained them explaining this by the need to verify their documents and then arrested them for 10 days. On 5 April another 25-strong group of Cossacks again endeavored to go to these Cossack villages in order to investigate the circumstances of this incident. However, they were met by a reinforced militia post and accompanied to the city of Sarkand in the Taldy-Kurgan region. On their way to Sarkand as many as 50 Kazakh nationalists, 20 mounted and 30 foot people made an attempt to seize the bus with the Cossacks. Some of the attackers had hunter guns. The Cossacks were detained in the city, several of them were arrested for seven-10 days and accused of the organization of an unauthorized meeting. The board of the friendly association and the council of the Atamans of the Siberian Cossacks believe that these actions of the Taldy-Kurgan region's administration deliberately provoke further aggravation of inter-ethnic relations between Russian Cossacks and Kazakhs. The statement contains a demand to the Kazakh president, as the guarantor of rights and freedoms of the Republic's citizens, to adopt urgent measures in order to prevent any demonstrations of nationalism and lawlessness with respect to Cossacks and to punish the guilty.
