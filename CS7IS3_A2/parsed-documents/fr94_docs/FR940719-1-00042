I [Docket No. 94N&hyph;0078] Medical Devices; Performance Standards for Electrode Lead Wires; Requests for Comments and Information; Public Conference AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; notice of public conference. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its intent to establish special controls, including the promulgation of performance standards, for medical devices that use electrode lead wires. The agency is taking this action because it has determined that special controls are needed to prevent hazardous electrical connections between patients and electrical power sources. FDA is also announcing a public conference on this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). FDA will consider any comments or other information received in response to this ANPRM and information gleaned from the conference when proposing the special controls for devices using electrode lead wires. DATES: Written comments by August 17, 1994. The public conference will be held on July 15, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. To register for the conference, please contact Sociometric, Inc. (address below) by June 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) issued an alert letter in June 1985 to manufacturers, home user support organizations, and apnea monitor users, announcing that CDRH had received reports of one death and two electrical burns that occurred when unsupervised children plugged the male connector pins of the electrode lead wires from a home apnea monitor system into either alternating current (AC) power cords or a wall outlet, rather than into the patient cable which connects to the monitor (Ref. 1). In that letter, the agency announced its intention to embark on a cooperative effort with industry and the medical profession to resolve the problem of potential electrical connection between patients and electrical power sources. FDA also requested each manufacturer to evaluate its device for potential electrode lead wire and patient cable hazards and, when necessary, to consider design changes to preclude insertion of lead wire connectors into AC power cords and outlets. In response, manufacturers voluntarily began to redesign their electrode lead wires and patient cables for home apnea monitors. In addition to issuing the alert letter, CDRH's July 1985 Medical Devices Bulletin (a periodic publication that is distributed to the healthcare community and manufacturers) was devoted in great part to publicizing the lead wire hazard (Ref. 2). Since 1985, FDA has cleared for marketing only those home use apnea monitors with patient cables and lead wires designed to prevent unsafe electrical connections. This protective design has also been required for all apnea monitors cleared for marketing since 1989, whether or not they were intended for home use. Nonetheless, some hospitals continue to use older units, or lead wires and patient cables from other devices, which do not have the protective design. Even with the new models, it may be possible for staff to switch patient cables and/or lead wires, thereby creating a hazard. On August 25, 1993, a 12-day old infant being monitored for apnea was electrocuted in a hospital, in Chicago, IL. FDA's investigation of the incident confirmed that the patient electrode lead wires were unprotected. Specifically, the male connector pins were not protected to prevent unsafe electrical connections. Although the infant apnea monitor involved in that incident had been sold with safety protected lead wires and patient cable, an unprotected patient cable from another manufacturer and unprotected lead wires from a third manufacturer were being used when the infant was electrocuted. In response to this incident, on September 3, 1993, FDA issued a safety alert to hospital administrators, risk managers, and pediatric department directors, warning them that the use of unsafe electrode lead wires with an apnea monitor may be dangerous to the patient, and may be in violation of section 518(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360h(a)) (Ref. 3). FDA included in the alert a number of recommendations to help prevent these accidents. On that same day, FDA also sent all apnea monitor manufacturers a notification letter under section 518(a) of the act (Ref. 4). Section 518(a) of the act authorizes the agency to require that notification be provided when it is necessary to eliminate an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health and when no other practicable means is available under the act to eliminate such risk. FDA determined that manufacturer notification under section 518(a) of the act to all hospitals, clinics, distributors, and suppliers of apnea monitors was necessary to eliminate the unreasonable risk of harm to infants and other apnea monitor patients from unprotected lead wires and patient cables. FDA stated that notification should include replacement of unprotected lead wires and patient cables, and that a warning label should be permanently affixed to all monitors stating that unprotected lead wires and patient cables should not be used with the device because inappropriate electrical connections may pose an unreasonable risk of adverse health consequences or death. FDA also requested manufacturers of all apnea monitors to cease further distribution of unprotected lead wires and patient cables. On September 20, 1993, FDA issued a similar letter to all known manufactures of patient cables and lead wires (Ref. 5). FDA also has received reports of injuries associated with unsafe lead wires and patient cables involving medical devices other than apnea monitors (Ref. 6). In 1986, for example, a death resulted in a hospital from electrocardiogram (ECG) lead wires being plugged into an infusion pump power cord. Similarly, in 1990, a death occurred when neonatal monitor lead wires were inserted into a pulse oximeter power cord. FDA has received additional reports of similar events that resulted in electrical shocks and burns to patients. The agency also has received reports of ECG monitor lead wires being inserted into power sources, causing patient injuries. Finally, FDA has received one report of patient shock involving an electroencephalograph cable. Manufacturers of devices other than apnea monitors that utilize patient electrodes, e.g., ECG, have been encouraged by various organizations to modify their lead wires so that they cannot be inserted into AC power cords or outlets. In February 1987 and May 1993, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) issued hazard reports concerning electrical shock hazards from unprotected lead wires and patient cables in its publication ``Health Devices'' (Ref. 7). On July 15, 1991, the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) amended its Standard for Medical and Dental Equipment (UL 544) to require patient-connected lead wires to be designed to avoid connection to electrical power sources. This requirement became effective on December 1, 1991 (Ref. 8). In March 1993, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published a standard for ECG machines, including a safety requirement for leads (601&hyph;2&hyph;25) (Ref. 9). The IEC, as well as the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), are in the process of developing a standard for all leads. There is also an existing German standard (DIN 42 802) which has been adopted by some U.S. manufacturers in their design of safety protected lead wires (Ref. 10). On December 28, 1993, FDA issued a Public Health Advisory to hospital nursing directors, risk managers, and biomedical/clinical engineering departments for distribution to all units in their hospitals and outpatient clinics, as well as to home health care providers and suppliers affiliated with those facilities, advising them of the hazards associated with use of electrode lead wires with unprotected male connector pins. (Ref. 11). In the Public Health Advisory, FDA expanded the scope of its September 3, 1993, apnea monitor safety alert to include all devices using patient electrodes. FDA noted that, even though manufacturers have changed the design of their devices to minimize the potential hazard, some facilities are still using older models that make it possible for staff to switch patient cables and/or lead wires, thus creating a hazard. FDA recommended various precautions to prevent the use of unsafe lead wires and patient cables. II. Revisions Under Consideration In accordance with section 513(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)), FDA has classified medical devices intended for human use into one of three regulatory classes, i.e., class I, general controls; class II, special controls; and class III, premarket approval. Classification depends on the extent of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each device. Apnea monitors, as well as many other medical devices that use patient electrodes, are classified into class II. Class II devices are devices for which general controls by themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance (see 21 CFR 860.3(c)(2)). Possible special controls include the issuance of performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of guidelines (including guidelines for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification submissions in accordance with section 510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)), recommendations, and other appropriate actions as FDA deems necessary to provide such assurance. (See section 513(a)(1)(B) of the act.) The agency recognizes that, despite efforts to eliminate the risk, unprotected lead wires and patient cabling systems are still distributed by some manufacturers as replacements for existing equipment, and may also be interchangeable among various medical devices. In order to reduce the risks to health presented by these devices, the agency is considering establishing special controls for devices that use lead wires. The agency believes these controls should include, but not be limited to, the development of a performance standard. FDA believes that the development of a performance standard is necessary to reduce or eliminate the hazards of unprotected lead wires and patient cables. The DIN standard is a design, rather than a performance, standard, and may be too restrictive for application to all devices. While the proposed AAMI and IEC standards for all leads are more general, they are not yet completed. Therefore, the agency is considering establishing a standard that resembles the UL standard. The agency will consider other standards, however, that are finalized before completion of this rulemaking process. FDA is also considering revising CDRH's Office of Device Evaluation's ``blue book'' to reflect the agency's policy of not clearing for marketing unprotected male pins that may be used with any device with patient electrodes. FDA is soliciting comments on the issuance of a performance standard that would eliminate the risk of burns and death associated with placing an unprotected electrode lead wire directly into a power source. FDA is soliciting comments on all aspects of this ANPRM, and specifically requests comments on the following issues: 1. The current extent of manufacturing, distribution, and use of unprotected patient cables and electrode lead wires as replacement products. 2. Advantages, if any, of using unprotected electrode lead wires with particular medical devices. 3. The devices, if there are any, that cannot accept redesigned electrode lead wires or patient cables. 4. Cost to manufacturers and the user community to convert to protected electrode lead wires and patient cables for all medical devices. 5. Extent of substitution, if any, of unprotected nonmedical electrode lead wires and patient cables, for use as medical device electrode lead wires and patient cables. 6. Essential components of a performance standard for lead wires and patient cables. 7. Viability of applying a performance standard across device types. 8. Alternative solutions to the removal of all unprotected electrode lead wires from the market, such as banning them under 21 CFR part 895. III. Public Conference FDA, the Health Industries Manufactures Association, and the American Hospital Association are sponsoring a public conference entitled ``Unprotected Patient Cables and Electrode Lead Wires'' to be held on July 15, 1994. The purpose of the conference is to: (1) Focus attention on medical devices that use unprotected electrode lead wires; (2) bring together patient cable and lead wire manufacturers, device manufactures, distributors, users, and purchasers to facilitate understanding of the electrode lead wire problem and possible solutions, including the development of performance standards, and the announcement of new regulatory policy for all devices that use patient electrodes; (3) solicit industry and user input concerning FDA's intention to develop a new regulatory framework for devices that use patient electrodes; (4) identify the extent of existing and potential design and user problems, including design applicability for specific devices; and (5) identify the economic impact of the proposed solutions to these problems.
