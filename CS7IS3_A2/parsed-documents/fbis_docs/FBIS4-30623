It is believed the leaflets in question were those circulated here and in several major cities across the country earlier this month. They called for an uprising against minority ethnic-Chinese Indonesians who have been criticised for their dominant role in business and for controlling the economy. The armed forces daily, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA, in a front-page report yesterday, did not make reference to the specific contents of the leaflets. But the report said the little-known Kelompok Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islam Group) sought to incite people into undertaking activities which would split national unity and the country. It said that the 13 members of the group were captured on Thursday at a house in West Jakarta and added that the military had been monitoring their activities for some time. West Jakarta District Military Commander Lieutenant Colonel I.P. Wisworo said the group attempted to put up a fight but surrendered after their leader, identified as 23 year-old Mus, was "incapacitated" by security forces. No other details of the operation were publicised and Lt. Col. Wisworo himself was not available for further comment yesterday. ANGKATAN BERSENJATA said the leaflets related to SARA issues -- the acronym used here to refer to the sensitive and, if exploited, potentially explosive issues of ethnicity, religion, race and differences between groups of any kind. The government of ethnically diverse Indonesia has adopted a hardline attitude towards individuals and groups which exploit SARA issues to heighten political and social tension. Although nearly 90 percent of Indonesia's more than 185-million-strong population are Muslim, President Suharto and the military in particular have reacted strongly to counter and act against anyone with intentions of turning the country into an Islamic state. The question of the ethnic Chinese Indonesians' stake in the economy has often been made an issue by politicians, business, and interest groups who feel that the indigenous majority -- 25 million of whom live below the poverty line -- has not received an equitable share of opportunities. Indonesia's five million ethnic-Chinese community is estimated to control anywhere from 50 to 60 percent of the economy. The leaflets, which focused on the issue of dominance and accused the Chinese of disadvantaging other Indonesians, resulted in rumours about unrest and caused unease among the ethnic-Chinesc community and others here. Lt. Col. Wisworo reiterated the government's long-standing call to Indonesians not to be influenced and caught up by the sentiments expressed in the leaflets and said the population could help by reporting such issues to the security forces.
