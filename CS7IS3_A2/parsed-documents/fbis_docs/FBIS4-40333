The committee's chairman, Toktar Aubakirov, linked it with the Kazakh government's failure to develop a statute for peace-keeping forces. In an interview with INTERFAX Wednesday [15 June], he said the statute should stipulate the rights, duties and privileges of these units as well as every individual soldier. "Each soldier of this battalion must serve on a contract basis," he pointed out. Aubakirov himself was ambiguous about sending a peace-keeping battalion to Tajikistan. On the one hand, Kazakhstan must comply with its obligations under the treaty on the joint guarding of CIS borders. "On the other hand, as a father I do not want my son to be killed in an alien country," he said. Aubakirov believes that the Tajik people should settle their issues themselves. In his opinion the peace-keeping forces "imposed their order on Tajikistan in a violent way." Kazakh Deputy Defense Minister Alibek Kasymov told INTERFAX Wednesday that his republic was ready to fulfill its obligations to guard the Tajik borders. He said that a Kazakh battalion numbering 500 servicemen had been stationed in Tajikistan since 1993. "The peace-keeping battalion is waiting for its turn to be deployed. If the Supreme Soviet ratifies the treaty, we will deploy it," he said.
