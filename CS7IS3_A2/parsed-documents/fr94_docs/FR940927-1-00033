FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sue McNeil, Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, (202) 634&hyph;2443. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A summary of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this docket was published in the Federal Register on August 18, 1994 (59 FR 42563). Order Adopted: September 16, 1994. Released: September 16, 1994. In the Matter of: Eligibility for the Specialized Mobile Radio Services and Radio Services in the 220&hyph;222 MHz Land Mobile Band and Use of Radio Dispatch Communications. By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau: 1. On September 6, 1994, American Mobile Telecommunications Association, Inc. (``AMTA'') filed a Motion For Extension Of Time regarding the time for filing Comments and Reply Comments in the above-entitled proceeding. AMTA requests that the Commission extend the deadlines for filing comments and reply comments from September 21, 1994 and October 6, 1994 to October 21, 1994 and November 7, 1994 respectively. RAM Mobile Data USA Limited Partnership (``RMD'') has filed an opposition to AMTA's request. 2. AMTA asserts that the rule changes proposed in this proceeding, if adopted, would fundamentally affect the wireless industry and the regulatory environment in which AMTA's members operate. AMTA seeks an extension of time so that it may evaluate these proposals in light of the Commission's recently adopted Third Report and Order in GN&hyph;Docket No. 93&hyph;252, which establishes new technical, operational, and licensing rules for commercial mobile radio services (CMRS). 1 AMTA observes that the text of the CMRS Order has not yet been released and requests that parties have the opportunity to review the text so that they can assess the substantive impact of the CMRS Order on the issues raised in this proceeding. 2 1 Third Report and Order, GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, FCC 94&hyph;212, adopted August 9, 1994, release pending (CMRS Order). 2 AMTA Motion at 4. 3. RMD opposes AMTA's extension request on the grounds that it could delay disposition of a pending waiver petition submitted by RMD to waive the wireline restriction. RMD also argues that a delay would be inconsistent with the Commission's overall goal of establishing regulatory parity between SMRs and competing CMRS providers. 3 3 RMD Opposition at 2. 4. We find that the public interest would be served by granting a short extension so that interested parties have the opportunity to assess the impact of the CMRS Order on the issues raised in this proceeding. We agree with RMD, however, that undue delay in this proceeding should be avoided. We therefore conclude that a two-week extension of the comment and reply deadlines is appropriate. 5. Accordingly, it is ordered, pursuant to ยง1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.46, that the deadline for filing initial comments in this proceeding is extended from September 21, 1994 to October 5, 1994, and that the deadline for filing reply comments is extended from October 6, 1994 to October 20, 1994.
