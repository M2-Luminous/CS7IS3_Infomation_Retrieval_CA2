FR940921-2-00014 FR940921-2-00013 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Notice of a Class Deviation To Waive Federal Register Notices of Financial Assistance Awards To Help Meet Special Power and Propulsion Needs for Future Space Missions AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of class deviation from 10 CFR 600.14(f). SUMMARY: Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.4, Deviations, the Department of Energy has authorized a class deviation from 10 CFR 14(f) which requires a Federal Register Notice of each financial assistance award. This deviation applies exclusively to applications received in response to a Notice of Program Interest (NOPI) entitled Invitation for Proposals Designed to Support Federal Agencies and Commercial Interests in Meeting Special Power and Propulsion Needs for Future Space Missions (58 FR 63931, December 3, 1993) which was published by the Department of Energy. Applications submitted in response to the NOPI were accepted through January 31, 1994. The intent of publishing notification of financial assistance awards is to foster competition and provide information regarding subcontracting opportunities. However, a Notice of Program Opportunity has already served as notice to interested applicants, and no subcontracting opportunities have been identified. Additionally, due to programmatic requirements, it is important that awards be made as soon as possible. Therefore, the Department of Energy has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 600.4, that a deviation from the requirement to publish a Federal Register Notice of each such award is (1) Necessary to achieve program objectives, (2) necessary to conserve public funds.
