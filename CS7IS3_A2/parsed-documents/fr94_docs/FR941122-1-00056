FR941122-1-00056 FR941122-1-00015 30. The Commission further proposes to adopt bid withdrawal, default, and disqualification rules for 800 MHz SMR licensing based on its general competitive bidding rules and seeks comment on these proposals. Under these procedures, any bidder who withdraws a high bid during an auction before the Commission declares bidding closed, or defaults by failing to remit the required down payment within the prescribed time, would be required to reimburse to the Commission the difference between its high bid and the winning bid amount the next time the license is offered by the Commission, if the subsequent winning bid is lower. A defaulting auction winner would be assessed an additional penalty of three percent of the subsequent winning bid or three percent of the amount of the defaulting bid, whichever is less. In the event that an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified, we propose to re-auction the license either to existing or new applicants. The Commission would retain discretion, however, to offer the license to the next highest bidder at its final bid level if the default occurs within five business days of the close of bidding. 31. The Further Notice also proposes to adopt the transfer disclosure requirements contained in Section 1.211(a) of the Commission's rules for all 800 MHz SMR licenses obtained by competitive bidding and specific rules governing unjust enrichment by designated entities. Generally, applicants transferring their licenses within three years after the initial license grant will be required to file, together with their transfer application, the associated contracts for sale, option agreements, management agreements, and all other documents disclosing the total consideration received in return for the transfer of its license. 32. The Commission also proposes to apply its previously adopted special rules prohibiting collusive conduct in the context of competitive bidding to the 800 MHz SMR service and seeks comment on this proposal. 33. The Further Notice proposes specific measures and eligibility criteria for designated entities, i.e., businesses owned by minorities and/or women, small businesses, and rural telephone companies. The Commission seeks comment on these proposals, and specifically on identifying special provisions that will create meaningful incentives and opportunities for such entities that are tailored to the unique characteristics of the 800 MHz SMR service. 34. The Commission proposes to utilize bidding credits and a tax certificate program to encourage participation by businesses owned by women and minorities in auctions for the 800 MHz SMR service. It seeks comment on whether the likely value of MTA-based SMR licenses would support a 40 percent bidding credit, but proposes a bidding credit of 25 percent for the ``lower 80'' channel licenses given their expected lower value. To prevent unjust enrichment by women and minorities trafficking in licenses acquired through the use of bidding credits, the Further Notice proposes imposition of a forfeiture requirement on transfers of such licenses to entities that are not owned by women or minorities. 35. The Commission also proposes to establish a tax certificate program under which tax certificates would be issued to: (a) non-controlling initial investors in minority and women-owned 800 MHz SMR applicants and licensees, upon the sale of their non-controlling interests; and, (b) 800 MHz SMR licensees who assign or transfer control of their licenses to minority and women-owned entities. It also proposes to impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer or assignment of 800 MHz SMR licenses obtained through the benefit of tax certificates. 36. In terms of eligibility criteria, the Commission proposes that in order to be deemed a business owned by minorities and/or women, minorities or women must have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and a 50.1 controlling interest in the designated entity. For limited partnerships, the general partner must be a minority and/or a woman (or an entity 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women) that owns at least 50.1 percent of the partnership equity. In the PCS context, the Commission established an alternative definition for minority- and female-owned businesses whereby women and/or minority principals control the applicant and own at least 25 percent of the equity and 50.1 percent of the voting stock (in the case of corporations). The Further Notice seeks comment on which of these definitions is most appropriate for purposes of determining designated entity eligibility in the 800 MHz SMr service, or whether both definitions should be adopted in the alternative. It also proposes to apply to the 800 MHz SMR applicants the same affiliation and attribution rules for calculating equity and stock ownership previously adopted in the PCS context. 37. The Commission proposes to adopt installment payments for small businesses bidding for 800 MHz SMR licenses. To ensure that large businesses do not become the unintended beneficiaries of installment payment provisions meant for small businesses, the Commission also proposes to make the unjust enrichment provisions in its general competitive bidding rules applicable to installment payments by SMR applicants. The Commission seeks comment on this proposal including whether additional unjust enrichment provisions are necessary for the 800 MHz SMR service.
