FR940922-1-00047 FR940922-1-00008 EPA further believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is needed in the OTR in order for serious areas with a 1999 attainment deadline to attain on time. Such areas, including the northern serious areas downwind of the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area and western/northwestern New England, face a need for tremendous reductions on a very fast track in order to attain by 1999. Since EPA believes that other reasonable and practicable options are not available to achieve the entire shortfall in emissions reductions necessary for timely attainment, even the limited reductions that the OTC LEV program would achieve in model year 1999 are actually necessary. And the program is not impracticable or unreasonable for this purpose, since the costs in 1999 will be limited in proportion to the limited vehicles that will meet the standards during that first model year. Further, EPA believes the manner in which areas actually demonstrate that they ultimately achieve attainment further supports the conclusion that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for the serious areas to attain by 1999. According to EPA guidance, attainment is reached when an area experiences no more than three exceedances of the ozone NAAQS over a three-year period. 62 In other words, air quality that results in no more than one exceedance of the NAAQS per year averaged over three years will be sufficient for attainment, and three years of such data are necessary to demonstrate that the state has achieved such air quality. 62 This is assuming the area has complete ozone monitoring data. An adjustment is specified in the ozone NAAQS to account for missing data. Where data are incomplete, the number of exceedances that would be expected had the data been complete is calculated to determine the attainment status of the area; See 40 CFR 50.9 as interpreted by Appendix H; ``State Implementation Plans; General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.'' 57 FR at 13506 (April 16, 1992); Memorandum from John Calcagni, former Director of EPA Air Quality Management Division to Regional Air Division Directors, ``Procedures for Processing Requests to Redesignate Areas to Attainment.'' (Sept. 4, 1992.) The Clean Air Act attainment requirements take into account that states may not be able to achieve air quality improvements two years prior to the attainment year deadline in order to be able to show attainment over a three-year period ending by that deadline year. Under section 181(a)(5) of the Act, a state may apply to EPA for a one-year extension of the attainment deadline specified in section 181 if the state has complied with all SIP requirements and the area in question has experienced no more than one exceedance of the ozone NAAQS during the deadline year, containing the attainment date. EPA may grant up to two one-year extensions under this provision. Of course, in order to achieve the NAAQS and be eligible for redesignation to attainment, the states must sustain the air quality improvements achieved in order to have not more than one exceedance for each of the two extension years, and are likely to have to control growth in emissions in order to do so. Serious areas in the OTR may need to rely on extensions of the attainment deadline under section 181(a)(5) in order to avoid a finding of failure to attain (and the consequent ``bump-up'' to a severe classification with a 2005 attainment date). 63 EPA believes it is highly likely, in such a case, that OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) will be necessary to achieve reductions in order to offset growth and sustain attainment-level air quality through the 2000 and 2001 extension years. OTC LEV would generate increasing reductions in those years, due to fleet turnover. 63 The available evidence described in this notice indicates strongly that these areas will not be able to avoid a bump-up without relying on the one-year extensions available under section 181(a)(5). In sum, since OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) is necessary to bring serious and severe areas stretching from Washington, DC to Portsmouth, New Hampshire into attainment by the 1999, 2005, and 2007 deadlines applicable to those areas, and because the reductions from OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) will be needed in areas located in a broad area extending from the south through the northwest of each of those areas and nearby locations from which vehicles may travel and be traded, EPA proposes to conclude that OTC LEV is necessary throughout the OTR to bring those areas into attainment by those dates.
