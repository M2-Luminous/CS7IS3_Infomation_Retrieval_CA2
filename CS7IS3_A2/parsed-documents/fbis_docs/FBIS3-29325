Hence, the increase in the defense budget will be curbed to less than 1 percent for the first time in 34 years since 1960, when its increase was curbed to 0.6 percent. We pointed out when the Finance Ministry announced a draft of the fiscal year 1994 budget that the curb on the defense budget is a trend that reflects the current times. With the tight fiscal policy envisioning an increase of only 1.0 percent in the entire national budget, the defense budget cannot be increased exceptionally. Given the post-Cold War situation of the world and the Far East region, the curb on the defense budget is an inevitable decision and a matter of course. In his speech last fall at a ceremony reviewing the Self-Defense Forces [SDF], Prime Minister Hosokawa unveiled his plan to review the "Guideline for the Defense Buildup Plan" and stressed that "Japan should take the initiative in promoting disarmament worldwide." In response, the Finance Ministry planned to curb the increase in the fiscal year 1994 defense budget to a negative figure by cutting back on the procurement of military hardware even before the guideline is reviewed. Meanwhile, the prime minister is said to have intended to curb the growth in the defense budget to zero. The DA, however, vehemently resisted this. The DA has claimed that 1) although it is said that European nations and the United States have been promoting arms control and disarmament, what they actually are doing is reducing their so-called redundant war capabilities; 2) unlike in Europe, there is no framework for disarmament and collective security arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region, and 3) in particular, an unstable situation continues to be present in the states neighboring Japan. The DA has opposed any attempt to curb the growth in the defense budget, saying that about 80 percent of the defense budget goes for personnel and food expenses and payments for military equipment procured in past years. The DA has also asserted that if funding for the repair of major military hardware is slashed, this would ground many aircraft and keep many ships in port, thereby scuttling the SDF's plans to carry out training and maintain Japan's security. The potential Soviet [as published] threat to Japan has now decreased largely, and the United States has cut its 1995 defense budget by 0.9 percent. The current situation is that the SDF cannot avoid making itself lean. The DA has so far worked to "build the SDF into a force beloved by the people," and we believe that its efforts to make the SDF a lean force will be welcomed by the people. Japan's neighbors in Asia, who have been concerned about the emergence of Japan as a military power, are also expected to welcome the DA's efforts. What is noteworthy is that the growth of the defense budget has been curbed to less than 1.0 percent, but there is one point that we cannot clearly understand. The percentage of the defense budget compared to the entire general accounts budget still remains unchanged. In the past few years, the ratio has hovered around 6.2-6.4 percent, and this time, the ratio stands at 6.4 percent. In other words, the ratio of the defense budget compared to the overall budget remains as it has been. The inclusion in the defense budget of the procurement of airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft and Patriot missiles is a question mark. The ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan, which has so far opposed their procurement, has agreed to this on the condition that the procurement be reexamined in the course of reviewing the "guideline." No serious debate has been held as to whether Japan really needs the aircraft, and the government intends to purchase the aircraft on the grounds that the Liberal Democratic Party government earlier promised the United States that it would buy it. An advisory body to the prime minister is set to reach conclusions on the review of the "guideline" by this summer. The prime minister should set a direction of keeping the defense budget in check by defining the current curb on the defense budget as an important starting point for a future institutional curb on the budget.
