FBIS4-59235 "drnes091_n_94001" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 LEBANON Prime Minister Confirms Intent To Remain at Home Prime Minister Confirms Intent To Remain at Home NC1005142094 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1210 GMT 10 May 94 NC1005142094 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Beirut, 10 May (MENA) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has confirmed his insistence on staying at home, not carrying out his duties, and clinging to his stance on making major changes in his government. In statements made today, he said that he is determined to implement his changes and that he will not accept any mediation that would keep the government situation unchanged no matter what the consequences. Al-Hariri explained that his proposal of a ministerial reshuffle by increasing the cabinet members from 30 to 34 and enlarging the Christian representation in his new government aims to secure the government under unstable domestic and regional circumstances and to enhance national unity. The Lebanese prime minister said he seeks to liberate the executive authority from interventions and pressure and that the country's domestic situation can no longer tolerate the policy of settlements and blackmail of the state's interests. In his statements, he disclosed existing differences between his ministers' stances, which have caused problems in the government's solidarity. He openly charged that some of his ministers have been unproductive and contentious and called for ending the Christians' boycott of participation in the executive authority. Main Christian parties, such as the Phalangist Party, the National Bloc Party, and the National Liberal Party, rejected participating in any new government led by al-Hariri in the presence of the current Chamber of Deputies, which they describe as illegitimate after they boycotted the parliamentary elections in August 1992. Al-Hariri, who is staying home for the second day, asked some of his supporters who demonstrated yesterday asking him to change his mind about staying home to stop these demonstrations, warning of any incidents by some suspicious elements that might harm the security situation in the country. The Lebanese Interior Ministry today issued a statement banning any demonstrations without prior license. Informed Lebanese circles believe that the current atmosphere on the street might usher in an open confrontation between the legislative and executive authorities since Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri called today for a plenary session of the chamber on 25 and 26 May without defining an agenda for the session. These circles fear that the exchange of criticism between the government officials might escalate, now that the cabinet crisis is threatening a political crisis between the leadership of the presidency, the Chamber of Deputies, and the cabinet. But some optimistic circles expect Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam to play a decisive role in resolving this crisis after he returns to Damascus from Johannesburg tomorrow evening, Wednesday. These circles do not rule out the possibility of holding an expanded summit meeting in Damascus attended by Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Nabih Birri, and Rafiq al-Hariri, as well as by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad as a necessary step to stop this crisis from escalating.
