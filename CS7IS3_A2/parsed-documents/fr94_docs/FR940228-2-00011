FR940228-2-00011 FR940228-2-00002 Home market sales of obsolete merchandise and distress sales were not disregarded in our cost analysis unless there was documented information on the record demonstrating that such sales were outside the ordinary course of trade. With respect to FAG Germany, we disregarded certain sales reported by the company in its home market database. The disregarded sales pertain to two unrelated German resellers of FAG bearings. Although FAG reported that it did not know whether these resellers sold its bearings in Germany or abroad, we preliminarily determine, based on the following information obtained at verification, that FAG, at a minimum, should have known that the two resellers would export its bearings. At verification, we found that FAG referred, both orally and in its records, to these resellers as ``indirect exporters.'' We learned that one FAG subsidiary sold to one of these resellers from its export price list, rather than from its domestic price list. Finally, we contacted one of the resellers independently and were told that it only sells in export markets and that its suppliers were aware of this. During verification, we inquired of other German producers/exporters about potential sales to ``indirect exporters.'' We did not obtain conclusive evidence that reported home market sales were in fact export sales. However, if we obtain additional information indicating that other producers reported home market sales that we ultimately conclude were export sales, we will delete these sales from their home market databases. In accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, we used constructed value as the basis for FMV when there were no usable sales of such or similar merchandise for comparison. We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act. We included the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, profit and packing. To calculate CV we used: (1) actual general expenses, or the statutory minimum of 10 percent of materials and fabrication, whichever was greater; (2) actual profit or the statutory minimum of 8 percent of materials, fabrication costs and general expenses, whichever was greater; and (3) packing costs for merchandise exported to the United States. Where appropriate, we made adjustments to CV in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56, for differences in circumstances of sale. For comparisons to PP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses and added U.S. direct selling expenses. For comparisons to ESP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses. We also made adjustments, where applicable, for home market indirect selling expenses to offset U.S. commissions in PP and ESP calculations. For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we made further deductions for constructed value for indirect selling expenses in the home market, capped by the indirect selling expenses incurred on ESP sales in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).
