President is obligated to make the annual report by the Constitution. On February 10 President Brazauskas will present commentaries on the report. The draft agenda gives half an hour for Brazauskas to speak. Then he will answer to the questions asked by Saeimas members. The presidential annual report consists of approximately 70 pages. In the report Brazauskas notes that the current political situation in Lithuania has become calmer after the period of looking for enemies passed. The efficient work of Saeimas was instrumental in stabilizing the political situation, although some contradictions existing in the society is reflected in Saeimas as well. Brazauskas expresses regret that parliamentary competition among political parties often has destructive results. According to Brazauskas, one of the most important problems is restructuring of the state apparatus. "What we need is not many, but professional state officers", Brazauskas admits. This must be achieved not by apealing to morals, but by adopting a law on state officers. Brazauskas suggests that the legal system should be reformed as soon as possible because of the increasing crime rates. The report includes statistics -- last year's crime rates increased by 6.6 times as compared with 1992. The report says that at present 14 thousand people are in the military service in Lithuania. Brazauskas notes that this number must be the limit which should not be exceeded. Instead the intellectual potential of the people in the military service should be increased alongside with a better material supply. Brazauskas considers the economic situation and says that the inflation decreased from 1163 percent in 1992 to 32 percent in 1993. He expressed regret that investments into the Lithuanian economy were rather small. Foreign investments did not add much to the Lithuanian economy as well. Until 1994 Lithuania received 430 million US dollars in foreign loans. This year it must pay the interest rates which will make 17 million dollars. But Brazauskas denied statements of some economists that all the credits are used only for the food purchase. Brazauskas points out positive results in Lithuanian foreign policy, the unity of the three Baltic States among them. A new formula "three plus five" has been strengthening its position in the foreign policy. This is cooperation between the three Baltic and five Nordic countries. The report notes that "rapprochement between Lithuania and European Union would make positive influence on the life of people". Thus, the agreement on free trade between Lithuania and European Community is considered by Brazauskas as a priority in Lithuanian foreign policy. He hopes that it will be signed in the middle of this year and will come into force in 1995. In the next stage of the relations with EC Lithuania should sign the agreement on associated membership. Brazauskas admits that at present a new page has been opened in the history of the Lithuanian-Russian relations. However, issues of the compensating the harm which was done during the years of occupation will remain on the agenda of the negotiations with Russia. Brazauskas suggests forming a special group at the Foreign Ministry which will deal with the issues of compensation. Brazauskas emphasizes that Lithuania objects to giving a mandate by the United Nations for Russia according to which Russia will be granted a right to maintain peace keeping in the former USSR territories.
