FBIS4-11875 "drnes064dd_94016" FBIS-NES-94-064 Daily Report 3 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Soldier Wounded; Hamas Kidnaps Fatah Official Soldier Wounded; Hamas Kidnaps Fatah Official TA0304064294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0500 GMT 3 Apr 94 TA0304064294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier was lightly wounded a short while ago when shots were fired from a passing car at IDF headquarters in Gaza city. A senior Fatah official was kidnapped by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists in Gaza city over the weekend. Hamas claims that the man was collaborating with the Israeli authorities. Palestinian sources told our correspondent Moti Amir that the real reason behind the kidnapping was a dispute over land in Rafah. In the course of the kidnapping a violent fight broke out; one Hamas activist was killed and 30 were injured. The sources stressed that because of the continuing clashes with Hamas, Fatah was making efforts to capture influential positions and seize control of land and installations before Hamas does. Our army affairs correspondent has learned that two wanted Hamas activists turned themselves in to the IDF over the past few weeks. IDF commanders in the Gaza Strip are continuing to hold contacts and meetings with Hamas members in an effort to persuade them to halt terrorist activity. Military sources said that the Hamas activists have a great deal of motivation to carry out terrorist attacks and they are expected to increase their efforts over the next few days.
