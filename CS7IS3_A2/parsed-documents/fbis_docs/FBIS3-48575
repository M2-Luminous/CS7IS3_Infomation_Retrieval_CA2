General Tran Van Quang, alleged author of remarks reported in one of the documents, said the study by U.S. Intellegency Agency [as heard] released in Washington on Monday backed the Vietnam's stand that the documents were fabrications. He said the verdict by the U.S. agency would help speed up normal relations and benefit both Vietnam and America.
