FR941017-2-00100 FR941017-2-00059 Even though the proposed rule change significantly improves the Exchange's audit trail with respect to late exercises, the Commission believes that the Exchange should continue to examine ways of ensuring compliance with the Exercise Cut-Off Time and the other requirements of Rule 6.24. In this regard, the Commission encourages the Exchange to review the permitted exceptions to Rule 6.24 and consider ways of establishing parameters as to the extent of the exceptions. 25 25 For example, the Exchange may want to define expressly in the rule the circumstances that qualify for a good faith exception. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, as amended, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register. Specifically, the Commission notes that the amended proposal is substantively similar to proposals submitted by the other options exchanges, which are being approved concurrently with the PSE's proposed rule change. 26 Additionally, each of the proposals submitted by the other exchanges was noticed for the full comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. Finally, Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the PSE proposal, as was the case with the amendments to the proposals submitted by the other options exchanges, merely clarify the application of the rules and may serve to minimize confusion and disputes between and among members and customers as to the application of Rule 6.24, as amended. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change, as amended, on an accelerated basis. 26 See supra note 5. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the proposed rule change, as amended. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the PSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;12 and should be submitted by November 7, 1994. It Is Therefore Ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 27 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;12), as amended, is hereby approved. 28 27 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). 28 The Commission notes, however, that the proposed rule change will not be implemented until the Commission receives certain written representations from the OCC regarding the operational status of C/MACS. See supra note 21. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 29 29 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
