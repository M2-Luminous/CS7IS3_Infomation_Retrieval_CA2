ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its public information regulations to help ensure that the identities of those who report adverse events associated with human drugs, biologics, and medical devices, and the identities of patients are held in confidence and not disclosed by FDA, as provided in current agency rules, or by manufacturers that possess these reports. The proposed rule is intended to preempt the establishment or continuation in effect of any State or local law, rule, regulation, or other requirement that requires or permits disclosure of such identities. This action is being taken to maintain the agency's ability to collect information about safety risks of FDA-regulated products that is vital to protection of the public health. DATES: Comments by March 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ilisa B. G. Bernstein, Office of Policy (HF&hyph;23), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;2831. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Introduction A critical public health activity of FDA is to monitor the safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices in the marketplace. As part of postmarketing surveillance programs to monitor the safety of these products, FDA relies heavily on its adverse event reporting systems. These reporting systems are important adjuncts to the product approval process, which is based primarily on testing conducted before a product is marketed. Although preapproval testing provides significant information about the safety and efficacy of a product, not all potential safety problems can be identified in the preapproval stage when the number of subjects exposed to the product and the period of exposure are necessarily limited. For that reason, the receipt of postmarket reports of adverse events associated with a regulated product is critical to the agency's ability to help protect the public health.
