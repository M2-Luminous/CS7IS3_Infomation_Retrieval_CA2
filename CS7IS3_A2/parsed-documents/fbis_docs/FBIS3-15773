The first round of talks is expected to be held in Moscow some time after March 16 with Russian mediation under the aegis of the UN. A senior Russian diplomat, who had accompanied Adamishin, said that Moscow appreciated "the positive mood" of the Tajik opposition. "The venue of the talks proved to be the sole problem; We proposed Moscow. Tajik opposition agreed to hold only the first round of talks here which was to be followed by meetings in Tehran, Iran or Islamabad, Pakistan. We did not object because we thought that the most important thing was to have the negotiation process started," the diplomat said. He added that the Tajik opposition leaders had emphasized the special role played by Russia, notably as the guarantor of Tajikistan's independence. According to the diplomat, Russia will do its best for the success of the talks while not being a party to them. Adamishin met with a Tajik opposition delegation headed by Khoji Akbar Turajonzoda who acted on behalf of Abdullah Nuri, leader of the Islamic Revival Movement. Other delegation members were Mukhammad Sharif Khimmadzoda, a leader of the Islamic Revival Party; Atakhon Latifi, a leader of the Democratic Party; Abdu Nabi Sattorov, a member of the Democratic Force Movement ruling body; Sabib Sangipov, chairman of the Fund of Aid to Tajik Refugees and Displaced Persons in CIS Member Nations, Bozorali Safarov, former Tajik transport minister and Khudoberdy Kholiknazarov, former foreign minister.
