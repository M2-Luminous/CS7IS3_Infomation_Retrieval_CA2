With the exception of the six cities directly under the provincial government, which have managed to initially check the spreading contamination of the atmosphere and surface water, the ecology of medium-sized and small cities in the province is being increasingly disturbed, and environmental pollution in some villages and towns is worsening. Shanxi is China's energy and heavy and chemical industrial base. The province produces approximately 290 million tonnes of coal a year, and its consumption of coal increases at a rate of about 10 percent a year. At the same time, it releases one million tonnes of soot and 900,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. These objective factors cast a shadow over Shanxi's already seriously polluted environment. The results of the monitoring of the quality of the atmospheric environment of 17 cities in the province show: The daily average value [zhi 0237] density of suspended particles over the year is 216 to 833 micrograms per cubic meter, surpassing the state's grade-2 standard of atmospheric environmental quality. The figure for some major cities of the province is 130 percent higher than that for the cities in north China. The results of the monitoring of the 11 major rivers and their tributaries in the province show: Although the major rivers have not yet been contaminated, the river sections whose waters are good for drinking and industrial and agricultural purposes are very few, and 85 percent of the river sections are contaminated to varying degrees. The sources of drinking water and its quality in many cities have thus been adversely affected. This grim situation has attracted great attention from the province's environmental departments. They expressed readiness to take an active part in comprehensive decisionmaking, to strengthen the building of the legal system, and to strive to urge the provincial people's congress to promulgate before 1997 the "Regulations of Shanxi Province on Environmental Protection," the "Regulations of Shanxi Province on Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution," and relevant administrative rules and standards.
