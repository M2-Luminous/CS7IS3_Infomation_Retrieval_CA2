Here the results are that the yes vote won over the no vote; that is what matters. What is worrisome, not just for the government but for the entire country, is the high abstention rate. We must strengthen the political parties system through a purge and a reorganization. We must think about this situation because it means that somehow the system may be exhausted or that many Guatemalans may feel that it is. However, we must also take into consideration the fact that the consultation was an unprecedented electoral event marked by a number of very special situations. No local authorities were elected. Voters usually pay more attention when they are electing a mayor, deputy, president, or vice president. Added to this are the vicissitudes that preceded today's electoral event as well as the terrorist incidents the day before the consultation. Abstention exists in Guatemala and anywhere there is an electoral event, but in this case it was rather justified. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the abstention rate was too high. We should all be concerned about this because, in my opinion, it is either a sign of exhaustion in the democratic system or of the Guatemalan people's desperation because they have yet to see any positive results since 1986, when the democratic process in Guatemala began with a number of problems and attempts to disrupt institutional order, and the actual disruption of that institutional order on 25 May. So we should be concerned. Every leader, every person who represents some level of power should take action so in five months the congressional elections will not see such a high rate of abstention, much less the general elections to be held within the year. It would be even more serious if that were to happen in a general election. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] The people's clamor began with the 25 May events. We managed to meet some of their demands by purging the executive branch and appointing a new president, vice president, and ministers. We are still working on the purge. Much remains to be done. We are still making changes and we are about to finish the process. However, the Guatemalan people are not satisfied with that and they are demanding that the president purge the two other branches of state. We have been discussing this for almost eight months. The president of the Republic has implemented legal, democratic mechanisms, being the eminently democratic president that he is. During the initial phase he asked the branches of state to conduct a self-purge and demanded the resignations of deputies and justices, but those resignations were not forthcoming. In view of this initial failure, the president introduced the second phase by calling for a popular consultation. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal determined that it would be held on 28 November. The months went by and, of course, the people encountered other problems and concerns. Although they continued to make demands, they became justifiably desperate. The Constitutionality Court interrupted and suspended the popular consultation in a decision with which I did not at all agree but which I had to uphold because ours is a de jure system. In response to the crisis that was already emerging, the Court reached an agreement that has been criticized but which, in the opinion of the president of the Republic, constituted an effort by the state to prevent an even greater crisis. We reached an agreement which, in the end, led to the same goals: a purge, reorganization, and the departure of the deputies, albeit not as quickly as the people wanted, but their departure nevertheless, which was decided today by the Guatemalan people. Meanwhile, the time that passed -- and this is my opinion, because a much more thorough examination must be conducted -- led to the people's disillusionment and to the lack of enthusiasm that existed at the outset. In response to the conclusions, the misinformation, and the lack of information, the people had to cope with a very confusing consultation. This can happen anywhere, and in this case it happened in a country where there is no deeply rooted democratic or civic culture. On the contrary, we are just now establishing such a culture, and I think that is why we have seen this change. That is why we have seen such a high percentage of abstention. However, that does not mean that the people who did not vote did not want the deputies to go. You can rest assured that their intentions are the same, but the circumstances surrounding the consultation, the formal part of it, may have prevented a massive turnout for the elections. That is my opinion. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] That will be revealed when the measures are adopted. If I reveal them now, they will not make an impact. In other words, within 60 days the reforms will be part of the Constitution, and within 120 days there will be a call to elect the new Congress. [Reporter] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] president said that 120 days was the minimum term, not that the call had to be made within the 120 days. [De Leon] It is the minimum, but according to what has been discussed and according to what must be done, it means that once the constitutional reforms go into effective, there is no reason not to issue the summons. Elections for Congress will come 120 days later. There should be no reason for the TSE not to obey the summons the Constitution must make during a minimum term of 120 days. What is not allowed is to issue a summons prior to 120 days. We can assume it will be after 120 or 121 days; in other words, another four months. [Reporter] What would your position be toward possible delays by members of Congress or other organizations that might set back this timeframe? [De Leon] This will not take place at a political party level or at an institutional level. There is an agenda, a commitment, an agreement that includes electoral and political party reforms, which must begin to be drafted next week. The same holds true for the (?in-house) rules. There could be several individual deputies who may try and stall things. My position has nothing to do with justice tribunals. Instead, it will be dealt with by the appropriate authorities. In view of the way the vote took place -- this I say as a lawyer, not as president -- I do not think there is room for any sort of legal challenge. However, any deputy could do so. [Reporter] Would you say we will have a new Congress this year? [De Leon] Definitely. A new Congress must be installed this year. Otherwise it would be another blow to the Guatemalan people, which I would say is dangerous -- more dangerous than what we just spoke about. The Guatemalan people have been very patient, but there are limits. You can't play around with the people. The people should feel satisfied from today that they have achieved their objectives and their petitions have been resolved or will be resolved in a matter of months. There cannot be any more playing around with the people. [Reporter] Some deputies plan to and have even issued communiques saying that they plan to lodge appeals of unconstitutionality, especially regarding the article that deals with cutting their mandate. Do you think that is possible? Do you think this could set everything back? [De Leon] I sincerely do not think so. There is no legal basis for this, and there have already been legal studies of the issue. Politically speaking, if some legal entity dared to issue a ruling, I don't know what would happen in Guatemala. Only time will tell what will happen if someone wants to take this risk. I do not think there is a legal entity that would dare. Anyway, it has no legal basis. [Reporter] How will you work with Congress from now until the end of their term? [De Leon] Considering all that has taken place since I became president, I think there has to be an interrelationship of tasks between the three government branches. There has to be an interrelationship because the state's goals are the same. There is only one state, therefore everyone must have the necessary awareness and maturity to do their jobs until the end of their term. They have a legislative agenda. I think they are aware of this and will try to recover their lost prestige, improve their image a bit, and carry out their legislative work. In my case, it means achieving goals and fulfilling the government plan with the available funds and with the decisionmaking authority that I must have. [Reporter] What about the relationship? [De Leon] The relationship must be an interrelationship. It might be nothing more, but it cannot be anything less. [Reporter] Some of them [not further identified], including a political leader who is involved in one of these organizations involved in the reform process, spoke about a governability pact. Would you enter any sort of governability pact with these people? [De Leon] I think the governability pact should involve all sectors of Guatemalan society. In this sense, of course, it is the duty of the president, who, according to the Constitution, represents national unity. Now is the moment to reach agreements -- agreements between the various sectors that make up Guatemalan society, but most especially a great national agreement. We are working precisely to attain these great agreements that allow a governability pact, which is essential to a transition government such as this one. It is essential in order to survive until the next administration which will have long-term plans or at least medium-term plans and which could have a much more favorable environment than the one I had to deal with when I became president. [Reporter] Much criticism was leveled on the talks between the Legislative and Executive Branches, which resulted precisely in the constitutional reforms. Aren't you afraid that speaking at this moment of a governability pact could be seen as a new pact with these people? [De Leon] That is why I mentioned a great national agreement. When I speak of a great national agreement I refer mostly to the first stage, which should be the country's productive sector -- capital and labor, entrepreneurs and workers -- and start there. When I speak of entrepreneurs and workers, I also refer to the public sector: help restructure the public sector and hold dialogues to attain efficiency in the public sector, attain reduction, even attain salary increases, but not through a larger payroll, rather by restructuring the public sector. In the case of the private sector: reach agreements between entrepreneurs and workers that will give the government time to take up the measures it needs to take. Afterward, the months will pass and with a new Congress and a restructured state within certain government organizations, then we can possibly involve the political sector to avoid precisely what worries you. Mind you, before this takes place I believe there should be an understanding, I repeat the term once again, an interrelation of tasks between both branches of government that will allow Congress to develop a legislative agenda and carry out its work.
