Following the Atlantic alliance summit, which has just been held in Brussels, it is difficult to answer. NATO, courageous but not reckless, announces in its final declaration that it "remains open to other European states" and accepts the principle of "expansion." The countries like Poland or the Czech Republic, which are knocking at its door, are simply asked to wait in the waiting room for as long as is necessary. They will learn the pleasures of purgatory. With regard to Bosnia, NATO sententiously decrees that the conflict "must be settled at the negotiating table and not on the battlefield." How can we fail to agree? And the Sixteen are renewing their already long-standing threat of an air strike against Serbian positions. But the threats, like the promises, primarily commit only those who receive them.... There is a well-known expression: "Stop me or I will do something I will regret." This is largely the international community's state of mind with regard to the Bosnian tragedy. From NATO to the European Union, all the world's institutions constantly predict reprisals against the Serbs which never come. Like Pontius Pilate, they say: "I am not responsible for this blood," wash their hands of it, but never forget, for history's sake, to proclaim their indignation by condemning Slobodan Milosevic. Thus the "world community" in general, and Europe in particular, have brought shame on themselves as they go from one step backwards to another. This time, however, it is not certain that the worst will happen. As Mr. Mitterrand noted, NATO yesterday put forward proposals for practical action formulated by Mr. Major and Mr. Juppe together. The aim is to launch air strikes to reopen Tuzla airport and clear the Srebrenica road. Will the international community finally succeed in instilling fear? NATO's distaste lies in having reaffirmed that the execution of its threats is dependent on the go-ahead of the United Nations which, as things stand, is merely carrying out the orders of the UN member states in the conditions on the ground about which we know. This is the tactics of discarding. Since the start of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, everybody has been trying to pass the buck. Europe regularly turns toward the United States which then demands the intervention of the Twelve. Hitherto they have both always managed not to agree at the same time on the need for military intervention. They thought they were taking people in. NATO is now addressing the United Nations which can do nothing about it. What if the United Nations said: "You are on?"
