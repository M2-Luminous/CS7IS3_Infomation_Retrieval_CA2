The State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin and his deputies began their working day in the new place today. The shifting of deputies to the State Duma new building was preceded by its sanctifying by Archbishop Istrinski Arseniy with a group of clergymen, in accordance with a Russian Orthodox Church ritual. Meeting halls of the houses and premises which were already open by that time were also sanctified. "We had decided that representatives of the patriarchate and his holiness himself will be permanent guests of the State Duma," house deputy chairman Valentin kovalev told ITAR-TASS. "During talks with Archbishop Arseniy, we spoke about a whole gamut of questions, which are impossible to resolve only on the level of knowledge, they need to be resolved at, what we call, the level of soul and heart," the duma official noted. Kovalev emphasised that the Russian Orthodox Church has expressed readiness to render all kind of assistance to the State Duma. "Archbishop Arseniy reminded us that during complex periods of the Russian history, such as today, fathers of the Russian orthodox Church gave advices to statesman, and at present it will also not be superflous," Valentin Kovalev said. According to Kovalev, the State Duma's shifting to the new place will be over within this week, as planned. The house deputy chairman noted that many premises are in need of repairs. "We felt this after shifting here," Kovalev noted. "The system of communications is in a bad state. This worries the State Duma leadership more than anything else. There are problems with electric wiring, water pipelines and even the sewage system. Valentin Kovalev said that these question will be discussed at a meeting to be held next Thursday with the participation of the Moscow City Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov.
