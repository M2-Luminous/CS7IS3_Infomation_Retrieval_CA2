This will be a pilot test program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 1871.102 Authority. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy has provided authority for NASA to conduct a pilot test of a new procurement process within the scope of this part. 1871.103 Applicability. (a) This part applies to all acquisitions, as described in 1871.103(b), conducted at NASA installations. (b) This part applies to all contract actions, the aggregate amount of which is greater than the small purchase limitation ((FAR) 48 CFR Part 13) and not more than $500,000 in basic value. For service contracts (exclusive of R&D and construction for which options are not permitted), up to four annual options of not more than $500,000 each are permitted where the option requirements are substantially the same as the basic requirement. For supply contracts, four options of not more than $500,000 each are permitted when not more than $500,000 in funding is to be required in any fiscal year. The total amount of the basic award plus options may not exceed $2,500,000 in either the case of supplies or services except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. (c) When the Government estimate for the basic award amount or any option amount, if any, exceeds the limits of 1871.103(b), the procurement will be processed under FAR and NFS procurement procedures applicable to large procurements (see (FAR) 48 CFR Parts 14 and 15). When the estimate is within the range of 1871.103(b) and the procurement was started using these procedures but the offered prices/costs exceed the MidRange ceiling, the procurement may continue under MidRange procedures, provided that: (1) The price/cost can be determined to be fair and reasonable, (2) The successful offeror accepts incorporation of required FAR and NFS clauses applicable to large procurements, and (3) The procurement does not exceed $750,000 for the basic requirement (and each option, if any) or $3,750,000 for the total requirement. 1871.104 Definitions.
