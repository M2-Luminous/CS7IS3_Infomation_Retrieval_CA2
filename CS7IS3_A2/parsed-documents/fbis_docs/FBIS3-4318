The investigation is being carried out by researchers from various institutes under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and some universities. Scientists on the investigation team say that they have completed the first-phase work of outdoor collection of data and samples for the "systematic research of the formation, evolution, environmental changes and ecology of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau". The scheme has been listed into the state's Eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1991- 1995). The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts from the Kunlun mountain range in the north and ends at the Himalaya mountain range in the south. The plateau has a total area of 2.5 million sq km and an average elevation of 4,000 m. Initial surveys started last year, and latest scientific research reveals that conditions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have a great impact on the climate and environment of the entire globe, especially the direction of monsoons and the climate of the hinterland of the Asian Continent.
