Therefore, we must support the actions carried out by the executive branch and the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation (Petroven) to prevent this measure from being implemented. The statement was made by Allan Viergutz, president of the Venezuelan Oil Chamber, who believes the current situation "contradicts those excellent trade relations." Viergutz explained that one of Petroven's most important marketing policies has been to guarantee the United States a reliable and continuous supply of petroleum-related products. This included purchasing and refurbishing a series of refineries, oil pipelines, terminals, and distribution systems. Consequently, Petroven is currently one of the United States' largest gasoline suppliers, and this is why limitations to the marketing of Venezuelan gasoline in U.S. territory is undeniably an unfriendly action toward our country, which has been one of the United States' most reliable suppliers of oil and petroleum-related products for more than half a century. "This inexplicable lack of loyalty toward a reliable supplier of the U.S. economy should prompt us to adopt a harder line in our international policy," it was stated by Viergutz. He added that, aside from the technical decisions which Venezuela may adopt in connection with the EPA decision concerning refined gasoline, our country "must adopt aggressive measures through a boycott -- not only of oil products imported from the United States but also of industrial products. The Venezuelan market represents an important element in the U.S. export formula." The Venezuelan Oil Chamber also believes that, in case we are compelled to seek new clients for our refined gasoline because of the EPA's standards, we must counter the measure by importing oil products -- which are normally purchased in the U.S. market -- from other markets that receive our gasoline. This would mean we would use "economic solutions." Meanwhile, the Venezuelan Oil Chamber will adopt the necessary actions to sponsor the free marketing of products in the United States, given this "change in relations."
