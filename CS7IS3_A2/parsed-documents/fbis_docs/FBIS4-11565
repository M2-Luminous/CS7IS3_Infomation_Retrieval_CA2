FBIS4-11565 "drlat083_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 MEXICO Foreign Secretariat Official on U.S. `Xenophobia' Foreign Secretariat Official on U.S. `Xenophobia' PA2804233694 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 26 Apr 94 p 8 PA2804233694 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Report by Victor Cardoso] [Text] The xenophobia unleashed in the United States against migrant workers must not taint all bilateral relations with Mexico because undocumented aliens are not responsible for all of that country's ills, Teodoro Maus, general director for Mexican communities abroad at the Foreign Secretariat [SRE], has said. The official noted the conditions of Mexicans living in the United States are a matter of permanent concern for the SRE. For that reason, the Mexican Government promotes, through its embassy and consulates in the United States, rapprochement and greater involvement with legal aliens, the Hispanic and Black communities, and even nongovernment organisms "to counter the xenophobia that has been unleashed in the United States against undocumented aliens." Mexican authorities are seeking a qualitative and serious change in the attitude toward undocumented persons in particular, and Mexican residents in general, without letting that problem cool relations, he said. Maus indicated that undocumented aliens are being blamed for all the woes of the United States, although they contribute more than they receive, since they fulfill their obligations, on fiscal matters for instance, but do not receive the benefits that that earns. Most of them, he said, pay their taxes with the hope of establishing a record of residency. In addition, they do not report abuses by their employers for fear of deportation. By way of example, he mentioned that in the State of California, restrictions were increased on federal aid for undocumented aliens who were hurt the most in the recent Los Angeles earthquake. The argument for this was that they are responsible for the rise in unemployment and crime, when the fact is those things happen as a result of that country's economic problems and the closure of military bases. He recalled that at first, federal aid for housing reconstruction was earmarked without discrimination, but later it was cut under the pretext that the undocumented aliens were to blame for unemployment, the deterioration of the economy, and crime.
