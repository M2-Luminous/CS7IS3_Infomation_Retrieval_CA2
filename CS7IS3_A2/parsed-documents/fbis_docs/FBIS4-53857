What was your biggest miscalculation in this affair? [Watanabe] I did not make any miscalculation. I know that this kind of attempt has only a 50-50 chance of success. I wanted to participate in the new government, because I wanted to translate my political ideology into reality. If my opinion does not go down with parties in the ruling coalition, there is no point in participating in the new government. Some people criticized me by saying that I wanted to become a cabinet member again to finish my political career on a high note. They are wrong, because I have already been appointed minister seven times. To me, becoming a cabinet member is not uncommon. So even if the coalition had offered me the post of deputy prime minister in the new cabinet, saying, "We cannot have you as our prime minister, but we can offer you the post of deputy prime minister," I would have rejected the proposal. And besides, to speak the truth, the coalition never made such an offer. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] We understand that Rengo [Japan Trade Union Confederation] was unwilling to endorse your bid for premiership. [Watanabe] Yes, I suppose it was. To be more precise, it was the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] that did not support me. I never wanted to become the head of a minority government. This is why I did not push my bid for the premiership this time. In any case, Tsutomu (Hata) seemed to be interested in taking over, so there was no reason why the coalition parties should choose an outsider like me as their prime ministerial candidate. I was able to form a clear view of the situation and make up my mind very early on because I had floated several trial balloons. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Nevertheless, the SDPJ opted out of the ruling coalition, forcing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form a minority government. What do you think of the new cabinet lineup? [Watanabe] This should be the best cabinet Prime Minister Hata is able to assemble, because the ruling coalition does not have many people capable of assuming government posts. The new cabinet is controlled by the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. If the Hata administration wants to pursue policy goals similar to those pursued by the LDP, it has to proceed humbly. If not, it will be short-lived. There is a limit to the tolerance that will be shown the high-handed tactics of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, whose principal objective is to wreck the LDP. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Mr. Ozawa is now placed in a difficult situation? [Watanabe] As I did not see him in person, I do not know exactly what is happening. But I think he should be reflecting on his conduct, because it is now clear that, like Nobunaga Oda [feudal lord known for his high-handed attitude toward administrative matters], his approach no longer works every time. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What should Mr. Ozawa do in order to get out of his current difficulties? [Watanabe] Shinseito was formed defectors from the LDP. It bears a different party name, but it is identical to the LDP in substance. Shinseito professes to be an advocate of political reform. However, all the Shinseito leaders were once at the center of LDP power as members of the faction controlled by Shin Kanemaru. Although they are not in a position to criticize the LDP, they are saying that the LDP is absolutely wrong. So, the LDP and Shinseito are hostile to each other. Relations would be a lot better if Shinseito leaders thought much more about the nation rather than being full of themselves: 80 percent of their work should be directed toward the conduct of state affairs, and less than 20 percent in looking after the interests of their party or in contriving strategy. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What are the chances of such an improvement? [Watanabe] I am not sure, but Shinseito should at least try, because the LDP has decided to take a case-by-case approach to the government's policies. For instance, the ruling coalition can now work out a bill to expand the role of the Self-Defense Forces and submit it as a government-sponsored bill, because the SDPJ, which is opposed to this kind of legislation, bolted from the Hata administration. The LDP would probably not oppose such a bill in the Diet. At least, it is certain that I will support it. I cannot oppose something that I agree with. I think many LDP members share my view on security issues. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think many LDP members also share your view on tax reform? [Watanabe] Well, it is not easy to find an LDP member who has the same view as me regarding tax reform. However, there will be some. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is the LDP going to judge each of the new government's policies by comparing it with its own policy platform? [Watanabe] Yes, because this is exactly what party politics should be, and because it is not logical for the LDP to emotionally reject what it used to advocate while in power. The only problem will arise if there is conflict within the LDP between "genuine members" and "unauthentic members." [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The opposition parties possess the numbers to pass a motion of no-confidence in the prime minister, because he heads a minority government. Will the prime minister dissolve the lower house for an election, or will he ask his cabinet to resign? [Watanabe] The odds are 50-50. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the next general election will take place under the old electoral system of multiseat constituencies? [Watanabe] That is the problem. The Diet has already passed a package of political reform bills that call for the implementation of a single-seat electoral system. The question is whether a bill to divide the nation into single-seat voting districts will clear the Diet smoothly. I do not think such a bill will be enacted during the current Diet session. It is not possible. And if the next general election is held under the old electoral system, whether the political reform legislation would be reversed is another question. The SDPJ would probably strengthen its power by winning about 100 seats. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think it inevitable that the next general election will be held under the old electoral system? [Watanabe] There is no other possibility if the prime minister is forced to dissolve the lower house at an early stage. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of him getting the cabinet to resign en masse? [Watanabe] Well, I don't know, but if the Hata administration were to collapse, the reins of government would be restored to the LDP. I do not think the reins of government can be handed over from one coalition member to another coalition member by prearrangement three times in a row. If the Hata cabinet were to resign en masse, a regular procedure of constitutional government would be the restoration of the LDP rule. It would be quite normal to hand over the reins of government to the largest political party in terms of number of Diet members, namely the LDP. However, although the LDP is the largest party in the Diet, it only has 200-odd seats in the lower house. It will, therefore, have to join hands with other parties to form a new coalition government. The search for a coalition partner will certainly cause big trouble. If the LDP were to join forces with the SDPJ to form a coalition government, once again the new cabinet would not be able to govern effectively, because of the difference in policies. In any case, the LDP would lose its influence, because the casting vote would always be held by the SDPJ. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Does this mean that either the SDPJ or the ruling coalition should split? [Watanabe] Which side should break up, the LDP side or the non-LDP side? That is the question. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you assess Tsutomu Hata as prime minister? [Watanabe] Mr. Hata has a fine personality, and he seems to prefer politics of consensus. However, he will certainly find himself in a very difficult position, because there are so many pressing problems confronting Japan, and because circumstances will not allow him to maintain a noncommittal attitude toward these issues. I wonder how far a gentle person such as he will be able to paper over the difficulties.
