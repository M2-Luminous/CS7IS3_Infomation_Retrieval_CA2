Rong made the remarks when meeting with Faruq al-Qaddumi, foreign minister of the State of Palestine, who arrived in Beijing on Thursday [7 April] for a six-day visit to China. Rong said that the signing of the agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on implementing a declaration of principles for palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza shows that the Palestinian issue can be solved through peaceful negotiations. China hopes that the recent U.N. resolutions on occupied territory would be implemented smoothly, he said, adding that parties concerned should continue to work for peace in an all-round manner. Rong said that China firmly supports the mideast peace process and will, as always, support the just cause of the Palestinians. Al-Qaddumi, also director of the Political Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said that his organization would work patiently and continue peaceful negotiations for an early realization of the legitimate rights of the palestinians.
