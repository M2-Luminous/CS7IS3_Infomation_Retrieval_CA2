Some people are saying that it is premature. Others are talking about a return to rivalry. I would like to set out my stance in clear-cut terms straightaway: There is no reasonable alternative to partnership, unless of course you count the possibility of missing the historic opportunity to shape a democratic Russian state and transform the unstable postcommunist world into a lasting democratic one. Both these objectives are indeed interconnected. They are all too precious for Russia's democrats, who have already repeatedly encountered armed (not to mention furious political) opposition from the enemies of reform. We will continue to fight to secure these goals even if we are not heeded and correctly understood by our natural friends and allies, in the shape of the democratic states and governments of the West. In this respect, the threats to reduce economic aid to a Russia led by President Yeltsin are as futile as they are counterproductive. The same can be said about the talk of the need to abandon "infantile pro-Americanism." If this were due to recognition of the need to finally have the Russian Embassy in the United States carry out diplomatic work on a professional, energetic, and systematic basis or to stop statesmen, including Russian parliamentarians, making pilgrimages to the United States, one might be able to agree with it. But people seem to want to see the attainment of maturity as abandoning the idea of natural partnership. But this is not maturity, but degeneration, an ill-disguised attempt to give up the very essence of radical reform -- in foreign policy too. I cannot agree to and I will not be involved in it! The United States and the West can make an invaluable contribution to shaping a stable democratic world via the means outlined in the Vancouver and Moscow declarations that Russia and the United States signed at summit level. Namely the policy of strategic partnership. Strategic because we share common values, while Russian and U.S. national state interests regarding the main world problems not only do not conflict but complement one another. In both Russia and the United States only reactionary forces in the military-industrial and bureaucratic complexes have an interest in wrecking partnership. They seek out mythical explanations, saying that Russia is doomed to totalitarianism and confrontation with the world outside, and East and West are incompatible. The reality is that we must move on to practical partnership. At the same time we must abandon certain illusions. Some people in the West have indeed been daydreaming that partnership can be developed with Russia on the principle that "if the Russians are good, they must follow us in everything." There may also be romantics in Russia who thought that partnership is an idyllic situation without conflicts and problems. I think that I and all pragmatic politicians realized from the very outset two fundamental facts. First, as I have repeatedly said in my speeches both in the West and in Russia, including before the breakup of the USSR, the Russian Federation is condemned to be a great power. Aggressive and threatening under the Communists and nationalists, peaceful and prosperous under the democrats. But a great power nonetheless! Naturally this prompts the conclusion that it cannot be a junior partner but only an equal partner. Second, partnership based on common values and even sympathies does not mean renouncing a firm or, if you like, aggressive policy of upholding your own national interests and sometimes of competition and disputes. There is another dangerous illusion in the way of partnership. Namely the almost fanatical desire to see just one great power in the world today -- the United States -- and insistently proclaim American leadership. First, the United States is not able to handle all the problems in the modern world on its own and would, I think, badly lose out by overtaxing itself in this way. Second, even though it is experiencing the difficulties of the transitional period, Russia will remain a superpower not only as far as nuclear missile and military might as a whole is concerned, but also in terms of space exploration and development of state-of-the-art technologies, not to mention natural resources and geostrategic position. Third, there are other centers of influence which mean that the world is not unipolar or bipolar but multipolar. So what option is left for Russia's democrats when the question is formulated in these terms? Agreeing to play a secondary or subordinate role would be as unwarranted as it is politically dangerous. The extreme nationalist and reactionary forces involved in the domestic political struggle in Russia would immediately take advantage of this. They are in effect already trying to do so. Even my fellow democrats are already grimly joking that, whereas Gaydar was not around long enough to see considerable Western aid, Zhirinovskiy is already enjoying the fruits of the talk about it! Russia and the United States in conjunction with other countries must set about tackling two interconnected tasks. First, the joint formation of a strategic partnership bolstered by the corresponding institutions and resources. Second, the immediate setting up of a mechanism for coordinating their actions in approaching the most important international problems. Both tasks are easily illustrated by the example of NATO. The alliance was set up to repel Communism and consolidate Western democracy. This institution, good as it may be, is obviously inadequate and unsuitable for current purposes. NATO is not faced with communism, and Russia itself is not part of NATO. The "Partnership for Peace" program will provide a partial answer, but it cannot be considered the pinnacle of achievement. That was obvious during the crisis in Sarajevo. The NATO ultimatum was delivered without Russia, but it is quite plain that Russia cannot and should not be excluded from the general efforts to settle the problem of Bosnia, where it has considerable interests and potential. There is a danger of putting too much emphasis on NATO and partnership with it to the detriment of the CSCE, a broader and more general-purpose structure. That would be a great mistake. It is the CSCE that should play the main role in making the system of Euroatlantic collaboration truly stable and democratic. If all of us in East and West do not learn from the difficulties and disputes of the last few weeks and immediately develop a strategy and instruments for partnership, you can be sure that these difficulties will be exploited by those in favor of self-fulfilling gloomy prophecies.
