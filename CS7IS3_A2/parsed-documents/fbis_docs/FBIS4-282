According to the acting deputy commissioner of the homeland's prisons services, Colonel Hennie du Toit, no details of the damages were available as they were still awaiting a full report. He also refused to confirm the number of prisoners involved in the protest. Rooigrond Central Prison is the biggest prison in Bophuthatswana, which accommodated former political prisoners involved in the 1988 abortive coup as well as death row awaiting prisoners. Today's violence in the former homeland was the second incident within a period of two weeks following the gutting down of Mafikeng prison in Mmabatho recently. Damages estimated at 100,000 [rand] were caused when prisoners went on rampage setting the prison on fire, demanding to be allowed to vote. The co-administrator for Bophuthatswana, Mr. Job Mokgoro, addressed protesting prisoners last week in an attempt to calm down the situation.
