Valladares is reassuming the post he held during the government of overthrown President Jorge Serrano (1991-1993). Before swearing in the new officials, President de Leon Carpio explained that the new attorney general will serve as an adviser and consultant to state institutions. Valladares left office in 1993 after being suspended. At that time the courts charged that Valladares had refrained from bringing fraud charges against his brother Luis Domingo Valladares. Presidency sources told ACAN-EFE that Cuestas, a lawyer with 30 years experience, has never held a public office. Valladares and Cuestas will assume the offices Telesforo Guerra Cahn held simultaneously. The attorney general was chosen directly by the president while the prosecutor general was chosen from among six candidates presented by a nominating committee headed by the Supreme Court of Justice.
