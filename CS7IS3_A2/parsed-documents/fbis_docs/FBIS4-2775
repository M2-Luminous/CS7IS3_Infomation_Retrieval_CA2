He called on officials at all levels to actively mobilize departments in charge of funds, materials and technology to provide the farmers with good service throughout the process of production to strive for a good harvest of grain and cotton. Chen, who has special responsibilities for agriculture, made these remarks during a survey tour of the provinces of Hebei, Shandong and Henan from April 6 to 12. Chen pointed out that the three provinces are China's major producers of grain, cotton and vegetables, adding that the grain output of the provinces accounts for one fifth of the national total, while that of cotton accounts for half of the national total. He stressed that at present, it is necessary to fight against the serious drought in Hebei and Henan Provinces and to increase the cotton-growing acreage. Attention should also be paid to the use of seeds from the best strains and to field management, including prevention and control of plant diseases and elimination of pests. While concentrating on the production of grain and cotton, Chen Junsheng said, it is also important to provide more for the vegetable basket. Efforts should be made to use stalks to raise more cattle and other herbivorous animals and to grow more vegetables to enrich the supply of non-staple food.
