He said that the members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] called for support by NATO aircraft, which fired warning missiles at the positions of the Serbian fighters and the Serbian territory.

Despite the fact that the convoy was not announced, it arrived on the Muslims territory without problems, it unloaded humanitarian aid, and went back, again without problems.
