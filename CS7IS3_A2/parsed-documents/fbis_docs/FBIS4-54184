The sources said the planned panel indicates Japan's desire to take the initiative in launching the next round of global trade negotiations. The study group, led by the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau, will be focused on possible agenda subjects for the next round, such as the relationship between trade and environment, trade and labor, and trade and investment, as well as regionalism. It will work out draft proposals on these themes by November and announce them at meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is scheduled to take form in January to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The draft proposals will reflect opinions from academics and private-sector firms as well. Just days after the Uruguay Round trade pact was signed in April, major powers began shifting to the next round of trade talks.
