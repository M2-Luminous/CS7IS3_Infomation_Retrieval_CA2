The commission, in which AIDS experts from both government and nongovernment spheres are represented, recently decided on the following distribution of the money: 20 percent will go to prevention (education, behavior surveys, and so on), 26 percent to testing, and more than half for everything else, principally treatment and investment. This means that health insurance covers, for example, only the drugs for hospitalized patients and not for those whose disease has not yet developed and are being treated as outpatients. According to Trojan, who is also president of the nongovernment Association for the Struggle Against AIDS and for Sexual Education, the commission could not turn down the funds for this purpose because it would endanger human lives. "Let us call things by their names and not boast to the World Health Organization of 70 million spent on prevention, if, in fact, the money is only covering for the state or health insurance," Trojan says. Just for a comparison: Great Britain invests an annual 20 million pounds on prevention. Nongovernment organizations receive approximately 7 percent of the 70 million. (The World Health Organization generally recommends, however, that at least 15 percent of the total be allocated to these organizations.) The AIDS Help Society wants, for instance, to establish a so-called lighthouse for those sick and dying of AIDS. According to Trojan, nongovernment organizations have to fight much harder for funds. The idea apparently still prevails that they are more likely to waste the funds at their disposal than government institutions.
