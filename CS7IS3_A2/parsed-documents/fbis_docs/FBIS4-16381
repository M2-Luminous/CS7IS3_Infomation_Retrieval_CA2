Han, who arrived in Russia Wednesday for a three-day visit, told Korean reporters that Moscow had expressed its willingness to cooperate with Seoul in helping North Korean escapees from Siberian logging camps wishing to resettle in South Korea after a meeting with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. Some 170 escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at Pyongyang-run camps in Siberia whose human rights are allegedly violated, are said to be seeking asylum in the South. Seoul pledged on Wednesday to help them resettle either in the South or in a third country in accordance with international law. The two foreign ministers are reportedly near agreement on the issue. Han urged Moscow not to repatriate the loggers to North Korea and instead offer them residential rights, and Kozyrev gave his word that no forcible repatriation would occur. Han told reporters he had the impression that Moscow would back Seoul in future action on the matter. Expressing sympathy for Seoul's interest in the North Korean escapees, Kozyrev said their future lies in their desire to seek freedom, adding that they can live where they like. Han said he understood Kozyrev's remarks as reflecting a willingness to give the loggers residential rights: Once they had the legal right to stay in Russia, they could make their way to South Korea because foreigners with such rights can travel freely abroad. Han asked that the North Korean loggers be given the status of international refugees by involving the U.N. High Commissioner [UNHC] on refugees while Moscow proposed bilateral discussions to settle the problem, offering to cooperate "If they want to go to South Korea and if the South will accept them". Han said he explained that in order to confirm the wishes of the escapees and refute North Korea's claims of "kidnapping," UNHCR involvement was necessary. Kozyrev said consideration could be given to regarding the loggers as refugees, but it was not needed. The Russian minister said that no heed should be paid to Pyongyang's threats and that Seoul-Moscow cooperation was sufficient to solve the problem. Han said that since Moscow was being very cooperative, the U.N. body's involvement may be unnecessary and that the loggers' fate should soon be addressed at the working level. Russian Foreign Ministry officials said Pyongyang had strongly protested to Moscow for not repatriating the loggers until recently, but nowadays makes no complaints. Kozyrev said Moscow will continue its logging cooperation with Pyongyang, but promised to include human rights provisions in the renewed contract. North Korea and Russia are currently negotiating renewal of their logging contract that expired at the end of last year, but are making little progress due to Pyongyang's opposition to human rights provisions. Han and Kozyrev also discussed the North Korean nuclear issue, the Korean seeking Moscow's continued support and the Russian reiterating his country's preference for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. Kozyrev, at a joint press conference after the talks, said it was too early to talk about economic sanctions against North Korea and that Russia's involvement was vital. The two ministers also discussed President Kim Yong-sam's official visit to Russia in early June and agreed to sign various agreements to improve bilateral relations during his stay.
