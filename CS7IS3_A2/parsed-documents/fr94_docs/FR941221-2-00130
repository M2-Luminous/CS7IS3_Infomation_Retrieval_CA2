This cooperative agreement will establish the broad programmatic framework within which specific projects can be funded as they are identified during the project period. The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to (1) increase the association's support for and assistance in increasing the proportion of practicing minority health professionals within the U.S.; and (2) assist the association in expanding and enhancing its health prevention, promotion, and health services research opportunities, with the ultimate goal of improving the health status of minorities and disadvantaged people. The OMH will provide consultation, administrative, and technical assistance as needed for the execution and evaluation of all aspects of this cooperative agreement. The OMH will also participate and collaborate with the awardee in any workshops or symposia to exchange current information, opinions, and research findings. Authorizing Legislation This cooperative agreement is authorized under the grant-making authorities of the Office of Minority Health. Refer to Section 1707 (d)(1) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 101&hyph;527. Background Assistance will be provided only to NMA. No other applications are solicited. NMA is the only organization capable of administering this cooperative agreement because it is the only organization that has: 1. Developed and expanded an infrastructure to coordinate and implement various medical education programs within local communities and physician groups that deal extensively with African American health issues. The association has also established regional, state, and local divisions which provide a foundation upon which to develop, promote, and conduct professional medical programs which are aimed toward preventing and reducing unnecessary morbidity and mortality rates among African Americans, as well as other minority populations. 2. Established itself and its members as an organization with professionals who serve as leaders and experts in public health campaigns aimed at improving the health status of minority populations. 3. Developed an extensive knowledge-base of essential disease prevention, health promotion, and research evaluation strategies that are necessary for any health intervention dealing with these minority populations, with particular understanding of African Americans. 4. Assessed the current education, research and disease prevention and health promotion activities for its members, affiliated groups, and represented subpopulations. 5. Developed a national organization whose members are all predominantly minority health professionals and providers with excellent professional performance records. 6. Developed a knowledge-base of critical knowledge, skills, and abilities related to instruction in medical and health professional preparation. Through the collective efforts of its members, the organization's committees, sponsored research, and sponsored health education and prevention programs, the NMA has demonstrated (1) the ability to work with academic institutions and official health agencies on mutual education, service, and research endeavors relating to the goal of disease prevention and health promotion of minorities and disadvantaged peoples, (2) the leadership necessary to attract minority health professionals into public health careers, and (3) the leadership needed to effectively promote health professional careers to minorities and disadvantaged peoples who would otherwise not consider such a career path. This cooperative agreement will be awarded in FY 1995 for a 12-month budget period within a project period of 5 years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.
