FBIS4-6579 "dreas078_c_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea Greenpeace Antinuclear Rally in ROK Reported Greenpeace Antinuclear Rally in ROK Reported SK2204051394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0434 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204051394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Criminals Must Face Justice" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA)--Members of Greenpeace, an international organisation of environmental movement, held an anti-nuke rally in Samchok, South Korea, together with members of South Korean organisations of environmental and anti-nuke movement, at which they urged the puppet authorities to stop the construction of an atomic power station, sounding warning against the danger of radioactive leakage from it. This is an expression of the unshakable will of the members of Greenpeace and the South Korean people not to tolerate the criminal acts of the South Korean puppets in dumping nuclear waste in the sea to destroy the ecological environment of the Korean nation and mankind, declares MINJU CHOSON in a commentary today. The analyst says: Nuclear waste dumping in the sea by the South Korean puppets is a heinous crime in reducing the Korean peninsula and its surrounding waters to a barren region contaminated with nuclear substance and a wanton violation of the international law and convention banning nuclear waste dumping in the sea. It is quite natural that Greenpeace members conducted anti-nuke activities in South Korea together with the local people. If the Kim Yong-sam group continue to dump nuclear waste in the sea and wreck ecological environment while accelerating the development of nuclear weapons, ignoring the unanimous protest of the people at home and abroad, it will face a stern judgement by the whole nation and the world people.
