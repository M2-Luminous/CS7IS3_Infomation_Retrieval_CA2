Vets are recommending that susceptible animals be vaccinated pre-sale and certified accordingly. This approach would add to the sale value of animals and reduce the incidence of pneumonia. The IVU has approached a number of marts on the issue and they are fully supportive. According to a statement, the primary viruses responsible are IBR, P13 and RSV. While these viruses have been at low levels in the cattle population, the IVU maintain that the current high levels of imports is adding to the problem. A preventative vaccination programme is recommended as there are no drug therapies to combat these viruses, although treatments for secondary infections are available.
