In his words, such agreements contain reciprocal obligations which make Estonia very vulnerable. "Since the Russian side is very reluctant to withdraw its troops, it would be a simple matter for it to accuse us of violating the stipulations of the treaty after it's been signed. There are previous instances of such stupid pacts. For example, Russia didn't delay taking advantage of the 1939 military bases pact, accusing the Baltic states of violating the agreement, and that served as a pretext for bringing in more troops," Lippmaa pointed out. Lippmaa said "unfortunately both Foreign Minister Juri Luik and President Lennart Meri" are for concluding a troop withdrawal agreement. Russia wants to link the troop pullout treaty to signing an agreement also on social guarantees for its military retirees. This has become the main stumbling block in relations between the two countries because the Estonian side has so far rejected Russia's demand. In Lippmaa's words, the Assembly Party isn't optimistic about Russian troop withdrawal being completed by Aug. 31. If Russian military presence in Estonia continues in September, the country's leaders must be prepared for "two essential demarches," he said. "We must lodge a complaint (against Russia) at the U.N. Security Council. Under the U.N. charter, a major power loses its veto right when it's the accused party. Also, Estonia must take a more active part with regard to the NATO in the context of the Partnership for Peace program. NATO has no idea how to evaluate the continued presence of Russian troops in Estonia, so it's not interested in the emergence of the need for this and wants the troops to pull out," was Lippmaa's opinion.
