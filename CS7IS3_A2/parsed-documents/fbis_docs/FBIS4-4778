Rep. Pak Chong-su, who led a South Korean delegation to the 91st International Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting in Paris, said last week he noticed that all nine members of the North Korean delegation were not wearing the Kim Il-song badge. In addition, all six North Korean representatives at a Paris meeting of the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization (Unesco) did not wear the badge, according to Pak. The absence of the badge, the symbol of Kim Il-song's "chuche (self-reliance)" ideology, is drawing attention because all North Korean officials had until recently worn one as though it were a bodily appendage, Pak said. "It is a big change, considering the rigidity and inflexibility of North Korean regime and society," Pak said. Pak speculated that North Korea's leaders may be preparing "a grace period" during a transition of power from Kim Il-song to his son and heir-apparent, Kim Chong-il.
