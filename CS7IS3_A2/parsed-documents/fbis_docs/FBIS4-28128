An official at the agency said that the report put a "slight emphasis" on the bright aspects instead of on the negative factors. "The main reason for this is that we've disregarded the view that industrial production is on a downtrend," he said, noting that the report now described industrial production as taking one step forward and one step back. After rising 4.6 percent in March, industrial production posted a smaller-than-expected decline of 1.4 percent in April. It is expected to fall the same 1.4 percent in May and to turn positive in June by 1.3 percent. The agency is still cautious about describing the economy as being on its way to recovery, however. "I would not say the economy is getting better. In order to be able to say the economy is recovering, we need to see the support from capital investment," he said. The report said that the employment situation is still harsh, particularly in the manufacturing sector. However, it termed the ratio of job openings to seekers as being flat, instead of on a downward trend as in its May report. It also said that the unemployment rate is flat, instead of on the rise as it noted previously. The jobless rate improved from 2.9 percent in March to 2.8 percent in April. Consumer spending was described as showing some signs of picking up -- the same wording as in the previous report. Household spending fell 4.3 percent in March, the biggest decline since February 1981, but the agency official brushed the fall aside, saying that the figure tends to fluctuate on the purchases of automobiles.
