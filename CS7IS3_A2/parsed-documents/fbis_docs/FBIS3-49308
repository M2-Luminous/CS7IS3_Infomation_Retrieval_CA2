I initiated this meeting as early as last Tuesday, when it seemed that the talks between Deputy Prime Minister Granic and [Bosnian Prime Minister] Silajdzic would not amount to [word indistinct]. However, Mr. Izetbegovic delayed the meeting. You are aware of the situation that led to this delay; you know who shelled the runway in Sarajevo. You also know that Izetbegovic is now airborne and that he is on his way to Bonn. I wanted this meeting so that I could tell the Bosnian-Muslim side that it is high time to stop their offensive against the Croatian population of central Bosnia; it is time for peace, because if the war should continue this will have catastrophic consequences, not only for the Muslim and the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but for everyone in the region. Keeping in mind that, not only Germany but international diplomats--France, Germany, and Europe--have all offered their good services to make the meeting possible, they all want to see some kind of result. We will go and see. [end recording] Asked if this was the right moment for negotiations in the light of a major Muslim offensive on the Croats in central Bosnia, President Tudjman said: [Begin Tudjman recording] It is obvious that the climate is not positive. Muslim forces have been launching strong attacks in the Lasva River valley over the last few days, from Busovaca to Kiseljak. That is why I am going, in order to save the people, the civilian population, and to prevent the expulsion of 100,000 more Croats. Our intention from the beginning of the clashes in Bosnia was to enable Croats to live in the Bosnian-Muslim republic and the Muslims to live in the Croat republic. That is why I have proposed this meeting and why I am going there where we will do everything we can. I believe that, for once, the Muslim leadership will have to realize that they should accept the hand of reconciliation in order to improve horrible relations caused by the conflict after the Serbian aggression. Like Croatia, the Muslims are still facing the Serbian aggression. Therefore, this is an unreasonable policy that should be put to an end. [end recording]
