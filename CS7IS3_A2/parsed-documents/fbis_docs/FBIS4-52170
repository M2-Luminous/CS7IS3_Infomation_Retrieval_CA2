The spokesman said that the government was unhappy over a news agency report quoting Fay's father, George Fay and his American lawyer, Theodore Simon, as saying that the caning ripped Fay's buttocks and left him in continual pain. Both men, speaking in the United States, had reportedly quoted US Vice-Consul John Coe who visited Michael Fay on Friday, a day after he received four lashes on his buttocks, in their accounts of the teenager's condition after the beating. Fay, 18, from Kettering, Ohio, who lives here with his mother and step-father had pleaded guilty to charges of spray-painting cars, pelting them with eggs and keeping stolen road signs. But he later claimed he was innocent. Boyce, the American Charge d'Affairs here, and Coe, who were both called to the foreign office, were not availabe for comment. Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Kishore Mahbubani said that the US embassy had the moral obligation to confirm or deny the report. The ministry thought that the true picture would come out when it allowed Coe to see Fay but instead was "shocked by the tremendous amount of falsification," the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation quoted Mahbubani as saying. Coe was the only American to see Michael Fay after the caning on Thursday. Coe did not speak to the press after the prison visit but briefed the teenager's mother, Randay Chan who later denounced the beating as "torture." Chan said that the consular officer was not able to assess her son's condition because the meeting took place "in a controlled situation" with prison officials present. Singapore's Prisons Department earlier Saturday called statements attributed to George Fay and Simon "wild allegations and misinformation," adding that Michael Fay walked back to his cell after the caning, saying he "wanted to act like a man." The spokesman said that the list of "misinformation" attributed to Simon included the claim that blood ran down the teenager's legs during the caning. He said that while there were a few drops of blood on Fay's buttocks, "blood did not run down his legs" during the caning. "He sat on a chair shortly after the interview started and remained seated throughout the rest of the interview," the spokesman said. George Fay had reportedly said that his son stood throughout the meeting with Coe Fay also told Coe to tell his mother "not to worry" and tell his father to "shut up," the spokesman said, adding: "The cane marks are almost dry and clean." Fay was ordered caned six times, but the Singapore government reduced the sentence to four lashes after President Bill Clinton intervened. Clinton has called the punishment a "mistake" and the State Department called in Singapore's ambassador to the United States, S.R. @athan, and told him that Washington was disappointed by the affair. Meanwhile 17-year-old Shiu Chi Ho, a Hong Kong national also convicted of vandalism, spent his first full day in prison Saturday after abandoning plans to take his case to a higher court. Shiu, sentenced to 12 lashes and eight months jail for spray-painting four cars over two weekends, will write to President Ong for clemency, his father, Shiu Chung On said. He is not expected to be caned until after the government decides on the petition, lawyers said.
