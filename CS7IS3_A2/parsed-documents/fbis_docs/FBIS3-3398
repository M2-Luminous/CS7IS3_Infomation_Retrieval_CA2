Commenting on difficulties in supervising "local governments, courts, and procuratorates," Sun Weiben said that the biggest problems are people's concepts, understandings, and habits. On the one hand, people's congresses have to develop their skills in executing their supervisory tasks; on the other hand, "local governments, courts, and procuratorates" need an adjusting and accepting process for such supervision. He said that at present they are gradually resolving the problems. Chinese and foreign reporters were concerned what powers local people's congresses have and how they use them. Lu Chuanzan provided a four-part answer to a reporter's question. He said: First, the Hebei PPC has made major progress in legislative work. As of the end of 1993, the Hebei PPC and its standing committee have formulated and approved 92 local laws and regulations; have made 19 legal resolutions and decisions; and have approved 6 autonomous regulations for autonomous counties. The total number was 117. Second, the PPC exercises its supervisory power over "local governments, courts, and procuratorates," mainly by hearing and deliberating their work reports, and by organizing deputies to inspect and examine the enforcement of laws and regulations, and to evaluate their work performance. Third, the PPC discusses and decides major issues affecting its various administrative areas. Fourth, the PPC chooses, appoints, and dismisses leaders of local state organs according to law. A reporter asked: What issues has local legislation emphasized? Sun Weiben answered: Between 1979 and 1993, the Heilongjiang PPC has formulated 98 local laws and regulations, mainly relating to economic tasks. The number of economic laws and regulations accounted for 60 percent of the total number of formulated regulations. Besides, our legislative work has also stressed promoting scientific and technological progresses and achievements. The general requirement is that our local legislation on economic tasks should basically enhance the establishment of a socialist market economy. A reporter, interested in Sun Weiben's concurrently holding posts as secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and chairman of the Heilongjiang PPC, asked him how he handled the relations between the two posts. Sun Weiben said: The two posts, in principle, do not conflict with each other. Both the party's guiding principle and the people's congress's work objectives aim at the same end. As the party committee and the executive organs differ in their natures and work styles, their functions are not interchangeable. The provincial party committee supervises "local governments, courts, and procuratorates," mainly by implementing political and ideological principles; whereas the PPC mainly supervises the enforcement of laws and regulations and work performance of "local governments, courts, and procuratorates."
