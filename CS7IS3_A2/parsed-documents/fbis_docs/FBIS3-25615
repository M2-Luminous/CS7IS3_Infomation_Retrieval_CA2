Over the last 24 hours the Rwandan capital, Kigali, has been the scene of street clashes, and in political terms things are not going well; the transitional parliament and government have not yet been installed. Our special correspondent Simone Remont reports from Kigali: [Remont] In Kigali this afternoon, the investiture ceremony for the broad-based government that has already been postponed many times came to a rapid end. Important absentees were the prime minister designate of the future government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front. [passage omitted] The situation is completely deadlocked, set against a backdrop of two political assassinations and the murderous violence which has resulted in about 40 dead and many injured in the Rwandan capital. The situation is all the more worrying because the former rebels of the Patriotic Front are now taking a tougher line. Everything is calm in Kigali this evening, but unless a rapid political solution is found, one can fear further trouble. Simon Remont in Kigali for the Newsreel. [Announcer] [passage omitted] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, who has arrived in Burundi, has commented on the situation in nearby Rwanda from the capital, Bujumbura. Willy Claes says that he is disappointed and irritated by the lack of goodwill on the part of all the political leaders who are seeking to keep a share of power for themselves rather than throwing themselves into sorting out Rwanda's economy. Willy Claes's remarks are targeted equally at the forces of President Habyarimana and the opposition. Last weekend Willy Claes was in Kigali and he sent a very firm message to the Rwandan politicians by threatening the suspension of western aid. [passage omitted]
