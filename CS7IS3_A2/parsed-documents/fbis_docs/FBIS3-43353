A poll conducted by Integrated Market Research (IMR) for THE SUNDAY TIMES found that the ANC can garner up to 60 percent support in contrast to a meager 13 percent for the NP--with the Freedom Alliance coming in right behind at 11.5 percent. Mr. Donald Simpson, an independent election analyst, projected for RAPPORT that the ANC could get 57.10 percent of the votes, the NP 15.51 percent, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) 9.22 percent, the CP [Conservative Party] 4.10 percent, the DP [Democratic Party] 4.00 percent, the Afrikaner People's Union (AVU) 0.30 percent, the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] 5.23 percent, and regional parties 3.30 percent. According to the IMR, support among black people for the NP has decreased drastically. Less than 2 percent of them will vote for the party, while support for it has declined to 40 percent among whites. A large segment of the colored and Indian community, where the NP is campaigning heavily, is still uncertain as to how it will vote, however. According to one of the polls, the ANC will not achieve the two-thirds majority necessary to change the constitution. The predictions are causing concern to the NP and Inkatha even though there are six months to go to the election. According to constitutional provisions, they will only be junior partners in the government. The rest of the parties are doing hopelessly poorly. In accordance with constitutional provisions, the ANC, with its predicted support, will get 19 posts in the 30-member cabinet. It will also be able to designate a president and vice president and will thus have a two-thirds majority in the cabinet. Accordingly, President F.W. de Klerk will be the second vice president with an additional four posts for the NP. The Freedom Alliance will also be able to occupy four posts. The survey was conducted among 2,200 people nationwide and the margin of error is 4 percent. According to Mr. Simpson, the parties could end up with the following seats in the National Assembly: ANC 229, NP 66, IFP 37, CP 17, DP 16, AVU 1, regional parties 13, and the PAC 21. He also predicts that the Northern and Western Cape are the only two regions where the NP could win easily.
