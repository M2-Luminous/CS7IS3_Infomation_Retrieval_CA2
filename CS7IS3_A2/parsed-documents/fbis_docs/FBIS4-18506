Ahmet Rasit said that cooperation between the Greek Cypriot side and the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] when talks are being held on the confidence-building measures is inadmissible. He said: "The Greek Cypriots have claimed that they are making an effort to achieve a durable peace. However, they continue to support the PKK, which the entire world regards as a terrorist organization. How can that be equated with goodwill?" Stressing that the Turkish Cypriot side has proved that it has acted with goodwill as much as possible until now, Ahmet Rasit said: "Taking into consideration the UN recommendations, the Turkish Cypriot side indicated when the talks began that it was prepared to trust the Greek Cypriots. However, they do not wish to trust us at all. In view of that, it would be meaningless for us to trust the Greek Cypriots who do not wish to reciprocate." Ahmet Rasit described Maras [Varosha] and Nicosia International Airport, which has been closed for 20 years, as two key issues in the Cyprus problem. He said: "The problem is the question of access to Maras through Dherinia. According to the package, travel through that area will be unrestricted without any formality. We have agreed to that principle. However, not satisfied with that, the Greek Cypriots have moved to ask for more." Stressing that the friction between the two sides was not due to disputes between individuals, Ahmet Rasit expressed the conviction that the two communities, which have been forced by history and geographic conditions to live together, can coexist in peace by respecting each other's religion, language, and origin. Ahmet Rasit said that they may consider holding a referendum on whether or not the Turkish Cypriot side should continue to participate in the indirect talks if the UN secretary general submits a report to the Security Council critical of the Turkish Cypriot side. Furthermore, he stressed that more work has to be done on the confidence-building measures package, and noted that the Turkish Cypriot side will maintain its effort to find a solution. Ahmet Rasit also stressed that the coalition government in north Cyprus, which came to power after the elections on 12 December 1993, is working together in harmony.
