It was learned that the personnel reshuffle of the two lieutenant generals this time was in line with the military reforms by the ROK military authorities following the release from his post in July last year of Major General Yi Chung-sok, (the 21st Class of the KMA), director of the Operations Bureau at the JCS, because of the "remarks" he reportedly made at a dinner party of the JCS. (He was discharged from the Army in August) However, the fact that the two lieutenant generals had still one year left in their terms of office at the posts and that their release was the first personnel action taken by the newly appointed minister, who was also a Hanahoe member, can be viewed to be quite unusual. On 30 December last year Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae called General Kim Tong-chin, chief of staff of the ROK Army, into his office and had a 30-minute secret conversation with him. In the conversation Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reportedly informed General Kim Tong-chin of his plan to eliminate Army officers affiliated with Hanahoe. Thus, the release of the two lieutenant generals at the JCS became the first personnel action that the new defense minister took after consulting with Chongwadae [presidential office]. Accordingly, people are predicting that the National Defense Ministry under the new minister will follow a "hardline" track in dealing with Hanahoe-affiliated officers. On the eve of the Army's periodic personnel reshuffle of last fall, General Kim Tong-chin, chief of staff of the Army, declared that "Hanahoe-affiliated officers who have enjoyed thus far special favor in promotion and duty position will be subjected to disadvantage for one year." Our attention is focussed on whether such a promise by General Kim will be carried out. Moreover, many people indicate that there is a good possibility that a conflict between the "hardliner" defense minister and "lenient" chief of staff of the Army will take place in dealing with Hanahoe-affiliated officers. On the other hand, some people hold that the fact that the new minister was member of Hanahoe will rather narrow the scope of his activity of handling Hanahoe-affiliated officers in the future. This is convincing. Convincing is also the analysis that President Kim Yong-sam's plan to "eliminate Hanahoe members through a Hanahoe member" is based on his high-level political calculation. Some people also indicate that although Defense Minister Yi himself was a Hanahoe member, but belonged to an alienated group within Hanahoe and that, therefore, he has not good feelings toward Hanahoe itself. Being a member of Hanahoe, if Defense Minister Yi withdraws the disadvantage in promotion and duty position imposed on Hanahoe members, this may create a serious conflict between those officers from the KMA and those from non-KMA background and between Hanahoe member officers and non-Hanahoe member officers. On the other hand, a section of the military circles estimates that under the new government the principle of eliminating Hanahoe-affiliated officers will be thoroughly adhered to and that the emergence of those pro-U.S.-leaning general officers or those general officers with some connections with the United States will be remarkable. In this connection, noting that the United States, which exercised great influence in the military personnel affairs during the era of President Pak Chong-hui, could not fully exercise its influence during the fifth and sixth republics because of the emergence of Hanahoe-affiliated officers a military source predicts that the U.S. influence over the military personnel affairs of the ROK Armed Forces will be revived in the future.
