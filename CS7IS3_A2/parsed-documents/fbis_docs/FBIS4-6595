Sison, exiled leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front [CPP-NPA-NDF]. This was revealed by Lieutenant General Arturo Enrile, Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP] chief of staff, and Maj. Gen. Alfredo Filler, AFP vice chief of staff, in reaction to Sison's accusation. Enrile emphasized that any attempt on the life of any of the communist movement's leaders will only destroy the peace process pushed by government. Meanwhile, Filler said that there is no report of any such plan monitored by the AFP Intelligence Service. Filler clarified that it is Sison's group who are doing things that are destructive to them in the first place, like murder, kidnapping, and robbery. [Begin recording in English] [Enrile] Why should we do that in the first place. You know, we are part of that sincere effort for peace in this country. If that is done, that will only derail whatever peace process that we are working out with the CPP-NPA-NDF. So, there is really no such thing. [Filler] The Armed Forces of the Philippines do not operate that way. We view such an act as entirely counterproductive to the reconciliation process and our search for lasting peace.
