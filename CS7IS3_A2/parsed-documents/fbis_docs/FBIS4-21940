The investigation into last year's events is still going on, since some saboteurs among the armed Tajik opposition gunmen have managed to take refuge on Afghan territory. It has been learned from informed sources in Dushanbe that the extremists planned to drive three "Zil" trucks loaded with explosives into the hydroelectric facility's operational tunnels and detonate them. In the opinion of military experts, a serious danger of flooding was averted: The unique mountain station's dam is 350 meters high. The reservoir's total capacity is 10.4 billion cubic meters. The wave after the explosion could have been 86 meters high. The initial width and length of flooding could have been 53 km and 1,385 km respectively. Over 2,000 villages and seven cities in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenia could have been flooded. The blowing up of the dam was prevented by soldiers of the 201st Russian Motorized Rifle Division's Kulyab Regiment, two of whom died in a shootout with Tajik opposition gunmen. Colonel General Eduard Vorobyev, who headed the antiterrorist operation and is now first deputy commander in chief of Russian Ground Forces, informed an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the extremists had also planned a sabotage operation to destroy the nitrogen mineral fertilizer plant in the city of Yavan. Its consequences could have led to the mass poisoning and death of people.
