The stock market plummeted over 19 points Tuesday on the announcement of North Korea's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Pyongyang's pledge to go to war if necessary in case of U.N. sanctions. Food hoarding has begun as anxious shoppers thronged supermarkets to stock up on groceries and the country held a large-scale mock war drill on Wednesday. The presidential office has made an inner judgement, based on around-the-clock monitoring of the North Korean military and the border, that there are no clear signs of a coming war. But presidential aides decided it was time to take action when food hoarding and other signs of creeping war anxiety emerged this week. Chief Secretary Pak Kwan-yong called in all senior presidential aides for a meeting Wednesday morning to seek input on how to provide assurances on the country's security capabilities while administering a dose of reality on imminent U.N. sanctions against North Korea. Presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said after the meeting that all participants agreed sanctions will not lead to immediate war as North Korea has suggested, but that they are a means to draw Pyongyang back to the negotiating table to resolve the nuclear crisis. In other words, they decided the people must realize that North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his regime will resort to dialogue only when they are taken to the edge of the cliff, Chu said. At the same time, they wanted to build up public confidence and the government's credibility in terms of national security, he said. "Some people are buying up instant noodles and rice because they are inclined more toward the North Korean war rhetoric that sanctions mean immediate war," said the spokesman. "We want to convince the people that although the public and the government do stand ready for the possibility of war, they have to behave calmly so that they don't jumble up the entire distribution network." But equally important, the public must be made to understand the exact situation on the Korean peninsula and what is happening on the North Korean nuclear problem so that they can be ready for even a 0.1 percent chance of war, according to officials. The sources said the meeting's participants held the foreign media partly responsible for South Koreans' war anxiety, citing the arrival of special news teams to cover the tense situation and exaggerated coverage of what is really going on. President Kim Yong-sam personally instructed the Foreign and Defense ministries to keep reporters briefed on all changes so they can relay the news to the public, and the two ministries are expected to carry out the instruction from Thursday.
