FR941103-2-00075 FR941103-2-00033 [FRL&hyph;5101&hyph;7] Acid Rain Program: Notice of Draft Written Exemptions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of draft written exemptions. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is issuing draft written exemptions from Acid Rain permitting and monitoring requirements to 55 utility units at 32 plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). Because the Agency does not anticipate receiving adverse comments, the exemptions are also being issued as a direct final action in the notice of written exemptions published elsewhere in today's Federal Register . DATES: Comments on the exemptions proposed by this action must be received on or before December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments. Send comments to the following addresses: For plants in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, William A. Spratlin, Director, Air and Toxics Division, EPA Region 7, 726 Minnesota Ave., Kansas City, KS 66101. For plants in Michigan and Wisconsin: David Kee, Director, Air and Radiation Division, EPA Region 5, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, IL 60604. Submit comments in duplicate and identify the exemption to which the comments apply, the commenter's name, address, and telephone number, and the commenter's interest in the matter and affiliation, if any, to the owners and operators of the unit covered by the exemption. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For plants in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, Jon Knodel, (913) 551&hyph;7599, EPA Region 7; for plants in Michigan and Wisconsin, Beth Valenziano, (312) 886&hyph;2703, EPA Region 5. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: If no significant, adverse comments are timely received, no further activity is contemplated in relation to these draft written exemptions and the exemptions issued as a direct final action in the notice of written exemptions published elsewhere in today's Federal Register will automatically become final on the date specified in that notice. If significant, adverse comments are timely received on any exemption, that exemption in the notice of written exemptions will be withdrawn and all public comment received on that exemption will be addressed in a subsequent issuance or denial of exemption based on the relevant exemption in this notice of draft written exemptions. Because the Agency will not institute a second comment period on this notice of draft written exemptions, any parties interested in commenting should do so during this comment period. For further information and a detailed description of the exemptions, see the information provided in the notice of written exemptions elsewhere in today's Federal Register . Dated: October 31, 1994. Brian J. McLean, Director, Acid Rain Division, Office of Atmospheric Programs, Office of Air and Radiation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27298 Filed 11&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
