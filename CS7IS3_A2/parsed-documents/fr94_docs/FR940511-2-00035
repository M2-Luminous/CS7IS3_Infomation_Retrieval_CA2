FR940511-2-00035 FR940511-2-00024 Financial Assistance Award; American Sun Company AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent to award an unsolicited application financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under Grant Number DE&hyph;FG01&hyph;94CE15601 to American Sun Company. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $99,824 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through the development and construction of an extra-focal, convective suppressing solar collector to use in such applications as water heating, space heating, industrial process heating, absorption cooling, and desiccant cooling. The proposed technology has a strong possibility of adding to the Nation's Energy Resources by enabling solar energy to be used in household and industrial processes that now can only be served cost effectively by fossil fuels and electricity. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, ATTN: John Windish, HR&hyph;531.23, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the unsolicited application for financial assistance submitted by American Sun Company, is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents a unique idea, that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation. Miles Maiden will be the principal investigator. He has pursued the development, refinement, manufacture, and marketing of this invention since 1990. The Energy Related Inventions Program (ERIP) has been structured, since its beginning in 1975, to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation. The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 18 months from the effective date of award. Issued in Washington, DC, on May 4, 1994. Scott Sheffield, Director, Headquarter Operations Division B, Office of Placement and Administration.
