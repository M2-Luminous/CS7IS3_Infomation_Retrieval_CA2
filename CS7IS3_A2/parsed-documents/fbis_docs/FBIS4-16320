On this occasion, the SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN newspaper reports that apparently not only Japan, but also the Maritime Kray is laying claim to the southern Kurils. At a March press conference in Vladivostok, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of the Maritime Kray, said the Kurils should be economically subordinated to the Maritime Kray. He added that the Maritime Kray economy would gladly accept the Kurils. SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN says this interest is understandable since a significant amount of foreign-currency-earning raw material resources from the far east are obtained in this region. As far as the Kurils' own economy is concerned, its neighbors are hardly prepared, or able, to take upon themselves the problems of the Kuril residents. It is not easy being the inhabitants of the disputed islands, writes SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN.
