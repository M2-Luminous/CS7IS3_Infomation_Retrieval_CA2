You Are Not at Maneuvers..."] [Text] On 29 April, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Collegium held a meeting. During the meeting, important issues concerning military life were discussed. According to a reliable source, after the chairman summed up the meeting and set objectives, a very excited Major General Vladimir Petenko, the president's adviser for military issues, appeared in the room. The supreme commander's envoy made a curious proposal to the generals present in the room -- to initiate in the military the emergency collection of signatures supporting the present head of state as a presidential candidate. This appeal bewildered the top brass just a little bit. Many generals surely recalled the old good times when the high staff would send an instruction suggesting (!) that they ensure active participation of the personnel in some social or political event. This was a written document, while an oral "supplement" specified the exact degree of "support," which the commander had to provide, no matter what. Now, everything is handled more elegantly; no one is sending any dictates. Instead, they provide oral instructions uttered in a commanding tone. But have those people bothered to think what a disservice they are doing to the president? How will those directives be met in the military -- by the 70,000 officers and warrant officers who have been left without a place to live and spend half of their miserable salary on rent? What should soldiers -- the main "supporters" -- feel when they cannot even buy a decent tube of toothpaste with their allowances? Yes, organizers of this undertaking should have first thought what they think this Army really is -- the defender of the Homeland or a group of people who can be manipulated at will?
