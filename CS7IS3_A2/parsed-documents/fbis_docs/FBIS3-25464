A Cameroon Government communique issued yesterday confirmed the clashes between Cameroonian and Nigerian forces on the Bakassi peninsular. Casualty figures are not yet known, but the event is being taken seriously in Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital. Our correspondent Jean Mater Ndi reports from Yaounde. [Begin Ndi recording] It is the first time that the Cameroon Government talks about this problem in such a solemn fashion. According to the communique, on the night of 18 February a detachment of the Nigerian Army launched a series of attacks against Cameroonian troops on the Bakassi peninsula in the English-speaking south-eastern Cameroon. According to the communique, Cameroonian troops responded and pushed back the attackers. It should, however, be noted that this incident is just an extension of a situation existing since 21 December when 500 Nigerian soldiers occupied certain areas of Cameroonian territory in the Gulf of Guinea. In the face of the negative attitude of the Nigerian Government, while remaining vigilant on the ground, Cameroon has opted for international arbitration. The Yaounde authorities have decided to take the case to the UN Security Council, the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and an OAU central body for the prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts. Cameroon reaffirmed its sovereignty over the Bakassi peninsula, citing in its defense the German-British treaty of 11 March 1913, the rule of intangibility of frontiers decided by the referendum of 1961 attaching the former eastern Cameroon to the southern part of Cameroon under British trusteeship. The government also cited the Mawa Declaration of 1975 demarcating the maritime borders between the two countries. [end recording]
