He said it was a grave fallacy to think of confederation as the formula for national reunification. He made the remarks after receiving a briefing on the operation of a fighter wing on Friday as if to clamp down on the emerging argument in favor of a confederational system as a form of national reunification. He said he cannot consent to the people thinking of a confederation system out of an emotional yearning for national reunification. "We should seek a viable and sustainable formula for national reunification, he said. Kim's remarks appear to be aimed at Kim Tae-chung, who said upon arrival here from his tour of the United States the previous day that people should be given the right to freely debate the national reunification issue, proposing a referendum on desirable unification formula. Kim Tae-chung has opted for a confederation system as a means of eventual national reunification. Meanwhile, North Korea has persistently held on to the confederation system for unification.
