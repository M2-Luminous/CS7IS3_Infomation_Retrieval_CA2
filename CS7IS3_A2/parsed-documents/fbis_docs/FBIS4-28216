Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said that the Thai ambassador to Iran was invited to a meeting at which Iran asked Thailand to facilitate a visit with the arrested suspects by Iranian Embassy officials. Iran also asked that inquiries into the case be accelerated. The foreign minister thinks there should be no affect on bilateral relations: [Begin Prasong recording] There is no problem; they can visit the suspects if they want to see them. Those people were arrested by our authorities because they committed offenses in Thailand. They have to undergo the process of investigation by our authorities. If they have relatives or lawyers, they can visit them. The suspects are not protected by diplomatic immunity and must be prosecuted. [end recording] Police General Phong-amat Amatayakun, acting police director general, said that officials from the Iranian Embassy are entitled to seek information on the arrests. They can visit the suspects on the condition that such a move would not distort the case. It is the privilege of diplomats to take care of their own people.
