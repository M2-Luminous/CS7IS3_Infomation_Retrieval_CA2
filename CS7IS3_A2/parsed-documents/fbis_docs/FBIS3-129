Pretoria Boerekommando Commandant Willem Ratte said the fortification of the town's municipal offices would hopefully be one of the first steps towards a volkstaat [homeland]. The offices had been barricaded at the request of the local community, he said. But Town Clerk Nick Ebersohn said he first heard about the erection of the barricades at 3.15am on Monday. "At that time, it did not seem opportune to tell the people not to do it," said Mr Ebersohn. Rayton's seven councillors were all independents, he said. He would not be drawn on whather Rayton supported the volkstaat movement. Rayton is situated about 30km east of Pretoria in an area marked by rightwing activity. Radio Pretoria's Donkerhoek site is about 10km from the town. Speaking on Radio Pretoria on Monday, Cmdt Ratte said the volkstaat would stand or fall at local government level."I am convinced that if we can't even restore democracy at local government level, we won't be able to do so at national level. "If communities like Rayton and Akasia and others clearly adopt standpoints against the government's threat of forcing undemocratic bodies on them, it can be the start of the volkstaat, and I am convinced it will be the start of the volkstaat." Cmdt Ratte said the government had issued a threat that all town councils would be forced to disband and become part of non-democratic forums. "The people of Rayton said that, just like akasia, they were not prepared to submit to these threats, and they refused to disband their democratically elected council." Just because Rayton was small did not mean it was unimportant. "It is especially at local government level that the volkstaat will stand or fall." Pretoria Boercommando members barricaded Akasia's council offices on February 14 to "protect the complex until Akasia's incorporation into a future volkstaat", Akasia Management Committee Chairman Louis Meynardt said at the time. Akasia is 15km north of Pretoria.
