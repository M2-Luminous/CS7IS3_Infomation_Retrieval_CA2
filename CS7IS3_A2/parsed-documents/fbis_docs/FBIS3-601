Informed sources say the attack took place near Gamalakhe Township. Earlier the IFP refused to allow members of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] to join the march. The AWB members said they had gone to Port Shepstone to support Zulu King Zwelithini's demand for a sovereign kingdom and the Freedom Alliance's constitutional demands. Thousands of Zulus continued the march without the AWB members. The group of protesters handed over a memorandum to the South African Police at Port Shepstone, supporting King Zwelithini's intercession in the negotiating process. Chief Khawula handed in the memorandum on behalf of the South Coast Zulu leaders. He said Zulus would never accept a flawed constitution. He said that not only did they reject the constitution, but they would actively resist it.
