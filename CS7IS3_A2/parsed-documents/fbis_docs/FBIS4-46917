It is the beginning of their implementation that is currently giving people there hope for the future, however illusory that hopes may be. One of the main programs pertains to conversion of the defense industry, which comprises 6 percent of the oblast economy. The administration made the right choice when it entrusted creation of the program to the staff of the defense-related Gradient All-Russian Scientific Research Institute, whose director, V. Blokhin, became chairman of the oblast committee on conversion. What eventually resulted was a collection of specific business plans for which R5.3 billion [rubles] in loans on favorable terms and R4.3 billion in subsidies were allocated by the central government. The oblast came up with another billion. According to estimates, within a year those investments will yield R2.0 billion in profit, and R2.6 billion within three years. The region's unique location and the unique position of Rostov itself as southern Russia's transportation hub, a point where principal water, air and land transportation routes meet, also dictates that the authorities devote priority attention to the rapid development of those routes. All sorts of firms and joint-stock companies are springing up like mushrooms along the Don River, specializing in the creation of such programs and the search for serious investors to finance them. One example is the Port Petrovskiy Joint-Stock Company, which is intent on building a modern seaport near Taganrog. The administration realizes that the meager local budget will not be enough to solve every problem. Therefore they have selected the most important ones, and then of those selected those that can be accomplished. Investment priorities have been established: the social realm, the agro-industrial complex, physical infrastructure, and construction of housing for retired military personnel. Incidentally, in one year the flow of investment into non-production-related construction increased from 26 to 32 percent. Housing completion increased by 4 percent. But not everything is going so smoothly; some mistakes have also been made. It is has proved virtually impossible to attract foreign investors to the Don and get them to commit to major investments. Administrators from the Don region are busily traveling abroad and eagerly welcoming visitors, but contacts are not turning into contracts. Many talks with foreigners are for some reason being conducted quietly, in secret from local business people, prompting objections from the latter and the suspicion that there is some personal stake in this for the officials, some of whom would not mind dabbling in international business themselves. The Rostov Chamber of Trade and Industry, established by major enterprises and banks (with the oblast administration among its founders, incidentally) has for some reason met with a cool reception from the oblast administration's Foreign Economic Affairs Department, which views it as an unnecessary competitor, though they should both be pulling in the same direction. Incidentally, staff members of the Foreign Economic Affairs Department are, in violation of the "Statute on Federal State Service," also employed by the Integratsiya Fund To Assist Foreign Economic Operations. Incidentally, a commission of the President's monitoring administration has studied the administration's foreign economic activities in Rostov. Its conclusions were, one must assume, serious, though for some reason they have not yet been revealed to the local public. True, soon after the commission's departure the head of the oblast administration signed Decree No. 93, which was sharply critical of activities by the Foreign Economic Affairs Department. Yevchenko was given until the end of May to come up with a program. Of course, the programs by which the oblast administration is managing the region are only a first step. But, as the ancients said, if you do not know to which shore you are sailing, no wind will seem fair to you.
