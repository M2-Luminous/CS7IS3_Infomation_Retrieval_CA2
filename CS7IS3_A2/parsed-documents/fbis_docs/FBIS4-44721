In 1993, more than 280,000 tons ended up in the yellow Dual System (DSD) collection sacks as packaging waste. DSD managers expect 440,000 tons of plastic packaging bearing the green dot by the end of 1994, the plastics mountain for recycling being expected to swell to 750,000 tons by the end of 1986 -- much more than the recycling capacity currently available in Germany. However, the much-prophesied waste flood by no means rattles the top DSD people, who are temporarily afflicted by tight finances and reprocessing bottlenecks. They are placing their trust in a confident promise made by Plastics Manufacturing Industry Association chairman Albrecht Eckell: "The problem of plastics recycling will have been cracked by the end of 1998." The magic formula is reprocessing into raw materials. Instead of just melting plastics down to make park benches, flowerpots, and noise insulation panels, yogurt pots, detergent bottles, and similar waste will be used as sources of raw materials. This week, the BASF chemicals group (on whose board Eckell sits) is bringing on stream a pilot plant in Ludwigshafen, where ground-down plastic waste will be liquefied at 400ï¿½C then split into oils and gases. Up to 950 grams of petrochemical products will be distilled in this way from every 1,000 grams of plastic and used as raw materials in the BASF factories. The PVC [polyvinyl chloride] component will be separated out as Javelle water and processed in the hydrochloric acid works. The plant, claims a BASF brochure, will operate without pressure in a closed system, so it will discharge "virtually no emissions." The 40-million German mark [DM] pilot plant has an annual recycling capacity of 15,000 tons. The follow-up model, which is scheduled to come on stream early in the summer of 1996, is of a different caliber: It can reprocess up to 300,000 tons of contaminated, unsorted DSD packaging -- sufficient volume, together with the VEBA [United Electricity and Mining Works AG] coal-oil plant in Bottrop (170,000 tons) and the RWE [Rhineland- Westphalian Electricity Works] plant (70,000 tons), to meet the requirements of the Packaging Regulation until that date. The new industrial-scale technology admittedly has one drawback: These expensive plants -- BASF's investment will amount to DM300 million -- must keep running, so they need a constant plastic waste input. This does away with the incentive to avoid creating packaging waste. In order to ensure supplies of DSD material, BASF is also working with the Cologne-based Otto Group, whose annual sales of DM1.3 billion make it one of the giants on the waste disposal market. Group chairman Otto answers objections that central plastics recycling will speed up the polarization process in the industry by pointing out that small and medium-sized disposal firms could participate in a "nationwide project" at 15 regional logistical centers. Plastics recycling does not come cheap. The Dual System pays BASF DM325/ton -- about a 10th of the cost of producing a ton of recycled raw materials, collection, sorting, and separating the packaging waste taking the lion's share. One ton of crude oil costs DM200 on the world market. In the ultimate analysis, the consumer has to pay for it as well at the checkout -- the "green dot" is what makes this possible.
