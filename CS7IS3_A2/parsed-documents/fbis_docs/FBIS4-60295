Brother dear citizens: On this venerable day of faith, in which the magnificence of the shining picture of the Islamic nation manifests itself, represented in the guests of God visiting the holy places and taking up position in common worship to the one God on the blessed Mount 'Arafat, and in the apex of great rites that almost count as the complete pilgrimage to quote Prophet Muhammad, who said that to climb Mount 'Arafat amounts to a complete pilgrimage. This is because standing on Mount 'Arafat [word indistinct] is an important religous event, where the sentiments of all Muslims gravitate [word indistinct] the close bond that does not unravel, and that makes us stick more firmly to it and believe more in the justice of the virtuous Islamic faith. We thank God for his guidance. On the occasion of the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, I take pleasure to send my sincere, heartfelt congratulations to all members of our people and Arab and Islamic nations, hoping that when the occasion next comes round all of us will be in the happiest state possible. This 'Id confirms great values of sacrifice and self-denial that are today manifest in the heroic acts of the courageous and faithful sons of our believing and proud people in the Armed Forces and Security Forces as they fight battles of sacrifice and self-denial and stand up to rebellious and secessionist gangs within the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party and display the finest examples of sacrifice with all courage and chivalry and dedication to the sacred duty. To them in particular, I send my warmest greetings on the occasion of 'Id al- Adha [word instinct] what they have always done in the areas of sacrifice and self-denial and standing up to the enemies of the people and the homeland and the enemies of principles, ideals, and values. Thanks to them, our people have been able to ward off the dangers that were ignited by the rebellious secessionists, threatening the homeland's unity and safety. They have extinguished the fire of those dangers before they became an overall national ordeal, thus bolstering and fortifying the people's unity, increasing the firmness of the people's faith in democracy, and enhancing faith in the present and future of the new Yemen, the Yemen of unity, freedom, and democracy, the Yemen of wellbeing, justice, and prosperity. On this occasion, we beseech Almighty God to have bountiful mercy on all the martyrs of our people, the martyrs of the revolution, unity, and democracy, and to elevate their souls to highest ranks among the prophet's companions and martyrs. We beseech God to accept the prayers of the pilgrims to holy Mecca, to guide our steps, and to lead us along the path that pleases Him. God is all-hearing, ready to answer. Many happy returns.
