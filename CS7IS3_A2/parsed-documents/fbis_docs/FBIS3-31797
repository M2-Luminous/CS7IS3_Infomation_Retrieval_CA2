Do you think that we have done enough to ensure that the door hanging in this gateway does not have squeaky hinges? And, do you think that our neighbors will willingly entrust us with the mandate of chief doorkeeper? [Havel] The idea of a gateway was expressed during our meeting with the Thai prime minister. It was put forward by our side, and the prime minister and the finance minister welcomed it very much. In my opinion, at the international level, it means nothing more than creating mutually favorable conditions for the economic presence of various companies and banks in Prague. And, as soon as the Thai companies become established in our country, they will then -- understandably -- be able to infiltrate the market around us, in this case, CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Zone -- LIDOVE NOVINY note). It will then depend not so much on the governments, but on contacts between individual economic entities. For example, when a bank wants to establish a branch in Central Europe, it hesitates and wonders whether it should do so in Vienna, Prague, Warsaw, or elsewhere. If we create a favorable climate by means of beneficial political and legislative conditions, it will locate its new branch in our country and we will become its base for the whole of the surrounding region. The same applies vice versa for our potential presence in Thailand, a country that is, for various reasons, most propitious for this purpose. This could mean a starting point for activity in other countries or -- as the case may be -- a starting point for triangular operations in which the Czech Republic and Thailand conduct business together in third countries. It is definitely not perceived as a contractual system involving several countries where this or that country will represent other countries. [Slezak] You are returning from Asia. Journalists and political scientists who deal with Asia from India to Japan are now arguing about whether the economic boom will necessarily lead the countries of this region to a point where they will have to adopt a Western-type political model. That is: Not just a parliamentary democracy, often characterized by local customs and foibles, but also emphasis on human rights. Some experts maintain that the attempts to graft something considerably different onto a cultural environment which has been evolving for a thousand years cannot succeed, and if it does, then only for a short time. It seems that the Thai example has confirmed the opposite theory.... [Havel] That is a subject that is indeed being much discussed -- not only among European or U.S. observers, but also among the politicians of that region. The Thai prime minister, for example, is of the opinion that the development of human rights and the development of the economy should -- and must -- go hand-in-hand. He was the inspiration behind the Bangkok Conference, which was devoted to this very idea. Other leaders allude to their specific traditions and say that first it is necessary to achieve a certain standard of living, a certain economic development, and only then is it possible -- as the case may be -- to intensify democracy and enhance respect for human rights. I will not presume to judge the issue. But, something in me -- most likely instinctively -- tells me that it is perhaps impossible for a flourishing economy to endure and enjoy good prospects without political freedoms. The market, which is based on the free activity of free economic entities, has its own particular freedom. Under conditions that curb political freedom, this freedom will begin to seem restricted. On the other hand, the market and the free game of market forces can only exist if there are rules that are respected by everyone. This means, respect for rights. It is hard to say, but I am more inclined toward the view that, although democracy has taken hold in these countries with greater difficulty than it did throughout the Euro-American world, it must and will -- despite this -- accompany the economic development of these countries. It is true that, in its early stages, economic development progressed here under the conditions of an authoritarian system. However, that does not seem to me to be possible forever. I think that the integrative efforts being made here, as in Europe, will also move in this direction. That is, apart from rules for a freer exchange of goods and similar economic measures, a kind of political requirement has always been set: The more advanced countries in this sphere may exert a little pressure on those who, within the framework of the integrative grouping, are less advanced. [Slezak] Mr. President, in Varanasi, which you visited last week, there once lived a poet and a mystic called Kabir, who merged elements of Hinduism and Islam in his work and who advocated love and tolerance toward God and people. There are many such examples in Indian history. Nevertheless, the brutal religious pogroms in India present a sharp contrast to the remarkable tolerance in the philosophical sphere. These pogroms return again and again. A tiny spark is enough and years-long coexistence in peace and harmony is forgotten in an instant. When you were awarded the Indira Ghandi Prize, you spoke about the prospects for coexistence among various cultures. It seems to me that it will be a very long time yet before the individual cultural spheres come together and that more than one tiny "Indian- type" spark will be ignited. It also seems to me that you are a far greater optimist in this respect. [Havel] In India and Thailand I made two speeches in which I outlined my views on the outlook for today's world and also on what I consider to be a better alternative, an alternative providing the only guarantee that the world will be able to confront the terrible dangers facing it. The fact that I outlined the better alternative did not mean that I ruled out the possibility that the worse one could occur. Of course, this may happen. But it would have catastrophic consequences for the whole world. It is true that this ambiguous tradition belongs to Indian culture. On the one hand, an ecumenical ideal -- to put it simply -- manifests itself there again and again, an ideal of conciliation and peaceful coexistence. The most celebrated exponent of this ideal in the modern era was Ghandi, who reconciled Hindus with Moslems.... [Slezak] ....and carried in his pack both the Bhagavadgita and the Koran.... [Havel] Yes, yes. On the other hand, religious conflicts are manifesting themselves there again and again. The disintegration of British India into Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India was caused by the inability to coexist. We still see the disastrous consequences of this division today -- in Kashmir, the Punjab, and elsewhere. We also saw it in Calcutta. There are two currents contending with each other in this region -- and also in another form in Europe. After all, there is again a kind of race between the integrative efforts based on the ideal of civic coexistence and the newly awakening nationalism. This is not only happening in the postcommunist world, but also in the Western world. The fact is -- and I also said this in my speech in Bangkok -- that there is some universalist idea in the very foundations of all religions; no hostility is enshrined there against anyone who believes in another god. I spoke about this once in Egypt with President Mubarak who said quite sternly that Islamic fundamentalism is a betrayal of Islam and that it is at variance with all of its original ideals. When all is said and done, we can also see it in Christianity. Fortunately, many centuries have passed since that time -- but terrible genocides were once also perpetrated under the banner of Christianity. [Slezak] I am thinking about other such strange associations: The brutal medieval Japanese samurai took delight in Buddhism and it did not bother them in the least that this benign doctrine forbids the killing of all live beings, including -- naturally -- people.... Since we have moved onto Buddhism: A man -- and especially a very busy man -- often desires the peace and quiet of cloistered seclusion. Do you feel this way? If the answer is yes, would you choose any of the Buddhist monasteries we visited recently for your contemplation? [Havel] My respect for various cultures and their specific traditions and environments does not stretch so far that I would feel the need to adapt to them and turn into someone else. When I want to be alone and think, I am happiest at Hradecek [his country cottage in East Bohemia]. [Slezak] Do you remember what in India and Thailand most surprised you? What most amused you and most disappointed you? [Havel] What surprised me? I was surprised, for example, by the immense interest, warmth, and kindness with which I and our entire delegation were received both in India and Thailand. Let us try to picture this the other way round. Let us imagine that the representative of a small, 10-million strong South Asian state -- a state about which half of our citizens know nothing or even where it is -- comes to our country. I really find it hard to imagine that he would be received with such respect and such interest, not only by the politicians, but also by the public. I knew that these are people who respect their guests. But the level of hospitality really surprised me. I cannot say what amused me, because I could cause a political incident. And what....? [Slezak] Disappointed you. [Havel] What disappointed me... (a 10-second pause; the president is deep in thought) Nothing! [Slezak] Mr. President, thank you for the interview. (The interview was recorded on board the flight from Thailand to Prague. The president looked tired, but he made no reference at all to his rib injury during the 25-minute interview.)
