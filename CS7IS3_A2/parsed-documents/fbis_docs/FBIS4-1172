Fighting is continuing in Kigali, while no progress has been made in Arusha. The meeting between the belligerents announced by the United Nations has still not taken place. Anne Corpet reports: [Corpet] In Arusha, these peace talks are still indeed awaited. They have not been cancelled officially, although the Rwandan Government delegation has not arrived. The Rwandan interior minister is believed to be in Goma, in Zaire, with two army chief officers. A UN plane is ready to take them to Arusha, but the plane has not taken off yet. For its part, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] sent its secretary-general, Theogene Rudasingwa, by land, and we have just heard that he left Arusha this morning. However, he proposed a conditional cease-fire yesterday which would come into force as of tomorrow. [Announcer] Things seem to be even more complicated since another mediation is reported to have taken place or to be taking place in Gbadolite, in Zaire, according to some sources: [Corpet] Yes, it is believed to be taking place in Zaire under the aegis of Marshall Mobutu. The Rwandan ambassador in Belgium has announced that a meeting took place last week between delegations of the RPF and of the Rwandan Government. According to the Rwandan ambassador, the two sides reached an agreement on a text providing for a cease-fire which was supposed to be signed today. The trouble is that the RPF has denied meeting the Rwandan Government and denies the existence of such an agreement. Moreover, the RPF did not attend the meeting which is reported to have been scheduled for today in Zaire to sign the cease-fire. From a diplomatic point of view, confusion has the upper hand, with two negotiation sites and two cease-fire proposals, but no official meeting between the two sides. Meanwhile, on the ground in Rwanda, as you said, fighting is continuing without respite. [passage omitted]
