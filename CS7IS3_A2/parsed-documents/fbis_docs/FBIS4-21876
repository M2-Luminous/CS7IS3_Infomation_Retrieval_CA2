They had been arrested about three weeks ago in the course of a violent demonstration to mark Jerusalem Day held in Ba'labakk, an area under Syrian control in Lebanon. Uri Lubrani, coordinator of government activities in Lebanon, told our correspondent Yoram Kohen that as far as is known this is the first time such an event has occurred. If it is true, Lubrani added, this is a step in the right direction aimed at curbing terror in Lebanon.
