Lambeck: "Resistance Against Scharping Forming in SPD"] [Text] Bonn -- After a meeting of the party's managing board, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping for the third time this week felt compelled to call for unity within his party. This time, his appeal was particularly self-critical and dramatic. The SPD leadership has found "unanimously" that the party has lost the clear lead in voters' support over the past few weeks "also through its own fault." Scharping threatened to tick off critics in public should they blemish the image of party unity in the future. Commenting on statements by Lower Saxony Minister-President Gerhard Schroeder, Scharping said that this reminds him of earlier traditions in the party that have been acted out "ad nauseam" and which "are not very helpful." In an interview Schroeder had said that Scharping should conduct an election campaign against Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union --CDU) instead of fighting with President elect Roman Herzog, or even soccer trainer Berti Vogts. Scharping admitted that the situation "is not as favorable for the SPD as would be desirable." The candidate for chancellor also admitted that he has made mistakes -- thus, he had reacted "angrily" to the election of Union candidate Roman Herzog as president. At the same time, he is convinced that he will win the elections. But in SPD leadership circles, criticism of the SPD election campaign is growing. An increasing number of members speak of a "current low" in voters' support for the party. Critics say, only secretly so far, that Scharping has bad advisers and that his election campaign schedule is far too tight. The candidate's surroundings complain that the press work done for Scharping is lousy. Thus, no one considered it necessary to mention that the SPD chairman spoke before an audience of 30,000 in Dortmund last week. Quote: "The marketing of our top man is simply bad!" The whole campaign is a weak imitation of the Clinton campaign in the United States, without taking into account the fact that the American situation cannot simply be transferred to Germany. Also, it was not realized in time that the motto "Time for a Change" is not very suitable at a time when the German economy is recovering. The same fears have been voiced concerning Gerhard Schroeder and Oskar Lafontaine, SPD economics expert and Scharping deputy. What is striking is that the two minister-presidents, known to be opponents, have been praising each other on several occasions recently. Both officially deny that they doubt the victory of their candidate Scharping. But at the same time the behavior of the two rivals is giving rise to rumors in the SPD. The latest one: If Scharping fails at the October Bundestag elections, Gerhard Schroeder, who will remain in Lower Saxony, wants to become party chairman. Lafontaine, who wants to win a Bundestag seat, is then to become parliamentary group chairman and leader of the opposition. Commentary from the SPD leadership: "Even if the two were planning such a thing, they will then fight in the chair like hell." Critics say that Schroeder and Lafontaine have only one thing in common: "Each of them thinks he is the greatest." Scharping, who is said to be an "extremely hard worker" even by his critics, is meanwhile counting on the elections in Saxony-Anhalt on 26 June. There the SPD quite rightly expects to win a clear victory over the Bonn coalition parties.
