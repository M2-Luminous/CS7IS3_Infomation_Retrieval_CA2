It was also reported that Oleksandr Moroz believed the Black Sea Fleet should be commanded jointly, following NATO's example. The Ukrainian Naval Forces' press center declares that the Black Sea Fleet press center's report grossly distorts the meaning of the statement made by Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman concerning the solution of the Black Sea Fleet issue. In Donetsk Oleksandr Moroz spoke out in favor of setting up a united command of the Ukrainian and Russian fleets on the Black Sea. At the same time he emphasized that "this command should be united, not a joint one." The Ukrainian Naval Forces command believes that the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet thus, mistakes the wish for the reality and reiterates that the negotiating process on the Black Sea Fleet division is continuing at the governmental level at which both sides point out unequivocally that the fleet must be divided.
