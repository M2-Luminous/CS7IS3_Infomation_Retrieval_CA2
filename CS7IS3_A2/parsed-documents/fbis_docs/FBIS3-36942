Our analyst Sorokin comments: As for the world's reaction to the decision taken by the North Atlantic Alliance, some countries support it to a certain extent while others are against, for one Russia. Reports say that President Yeltsin has spoken on the phone with a number of Western politicians and told them that the planned measure was pointless. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has sent a letter to the United Nations warning against serious consequences for NATO's direct meddling into Bosnia's conflict. There are several reasons for Russia's position, which may be grouped in a certain way. The first range of issues refers to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is no evidence so far that it is the Serbs who are responsible for the tragedy that took place in Sarajevo last Saturday. Military experts find it difficult to locate the place from which the fatal mortar blow was made killing 68 people. As for the Serbs, they deny their involvement in the crime and argue that the tragic outcome runs counter to their interests. Such events could only play into the hands of their rivals, the Bosnian Muslims. Therefore, Moscow believes it is necessary to look into what happened first. And the Russian leadership also believes the military operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be stopped by their escalation, that is by resorting to NATO's air strikes. Moreover, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has warned any assault plane will be shot down and UN peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia are jeopardized, though NATO has said that in case they are attacked retaliatory strikes will follow immediately. But in this case Serbia may interfere and the scope of military operations will considerably expand. On 28 June 1914, the heir to the Austrian throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo and that sparked off World War I. The tragedy in Sarajevo on 5 February 1994 could prompt a chain reaction, the tragic outcome of which is difficult to foresee. Russia's negative attitude to the NATO ultimatum determines another set of questions which have a direct bearing on the internal situation in the country. One has to view the historic past in this particular case; as a rule it is closely linked with the present. With Russia it was a tradition to support the Serbs, the ethnic Slav people who are Orthodox Christians. After they suffered a defeat at the battle of Kosovo in 1389, the Serbs came under the rule of the Ottoman empire but they would not accept such a destiny. The Serb uprisings at the beginning of the past century caused wide sympathy among the Russians toward their Slav brothers. There were Russian volunteers among these Serbian rebels. With Russia's active support, Serbia became an autonomous principality in the year 1833, attaining its full independence at the 1878 Berlin Congress. During the Balkan wars earlier this century, Russia took the Serbian side once again, and in World War II the Soviet Army liberated the Serbian territory from the German Fascists together with the Yugoslav People's Army. It goes without saying that the Russian leadership takes into account all these historic facts and circumstances. It is also forced to account for the opinions of members of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, which is clearly dominated by the pro-Serbian majority. It is not Vladimir Zhirinovskiy alone who counts in this case. He is trying to stake on the Serbs in his own political interests. A political settlement that will fully meet the Serbs' interests is actively sought not only by Russia's political elite but wide sections of the Russian public as well. Generally speaking, Moscow is no less than others interested in halting the Bosnian tragedy that has already lasted for two years. But to attain this goal one needs to resort to different policies which will break the deadlock of the problems that are at issue. This is the standpoint Moscow shares. A force policy by the NATO alliance can hardly help resolve this issue.
