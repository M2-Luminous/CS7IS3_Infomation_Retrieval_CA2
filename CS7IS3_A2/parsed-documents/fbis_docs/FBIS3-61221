According to Mr. Vagnorius, the leader of the Conservative Party, refusals to make an official request for Lithuania's membership in NATO and attempts to negotiate with Russia over military transit are the most scandalous facts in Lithuanian foreign policy this year. He also sharply criticized Chairman of the Parliament, Ceslovas Jursenas, who said that NATO membership would limit Lithuania's sovereignty and who indicated the need to hold a referendum on the issue.
