The same thing is happening with money in circulation, which is increasing by more than 35 percent. Fenalco [National Federation of Businessmen] warned of the serious risk of a new heating up of inflation during the coming months as a consequence of the increase in the amount of money in circulation, the rates charged for services provided by the state, and the obligations imposed by the social security reform. "Realistically, it seems likely that in 1994 the IPC [Consumer Price Index] will have a higher rate of increase because of a number of factors," said a Fenalco statement. In its end-of-the-year report, Fenalco maintains that inflation's downward trend is still far from certain. "If foods are excluded, the annualized inflation rate remains at 27 percent." According to Fenalco, the prices of goods and services provided by the state continue to rise sharply. In addition, money in circulation is increasing by over 35 percent. The business association also cites the fiscal deficit and the rise in public spending as causes of inflation, along with labor costs created by the social security reform, which readjusts the payments that businesses and users must make to the ISS [Social Security Institute]. "Fenalco cannot be as optimistic about inflation in 1994 as the government is." No Slowdown in Trade Liberalization Fenalco said that a too great delay of trade liberalization would be a historic error on the part of the next president of Colombia. This process has become essential for the nation's progress in the next century, if it wants to move ahead of the group of medium- and lower-income countries. Another immediate challenge, says Fenalco, is stabilizing the economy to bring the annual inflation rate down to one-digit levels within a maximum of three or four years. According to the business group, the next government cannot continue the policy of excessive, deficit-based public spending, nor can it slacken in the area of monetary discipline. The report adds that accelerating devaluation to stimulate exports "is not a consistent and serious policy." Concerning foreign investment in Colombia, Fenalco's president, Sabas Pretel de la Vega, said that although Pablo Escobar's death has created a better environment, Colombia still has many weaknesses and risks that deter foreign investment. The association report includes numbers on business growth. According to these statistics, during the first eight months of 1993 retail sales rose 3.8 percent. Although automotive sales have increased, sales of imported vehicles declined during the last two months of 1993, as the dealers waited for next year's new models.
