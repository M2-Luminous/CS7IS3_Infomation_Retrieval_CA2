This will be the first high-level contact between Havana and the government of Phnom Penh which was elected last year under UN auspices. The Cuban minister will meet with his Cambodian counterpart, Norodom Sirivuth, who will welcome him officially at the capital city airport of Pochentong. Sirivuth is the younger brother of King Norodom Sihanouk. Sirivuth will attend to the visiting delegation in his capacity as acting head of government in the absence of Prime Ministers Norodom Ranarith and Hun Sen, who are abroad. Robaina will also be greeted during a special audience with Chea Sim, the acting head of state and president of the National Assembly, who has for the past months represented Sihanouk, who is receiving medical treatment in China. Before heading for Phnom Penh, the head of Cuban diplomacy visited Indonesia, where he started his tour, Laos, and Myanmar [Burma], and he made a stopover in Thailand's capital, Bangkok. His next destinations are India, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba has found new possibilities for exchanges and communication with the countries that he visited. He added that the hosts voiced their interest and desire to negotiate with Havana in the areas of health, biotechnology, and sports, among others. In his opinion, Cuba must study the economic explosion experienced by this region and determine what is most applicable to its own situation. The most important aspect of this tour, Robaina pointed out, is the degree of understanding and the opportunities we have found to explain the true reality of the Cuban project.
