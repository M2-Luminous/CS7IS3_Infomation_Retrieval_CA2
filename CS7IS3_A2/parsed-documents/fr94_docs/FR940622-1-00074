FR940622-1-00074 FR940622-1-00029 The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol ``§'' and a numbered heading, for example, §674.4 Allocation and reallocation .) (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW. (Room 5125, FOB&hyph;6), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities affected by these proposed regulations are small institutions of postsecondary education. The changes in these regulations will not substantially increase institutions' workload or costs associated with administering the title IV, HEA programs and, therefore, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
