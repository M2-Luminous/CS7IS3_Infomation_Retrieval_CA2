The formal inclusion of these nations occurred at the 27th General Assembly of the organization held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Important Colombian businessmen, accompanied by Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos, attended the meeting. "This is an important step in our policy of diversifying outside the Paris-London-New York axis and getting closer to the most dynamic region of the world and the one with the brightest future," Santos said. The PBEC is an organization that includes important businessmen from Asia, Canada, United States, Mexico, and Chile and whose goal is to expand the trading borders of PBEC member countries. This organization is different from the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (known by the English acronym PECC), which is a governmental institution that Colombia joined last March. "The opportunities opened for the Colombian private sector are immense because here we are dealing with the big leagues," said Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Santa Fe de Bogota. Meanwhile, Fernando Urrea, executive of the Colombian Leonisa Company and member of the Colombian delegation, said that "at forums such as this one, we realize the valuable opportunities that we businessmen have at our disposal to broaden our markets and also realize that we must seek markets abroad instead of waiting for them to come by the grace of God." Colombia, Very Attractive Minister Juan Manuel Santos was invited to the General Assembly's plenary session in his capacity as presidential designate, along with the prime ministers of Malaysia and Vietnam. In his speech, Santos explained the opportunities offered by the Colombian economy and the privileged access to international markets it has achieved through its integration policy. "Colombia has become one of the most attractive houses in a neighborhood that is becoming more interesting by the day to foreign investment," the Colombian minister said in reference to the nation's prominent position in Latin America. He mentioned the struggle against drug trafficking that the country has waged in the past years and requested greater international cooperation for this battle. "We have lost our most prominent politicians, our most honest judges, our most courageous officers, and our best journalists, and this great sacrifice has only reinforced our determination to eradicate this scourge," he added. Colombia's interest in joining the PBEC lies in the growing importance of the area in the world economy. The 19 countries that make up the PBEC produced 50 percent of world GNP in 1993 and registered an average growth rate of 3.7 percent. It is expected that by the end of this decade these economies will grow by more than $5 trillion, that is, more than one third of the world's growth up to the year 2000. The PBEC is made up of: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Chile, China, Korea, the United States, Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan.
