Dienstbier, foreign minister from December 1989 until June 1992, told journalists that at the time when he was a Czechoslovak cabinet member, the possibility of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons being stored on Czechoslovak territory was investigated. "The Army had revised these things and.... as far as I know nothing was found," Dienstbier said. Petr Pithart, Czech premier from February 1990 until June 1992, told CTK that "he had no idea" about biological weapons being stored in the Czech Republic. He added, however, that the army was not within the jurisdiction of the Czech Government. He said it could have happened that "something was forgotten somewhere" but the question could not be linked to political motifs. Some Czech papers reported on Thursday [17 March] and today that Czechoslovakia was charged with developing bacteriological weapons in the framework of the former Warsaw Pact. A secret branch of the Military Research Institute located in the vicinity of the village of Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains, east Bohemia, allegedly served this goal. The cultures of bacteria and viruses developed there were allegedly hidden at different place in the Czech Republic. According to press reports, this would mean not only violation of the Czech Republic's international commitments since it is a signatory of the Geneva Convention whose members had pledged not to develop, use or store biological weapons without international consent, but also crime threatening the public. Chairman of the Czech Parliament's Defense and Security Committee Vladimir Suman has asked Defense Minister Antonin Baudys on Thursday to inform the committee about the alleged storage of bacteriological and virological weapons in the Czech Republic on April 7. Suman told journalists this today at a press conference of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of which he is a member.
