He pointed out that he had met with the UN secretary general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to discuss this issue and added that the contacts that Egypt is conducting seek a cease-fire agreement. The foreign minister continued: "We have not lost hope of reaching a cease-fire agreement." He said that the Yemeni issue is "complicated and requires great efforts." Musa added that a big gap still separates the positions of the warring Yemeni parties and there are several reasons that still preclude an agreement. He said this requires further efforts by Egypt and the United Nations to reach a solution. Musa said he hopes the fighting in Yemen will not escalate in such a way as to harm the prospects of "achieving a breakthrough rather than complicating the matter further". Noting the need to protect the Yemeni citizens in various towns, he said current efforts are concentrating on ending the fighting, and Egypt is contacting the United Nations and other parties for this purpose.
