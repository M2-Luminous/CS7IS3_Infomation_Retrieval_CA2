The Board is required to meet prior to September 20 of each marketing year to compute an inshell trade demand and preliminary free and restricted percentages, if the use of volume regulation is recommended during the season. The order prescribes formulas for computing the inshell trade demand, as well as preliminary, interim final, and final percentages. The inshell trade demand establishes the amount of inshell filberts/hazelnuts the market can utilize throughout the season, and the percentages release the volume of filberts/hazelnuts necessary to meet the inshell trade demand. The preliminary percentages provide for the release of 80 percent of the inshell trade demand. The interim final percentages release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand. The inshell trade demand equals the average of the preceding three ``normal'' years' trade acquisitions of inshell filberts/hazelnuts, rounded to the nearest whole number. The Board may increase such estimate by no more than 25 percent, if market conditions warrant an increase. The final free and restricted percentages release an additional 15 percent of the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions of inshell filberts/hazelnuts for desirable carryout. The preliminary free and restricted percentages make available portions of the filbert/hazelnut crop which may be marketed in domestic inshell markets (free) and exported, shelled, or otherwise disposed of (restricted) early in the 1993&hyph;94 season. The preliminary free percentage is expressed as a percentage of the total supply subject to regulation and is based on preliminary crop estimates. The majority of domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts are marketed in October, November, and December. By November, the marketing season is well under way. At its August 26, 1993, meeting, the Board announced preliminary free and restricted percentages of 7 percent and 93 percent, respectively, to release 80 percent of the inshell trade demand. The purpose of releasing only 80 percent of the inshell trade demand under the preliminary percentage is to guard against underestimates of crop size. The preliminary restricted percentage is 100 percent minus the free percentage. On or before November 15, the Board must meet again to recommend interim final percentages and final percentages. The Board uses current crop estimates to calculate the interim final and final percentages. The interim final percentages are calculated in the same way as the preliminary percentages and release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand previously computed by the Board for the marketing year. Final free and restricted percentages release an additional 15 percent of the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions to ensure an adequate carryover into the following season. The final free and restricted percentages must be effective at least 30 days prior to the end of the marketing year (July 1 through June 30), or earlier, if recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary. In addition, revisions in the marketing policy can be made until February 15 of each marketing year. In accordance with order provisions, the Board met on November 10, 1993, reviewed and approved an amended marketing policy and recommended the establishment of interim final and final free and restricted percentages. Interim final percentages were recommended at 12 percent free and 88 percent restricted, and final free and restricted percentages were recommended at 13 percent and 87 percent. The interim final percentages made an additional 807 tons of product available for the domestic inshell market. The interim final marketing percentages were based on the industry's final production estimates and released 3,903 tons to the domestic inshell market from the 1993 crop. The final marketing percentages released an additional 605 tons from the 1993 crop for domestic use. Thus, a total of 4,508 tons of product was available from the 1993 crop for domestic use when the final percentages were established. The Oregon Agricultural Statistics Service provided an early estimate of 39,000 tons total production for the Oregon and Washington area. However, a handler survey conducted by the Board provided a more current estimate of 37,700 tons total production for the area. Therefore, the Board voted to unanimously accept the more current estimate of 37,700 tons. Although the crop is large, the Board determined that the inshell domestic market conditions would allow more product without depressing the market and recommended immediate release of the additional 15 percent (the final percentages). The Board believed that the immediate release of the final percentages would benefit the industry with increased returns to growers and more product available for consumers.
