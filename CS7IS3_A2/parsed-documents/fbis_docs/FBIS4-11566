FBIS4-11566 "drlat083_c_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 MEXICO Government Grants Temporary Visas To Cubans Government Grants Temporary Visas To Cubans PA2804170094 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO In Spanish 25 Apr 94 p 90 PA2804170094 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO In Spanish 25 Apr 94 p 90 BFN [Excerpt] Cancun, QR [Quintana Roo], 24 Apr -- The Mexican Government has decided to grant temporary, 180-day visas to the Cuban boat people who arrived in national territory, as a "general measure" to halt problems that may stem from the wave of Cubans trying to seek asylum in the United States. Jorge Mendoza Garza, coordinator of supervision and operations control of the National Migration Institute [INM], said here the 85 boat people who arrived at Isla Mujeres at dawn on 11 April are the first Cubans to benefit from this measure. Mendoza was in charge of transporting the boat people via chartered plane to Mexico City today. The official said that after verifying that the boat the boat people were planning to use to reach Miami "failed to meet specified international security standards," these Cubans were convinced to go to Mexico City "where they can probably expedite procedures to enter the United States legally." The Cubans voiced their doubts, however, that Mexican authorities are trying to repatriate them in light of the 23 April incident, which occurred 13 km off the coast of Isla Mujeres whereby 62 boat people evaded the Mexican Army, trying to reach international waters on board the boat that brought them from the Cayman Islands, the Ferro 25. The Mexican Army deployed two frigates to intercept the deserters of the Fidel Castro government. One of the frigates, the "Chontal," rammed the middle of the Cuban boat. Carlos Avila, one of the boat people who, as he said, "unintentionally" became the group's spokesman, said "the boat was damaged after we were hosed with water cannons." During the operation, three Cubans were injured, one of them in the ribs, but Jaime Machorro Musalem, Yucatan Peninsula Migration representative, has insisted that the boat people had minor bruises and that no seriously injured Cuban traveled to Mexico City. The Cubans left for Mexico City from the local airport at 1720 sharp on a chartered Boeing 727-200, plate registration XA-TCX, owned by the Allegro Charter Company. Meanwhile, another boat with 96 Cubans on board was on its way to Cozumel, presumably to be transported to Mexico City in the same plane on 25 April. Meanwhile, many relatives of the boat people in Miami have contacted news correspondents and the local media to inform them they would protest abuses to which the Mexican Army allegedly subjected the boat people. Machorro refused to confirm these allegations, but he underscored immigration authorities had nothing to do with the operation "because there are no formal relations between the Navy [as published] and the INM." He added that for the time being, these institutions are addressing the problem "only as far as they are concerned." [passage omitted]
