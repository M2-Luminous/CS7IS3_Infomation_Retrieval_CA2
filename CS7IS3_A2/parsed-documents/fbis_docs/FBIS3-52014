Having points in common does not mean a lack of disagreements. It is along those basic lines, among others, that Brazilian foreign policy is being consolidated once again, under Itamar Franco's administration, in a clear, cooperative, and independent manner. Ambassador Celso Amorim has been in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since June, first as secretary general and then as minister. He is the main architect of that consolidation--a task involving bilateral relations, regional efforts, and Brazil's participation in such wider forums as GATT or the UN Security Council. Here is a look back at the year as seen by Celso Amorim. [Recena] Mr. Minister, what do you consider the chief events of this year? [Amorim] I will begin by emphasizing the idea, first brought up by the president of the republic, of a free trade area in South America--an idea that we are exploring bilaterally and within Mercosur [Common Market of the South]--and I hope it will become stronger. There are no new developments to mention, but I hope that the idea will soon take on a more definite shape. [Recena] What about Mercosur? [Amorim] Well, the final evaluation will have to be made next year when the presidents meet in Uruguay on 17 January, but intense negotiations have continued within Mercosur, and it is expected that Brazil and Argentina will overcome the difficulties that have arisen, especially as regards the Common External Tariff. The negotiations are not easy, but they are continuing to make progress. As I have been saying, we are reaching the moment of truth on several points--in sensitive areas affecting not only us--where Brazil is not the only one with protectionist interests. All four countries have specific interests, and this is now becoming increasingly clear. That is why we are entering a period of intense negotiations that will extend beyond the meeting by the presidents, but the presidents may be able to use the progress to date to lay down clearer parameters. [Recena] Do you want to single out anything particular on the subject of Argentina? [Amorim] Concerning Argentina, I would like to single out the recent meeting in Sao Paulo between the ministers of finance and foreign affairs of both countries. Brazil was also represented by the minister of industry and commerce. It was a meeting at which we were able to get negotiations moving again. I also regard as very important the visit by Minister of Foreign Affairs Guido Di Tella to the INPE [National Institute of Space Research] and the CIA. It was important as a demonstration of our exclusively peaceful intentions. [Recena] Beyond the regional realm, what was the most important event? [Amorim] It was undoubtedly the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. That was the most important international event from the standpoint of economic and even political relations, which needed a balanced solution from that round. We are pleased that the Uruguay Round has been completed. Obviously, it was not ideal--it did not give us everything we wanted--but important progress was made as regards market access: the average reduction on the part of the developed countries was on the order of 38 percent, and that will mean greater access for Brazilian products. It also marks the start of a reduction in farm subsidies, and while modest, that reduction is sizable and will bring benefits. In addition, there is GATT's role in laying down rules, another area in which considerable progress was made. Establishment of the World Trade Organization was another very important advance, since that institution will be able to actually regulate international trade. Brazil participated actively in those negotiations. [Recena] What did its participation consist of? [Amorim] There were seven years of hard work, and we made a very big contribution. It is good for Brazil that the agreement in question was possible. It is important to emphasize that the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs consistently conducted those negotiations in an efficient manner with the cooperation of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, and Industry and Commerce. I feel that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be given credit for the coordination effort: the effort to conduct those negotiations, which were the most complex negotiations to date in the field of trade and economy. [Recena] What were relations with the United States like in 1993? [Amorim] I have just returned from a visit to the United States. It was a short visit but one involving a lot of work. I met with many officials, among them Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the White House security adviser, Anthony Lake. I have heard many favorable comments about that visit. I took the opportunity it provided to present the Brazilian viewpoint with great frankness, stressing something that was not being sufficiently emphasized: the fact that our points of agreement are much greater than our disagreements. But public opinion in both countries and even some government circles focus more strongly on the disagreements. It may be natural to do so, but it is not right, because then the focus is on 5 percent of the issues at most and ignores the fact that we agree on the other 95 percent. [Recena] How did you approach that subject? [Amorim] The message that I tried to convey, and I think it was well received, well understood, and accepted, was this: precisely because Brazil is a country with its own specific characteristics and the same basic principles as those guiding U.S. society--democracy, a market economy, and respect for human rights--well, at the same time that we have those things in common, we also hold different views on various subjects. And a good partner is not one that reflects the other. A good partner is the one that is in a position to disagree and engage in dialogue in the search for a joint solution. I cited a few examples of that: our profitable coordination in the Security Council, including the time during Ambassador Ronaldo Sardemberg's presidency, and our action at the Human Rights Conference, at which Brazil, precisely because of its special characteristics, played a fundamental role in ensuring the success of that conference and managed to conclude a negotiation that had seemed impossible of solution because of the disagreements among the Asian, African, and Western blocs. That message was very well received and very well understood, and during meetings at the White House, they asked for Brazilian suggestions regarding the hemispheric conference recently proposed by Vice President Al Gore. [Recena] What is the greatest difficulty in those relations? [Amorim] The issue of industrial property, which I also brought up during my visit. I explained that we expect to find a satisfactory solution. Brazil has been acting constructively while listening, of course, to the National Congress. They need to understand that--the fact that there are diverse sectors in Brazilian society, just as there are in U.S. society. It would be a political mistake jeopardizing the mature partnership we already have if some kind of unilateral measure were adopted this coming February. I have greater hopes following the Uruguay Round, whose agreement as approved also deals with the issue of intellectual property. [Recena] What is your expectation? [Amorim] It is very optimistic. And also because our relationship with the United States is symbolic of the integration we want to have with the other developed countries. I am scheduled to visit Germany and France, where I intend to talk along that same line: about cooperation while always respecting each country's special characteristics. [Recena] Portugal: you were there recently. How was it? [Amorim] It was an extremely productive visit. At the bilateral level, we had a frank discussion of the opportunities and problems, including the question of Brazilian members of the liberal professions practicing in Portugal. A task force will start dealing with that issue in January. At the start of February, we will be visited by Minister Durao Barroso. There is also the possibility of a bilateral presidential summit meeting during the first half of the year. Apart from bilateral matters, I want to mention Portugal's sincere support for the Brazilian idea of forming a Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. I would very much like to hold meetings by the foreign ministers of those seven countries in Brasilia and Lisbon before this year is over, at which time we would lay the foundations for that community. [Recena] In the domestic area, what subjects are of concern to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? [Amorim] We are assigning great importance to ratification by Congress of the various agreements we have in the nuclear area. Those agreements were approved by the Chamber of Deputies in September, and we are confident that it will be possible to get them approved by the Senate as well before the year is over or as soon after that as possible. This is important in order to show the world clearly that Brazil is pursuing exclusively peaceful objectives in its economic and technological development, and we will then be in a better position to play an active role as regards the supplying of advanced technologies. [Recena] The president of Communist China was in Brazil. What has changed? [Amorim] It was an extremely important visit and one that will be repaid by our president in the coming year [1994]. We intend to send missions to the Asian countries. Thailand's minister of foreign affairs will visit Brazil in the near future. We are going to open an embassy in Vietnam. We were also visited by the president of Guyana, and I have just made a visit to Colombia--proof in both cases that we are seeking complete integration in the region. [Recena] What about East Europe and Russia? [Amorim] There was the visit by Minister Andrade Vieira, who signed a very important protocol, and various sectors in the government and in private enterprise are thinking of that big market. These are visits which mobilize and bring about positive reactions. I would also like to emphasize the decision by the president of the republic to open an embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. [Recena] In conclusion.... [Amorim] In conclusion, I would like to announce that next year we are going to give a great deal of attention to making Brazilian culture known abroad. It is through culture that we will be able to present a good image of Brazil abroad. And a good image of Brazilian culture has very big effects. Our culture is very rich and attractive; it arouses the interest and attention of other countries naturally. It is a very important factor in promoting investments and trade. We will certainly be able to carry out important projects in this area in the new year.
