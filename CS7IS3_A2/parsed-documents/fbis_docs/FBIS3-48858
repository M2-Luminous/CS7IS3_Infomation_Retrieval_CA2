The lengthy treatise underlines the significance of the inauguration of the society for the study of works of Kim Chong-il and its strengthening and development. The treatise consists of "1. President Kim Il-song who has built anthropocentric socialism", "2. Question of succeeding to revolution is key to ultimate victory of socialism", "3. Characteristics of Secretary Kim Chong-il in ideology and theory, exploits and humanity" and "4. Towards inauguration of national organization of societies for the study of works of Kim Chong-il." In the first part, the treatise points out that President Kim Il-song has founded the chuche idea, a new revolutionary idea, with the popular masses, the subject of socio-historical development and revolutionary movement, as the main, in a new historical atmosphere in which the independence of the popular masses has been strengthened and the world revolutionary movement waged on an independent basis in the 20th century. The building of anthropocentric socialism in Korea, the first of its kind in history, embodying the chuche idea is the greatest exploit performed by President Kim Il-song for human history. It says: Despite the vicious offensives and slanders of the imperialists and reactionaries, President Kim Il-song has pushed aside all difficulties, built socialism centred on the masses, the only in the world, at an Asian corner and is maintaining and developing it with pride. However vicious the offensives and slanders of the imperialists and reactionaries may be, Korean-style socialism centred on the masses will never be collapsed. Because socialism of Korea has struck deep roots among the popular masses. In the second part, the treatise points out that the question of succeeding to revolution is the key to the ultimate victory of socialism and that it is not too much to say that all socialist countries except Korea have failed in the question of succeeding to revolution and the question of a successor. It is of universal significance that Secretary Kim Chong-il has emerged as a successor to the revolution who is carrying forward and developing the leadership of President Kim Il-song, the treatise says, and adds: The right settlement of the question of succeeding to the revolution and the question of a successor for the first time in Korea not only provides a guarantee for the ultimate victory of the Korean revolution but also opens a bright future ahead of the revolutionary struggle of all countries. In the third part, the treatise refers to the characteristics of ideology and theory, exploits and humanity of secretary Kim Chong-il. One of the exploits of Secretary Kim Chong-il in ideology and theory is that he has systematized and formularized the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il-song. He formularized the revolutionary idea of the president as Kimilsongism, an integrated system of the ideology, theory and method of the chuche idea, on the basis of his deep study of the basic principle and the quintessence of the chuche idea created by President Kim Il-song and on the philosophical principle of the chuche idea. The ideology, the theory and the method are components of Kimilsongism. The ideology systematizes the independent demand of mankind, the theory gives a systematic exposition of the prospect, ways and tasks to realize the independent demand of the masses and the method systematizes the method of guidance to awaken, organize and powerfully arouse the masses in the revolutionary struggle. What is important in the ideological and theoretical contents of the chuche idea enriched by Secretary Kim Chong-il is that he has developed the chuche idea on a philosophical principle, clarified the superiority of socialism to capitalism in an all-round way and elucidated the law of social development on the basis of the intrinsic demand of mankind. The ideological and theoretical exploits of Secretary Kim Chong-il lie in that he has made the masses accept the chuche idea as their own. A great exploit of Secretary Kim Chong-il as a leader of the revolution is that he has strengthened the party and enhanced its leadership role so as to bring the creativity of the masses into full play. The principle maintained by Secretary Kim Chong-il in strengthening the party and enhancing its leadership role is to establish the party's leadership system to the letter and direct big efforts to the ideological education in the party's activities after advancing an ideological theory. What is outstanding in many exploits accomplished by Secretary Kim Chong-il is that he has turned the whole society into socio-political organism with the leader, the party and the masses united as one. Korea's is a society of an integral whole rallied firm around President Kim Il-song and Secretary Kim Chong-il. The party finds itself among the masses and devotedly works for them holding aloft the slogan "We serve the people!" The masses accept the tasks set forth by the party as their vital demand and carry them through unconditionally under the slogan "When the party is determined we can do anything". Through the social realities of Korea we can see the most solid unity of collectives formed by human beings. The high quality of humanity of Secretary Kim Chong-il as an illustrious leader is infinite loyalty and devotion to the leader and the party, the revolution and the people, stronger sense of respect for the revolutionary seniors than others' and boundless love for the comrades and the people. All the activities of Secretary Kim Chong-il are characterized by politics of love and trust. "Belief in people as in heaven": To regard the people as the heaven was the motto of President Kim Il-song, while Secretary Kim Chong-il has respected the people as the greatest and takes it as his creed to regard them as the heaven. As the Korean people actually feel that Secretary Kim Chong-il who is devotedly working for the people is, indeed, a genuine leader of the people, they hold him in high esteem on the basis of their faith and will. In the fourth part, the treatise points to the tasks to firmly build up and expand the organization of the societies for the study of works of Kim Chong-il in an organizational and ideological way. The world will, in the future, usher in a new era when the chuche idea is applied in an all-round way and brought into full play under the guidance of Secretary Kim Chong-il. Without learning from Secretary Kim Chong-il it is impossible to look forward into a new era of mankind. It is necessary to push ahead with the work of studying and disseminating the chuche idea with a bright prospect for the future and a clear cut method to shape it out, deeply learning from the ideology and theory, exploits and humanity of Secretary Kim Chong-il. On the basis of the achievements we the entire members of the society will inaugurate the national organization of the societies for the study of works of Kim Chong-il on the occasion of the February 16, 1994, the 52nd birthday of secretary Kim Chong-il by vigorously pushing on with the work to inaugurate the society for the study of works of Kim Chong-il in all regions and among the people of various strata. The inauguration of the national organization of the societies for the study of works of Kim Chong-il will be a turning point in exerting a big ideological influence on the activities of studying and disseminating the chuche idea in Japan and the social movement as a whole and serve as a banner showing how the study and dissemination of the chuche idea will be conducted in the world.
