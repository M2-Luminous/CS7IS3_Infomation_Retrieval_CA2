The first thing they noticed was that Russia is striving for a colossal arms market. Kuwait, which intends to spend approximately $12 billion over 10 years on acquiring weapons, really does represent a highly favorable trading partner. Well, it would be the height of hypocrisy to deny that Russia is motivated exclusively by altruism [sentence as published]. The Arab East is of definite interest to us also from the viewpoint of replenishing our more than meager currency reserves. Particularly since it seems that we will not receive any palpable aid from the West. The fears of the United States, Britain, and France, which have taken up key positions on the arms markets, about a possible Russian breakthrough into this territory are indeed understandable. It seems to me that the chief thing is not only and not so much the financial opportunities which the arms trade promises as the fact that Russia is at last starting to aspire to (or, at any rate, is making a serious bid for) the role of one of the guarantors of the security system in a very difficult region of the globe. At the same time, Russia is also taking care of its own interests. If only because of our geographic proximity to the southern borders of the CIS, there exists a real danger of the spread, or "overflowing," of instability across our borders. To be more precise, the simple configuration of the potentials for conflict in the Caucasus (the "Caucasian knot") and in the Persian Gulf region could produce a totally different quality of confrontation in this segment of the "arc of crises." Moscow has a vital interest in preserving peace and stability in this region also because the Gulf zone is the source of such terrible dangers as narcotics trafficking, an uncontrolled arms trade, and so-called extraterritorial threats. Finally, some states are drawing up ambitious plans to create weapons of mass destruction. Their possible use close to the borders of Russia and the CIS is fraught with very unpredictable consequences. Moreover, from the military viewpoint the presence of unfriendly forces in the region could in time become a lever to exert pressure on our country. In our view Saudi Arabia can be the main link in the system of security in the Persian Gulf region. Whereas prior to the war in the Persian Gulf the balance of power here was maintained chiefly thanks to the Iranian-Iraqi standoff, now there is hidden, indistinct rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, who for a long time preferred to act exclusively by peaceful means, have decided to try independently to create armed forces capable of responding to any regional challenge to their security. The bitter experience of proximity to such dangerous countries as Iraq and, to some extent, Iran has made Riyadh make substantial corrections to its defense concept. In practice this has resulted in huge military purchases thanks to which Riyadh has become the world's biggest arms importer. It accounts for more than one-third of all the arms supplied to the third world. The Saudis should not, however, be condemned for overmilitarization. They have something to defend and the right to defend it. Particularly as the arms being acquired and the building of the army are aimed not at expansion (the Saudis have no need of other people's property -- they have more than enough of their own) but defense. Once bitten, twice shy. Of course, the growth in the strength of the Saudi Army's armed forces is limited by the country's total human resources, which are comparable with Iraq's but considerably inferior to Iran's. In addition, Saudi generals have no experience of waging combat operations. In practical terms, the army has not come under fire. It will take many years to create really battleworthy armed forces. No wonder, in this connection, that the Saudis' defensive concept is geared above all to support from the U.S. armed forces. Of course, Riyadh's close ties with Washington determine a certain regional preponderance of forces in favor of the United States. Therefore Russia's more active -- to one degree or another -- participation in the regional security system would meet Moscow's interests. But this is not the only reason. Riyadh, being the official custodian of the chief Islamic holy places in Mecca and Medina, is opposed to religious extremism in politics. Possessing indisputable authority in the world of Islam, it could also play a more active role in settling local conflicts on CIS territory, particularly in the so-called new Muslim states. I believe that these arguments will suffice to acknowledge Russia's right to be concerned about peace and security in the Arab East.
