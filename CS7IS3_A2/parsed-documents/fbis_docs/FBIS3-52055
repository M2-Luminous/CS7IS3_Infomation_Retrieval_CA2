Sources close to the president told PRENSA LATINA that the president decided a few hours ago to cancel his trip to Lima, Peru, and that -- for the time being -- no date has been set for his meeting with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes recently said that Duran-Ballen's trip to Lima was subject to some diplomatic details that were being worked out, inasmuch as this was a very complex trip because the topics to be discussed were very delicate. One week ago, Fujimori told Ecuadoran newsmen that he was waiting for Duran-Ballen with open arms, but only to discuss topics on integration and economic cooperation and that he would not talk about the so-called "border conflict." Diplomatic sources feel the Peruvian president's remarks and negative reaction from various public sectors prompted the Ecuadoran president to cancel his trip.
