At the centre of the debate lay the research and development into more effective, less vulnerable and especially less expensive photovoltaic cells. Around 600 projects of concrete application of solar energy were presented in Amsterdam; the European Commission presented, notably, the efforts it had made in the field through the THERMIE programme (and THERMIE II has just been proposed by the Commission, see yesterday's EUROPE, p.8). The European Commission will continue to support the development of renewable energies, said the Commission's representatives in Amsterdam: in the 4th Research Framework-Programme (1995-98) over Ecu 1 billion is provided for research, development and demonstration programmes into non-nuclear energy, of which 60% into renewable energy sources. Hendrik Tent of the Commission's DG XII, said that a large part of these funds would be used for developing photovoltaic solar energy. Wolfgang Palz (DG [Directorate General] XII), moreover, announced that the European Commission intended to present a new programme soon entitled "Power for the World", whose aim will mainly be to support the implementation of photovoltaic solar energy projects in countries of the Third World. In this context, the Conference criticized the loan policy of multilateral financing organizations towards Third World countries for relying too heavily on the extension of large conventional energy production and grid connections, without taking account of ecological difficulties, the enormous cost of infrastructures, etc. in these countries. Funds would be better used for energy generated decentrally and distributed independently: photovoltaic solar energy is considered to be a more suitable solution, most agreed. "The efforts of the European Union and its Member States are not enough", said the president of the European Association for Solar Energy (EUROSOLAR), Herman Scheer, deploring the fact that nuclear energy still occupied a privileged place compared to alternative energies where Community funding was concerned. The current President of the Environmental Council of the European Union, Greek Minister Elisabeth Papazoi deplored the fact that solar energy was encouraged so little: "Everyone knows the answer, but no one wants to give it. Everyone wants solar energy, but only a few are engaged. Most agree that renewable energy deserves more money, but funding is insignificant". The Netherlands' Economic Minister, Dr. J.E. Andriessen, stressed the great ecological advantage of renewable energy in which production is not accompanied by carbon dioxide emissions or other polluting gasses. If converting solar energy into electricity is still too expensive to be applied on a wide scale, it should, after the year 2010, be the most widespread form of renewable energy in the world, said Mr. Andriessen. The Netherlands currently produces 1,000 kilowatts in photovoltaic solar energy; in 2010, it ought to produce 250 megawatts, he estimated. On the fringe of the Conference, the Becquerel Award was attributed to the American scientist Morton B. Price for his work and in particular for the invention of the first cell with a 10% yield in 1954 and the Bell solar battery. EUROPE recalls that the Becquerel Award has been awarded by the Commission since 1989 to a person having contributed in an extraordinary way to developing photovoltaic solar energy.
