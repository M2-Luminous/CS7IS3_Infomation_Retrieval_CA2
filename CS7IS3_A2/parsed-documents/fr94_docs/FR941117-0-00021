FR941117-0-00021 FR941117-0-00005 5. ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(C), An Operator's Obligation to Reimburse the Department for the Cost of the Services Rendered under SOAP Arkansas proposed a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(C) that requires a coal operator that has received assistance under SOAP to reimburse the State for the cost of the services rendered if Arkansas finds that the operator's actual and attributed annual production of coal for all locations exceeds 300,000 tons during the 12 months immediately following the date on which the operator is issued the surface coal mining and reclamation permit. Proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(C) is substantively identical to section 507(h) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds that proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(C) is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA, and approves it. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Following are summaries of all substantive written comments on the proposed amendment that were received by OSM, and OSM's responses to them. 1. Public Comments OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment, but none were received (administrative record Nos. AR&hyph;507, AR&hyph;513, and AR&hyph;525. 2.
