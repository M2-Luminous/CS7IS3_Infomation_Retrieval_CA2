FR940506-2-00027 FR940506-2-00013 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [I.D. 040494B] Sea Turtle Conservation; Shrimp Trawling Requirements AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement; request for scoping comments. SUMMARY: NMFS announces its intention to prepare a proposed rule pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that would amend NMFS' regulations relating to endangered and threatened species of sea turtles. The purpose of this notice is to alert the interested public of the commencement of a scoping process and to provide for public participation in the preparation of the environmental impact statement (EIS) as required by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). DATES: Written comments will be accepted by NMFS until June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this notice should be addressed to William W. Fox, Jr., Ph.D., Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD, 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Phil Williams, Acting Chief, Endangered Species Division, (301) 713&hyph;2319; Doug Beach, Protected Species Program Coordinator, NMFS Northeast Regional Office, (508) 281&hyph;9254; or Charles A. Oravetz, Chief, Protected Species Program, NMFS Southeast Regional Office, (813) 893&hyph;3366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background All sea turtles that occur in U.S. waters are listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. Kemp's ridley ( Lepidochelys kempii ), leatherback ( Dermochelys coriacea ) and hawksbill ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) turtles are listed as endangered. Loggerhead ( Caretta caretta ), green ( Chelonia mydas ) and olive ridley ( Lepidochelys olivacea ) turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding populations of green turtles in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and the breeding population of olive ridley turtles on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which are listed as endangered. In 1990, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) completed a review of the biology of sea turtles, and the causes and significance of their decline. The NAS concluded that incidental capture in shrimp trawls without turtle excluder devices (TEDs) is by far the leading cause of human-induced mortality to sea turtles at sea, but collectively, the activities in the non-shrimp fisheries constitute the second largest source of mortality. The study identified finfish trawls, seine nets, pompano gillnets, and various passive fishing gear such as sink gillnets, weirs, traps and longlines as potential sources of mortality to sea turtles. NMFS is considering sea turtle conservation measures addressing incidental takings in non-shrimp fisheries. NMFS is considering many options, including: (1) Requiring the use of nets equipped with NMFS-approved turtle excluder devices (TEDs) at certain times of the year by non-shrimp bottom trawl fishing vessels fishing in waters of Delaware through Texas, to protect threatened and endangered sea turtles; (2) establishing a mandatory observer requirement in all fisheries that may take sea turtles incidental to fishing operations; and (3) providing a mechanism to allow NMFS to respond quickly to emergency situations that threaten listed sea turtles. Through these management actions, NMFS intends to protect endangered and threatened sea turtles in a manner that is compatible with commercial fishing operations. NMFS intends to solicit further public comments and to hold public hearings during the rulemaking process. 1. TED-Use Requirement Under the current regulations, most shrimp trawlers are required to use TEDs in inshore and offshore waters from North Carolina through Texas. Other bottom-trawl vessels using essentially the same equipment are not required to use TEDs, despite operating in areas with turtles. NMFS has determined that non-shrimp bottom trawlers, such as summer flounder bottom trawlers, are as likely to capture and drown sea turtles as are shrimp trawlers. Through an interim rule (58 FR 48797, September 20, 1993), NMFS currently requires the summer flounder fishery to use TEDs in the waters off North Carolina and southern Virginia. Turtle stranding and observation data suggest that turtles are found year-round off portions of North Carolina, in the waters of Virginia and Maryland from May through December, and in New York coastal bays from July through October. Information on turtle occurrence and capture is limited for areas north of Delaware Bay. However, NMFS is collecting data on the possible incidental take of turtles in the North Atlantic. NMFS is considering requiring bottom trawlers operating in offshore waters south of Cape May, NJ, to use TEDs, and is collecting information regarding when and where bottom trawlers interact with sea turtles. NMFS requests comments on bottom trawl gear and fisheries that may capture sea turtles.
