The speculation is as intense within the ANC as without. As far as is known, final decisions have not yet been made despite reports to the contrary. But the considerations at stake are becoming clearer -- particularly in the key posts of Deputy President, Finance Minister, Reconstruction and Development and the security portfolios. It is not yet decided whether the Reconstruction and Development post will be a separate Cabinet position or be placed within the President's department. Either way, it is obviously the surefire bet -- former COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] general secretary Jay Naidoo is unchallenged. Constructing the new Cabinet is likely to be one of Mandela's loneliest tasks. Devising the candidates' lists was much easier -- it having been a product of the popular will combined with tinkering by the national executive and special interest lobbying by the likes of COSATU, SANCO [South African National Civics Organisation] and the SACP [South African Communist Party]. Where the Cabinet is concerned, Mandela will (and presumably has already been) pondering these issues with only limited reference to many of his most senior colleagues since they have a direct personal interest in the outcome. Some insiders suggest that, to the extent that he consults initially, he will do so informally with his closest friends -- mainly his old fellow inmates on Robben Island and primarily Walter Sisulu who probably has no Cabinet ambitions of his own. Eventually he will have to go to his National Executive Committee, but that organ will be hard pressed to make objective decisions. The Deputy President post is a curious one. Some observers see it as a straight contest between Cyril Ramaphosa and Thabo Mbeki -- two of the contenders (likely PWV [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] premier Tokyo Sexwale being the third) for Mandela's position when he retires. But it is questionable whether the post is a significant one beyond that, especially given that F.W. de Klerk will also probably be a Deputy President. Unless, of course, the Deputy President is also able to hold a senior Cabinet post. Which brings us around to the most crucial post -- that of Finance Minister. Will it be Derek Keys, and if not, then who? First, there is no undertaking in the TEC's [Transitional Executive Council] statement of policy to the IMF that Keys and Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals have been guaranteed their posts in the government of national unity (as was suggested yesterday by BEELD). However, there is broad agreement in the ANC that Stals should be reappointed when his present term expires in June. The issue, quite simply, is investor and business confidence. (There is some concern in parts of the ANC, though, at talk that the deputy governorship may go to Bank of Beijing-trained radical economist Vella Pillay, which would not enhance confidence.) But it does go further, as reflected by a question put this week by a senior ANC source: "Do we need to keep both Keys and Stals in place to maintain confidence, or is Stals enough?" There is genuine ANC concern about giving the key Finance portfolio to an NP [National Party] member -- many would not stand for it. While the incumbent may have to ensure financial discipline, he should at least be committed in principle to the RDP [Reconstruction and Development program], it is argued. Even a senior NP source argued cogently this week that the post should be held by the ANC. Keys, the argument goes, was able to maintain financial discipline because he had the unstinting support of De Klerk. Given the populist pressures the ANC will face, the new Finance Minister should be someone with a political base sufficiently sound to empower him (or her) to say "no" to excessive claims on the Treasury by his colleagues. The question is -- who fits this bill? It is widely accepted that neither of the ANC's top two economics department figures -- Trevor Manuel and Tito Mboweni -- have the stature in terms of experience or political popularity. The two most likely candidates, therefore, are Mbeki (tipped by the SUNDAY TIMES some weeks ago) or Ramaphosa. Both have the necessary political base, and some, though limited, economic and financial expertise. But they would be surrounded by the bright young officials who have advised ANC policymakers in the past four years, and many of the incumbent Finance Ministry bureaucrats trained latterly by Keys. There are many other economics-linked posts which could be occupied by Keys, Manuel, Mboweni and others -- such as Trade and Industry, Public Enterprises, Mineral and Energy Affairs, Agriculture, Transport, Manpower, Water and Forestry and so on. This raises an international fact of life of cabinet-building. As a Centre for Policy Studies analyst points out, many appointments are made on the basis of political favours owed rather than expertise in a portfolio or other special qualities. There is no reason to think the ANC will be any different. The key to avoiding chaos is to ensure that senior departmental officials are capable. They then need only "to give the Minister a few papers to sign each day" and to focus their energies on running the show. Mandela's position is made all the more difficult because many of the top ANC candidates have no obvious administrative skills in vital areas of government. Although Mbeki would be an obvious candidate for Foreign Minister if he does not get Finance -- and even if he makes Deputy President -- and Steve Tshwete must be a sitter for the sport portfolio, who in the ANC knows anything about how to administer transport, water affairs, the environment and even education or health? When it comes to handing out rewards for favours, Mandela will have some leeway by virtue of the fact that he also has to establish, in terms of the constitution, a public protector, a human rights commission, and the restitution of land rights. In his selection of Cabinet candidates, De Klerk is likely to be swayed by the success of each region in the election. On this criteria, and on the basis of seniority in the party, the most likely candidates would therefore be Cape leader Dawie de Villiers, Transvaal leaders Pik Botha and Roelf Meyer and [Orange] Free State leader Kobie Coetsee along with Keys. The portfolios Mandela may consider distributing to NP candidates would be Agriculture to appease white farmers, and Public Administration to quell the fears of the Afrikaner-dominated public service. The DP's historical role as parliamentary watchdog and its centrist position could well be recognised by the appointment of party veteran Colin Eglin as Speaker of Parliament. The constitution provides for the appointment of a maximum of 27 Cabinet Ministers, but it does not specify which portfolios must be allocated to opposition members. Technically, therefore, Mandela could make the four or so NP candidates (assuming the NP gets 20 percent of the vote) "Ministers without portfolio" but he is required to engage in a process of non-binding consultation with other party leaders and make his decisions "in the spirit underlying the concept of a government of national unity." Mandela is not constrained by the constitution on what portfolios should be created. The ANC has already expressed its desire to reintegrate the State Expenditure and Finance departments. Other likely changes are a separation of the Regional and Land Affairs portfolio in line with the increased importance of regional government, and the creation of a Gender Affairs Ministry. Whether Housing and Public Works should be split is an open question and whether the current Public Enterprises Department will keep its "and Privatisation" epithet is a moot point.
