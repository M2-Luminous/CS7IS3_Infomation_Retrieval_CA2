The truce was signed by the Bosnian belligerents in Geneva last week and came into effect at noon on Friday. The same sources told TANJUG's reporter that the Croats had stepped up attacks in northern Bosnia and that Muslim provocations had been reported in many areas. Bosnian Croat forces and regular army troops of neighbouring Croatia continuously opened fire from small arms along the entire line of separation in the area of Orasje, a Croat enclave in northern Bosnia. Croatian artillery also shelled Serb settlements and the town of Brcko. The Serb side lodged a strong protest with the U.N. command and special U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi, warning them that the attack on the Bosnian Serb Republic from Bosnian and Croatian territory might have serious consequences. The Muslims were opening fire from small arms and tanks on Serb positions in the areas of Gradacac and Teslic in northern Bosnia. Provocative actions, mostly from snipers, directed against Serb civilian targets on the right bank of the Drina and check points on the line of disengagement were renewed from the U.N.-protected Muslim enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. Muslim provocative actions in the areas of Olovo and Kladanj in eastern Bosnia also continued, Bosnian Serb military sources said and added that a part of the Serb municipality of Zvornik had come under Muslim mortar fire. In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb military sources reported sporadic Muslim sniper and infantry fire aimed against the Serb sections of Nedzarici and Grbavica, while the suburb of Ilijas was shelled by rifle-grenades.
