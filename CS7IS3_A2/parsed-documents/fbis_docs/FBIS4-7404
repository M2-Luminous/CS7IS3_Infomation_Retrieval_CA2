B.P. Messakh, member of the DPR FKP [Functional Group Faction], feels that Bank Indonesia, as the only institution that supervises and oversees banking, should give an explanation to the public about the problem loans at BAPINDO. "Why has Bank Indonesia never given any information about the BAPINDO case, despite the fact that under Law No. 7/1992, Bank Indonesia is the only institution that supervises and oversees banking? The minister of finance himself has not directly given any information, either," Messakh said yesterday at the DPR Building. Messakh also asked why Bank Indonesia has not announced the results of its supervision and oversight of BAPINDO, although the BUMN bank has been in the news for months. "Should not Bank Indonesia have announced whatever its action has been against BAPINDO? If there is a bank that is not healthy, Bank Indonesia should know more about it than anyone else," the legislator said. A similar thought was expressed by Sri-Bintang Pamungkas, member of the DPR's APBN [National Budget] Commission from the FPP [Development Unity Faction], who said that because Bank Indonesia is the institution that oversees the activities of BUMN banks, it naturally knew of the BAPINDO loan case before anyone else. "Bank Indonesia should be the one to give explanation to the public. It is simply silent, however, although it certainly knew of the case first," Bintang asserted. The vocal DPR member feels that Bank Indonesia must be examined in connection with the BAPINDO case. "Bank Indonesia must be examined," he declared. Bintang's basis for his statement was that because Bank Indonesia routinely oversees banking activity, including that of BUMN banks, it must give account of its oversight of BAPINDO. Bintang feels that Bank Indonesia people can be bribed, however. Thus, unsatisfactory conditions at a bank are made satisfactory. Messakh also said that Bank Indonesia is the one that should know whether a bank is healthy and should also know what action is to be taken against such a bank, including BAPINDO. Bintang thinks the DPR APBN Commission's request for cancellation of its meeting with the Bank Indonesia governor was "engineered," thus closing off any information from Bank Indonesia. The basis for the cancellation was that the questions the APBN Commission would have asked the governor would be the same as those asked by Commission VII. "Oral questions from APBN Commission members would certainly differ from those of Commission VII, because their areas are different," Bintang asserted. Messakh said Bank Indonesia appears to have no role in the current BAPINDO case. "It is as though Bank Indonesia has no part whatever in the BAPINDO case," he said. The former member of Commission VII, which handles finance and banking, also asked whether the Attorney General's Office is pursuing the person who leaked confidential information about Eddy Tansil's loan at BAPINDO. He asked why the person who leaked confidential loan information about Eddy Tansil is not being pursued, because from the criminal aspect that person violated the Banking Law, particularly with regard to bank secrecy. "I agree that Eddy Tansil should be pursued, but there is clearly a criminal element in the leaking of bank secrets. Why has it been hushed up?" The DPR member asked whether the Attorney General's Office has tried to trace the one who leaked the confidential information about Eddy Tansil's loan. A similar question was raised by Aberson M. Sihaloho, deputy chairman of the DPR APBN Commission. "The person who leaked the bank secrets should be tracked down," he said. Foreign Bankers Meanwhile, people in the DPR also expressed the opinion that the use of foreign bankers to resolve the BAPINDO crisis is justified only to the extent that such use does not violate Law No. 7/1992 on banking, the provisions of which have yet to be spelled out in government regulations. Abdullah Zainie, deputy chairman of the FKP, said that Law No. 7/1992 provides for the possible use of foreign personnel by domestic banks. "As long as such foreign personnel are used only as consultants or advisers, it is all right to assign them to help BAPINDO managers or directors, but they cannot be used for executive jobs at the bank," Zainie said. "I agree with the government's contracting with foreign bankers to improve BAPINDO management, as long as such contracts do not violate the Banking Law," Commission V member Bomer Pasaribu said yesterday at the DPR Building. Bintang expressed the opinion that there will be no problem if the government wishes to establish BAPINDO management cooperation with a foreign bank as long as management is not delegated. "It would not be right to delegate BAPINDO management to a foreign bank!" Bintang declared. Meanwhile, Messakh, a member of DPR Commission V, said that if the improvement of BAPINDO management is to involve foreign personnel or bankers, it must be learned which areas are permitted by Law No. 7/1992 on banking. "In the clarification section of Law No. 7/1992, there are limitations and conditions on the employment of foreign personnel," said the former member of the special committee on the banking bill. The conditions are to be spelled out in government regulations, Messakh said. "The conditions that are to be spelled out are specified in Law No. 7/1992," he added. Messakh invited the government to cooperate with foreign personnel to improve BAPINDO management, as long as such cooperation does not violate the Banking Law and is not contradictory to it. A similar view was presented by Novyan Kaman, secretary of the FKP, who said that regulations should be drawn up before recruiting foreign personnel to improve BAPINDO management. "If the government wants to improve BAPINDO management by contracting with foreign personnel, it will not be done in the near future, because the government will naturally wait for the regulations to be drawn up first." They said these things as reaction to the plans of the minister of finance to recruit foreign bankers to improve BAPINDO management. Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad is expected to explain the plan in a working meeting with the APBN Commission today at the DPR Building. Bintang said that besides asking about the finance minister's plan for BAPINDO management cooperation with foreign bankers, he will also ask about other problem loan cases, which involve about 50 big customers. "If the resolution of just one problem loan case takes at least two months, then about 100 months, or eight years, will be needed to resolve 50 cases," he said. He feels that not all the capital of a BUMN bank needs to be owned by the government. As long as more than half the capital is owned by the government, it can be called a BUMN bank.
