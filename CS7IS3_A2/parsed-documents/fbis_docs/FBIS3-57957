FBIS3-57957 "drweu003__a94018" FBIS-WEU-94-003-A Document Type:Daily Report 5 January 1994 ANNEX Germany Former Official Questions Letter LD3012180193 Hamburg DPA in German 1714 GMT 30 Dec 93--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD3012180193 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Cologne [no date as received] (DPA) -- Heribert Hellenbroich, former president of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution [Bundesverfassungsschutz], views the letter claiming responsibility [for the death of Christian Democratic Union politician Bernhard Saelzer] as "a bad joke perpetrated by amateurs." He told the Friday [31 December] edition of the Cologne daily EXPRESS that the writers had made three decisive mistakes that had unmasked them: "First, the letter is very different from the confused linguistic style of the Red Army Faction [RAF]. Second, real terrorists would never claim to have tampered with the victim's car. They act professionally and do not talk about it. And third, they look for symbolic figures for their attacks. Mr. Saelzer was neither well known nor powerful enough to be a target for terrorists."
