The draft now enters the parliament. The draft legislation proposes raising the excise tax on gasoline from the present 0.40 kroons per liter to 0.80 kroons for ordinary gasoline, and to 0.60 kroons for gasoline containing less than 0.013 grams of lead per liter. Introduction of different rates is aimed at encouraging car owners to use fuel less detrimental to the environment. The excise tax on diesel fuel is to be hiked from the current 0.25 kroons to 0.50 kroons per liter. Rates for aircraft fuel, liquid gas and lubricants are to remain the same. The government has said the step is mainly due to the need to earn an estimated additional 21.8 million kroons into the state coffers to pay higher pensions from April. A representative at the Finance Ministry said the Estonian Oil Association, a body connecting the country's fuel companies, had agreed to the motion. The Oil Association's managing director, Mart Kutsar, told BNS his association had not approved of the planned step. But he also said in an interview with the ARIPAEV business newspaper that despite not approving of the step the association still understood that the hike was inevitable.
