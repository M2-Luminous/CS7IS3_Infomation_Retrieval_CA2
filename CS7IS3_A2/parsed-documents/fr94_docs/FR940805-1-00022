The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: AlliedSignal, Inc.: Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;10. Applicability: AlliedSignal, Inc. (formerly Allied-Signal, Inc., Garrett Engine Division, Garrett Turbine Engine Company, and AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of Arizona), TPE331&hyph;25, &hyph;43, &hyph;1, &hyph;2, &hyph;3, &hyph;5, &hyph;6, &hyph;8, &hyph;10, &hyph;11, and &hyph;12 series, and &hyph;55B and &hyph;61A Model turboprop engines; and TSE331&hyph;3U Model turboshaft engines. These engines are installed on but not limited to Mitsubishi MU&hyph;2B series (MU&hyph;2 series) Solitaire/Marquise; Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A. (CASA) C&hyph;212 series; British Aerospace (BAe) Jetstream 3101 and 3201 (31 and 32) series; Fairchild SA226 and SA227 series (Swearingen Merlin and Metro series); Prop-Jets, Inc. Model 400; Cessna Model 441 (Conquest); Twin Commander 680, 690, 695 (Jetprop Commander); Rockwell Commander or Ayres Corp. S&hyph;2R; Shorts Brothers and Harland, Ltd. SC7 (Skyvan); Dornier 228 Series; Beech 18 and 45 series and Models JRB&hyph;6, 3N, 3NM, 3TM, and B100; Pilatus PC&hyph;6 series (Fairchild Porter, Peacemaker); DeHavilland DH 104 Dove series; Grumman Model TS&hyph;2A; Grumman American Model G&hyph;164C; and Schweitzer Model G&hyph;164 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent uncontained failure of turbine rotors, fire, or loss of aircraft control, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 20 hours time in service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), review engine records and other pertinent information to identify any repair, assembly, modification, or installation work that was performed by Fliteline Maintenance, domestic repair station certificate number GR2R856K; or Mr. Eugene E. Shanks, mechanic certificate number 1914482; or Mr. Carl Ramirez, mechanic certificate number 466432551. (b) For engines with repair, assembly, modification, or installation work identified in accordance with paragraph (a) of this AD, within the next 100 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the following: (1) If records or other pertinent information indicate that the engine was disassembled beyond shaft nut removal from the tie bolt, by Fliteline Maintenance, or Mr. Eugene E. Shanks, or Mr. Carl Ramirez, verify life-limited turbine components and take appropriate action by the following methods: (i) Remove, disassemble the engine, compare, and match each component's part number (P/N) and serial number (S/N) against that engine's issued life-limit log cards. (ii) Validate all life-limit log card entries by utilizing the component's hourly and cyclic life as determined by records of the engine manufacturer or FAA-certified repair stations other than Fliteline Maintenance, or Mr. Eugene E. Shanks, or Mr. Carl Ramirez. Photocopied life-limit log cards may be used provided component history can be established. (iii) If the P/N, S/N, hourly and cyclic lives or the life-limit log card of each life-limited turbine component do not match or can not be validated, remove the component from service prior to further flight and replace with a serviceable component. (2) Verify that any requirements of AD's signed off by Fliteline Maintenance, or Mr. Eugene E. Shanks, or Mr. Carl Ramirez were actually accomplished by visual examination or reinspection of the affected components in accordance with the applicable AD. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on July 29, 1994. Jay J. Pardee, Manager, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
