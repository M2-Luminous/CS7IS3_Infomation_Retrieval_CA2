In particular, Anton Buteyko said: "There is a change for the better in the attitude to Ukraine on the part of United States and other Western states. Previously they were interested only in the situation concerning nuclear weapons, whereas now they are interested in full-scale economic cooperation and assistance for Ukraine in connection with the economic crisis. The main aim of the visit is to raise both countries' economic relations to a new level. It is expected that a number of agreements will be signed: on the legal basis of Western investments, avoiding double taxation, and statements on economic and trade relations. Issues connected with Ukraine's fulfillment of the START I Treaty and with making the mechanism of granting American aid more concrete are also to be discussed. A meeting is planned with the leadership of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Their investments are to be included in the Ukrainian reforms."
