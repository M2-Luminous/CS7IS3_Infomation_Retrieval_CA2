FBIS3-28864 "dreas030_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 North Korea Demand for Full Inspection Not `Justifiable' SK1202103194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0928 GMT 12 Feb 94 SK1202103194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0928 GMT 12 Feb 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [NODONG SINMUN 12 February commentary: "The United States Must Act With Discretion"] [Text] The United States, which has built a grave obstacle to peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula even after overturning its agreement with us, is now behaving more recklessly. Completely contrary to the agreement, U.S. hard-line conservatives urge us to accept a full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal] and are openly maneuvering to bring our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. They are also urging France, Britain, Russia, and other countries to join in sanctions [chejae] on us. This is a maneuver to bring the situation to a catastrophe [paguk] to the end. As clearly manifested in the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact held toward the end of last year, the inspection which we agreed to receive is an inspection for purely ensuring the continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui yonsoksong pojangul wihan sacharida]. This inspection is starkly different [omyonhui kubyoltoenda] from regular and irregular inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] legally required by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Inspection for ensuring the continuity of safeguards has stemmed from our special position [tuksuhan chiwi] that we temporarily suspended the effectuation of our withdrawal from the NPT. The United States must not have forgotten the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact which was held toward the end of last year, not several years ago, or failed to differentiate an inspection for purely ensuring the continuity of safeguards from a full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal], which is tantamount to a return to the treaty. In view of our special position and the promise between us and the United States, demanding a full-scope inspection can in no way be justifiable. Nevertheless, U.S. hardline conservatives ask us to accept a full-scope inspection and are openly maneuvering to have sanctions [chejae chochi] imposed on us in case we do not accept this request. This cannot be construed otherwise than an act for blocking the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue and deliberately bringing the situation to a catastrophe. This kind of act by the United States in fact shows that it has from the beginning no will to resolve the issue peacefully through talks, but that it is only pursuing the goal of trying to provide a moral obligation to crush [apsal] us in whatever way. Viewing from its cause and characteristics, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is an issue which must be resolved between us and the United States. It is very clear that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is not an issue to be discussed at the UN Security Council. The hardline conservatives of the United States are trying to drag our nuclear issue to the United Nations. This is because it is a reemergence of its habitual maneuver to use the United Nations as its tool of tyranny. France is actively following such maneuvers of the United States. France is a nuclear power and has committed innumerable nuclear tests, thus seriously polluting man's ecological environment. Therefore, it is a country that is receiving resolute protest and denunciation from the broad peace-loving people of the world. France's act of scheming with the United States by shamelessly interfering in the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, is indeed inviting the people's hatred. As the whole world knows, we have already clearly announced that any kind of sanctions will be regarded as a proclamation of war against us. It is a well known fact that we by no means make empty talk. The hard-line conservatives of the United States and their followers who are scheming to unreasonably drag our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council to take sanctions, must contemplate on what dangerous consequences their moves can bring about. Pressure and threat do not by any means work for us. The United States must correctly know who it is dealing with and act with discretion.
