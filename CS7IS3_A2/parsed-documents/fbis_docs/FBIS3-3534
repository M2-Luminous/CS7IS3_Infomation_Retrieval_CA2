Chen Liuming said that in the first two months of this year, Guangdong's national economy continued to maintain rapid development. Reform of the taxation system caused no big fluctuation in commodity prices on the market and revenue from taxation continued to grow quite rapidly. By 10 March, the accumulated total of industrial and commercial taxes collected in Guangdong reached 7.6 billion yuan, 38.5 percent up on the same period last year. Talking about recent problems cropping up in the course of implementing the new taxation system, Chen Liuming said that the tax reduction exemption policies adopted by the central authorities and the provincial government before June last year and which are not yet due will continue to be implemented until 1995, and taxes will be collected first and returned later. With regard to returning the increased portion of taxes after the collection of a turnover tax paid by foreign-invested enterprises whose operations were approved before the end of last year, he stressed that we should clearly understand that, firstly, the increased portion of taxes paid for products or labor services at a unified industrial and commercial tax rate lower than the existing value-added tax rate and sales tax rate should be returned, and the value-added tax rate should be converted according to unified taxes included in the calculated prices. Secondly, regarding goods purchased by enterprises without legal proof of tax reduction, the calculation of a specific amount of tax payments for return should first be based on the actual prime cost and the tax rate suited to the value-added tax, and this portion should be deducted from the amount of tax to be returned.
