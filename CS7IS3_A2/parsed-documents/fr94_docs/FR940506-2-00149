FR940506-2-00149 FR940506-2-00081 3. Applicants believe that the imposition of the CDSC is fair and in the best interests of their shareholders. The proposed CDSC provides shareholders the advantage of having more investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase. Furthermore, the CDSC described above is fair to shareholders because it applies only to amounts representing purchase payments and does not apply to amounts representing share appreciation, or to amounts representing reinvestment of distributions. Applicants Conditions Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in all respects to each other class, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) Different distribution fee payments associated with any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for a particular class of shares and any other costs relating to implementing or amending such Plan (including obtaining shareholder approval of such Plan or any amendment thereto) which will be borne solely by shareholders of such classes, (b) different service fees, (c) different shareholder servicing fees, (d) different Class Expenses, which will be limited to the following expenses determined by the Trustees to be attributable to a specific class of shares: (i) Printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (ii) Commission registration fees incurred by a specific class; (iii) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class; (iv) Trustee fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class; and (v) accounting expenses relating to a specific class; (e) the voting rights related to any 12b&hyph;1 Plan affecting a specific class of shares, except as provided in condition 16 below; (f) conversion features; (g) exchange privileges; and (h) class names or designations. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly applied to one class of shares shall not be so applied unless and until approved by the Commission by an amended order. 2. The Trustees of each Fund, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will approve the Multiple Distribution System for a particular Fund prior to its implementation by that Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of each Fund regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Distribution System will reflect the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multiple distribution System is in the best interests of both the Fund and its shareholders. 3. The initial determination of any Class Expenses that will be applied to a class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees, including a majority of the non-interested Trustees. Any persons authorized to direct the application and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Board of Trustees, and the Trustees shall review at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 4. Any distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to conform to such standards; and such compliance standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase Institutional Shares will be sold only Institutional Shares rather than any other class of shares offered by a Fund, and that all investors eligible to purchase Non-Institutional Shares will be sold only Non-Institutional Shares. 5. The Administrative Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 6. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. KFS will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, KFS at its own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.
