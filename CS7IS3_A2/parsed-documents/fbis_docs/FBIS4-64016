At the same time, he said they indicated a number of small steps forward and were positive as such. But Bunich thinks their effects could be felt only in the next year's budget. By then, he stressed, appropriate laws will have been adopted to enshrine the measures indicated in the package. Bunich thinks that the package was intended only to declare some changes in the course of economic reforms. Deputy Speaker of Parliament Aleksandr Vengerovskiy of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] told Interfax that LDP economists would outline their own vision of economic reforms and their attitude to the president's package at a news conference in Moscow on Friday. As for himself, Vengerovskiy thinks that the package-envisaged measures are "largely forced ones, though positive on the whole". One other LDP deputy Vladimir Lisichkin, himself an economist, has praised the package though not the measures it set out "are belated and should have been taken a year ago". He said LDP was opposed only to one of the six decrees, notably the one lifting export quotas and licences. He said the measure aimed at liberalizing foreign trade and called for by Yegor Gaydar last year but rejected by the Liberal Democrats was nothing but a follow up of the shock treatment of the economy. In the absence of a legislative basis, the measure will cause further flight of capital to other countries to back up their economies rather than Russia's, Lisichkin believes. For his part, Vladimir Semago of the Communist Party said that many of the package's points that the opposition raised during 1991-1993 were reflected in his party's economic recovery plan. The president is clearly moving into our camp and the only thing that prevents us from accepting him, he said, is the absence of his announcement about early elections and his own resignation. At the same time, Semago is opposed to serious economic decisions being taken by splashing out a series of decrees. He said such decisions must be legislated after passing through Duma committees. He accused Yeltsin of pretending to have forgotten whatever negative was done. He now pretends to have a new inspiration, new aides and to be moving forward which nothing but a cunning game, Semago believes.
