They are asking the court to instruct the General Custodian to transfer the land to the state, and to obligate the government's legal adviser to open an investigation into serious irregularities in the procedures of the tender request. Presiding High Court of Justice Judge Theodore Or yesterday issued a temporary injunction forbidding the carrying out of the tender request process, including a meeting that was to be held yesterday in the office of the General Custodian, until the decision of the High Court of Justice on the appeal. The appellants argue, through attorney Dany Zeydman, that the very decision to issue the tender request is not legal, and is tainted by extreme lack of reasonableness. According to them, the decision stems from extraneous considerations of preferring the settlers in general and the 'Ateret Kohanim Yeshiva in particular, over the good of the public. The appellants argue further that even if the decision is found to be reasonable, the tender request itself is defective to the extent that it becomes a tender request in appearance only. According to the appellants, it becomes clear from the minutes of the deliberations of the General Custodian that the regular attorney of the 'Ateret Kohanim Society, Eytan Geva, and its main contributor, Ervin Moscowitz of the United States, had already been brought into the earliest stages in the process of the decision to issue the tender request. In this manner, 'Ateret Kohanim and those close to it were given an unequal opportunity to learn about the land being offered for sale and to put together their offer accordingly. At the critical meeting where it was decided to issue the tender request, only two days before its publication, there was discussion of an explicit proposal of 'Ateret Kohanim, and the representative of the General Custodian even recommended that the proposal be accepted. It is also asserted that the tender request itself was issued even though the Israel Lands Administration expressed its agreement to receive the lands into state ownership. According to the appellants, not only did the General Custodian ignore this agreement, it also issued the tender request without announcing this to the proper persons in the Administration. A Systematic Policy The appellants also assert that the General Custodian issued the tender request even though there are still no plans. This means that the price that will be asked for the land will be radically lower, and the proceeds from the sale will be reduced. The General Custodian issued the tender request after he himself acted to release this land for construction, but he abandoned this process while it was going on. In this regard, the appellants note that the policy of the Israel Lands Administration is not to issue a tender request for land that is not planned. The appellants note that a man who was employed by 'Ateret Kohanim as an identifier of land in the territories, for the purpose of purchasing it, is now employed in a similar position in the office of the General Custodian. They emphasize that the tender request for the land in Abu Dis was published in only one newspaper, in contradiction to the instructions of the law, and with an extremely short period for submitting bids. According to the appellants, such acts are actually another link in the systematic policy of the General Custodian to earmark in advance and illegally monies and land to settler societies in East Jerusalem, as a committee headed by Ministry of Justice Director-General Hayyim Klugman, which examined the subject, has already described. The appellants believe their suspicions were reinforced by an "appraisal" that was made of the value of the land in Abu Dis. A minimum price of only approximately $66,000 was established, which is the price a one-room apartment in Jerusalem, was established for 33 dunams. It also appears that the General Custodian deviated from the statutes regarding tender requests for the sale of lands, to which he himself is a signatory. According to these statutes, the chairman of the tender request committee is supposed to open the envelope that contains the appraisal of the government appraiser, and to record it in the minutes, without bringing it to the knowledge of the bidders. However, not only was the appraisal known to 'Ateret Kohanim, but it was also not from the government appraiser, rather from the staff officer for appraisals in the Civil Administration in the West Bank. And this was even though the land is located in an area where Israeli law applies, and which is not in the area in which this appraiser specializes.
