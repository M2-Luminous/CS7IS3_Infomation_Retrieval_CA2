FR940921-0-00147 FR940921-0-00016 107. Section 86.1327&hyph;96 of subpart N is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (f)(1) and (f)(2) introductory text to read as follows: §86.1327&hyph;96 Engine dynamometer test procedures; overview. (a) The engine dynamometer test procedure is designed to determine the brake-specific emissions of hydrocarbons, nonmethane hydrocarbons (for natural gas-fueled engines only), carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate (petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engines), and methanol and formaldehyde (for methanol-fueled diesel engines). The test procedure consists of a ``cold'' start test following either natural or forced cool-down periods described in §§86.1334 and 86.1335, respectively. A ``hot'' start test follows the ``cold'' start test after a hot soak of 20 minutes. The idle test of subpart P of this part may be run after the ``hot'' start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air and a continuous proportional sample is collected for analysis during both the cold- and hot-start tests. The composite samples collected are analyzed either in bags or continuously for hydrocarbons (HC), methane (CH 4 _natural gas-fueled engines only), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), or in sample collection impingers for methanol (CH 3 OH) and sample collection impingers (or capsules) for formaldehyde (HCHO). A bag or continuous sample of the dilution air is similarly analyzed for background levels of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen and, if appropriate, methane, or methanol and formaldehyde. In addition, for petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engines, particulates are collected on fluorocarbon-coated glass fiber filters or fluorocarbon-based (membrane) filters, and the dilution air may be prefiltered. * * * * * (f) *␣*␣* (1) Otto-cycle engines. A chassis-type exhaust system shall be used. For all catalyst systems, the distance from the exhaust manifold flange(s) to the catalyst shall be the same as in the vehicle configuration unless the manufacturer provides data showing equivalent performance at another location. (2) Diesel engines. Either a chassis-type or a facility-type exhaust system or both systems simultaneously may be used. The exhaust back pressure or restriction shall be typical of those seen in the actual average vehicle exhaust system configuration and may be set with a valve (muffler omitted). * * * * * 108. Section 86.1332&hyph;90 of subpart N is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(1) heading, (c)(2) heading, (d)(2) heading, (d)(3) heading, (e)(1) heading and (e)(2) heading to read as follows: §86.1332&hyph;90 Engine mapping procedures. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (1) Otto-cycle engines . * * * * * (2) Diesel engines . * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (2) Otto-cycle engines . * * * * * (3) Diesel engines. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (1) Otto-cycle engines . * * * * * (2) Diesel engines . * * * * *
