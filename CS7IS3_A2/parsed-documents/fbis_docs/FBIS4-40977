"The Caucasus and the Transcaucasus are two mutually related regions," said Pastukhov. "A fire in one of them may spread to the other. From the international point of view, Russia has always played the role of peacemaker, guided by U.N. norms and requirements," he added. He also said that this operation would differ from the previous ones in that Russian peacekeepers would work jointly with U.N. observers.
