Senior officials of the seven-party coalition reached the consensus at a meeting in a Diet building after Shoji Motooka, chairman of the upper house panel on political reform, decided to resume discussion on the government's reform package Wednesday. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party who moderated the meeting, told a news conference he hopes the LDP will participate in the committee debate but said the coalition would go ahead with reform discussion without the LDP. At a meeting of governing and opposition directors of the upper house panel, the LDP objected to the coalition's call for Wednesday's resumption of deliberations on the reform bills but Motooka decided to reopen panel business to speed up the long-delayed debate, Diet officials said. The government reform package cleared the House of Representatives in mid-November but deliberations in the upper house stalled for over a month through late December due partly to the LDP's refusal to attend the reform panel session. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political future on enactment of the reform package in the current extraordinary Diet session, which ends January 29.
