The similarities in the problems that plague the Peruvian and the Colombian peoples pave the way for understanding and comprehension between us. I am referring to drug trafficking, terrorism, the extreme guerrilla violence, and, of course, poverty, indigence, and lack of opportunity that so harshly continue to hit some areas of our two nations. We Colombians are pleased with the great progress Peru has achieved in recent times. The Peruvian economy that had reached astronomical inflation rates barely a few years ago, now has an inflation rate slightly higher than ours. Also, economic growth, which for more than two decades had been stalled, in 1993 achieved a 6-percent growth rate. Likewise, drug trafficking, violence, and terrorism have strongly oppressed our peoples over the last decade. We are, however, winning this struggle. One only has to mention Abimael Guzman and Pablo Escobar's names to remind the most skeptical that no criminal, no matter how powerful he may appear, can indefinitely defy the will of a people who are not willing to live in fear. These people have found justice in their authorities through the required solutions. If the first one [words indistinct] is serving his sentence, the second was recently gunned down by our authorities. This is why President Fujimori, I am certain that the positive results achieved by your government in the economic as well as political and social fields will allow Peru once again to be reintegrated into the international financial community, to advance with firms steps toward the encounter with progress. From Peru arose the process that led to our independence, as well as Bolivar's integration [words indistinct]. We are united by the Amazon, the Andes, and the significant opportunities we have before us on the Pacific side. We are also united by that desire to [words indistinct] countries of a continent with a millennium of traditions; based on these we project ourselves toward the future. Few nations have [words indistinct] goals and expectations. This is a happy occasion for all Colombians. My people and my government are honored by your presence, my president friend. There is a great deal that unites us. We have a common past, a common border, a [words indistinct], a cultural history, and a common future that men of your stature help to form. We must be conscious to share more in the future. We want our two nations to strengthen their ties of friendship. We want our mutual [words indistinct] to strengthen democracy and to give way to a better future for our children. I know you well enough, President Fujimori, to say that you are a man of vision and of character, two of the vital [word indistinct] of true leaders. Allow me tonight to offer a toast to your country and to your personal well-being, with the hope that both nations will achieve peace, equality, and social justice which our peoples demand. [applause]
