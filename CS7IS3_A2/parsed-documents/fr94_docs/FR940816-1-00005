FR940816-1-00005 FR940816-1-00002 The Board of Directors also specifically requests comment from all interested parties as to whether the amendments which the FDIC proposes are the most appropriate means to create an exception to the limit on other purpose loans to executive officers of insured nonmember banks. If a commenter should feel that there is a better alternative to the proposed amendments, the Board of Directors of the FDIC requests that the alternative be specifically described. IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the FDIC hereby certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If adopted, the rule will not impose burdens on depository institutions of any size and will not have the type of economic impact addressed by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The FDIC has reached this conclusion because the effect of the rule, if it is ultimately promulgated in its current form, will be to reduce the regulatory requirements that are imposed upon small depository institutions rather than to increase them. Small depository institutions will have greater freedom of action to extend credit to executive officers as a result of the proposed rule rather than less. V. Paperwork Reduction Act No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) are contained in the proposed rule. Consequently, no information has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review.
