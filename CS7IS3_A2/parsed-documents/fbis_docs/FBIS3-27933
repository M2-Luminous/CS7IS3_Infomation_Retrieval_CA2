While world trade grew steadily at an annual rate of 13 percent from 1985 to 1990, foreign direct investments, showing even greater growth, expanded at an annual rate of 34 percent. In the midst of these changes in the world economy, we see the rapid growth of Japanese foreign direct investments since the Plaza Accord of 1985 as well as changes in Japan's trade structure. In view of these changes, the International Research Section of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] Customs and Tariff Bureau conducted a survey over a one-year period to address the following and other questions: 1) how has the expansion of foreign direct investments changed Japan's trade structure; 2) what kinds of changes have occurred with respect to Japan's international air cargo industry along with these other changes; and 3) what is the status of attempts by Japanese enterprises, which underlie these changes in the trade structure, to localize production? Here and in the following (October) issue, we would like to introduce findings from this survey regarding changes in Japan's trade structure from the latter half of the 1980's through 1992. I. Introduction During the latter half of the 1980's, Japan's trade structure underwent dynamic changes both in terms of imports and exports. Using figures indicating the volume of trade in terms of quantity [e.g., number of cars exported] rather than in just dollar amounts, which is a less accurate measure of volume, we see that during the first half of the 1980's (specifically, in 1980, 1981 and 1984), with the yen still weak, exports grew at a two-digit rate. That changed to a single-digit, however, from 1987. In 1992, the rate of growth in exports had fallen to 0.2 percent due to the J-curve effect following the yen's appreciation and to more higher value added export items (Tables 1 and 2). For example, in the case of automobiles, which were Japan's leading export through the 1980's, making up almost 20 percent of all Japanese exports during that period, exports, as measured in dollars, continued to grow while the actual number of cars shipped from Japan fell (from 7.01 million cars in 1986 to 6 million in 1992), indicating that the growth in exports was due to price factors rather than to a change in the number of cars being exported. Again, along with a growth in foreign direct investments by Japan's enterprises, growth in export parts (for example, semiconductor and electronic parts, car parts and engines), which were hard to secure in the countries where Japanese enterprises had set up their branch operations, became a characteristic of the export trade during the latter half of the 1980's (Table 3).

Specifically, from the latter half of the 1980's, clothing, office machinery (such as computers), semiconductors and electronic parts (such as integrated circuits) and audio-video equipment (color televisions, VTR's) have all shown significant increases (Table 4). The decline in the volume of manufactured imported products in 1992 was due to a decline in luxury items such as cars, gold, diamonds and paintings as well as in steel and nonferrous metals (aluminum, aluminum alloys, copper and copper alloys), the result of the bubble economy's collapse and the domestic economy's entering an adjustment phase. Where local production by Japanese enterprises had progressed--in apparel, office equipment, semiconductors and electronic parts, and audio and video equipment--imports continued to increase. Behind such changes in the trade structure, we can find the influence of the yen's sharp rise in value following the Plaza Accord of 1985. The yen's appreciation lowered import prices (calculated on the basis of the yen) and weakened the ability of domestically manufactured goods to remain price-competitive. In order to respond to the yen's sharp rise and deal with trade problems, however, Japanese enterprises aggressively engaged in foreign direct investments and succeeded in transferring their production bases overseas. As a result, re-imported products--for the most part mass market consumer products--penetrated the domestic market while exports, in order to keep the work force employed at home, centered on high value added items that could not be produced at overseas plants, thus creating specialization, or an international division of labor, in the production of manufactured goods. In the future, too, domestic and foreign economic trends permitting, Japanese enterprises are expected to expand their overseas operations even further, just as they have since the latter half of the 1980's, as long as yen continues its upward climb.

A larger share of all foreign direct investments during the latter half of the 1980's was going to Asia, reflecting the importance placed on this region in the corporate strategies of Japanese enterprises. While we can gather from their profits that Japanese-owned enterprises engaged in local production in Europe and the United States are having a hard time, operations in Asia are proceeding smoothly, comparatively speaking, and in the future, we can expect the relative importance of this region for Japanese enterprises to increase even further. Wide variations exist among different industries when it comes to local production. The picture, however, in terms of changes in trade structure due to foreign direct investments, when considered on an industry by industry basis (here, the automobile, consumer appliance and electronics, apparel, and steel industries will be considered), indicates that in each of these industries, manufacturers are exporting high value added products. On the other hand, the trend in imports is toward mass distribution consumer products. Thus, we can see that, in terms of exports and imports, an international division of labor, or "segregation of niche" [sumiwake] is developing. During the latter half of the 1980's, a large wave of foreign direct investments was developing, even on an international scale, (with investments going from advanced countries to other advanced countries and from advanced countries to developing nations), and as a result, there has been a shift in the world's trade structure, including Japan's, from vertical to horizontal trade. This shift can be understood in terms of changes in the index of intra-industry trade (ITT), an indicator of the degree to which horizontal (intra-industry) trade has developed. Not only has Asia, a region actively receiving direct investments from advanced nations, including Japan, seen a brisk, quickening of trade, close trading ties within the region are developing as domestic demand among Asian countries expands. Changes in Japan's trade structure and in its regional ties can also be seen from the perspective of Japan's international air cargo. II. Trends in Japanese Foreign Direct Investments 1. General Remarks From the end of the 1980's into the 1990's, foreign direct investments by Japanese enterprises have increased dramatically as companies have embarked on plans to transfer their domestic production bases overseas. This move has been in response to a downturn in the profitability of exports due to the yen's steep rise following the 1985 Plaza Accord and in response to voluntary export restrictions and worsening trade relations of the kind seen in anti-dumping suits (Table 5). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 5.

Although investments have dropped since 1990 for various reasons--the increasingly unpredictable nature of market trends due to a global slump, the difficulty of raising corporate funds following the collapse of Japan's bubble economy, and the completion of a round of plans by Japanese companies to build overseas production bases--the level of investments, in 1992 amounting to $10.1 million, still remains high when compared to the early half of the 1980's when investments were at around the $3 billion level. (It should be noted that, after an initial period of investments in local production, additional funds for plant facilities are often raised by companies in the country where those facilities are located and the connection between direct investments from Japan and the further development of local production becomes weaker.) In considering regional changes in Japan's foreign direct investments, we see that North America was Japan's principal target for investors, their reasons for investing in this region being to maintain and expand their market shares and to develop new markets; additionally, investors have been motivated by the desire to avoid trade problems. As can be seen in responses to the questionnaire given to Japanese enterprises on their reasons for branching out overseas (Table 6), oftentimes the motive, in the case of North America and Europe was to cope with trade restrictions set up by their trading partners. In 1988, 67 percent of [Japan's] foreign direct investments went to North America, but that figure has since dropped, falling to 42 percent in 1992. Among the reasons for this decline are the business slump in the United States and the fact that Japanese enterprises have just finished a round of large-scale production projects (Table 7). Europe's share of foreign direct investments, about 10 percent, was relatively low until 1988, but with the economic unification of the European Community (EC) slated for 1992, Japanese-owned enterprises, believing they should try to gain "insider status," hurriedly began to move into the region from the latter half of the 1980's, bringing EC's share of Japanese investments to 30 percent in 1990. Because of the business slump in Europe, particularly in England, which receives from one-third to one-fourth of the direct investments from Japan (Table 7), less money is being invested in the area, and Europe's share dropped to 21 percent in 1992. Ideally, there are two routes companies can take when moving into advanced market countries (i.e., North America and Europe): they can either set up their own production bases there through foreign direct investments (local production) or they can base their production on tie-ups with [local] enterprises (establish mutually complementary production relationships, OEM [original equipment manufacturer] tie-ups, technical tie-ups, or joint development). In recent years, rather than through foreign direct investments, more weight has been given to the latter route; namely, cooperative dealings between companies and joint technical development based on strategic tie-ups with foreign enterprises. As a result, Japanese companies have been placing less importance on foreign direct investments. Asia, with its abundance of cheap labor, on the other hand, has been designated a production base for Japanese-owned enterprises and since 1988, has steadily been receiving a larger share of Japan's foreign direct investments. In 1992, this share reached an all time high of 31 percent. But even within the same region, interest has been shifting since 1990 from ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nation] member countries to China. Thus, it seems that in recent years, Japan's foreign direct investments have been shifting from North America and Europe to Asia. Table 6.

Regional Trends in Japanese Foreign Direct Investments and the Earnings Situation of Japanese-Owned Enterprises If we consider regional trends in foreign direct investments in terms of profits, we see that, according to a questionnaire survey (on the overseas business activities of Japanese companies), which was conducted by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], current profit-to-sales ratios for companies in North America and Europe are low and, in some cases, companies are even coming out with negative profit ratios. In Asia, on the other hand, current profit ratios for Japanese-owned companies are relatively high (Table 8). Table 8.

The following are among the factors thought to be responsible: (1) North America was hit by a business recession during the start up period for large scale projects (2) In order to manufacture high quality goods on a scale beyond a certain level, Japanese companies that have gone to North America often have capital-intensive facilities and, during their start-up period, have high depreciation costs and are also burdened by heavy interest payments. Again, local sales ratios for Japanese-owned enterprises in North America are about 90 percent, and presumably having invested in order to secure a share of the local market, they may be sacrificing profits to a certain extent when they make their investments (Table 9.1).

As in the case of North America, many of the companies branching out into Europe were doing so in response to trade problems related to automobiles and scientific and optical equipment such as duplicators and copying machines; but, for the most part, as concern grew about the "fortification of Europe" with the approaching unification of the EC in 1992, companies beat a hasty path to this region during the closing years of the 1980's in order to gain insider status so they could secure a piece of the European market. Over 90 percent of the sales of locally produced goods in Europe comes from local markets. As in the case of the United States, Europe is not a manufacturing base for exports to countries, including Japan, that are outside of the region (Table 9.2) Table 9.2. Changes in Percent of Products Sold in Local Markets by Overseas Japanese Enterprises: Europe (Unit: percent) 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 Products for 95.9 95.9 94.4 95.6 96.1 93.9 local markets Exports for 4.1 5.6 4.4 3.9 3.9 6.1 non-local markets Exports for 1.2 1.5 1.7 1.7 1.2 1.9 Japanese markets Asia Not only are current profit-to-sales ratios higher in Asia than in North America and Europe, in 1990 and 1991, they were even higher than those of domestic enterprises. This is probably due to attempts to develop production networks there and to set the region up as a manufacturing base for exports to third-party countries outside of the region (such as the United States, Europe and Japan). In this respect, the region presents the following advantages: (1) Labor costs in Asia are much cheaper than in economically more advanced countries (2) Many of the manufacturers that have gone to Asia are labor-intensive, and depreciation costs and interest payment burdens are low. The market for products made by Japanese-owned enterprises in Asia differs very much from those of Japanese companies in North America and Europe: local sales make up no more than slightly over half of all sales for Japanese companies in Asia, while exports to other countries outside the region, including Japan, make up a little under one-half (Table 9.3). Table 9.3.

However, even within this "world center of growth," regional differences of the type mentioned below are likely to occur, and this diversity should be kept in mind. During the second half of the 1980's, Asia's newly developing economies [NIE's], which received foreign direct investments from Japan, all similarly underwent rapid growth. The 1990's, however, find Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore in different political and economic environments. In other words, the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong are in the process of merging with the economy of China, which has seen remarkable growth through the foreign direct investments of overseas Chinese merchants. Singapore's aim is to develop knowledge-intensive industries such as service industries and banking and financial services. On the other hand, Korea is shifting its emphasis from heavy and chemical industries (for example, steel and shipbuilding) to high-tech fields such as the semiconductor and computer industries. From the end of the 1980's, wages in Asian newly industrializing economies soared, off-setting the advantages of local production originally undertaken because of their low wages. As a result, Japanese foreign direct investments were then targeted to ASEAN member countries, which became production bases for Japanese manufacturers, especially in the consumer appliance and electronics industries for products like air conditioners and VTR's. Wages in ASEAN countries have risen sharply, however, since 1991, and manufacturers are encountering such bottlenecks as inadequate infrastructure provisions and difficulties securing engineers and other personnel (these countries are having the same problem that Japan has had in filling undesirable, so-called 3K positions [jobs considered dangerous, difficult and dirty]. At present, ASEAN nations are undergoing an adjustment phase in their progress toward industrialization. On the other hand, though Japanese direct investments in China have been low-pitched due to the Tianamen Square incident (June 1989) and to economic adjustment policies, the attention of Japanese enterprises at present seem to be focussing on China. This is due to such factors since 1991 as: (a) the deteriorating investment environment in ASEAN countries and the rapid emergence of China, with its conspicuously lower wages, as a local production base for Japanese enterprises; (b) the fact that, despite concerns about post-Deng Xiaoping political risks, China is promoting reform and a policy of openness; and (c) the expectation that domestic demand will expand, given China's population of 1.1 billion and its huge, potential market. [Oct 93 pp 15-29] [Excerpts] In the first installment of "Changes in Japan's Trade Structure and Foreign Direct Investments" (September 1993), we noted that significant changes had occurred in Japan's trade structure due to increased foreign direct investments during the latter half of the 1980's, including a growth in locally manufactured re-import items. Particularly noted was the growing importance of Asia as an overseas production base. To understand in greater detail (i.e., in micro terms) changes in our trade structure given the macro trends described earlier, we will look at these changes and trends in our foreign direct investments on an industry by industry basis. Since foreign direct investments increased during the latter half of the 1980's on a global scale, we will take a global perspective in considering these structural changes and trends. III. Changes in Trade Structure and Foreign Direct Investments as Seen in Different Industries With regard to exports, a look at changes in trade structure and foreign direct investments as they apply to the different industries (automobiles, consumer appliances and electronics, apparel, and steel) generally indicates that, in each of these industries, there has been a furthering of local production through foreign direct investments (Table 11). However, because of difficulties in locally obtaining parts due to the weakness of supporting industries, Japan is also exporting more parts and, at the same time, is substituting among some of its exports finished goods (non-specialty items intended for the general market) that have been based on local production.

In the apparel and consumer appliance and electronics industries, where local production has been undertaken primarily to take advantage of low-waged, local labor, there has been a steady growth in reimports from Asia that have been locally produced. The situation in the steel industry, where local production has been undertaken primarily as a way of dealing with trade frictions, however, does not indicate any growth in reimports based on foreign direct investments. 1. Auto Industry The auto industry started moving its operations overseas from the early half of the 1980's, beginning with North America. Initially acting in response to voluntary export restrictions, the industry speeded this process up from 1985, when the yen suddenly gained in value. Local production in Europe started from the latter half of the 1980's in response to trade problems between the United States and Japan and grew out of the desire by Japanese auto makers to gain insider status in light of EC's pending economic unification Table 12). Table 12.

The number of re-exported cars in 1992 was 26,000, or about 14 percent of Japan's imported car market (of 181,000 cars). The market for passenger cars in Asia (Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries, excluding Borneo) is not as large as it is in advanced countries (in 1992, 1.448 million cars were sold in Asia), but as motorization progresses, Japanese-owned enterprises are expected to put more effort into strengthening local production. A sharp growth in the export of parts, including car parts and engines, has accompanied the development of local production bases in regions throughout the world (Table 13). To take the export of passenger cars to the United States as an example, we see that, in 1986, 2.348 million cars were exported [to the United States], as compared to 508,000 cars that were locally produced. In 1992, however, the number of exported cars fell to 1.584 million while the figure for locally produced cars rose to 1.416 million cars, indicating that exports from Japan are being replaced by local production. The same trend appears in the EC market. Though the car market has been in a slump, operations have begun at plants built through Japanese direct investments, and the figures for 1992 show a decline in the number of passenger cars being exported from Japan.

Consumer Appliance and Electronics Industries The consumer appliance and electronics industries set up branch operations in North America, Europe and Asia from a relatively early date. Moving into North America and Europe in response to trade problems, these industries are eyeing local sales in these two regions. In Asia, particularly the ASEAN countries, the aim has been to set up export supply bases--production bases from which to export products to North America and Europe--rather than local sales (Table 14).

Thus, along with active local production in Asia, there has been a growth in exports to the region of semiconductors and electronic parts (primarily used for assembling consumer appliances and electronic equipment), which are hard to secure locally (Table 15).

Thus, since 1990, we see the volume of re-imports from these countries in terms of the consumer electronics industry rapidly approaching the volume of re-imports from Asian NIE's. In looking for the factors behind this remarkable progress in ASEAN member-countries, we should point out that Japanese enterprises had to transfer their operations to Korea and the other newly industrialized economies of Asia gradually while, at the same time, adjusting their production process to existing local industries; in the ASEAN case, however, the entire process could be transferred from Japan in one piece, thus making it easier to introduce the latest technology more effectively (Tables 16 and 17).

Within China, durable consumer goods like refrigerators, washing machines and television sets--consumer products that are becoming part of the necessities of daily life--are coming into general use, and manufacturers are anticipating growth in the durable consumer market and products like air conditioners and audio-video equipment along with a rise in China's standard of living. 3. Apparel Industry The apparel industry is labor-intensive, and because it became less profitable to export apparel from Japan when the yen gained strength following the Plaza Accord, Japanese enterprises have gone about aggressively setting up local production facilities in Asia in order to utilize the region's relatively cheap labor (Table 18). China, where labor costs are especially cheap, has emerged as an important production base for mass market apparel. At the present time, however, technical standards for cloth and dying and quality control are still inadequate, and quality control is being handled in Japan. Cut cloth is then exported and sewn and assembled locally. Thus, there has developed a form of specialization or division of labor. Statistical data clearly show changes of this kind with regard to Japan's import partners. Until 1990, Korea was the apparel industries number one importer; then, from 1991, when wages went up and Korea lost its price-competitiveness, China assumed that head position (Table 19). While inexpensive (mass market) apparel is being imported from Asia, domestic apparel makers are manufacturing expensive items (high value added items whose selling point is superior design), which cannot be produced overseas, and are thus creating a division of labor in terms of imported items and domestically manufactured items.

Steel Industry In addition to being one of the items subject to managed trade and to voluntary export restrictions, steel exports have dropped in volume (quantitatively) because they have become less price-competitive following the yen's appreciation after the Plaza Accord. However, the total dollar amount of steel exports has shown very little change, and proportionally more high value added items are being exported Table 20). Specifically, while high value added export items like surface treated steel sheeting (for use in auto bodies and treated to prevent corrosion) and special steel materials exports are increasing, the export of low value added products like hot rolled steel and bar iron is decreasing (Table 21). On the other hand, the trend seems to be toward a steady growth in imports from Taiwan and Korea, both in terms of quantitative and cash volume. (In 1992, however, there was a large drop in import volume because the domestic economy was entering an adjustment phase.) Types of steel materials being imported are for the most part low value added products like pig iron, semi-finished steel ingot products and hot rolled steel sheets (Table 22). A comparison of unit prices for imports and exports indicates that the latter is about twice that for imports, indicating the development of a "segregation of niche" (Table 20). In the United States, where the steel industry's primary overseas expansion has occurred, Japanese steel makers, responding to concerns about U.S.-Japan trade friction, began by providing U.S. manufacturers with technical assistance and, at present, are undertaking production in the form of mergers with U.S. steel manufacturers. This does not mean, however, that re-imported steel from the United States has increased; rather products manufactured in the United States are being sold on the local market. Japanese steel makers have also provided technical cooperation to developing nations, and as the technical level in those countries improves, inexpensive steel will probably start being exported to Japan in earnest (Table 23.)

Changes in Trade Structure as Seen From the Perspective of International Air Cargo From the latter half of the 1980's, a structural change has been occurring in Japanese industries, with a move away from large-scale and heavy industries (e.g., steel and shipbuilding), where there has been declining price competitiveness, toward high value added light industries (semiconductors and electronic parts, office equipment, scientific and optical equipment, and video equipment). Also, with the transfer of production bases overseas, there has been an increase in the transport of materials and assembly parts as well as maintenance parts to service equipment and machinery. In order to meet delivery deadlines, air cargo services are being utilized. Moreover, along with the global development of horizontal trade (intra-industry trade), Japan's volume of high value added import products has also increased. Through these changes, there has been a shift (particularly noticeable with exports) from surface freight to air cargo in terms of international distribution. This shift can be traced, using as our indicator the ratio of air cargo export volume to total export volume. In terms of the dollar-valued amount of this air cargo, too, we can see that, regionally, there has been a deepening of economic ties with Asia (Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries) where Japanese enterprises have established production bases. 1. Increasing Ratio of Air Cargo Because there has been a shift in Japan's export structure toward high value added industries and, along with foreign direct investments by Japanese enterprises, an increase in exported parts from Japan, there has also been a steady growth in exports shipped as air cargo. Specifically, 1970 figures indicate a 4.1 percent growth in the dollar-valued ratio of air cargo exports to total exports and a 0.2 percent increase in tonnage. By 1992, these ratios had climbed to 15.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively (Table 27). With an increasing volume of high value added imports like diamonds, pharmaceutical goods, semiconductors and electronic parts and office equipment, there has also been a growth in air cargo on the import front. In 1970, the dollar-valued ratio of air cargo imports to total imports rose by 7.9 percent and, in terms of tonnage, by 0.01 percent. By 1992, these figures had grown to 21.1 percent and 0.13 percent, respectively. The percentages are low when considering tonnage, but that is because heavy raw materials and resources like crude oil and liquified natural gas make up a large percentage of Japan's import structure (Table 28). Carriage rates for air cargo are about ten times that for sea freight, so during recessions, companies will send via sea rather than air in order to cut down on their operating expenses (in other words, in the short term, the ratio of air-to-sea for international delivery will be influenced by economic trends). Since 1991, when Japan's economy entered an adjustment phase, companies have been increasingly conscious of the mounting distribution costs associated with just-in-time (JIT) deliveries--an accommodation to the small volume, diversified product approach taken by manufacturers in recent years--and the pressure these costs are placing on profits. In terms of both exports and imports, then, there has been a tendency toward stagnant or falling growth rates in air cargo and, in fact, for two years straight--from 1991 through 1992--the dollar amount of air cargo imports fell in absolute terms. From the beginning of 1993, however, the volume of air cargo imports (in dollars) appears to be rising. In terms of predominant trends, we can expect Japan's manufactured exports to shift toward high value added products. If there is a cut in air cargo rates due to a buildup of air cargo carrier capacity, we should be able to see a clear upward trend in air cargo ratios as the domestic economy improves. Table 27.

Regional Trends in Air Cargo Exports Of the $11.02 billion in exports shipped as air cargo in 1980, the largest dollar amount went to the United States (29.4 percent), followed by $2.67 billion to the EC (24.2 percent) and $2.63 billion to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries (23.9 percent). In 1992, the total volume of air cargo exports amounted to $53.8 billion, or about 4.9 times the amount in 1980. By region, exports to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries amounted to $18.84 billion (35.0 percent). This 7.2-fold increase over 1980 is due to an increase in exported parts to Asia, where Japanese enterprises are furthering local production, and to an increased demand in recent years for Japanese office equipment. Exports to Asia were more than the amount, $17.68 billion (35 percent) that went to the United States, showing the close economic ties that now exist between Asia and Japan (Table 29). Imports The largest percentage of all import from 1980 to 1992 consistently came from the United States. EC's share has also increased significantly since 1986, but with the collapse of Japan's bubble economy and a sudden drop in luxury items (paintings, diamonds, etc.), import figures have been falling since 1991. Increased local production by Japanese enterprises since the latter half of the 1980's led to steady increases in imports from Asian NIE's and ASEAN member-countries in 1991 and 1992. This increase was primarily in re-imported items such as office equipment and semiconductor and electronic parts. Looking at import trends in absolute dollar amounts [rather than percentage shares], we see that imports from the United States and EC countries declined in 1991 and 1992 while increasing steadily with regard to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries, thus showing the development along the import front of horizontal trade between Japan's economy and these Asian countries (Table 30).

Summary Behind the sharp rise in Japanese foreign direct investments and the furthering of local production by Japanese enterprises, we can see, as major factors, their response to trade friction and the steep rise in the yen's value during the latter half of the 1980's. As overseas production began, Japan's trade structure also began to undergo significant changes as the production of manufactured goods which had lost their price-competitiveness shifted from domestic industries to overseas bases. Trend has caused concern about the "hollowing out" of some of Japan's industries at home. A detailed examination of trends within specific industries, however, shows an aggressive effort by Japanese enterprises to shift domestic production in the direction of high value added manufactured items that do not have to be price-competitive. For example, in the textile and home electronics industries, high quality items (high value added products) are exported after being produced at home, while mass market items (low value added products) are re-imported to Japan after being made at Japanese-owned production plants in developing countries where labor costs are low. This kind of "segregation of niche," we can see, is developing. Future exchange rates will be a factor, of course, but in general, we need not assume that particular industries will lose their competitive edge in every item they produced (from low and intermediate quality items to high quality items) or that there will be a complete hollowing out of those industries. Rather, the trend seems to be toward a greater differentiation of roles in the production field, with domestic industries specializing in high value added, high tech products through the development of innovative technology. While the furthering of local production by Japanese enterprises is inescapable, the course will not necessarily be smooth sailing. It holds out many difficulties, not only in terms of production and production management technology but also in the "soft" sciences of labor and business management. In North America and Europe, where Japanese enterprises were initially motivated to move primarily in order to avoid trade problems, companies are having a tough time in terms of profits, and the situation and future direction of local production there warrants careful attention. In Asia, on the other hand, companies were motivate by the sound economic desire to seek cheap labor and are seeing satisfactory profits. At present, North America remains the most important region for Japan in terms of local production; but it seems only natural that, with the growing, future potential of the Asian market, Japanese enterprises will be embarking on overseas corporate strategies that stress the importance of Asia. Designating Asia as a production base not only means a production base for exports but also signifies Asia's transformation into a production base targeting local sales as regional demand expands.
