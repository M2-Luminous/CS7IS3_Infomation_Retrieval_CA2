The fighting broke out as security forces, mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe, carried out an arms sweep intended to disarm civilians from the majority Hutu group following clashes with soldiers. It was unknown whether there were casualties. A military spokesman said soldiers had only fired smoke bombs to encourage civilians to leave the northern suburb of Kamenge and the adjoining neighbourhoods of Cibitoke and Kinama. Armed civilians had reportedly fired mortars from the three areas during several weeks of clashes with soldiers. Military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Bosco Daradangwe said civilians had been "taken hostage by militiamen who wanted to use them as human shields." "We hope that these men will surrender and that we will not need to use tougher measures to disarm them," a government source said. [passage omitted] Civilians were to have laid down their arms Thursday in the presence of diplomats and Interim President Sylvestre Ntybantunganya. But the ceremony never took place because "an extremist group opposed the idea," a diplomat said. The government then ordered the Army to disarm the hardline groups, the diplomat said.
