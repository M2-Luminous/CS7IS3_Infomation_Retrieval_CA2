Silbert, Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: Michael L. Boyle. Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50&hyph;325 and 50&hyph;324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County, North Carolina Date of amendments request: June 17, 1994. Description of amendments request: The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to (1) remove the heatup and cooldown curves from TS 3/4.4.6 and relocate them to a newly created Pressure and Temperature Limits Report, and (2) remove the reactor vessel material surveillance program withdrawal schedule from TS Table 4.4.6.3&hyph;1 and relocate it to the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment [sic] does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the changes are administrative in nature. These changes do not alter the configuration or operation of the facility. The Limiting Safety Systems Settings and Safety Limits specified in the current Technical Specifications remain unchanged. 2. The proposed amendment [sic] does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The safety analysis of the facility remains complete and accurate. There are no physical changes to the facility and the plant conditions for which the design basis accidents have been evaluated are still valid. The operating procedures and emergency procedures are unaffected. 3. The proposed amendment [sic] does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because these margins are established through the Limiting Conditions of Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications, and since there are no changes to the physical design or operation of the facility, these margins will not be changed. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
