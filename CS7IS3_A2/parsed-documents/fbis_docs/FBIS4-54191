"I believe the coalition's continued hold on power is the demands of the times," SDP secretary general Wataru Kubo told reporters after meeting Hata at the premier's official residence. "I told (Hata) a voluntary resignation is one option if he wishes to form a new coalition government and solidify his power base," he said. Hata replied that he will strive to fulfill his duties as head of government, Kubo said. Hata agreed to meet SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the second largest opposition party, whenever necessary, to compare notes on issues of mutual concern, Kubo said. Kubo also said Saturday that the Hata cabinet should resign as soon as the fiscal 1994 budget wins Diet approval, and before the opposition camp submits a no-confidence motion against the government. Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDP, said this to Japanese reporters traveling with him on his trip to China, indicating the SDP may move to bury the hatchet with its former coalition partners and join a new ruling union. Questioned Thursday about the possibility of the SDP's return to the coalition, Kubo said he did not discuss the matter with the premier in their meeting. In late April, the SDP broke away from the coalition in protest against the formation by other coalition parties of a new parliamentary group excluding the SDP, the alliance's largest contingent. As a result, Hata was forced to lead the first minority government since 1955. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition group, has threatened to introduce a motion of no-confidence against the Hata cabinet after passage of the budget. Defeat on such a motion would leave the premier with a choice of either resigning or calling a snap general election. If Hata quit after a no-confidence vote, Kubo said, he would have no other choice but to hand the reins of government over to the LDP. On the other hand, he said, if a snap poll is called after Diet passage of the budget, it should be contested under the current multiseat electoral system, which is to be replaced by a new system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. Hata contends that the next general election must be called under the new system, which, however, requires the enactment of a bill to redraw the electoral map. To hold an election under the old system would be to abandon political reform, he says. Kubo visited Hata to relay the reply of Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin to the premier's personal letter he handed over when he met the Chinese leader.
