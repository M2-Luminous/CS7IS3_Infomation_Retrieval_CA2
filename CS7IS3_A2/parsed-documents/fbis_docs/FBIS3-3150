In answering a question regarding the issuance of treasury bonds this year, Liu Zhongli said: A total of 100 billion yuan of treasury bonds are planned to be issued this year. Although the total amount of bonds issued is much larger than that of last year, the issue is expected to go smoothly because the financial order this year is good, the bonds have a preferential interest rate, and the method of issuance has greatly improved. In particular, banking institutions have cooperated closely to handle issuance work on this occasion. Bonds will be underwritten by banks and other financial institutions, which will be responsible for resale to investors who can make purchases at any time. Because they are easy to purchase and because of other favorable conditions, including the inflation-proof interest rate, the work will be supported by the people. Speaking of China's foreign debts, Liu Zhongli said: China has achieved great results in utilizing international funds in recent years. The total amount of China's current foreign debts is $80 billion, including funds provided by foreign investors of Chinese-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, as well as loans obtained by enterprises and the government. At present, the ratio of China's total foreign debts to its annual export value is 90 percent and its debt service ratio is 7.6 percent, which are far lower than the internationally recognized warning levels, which are 100 percent in debt ratio and 15 percent in debt service ratio. China has enjoyed a good international credit rating. As of last February, China's foreign exchange reserve had increased to $27.2 billion from $21.2 billion recorded at the end of last year. Speaking of ways to reduce this year's deficit, Liu Zhongli said: We will no longer use bank overdrafts to cover our deficit. Instead, we hope to reduce the deficit first by effectively controlling the scale of capital construction; and second, by reducing the loss of tax revenues through implementation of the new taxation system. In response to a reporter's question on whether the introduction of the tax-revenue-sharing system will affect state revenue, Liu Zhongli answered: Judging from developments in the first two months after introduction of this system, the overall situation is good. The state's revenue reported a relatively large increase over the previous year, growing 31.2 percent. The increase in expenditures, however, is also not small. Therefore, it is necessary for us to keep a sober mind. We should promptly take measures to solve problems cropping up during the course of carrying out the tax-revenue-sharing system to gradually perfect it. In response to a reporter's question on whether implementation of the revenue-sharing system implies that the central government is withdrawing the delegated authority and China's policy allowing some regions to become prosperous ahead of others has changed, Liu Zhongli said: Revenue-sharing is a commonly practiced system throughout the world. The revenue-sharing tax system we are implementing has borrowed the experience of developed countries while taking into consideration China's national conditions. In implementing the system, the central government has not withdrawn the delegated authority. It is true that more tax revenues will be collected by the central government, but they will be returned to localities through a refund system. The refund will use 1993's actual revenue receipts as the base, and the refunded amount will be available to localities to use in prescribed ways. Naturally, the central government will appropriately collect more revenues from the increased portions of tax receipts, which is necessary. Besides, the central government will also return a fixed proportion of the increased revenues to localities. In response to a reporter's question on whether the implementation of the revenue-sharing tax system will affect economic growth in coastal and other developed provinces and municipalities, Liu Zhongli said: Implementation of the revenue- sharing tax system will not and should not affect local economic growth. Economic growth in the first two months following implementation of the system has made this clear. Under the revenue-sharing tax system, the central and local governments will share added-value taxes from a growing economy. This benefits both the central and local governments. A reporter asked: Comrades in the central and western regions are worried that with implementation of the revenue-sharing tax system, the central government will abolish some of the preferential policies granted to central and western regions; how should this question be approached? Vice Finance Minister Xian Huaicheng said: There is no need to worry about that. Implementation of the system will not change the existing interest distribution pattern, and the subsidies given by the central government to central and western regions, and poor provinces and autonomous regions in the past will continue. Some of the original preferential policies will be retained if they accord with regulations. Besides, a payment shift [zhuan yi zhi fu 6567 4448 2388 0102] system will be established following implementation of the revenue-sharing tax system, which will benefit central and western regions, and poor provinces and autonomous regions most. Jin Xin, deputy director of the State General Administration of Taxation, attended the news conference.
