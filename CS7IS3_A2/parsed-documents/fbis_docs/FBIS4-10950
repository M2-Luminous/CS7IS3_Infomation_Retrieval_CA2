According to a statement made by the PNP's [Peruvian National Police] general director, Victor Alva Plasencia, this measure is being applied in a general context of police reorganization, and is not limited to the DINCOTE. Nevertheless, there are indications that the changes in the DINCOTE are attributable to a higher political realm, in which not even President Alberto Fujimori himself holds all the decision-making power. According to unofficial information, the DINCOTE has five police units called Deltas, each of which has approximately 35 members and is under orders from a commander. Their task is to support the intelligence work and the operations planned on the directorate levels. Concurrently, there is the Special Intelligence Group (GEIN), engaged in intelligence work per se, and constructing and refining its own data base in order to track the leading suspects. On a certain occasion, the GEIN was divided into one group devoted to SL [Shining Path] and another devoted to the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]. There are also the BREDET, initials designating the brigades that follow up reports frequently provided by the public on suspected houses or persons. The work of a DINCOTE member is quite arduous. Officers and some of the subordinate personnel often work for consecutive periods lasting 12 or 16 hours a day. Moreover, on many occasions their stint lasts 24 hours, because of the proximity of an operation. Despite the intense work and the constant danger to which each member of the operative groups is exposed, he is not compensated monetarily. For example, a captain's pay is from 400 to 450 soles ($215), not counting the amount deducted. A junior officer, on the other hand, earns approximately 300 soles ($140). A DINCOTE operative member, among those stationed for hours to spy on a suspect, receives 5 soles of per diem for his entire long work assignment. Recently, the DINCOTE personnel had a pay cut. At the end of January, their annual bonus for hazardous work was reduced. According to one official, this occurred despite the fact that the budget allocated to the DINCOTE for 1993 had included this extra income. Two days before they were to receive the bonus, the agents were informed of a 70 percent reduction in the incentive bonus. Hence, if an officer was supposed to receive 225 soles, he was given only 65 new soles; whereas a junior officer, who would have received 160 more than his salary, earned only 40 soles. According to members of this institution, until General Ketin Vidal's administration, "the DINCOTE was far more compact, and the entire group's motivation was sustained. There were no objections when it was necessary to engage in any operation." Furthermore, the operative members had a certain amount of autonomy for carrying out their missions, without lapsing into a mechanical job. Now, the situation in the DINCOTE reportedly has deteriorated in all these respects. There are fewer resources for operations, and there is more inflexibility in the instructions. The National Intelligence Service's [SIN] excessive interference in the management of operations and personnel has become another debatable feature of the present-day DINCOTE. Two copies of every case file or record prepared in the DINCOTE must be submitted to the SIN, without any reciprocity implied. Some officers criticize what they claim to be the unwillingness shown by the chiefs, including their present general director, to defend their own decision-making power, unlike what was typical of them until December 1992. Some of the SIN's intervention in the DINCOTE is backed by legal regulations stipulating that the SIN shall receive the support of qualified forces so long as it lacks the necessary personnel. However, that support to the SIN is now becoming a virtual decapitation of the DINCOTE. Recently, the "Sunday Review" news program on television Channel 4 announced the transfer of 14 DINCOTE officers, including lieutenants, captains, majors, and colonels, to the SIN. Nevertheless, the number of officers transferred is said to be even higher. Among those transferred to the SIN is a colonel who, according to very well-informed sources, was the real director of the investigations making it possible to capture Abimael Guzman and scores of other Shining Path leaders. Another colonel, the principal expert in the investigations of the MRTA, was transferred to a province in late 1993. Moreover, nearly 90 percent of the total personnel transferred to the SIN were members of the Delta and Special Intelligence (GEIN) groups. The other 10 percent are assimilated or administrative personnel. The objective no longer seems to be merely to obtain support, but rather to expropriate intelligence from the DINCOTE, so as to put its best investigators under the direct control of military intelligence. The particular goal would be to put them under the command of Vladimiro Montesinos, President Fujimori's principal adviser on the subject of subversion, and one of the SIN's preeminent spokesmen. Now then, the following question is fitting: Why reinforce military intelligence so much, at the cost of debilitating the DINCOTE, which has been the state's real mainstay for repressing subversion? Furthermore, why do so in a situation wherein subversion is plummeting? The most plausible, and perhaps also the most suspicious response is that such personnel will be assigned to other investigations dissociated from the countersubversive types. With the SL decline, other adversaries are taking priority: others to be located, checked, and neutralized. The drug traffic? If that were the target aimed at, the DINANDRO [National Police Counternarcotics Directorate] should have been the unit reinforced with ex-DINCOTE personnel. Or, in any event, the SIN would have requested DINANDRO rather than DINCOTE officers to reinforce it in this mission. The military and civilian opposition? Therein lies the explanation. There is no doubt that the La Cantuta case, the leaks to the press of classified information provided by the Comaca or Leon Dormido groups, and the charges by certain officials of generals' being implicated in the drug traffic are becoming the main factor in the erosion of the current military commanders and of the government itself. Hence, one of the adversaries, possibly the principal one, that should be targeted, is the military opposition. The other is the civilian opposition which, as the electoral period approaches, will be as dangerous as the dissidents in uniform, or more so. The problem is that three processes detrimental to the country's democratic order are implicit in all this: the subordination of the armed institutions to the government's particular political interest; the military control of the major police units; and the weakening of the DINCOTE when the Shining Path terrorist adventure has not yet been totally stifled. On the other hand, what the country's general interest requires is the same as what befits forces of order with a democratic inclination and professional excellence: submission to the law, clear demarcation of military and police jurisdictions, and genuine recognition for the merit of the police units performing their duty.
