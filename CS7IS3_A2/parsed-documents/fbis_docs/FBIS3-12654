You have conveyed a message from Yasir 'Arafat to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. What does the message contain? ['Urayqat] In fact, the message was conveyed to the Israeli negotiators by telephone last Friday. The message urges the Israeli Government to make four moves. First, to disarm the settlers; second, to dismantle the settlements in Gaza and Hebron; third, to provide international protection; and fourth, to place the settlements issue at the top of the agenda. The Israel Government replied by adopting certain decisions, which do not rise to the required level and which lack seriousness. The PLO Executive Committee studied the issue and found that the decisions and replies did not contribute to peace efforts. In light of the incidents that followed the massacre in the occupied Palestinian territories, including the settlers' continued terrorist and provocative activity and the Israeli Army's continued killings of Palestinian citizens, the Israeli Government is once again required to take practical and realistic measures, rather than mere formalities, like the ones it has taken in the past. This is exactly what happened and this is what was conveyed to the Israeli delegations in Washington. [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib: Where do we stand now regarding the future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? ['Urayqat] I believe that negotiations are not a goal in and of themselves. They are a means to achieve a goal. We believe that as a result of the terrorist operation in the city of Hebron, the current negotiations face a sharp turning point. Any negotiations that do not deal with settlements will be fruitless. Therefore, Israeli measures should deal with content rather than form. [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib: Have you ruled out the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations before the PLO's conditions are met? ['Urayqat] We are not talking about conditions. We state clearly that life will not go on as it used to do before the massacre that took place against our people in Hebron. The U.S. Administration took procedures to move the negotiations from one place to another. This is a procedural matter and cannot influence the situation. What is required now is serious Israeli and U.S. moves. [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you very much. ['Urayqat] You are welcome.
