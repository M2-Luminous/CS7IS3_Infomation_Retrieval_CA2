On Friday [25 March], Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of the Jews in Germany, reacted with these words to the arson attack on the synagogue in Luebeck. Such actions are not least due to the "mental arsonists" who create the climate for it with virulent campaigns and hate slogans, Bubis told DPA. For him, the real arsonists are extreme right parties, such as the Republikaner, the German People's Union, the National Democratic Party of Germany, and others of a total of 82 rightist groups and parties. Bubis said that the fact that synagogues are targets of attacks by extreme right groups is new. In the past two years, Jewish graves and memorials were desecrated, but no synagogues. As a consequence of the incident in Luebeck, Bubis called for more severe social ostracism of "arsonists" and stricter punishment of the perpetrators. "Authorities and courts still have not understood that warnings and educational measures are not enough to deter right-wing extremists from such actions," the chairman of the Central Council said.
