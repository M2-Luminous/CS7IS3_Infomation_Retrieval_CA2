During the meeting they examined the implementation of the Geneva cease-fire agreement and the agreement on the exchange of prisoners, and the development of the situation in Gorazde. We have concluded that the agreement of the countries is being observed, de Mello said for the B-H PRESS agency after the talks, even though there have been cases of cease-fire violations. We hope that in the course of the coming week a new meeting of the warring sides will take place in order to promote this agreement and prolong it by at least another month, he added. Speaking about the meeting at Sarajevo Airport, where the fate of prisoners and the missing persons was discussed, de Mello expressed optimism, emphasizing that the two sides were interested in making progress in this sphere, too. Regarding Gorazde, it was agreed which steps must still be undertaken to allow the residents return to their homes in the areas [words indistinct] around the town.
