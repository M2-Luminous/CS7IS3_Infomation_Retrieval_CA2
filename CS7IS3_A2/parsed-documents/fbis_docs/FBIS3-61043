Tokyo has not experienced such pressure in a long time. Let us recall that the topic was broached for the first time at expert level at the end of this summer, after which a U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense came to Tokyo to "push" the idea and was followed by the Secretary himself. The subject has also been explained to the head of the Japanese cabinet, including at top-level meetings with the U.S. President. Tokyo is clearly in no hurry to give a positive reply but the lack of feedback is simply making the Americans even more persistent -- it has come to light that the next round of special talks on the missile project is scheduled for 15 December in Hawaii, and this haste is due to the Americans' insistence. The Americans are pressuring Tokyo by consciously fueling passions over North Korea's missile successes. Indeed, it all began with those successes. As soon as it became known that the DPRK had successfully tested its latest ballistic development [razrabotka] with an operational radius of 1,000 km and can now potentially "reach" virtually anywhere on Japanese territory, the U.S. side began actively exploiting Japan's natural concern. The thesis of the North Korean threat was rapidly fostered in Japan and many people in the country took fright -- due to Pyongyang's reputation for unpredictability and the fact that the Japanese have no effective means of protection against such weapons. Meanwhile, U.S. sources added new elements to the story and fanned those fears. People in Tokyo have begun talking with renewed force about Pyongyang's military superiority, contrasting this superiority with Japan's defenselessness against North Korea's missiles. The U.S. attempts to involve Japan in the development of the new ABM system is based meanwhile not so much on military factors as on economic ones -- it will cost at least $12 billion which, given the present defense spending cuts, does not exist. There is another factor -- technological questions. The U.S. side is proposing the Patriot system as the basis of the design project, a system which must be properly "upgraded" using a number of Japanese technologies which the Americans do not possess. Tokyo can easily read between the lines here and see all this and is determinedly shying away from the U.S. proposals. It is certainly not a question of money or the prospect of sharing technological innovations that worry the Japanese here. Those who know about these things believe that there are two other factors which are proving the main obstacle to progress -- first, the implementation of the U.S. proposal requires substantial adjustments to Japan's defense policy and objectively necessitates a review of a whole range of related problems, including the Japanese-U.S. security treaty itself; second, the Patriot system does not inspire great hopes as a worthy basis for the design -- during the Persian Gulf war its effectiveness against Iraq's missiles, whose characteristics are close to those of North Korea, was lamentably low. It is noteworthy that recently the Japanese mass media have been spreading reports on the inadequacies and deficiencies of the Patriot system and on the vagueness of the very concept offered by the United States. This counterattack mounted against the U.S. obsession is gaining momentum at such an admirable rate that the prospect of the forthcoming talks in Hawaii is already in doubt -- the Japanese do not intend "subscribing" to the Pentagon's venture at the moment.
