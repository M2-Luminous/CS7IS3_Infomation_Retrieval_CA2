He pointed out that the plans being prepared aim to find an urgent solution to the problem of lack of land in Gaza for constructing houses. Al-Agha said that the Palestinians are in need of 250,000 housing units, 110,000 of them are needed in Gaza and he refuses to build skyscrapers of more than eight storeys each. "We want to keep the general character of Gaza." Al-Agha revealed that the headquarters of his ministry will be in Gaza, and indicated that the reason behind this decision is that his ministry will be needed there as most of its work will be focused in Gaza, while branches of the ministry in other parts will be in the West Bank and Jerusalem. He expects that these projects will absorb most of the labor force in construction. "The implementation of this plan will need 150,000 laborers," he added. Al-Agha said that his ministry will coordinate with the Higher Palestinian Council and will try to enroll the council with the ministry responsibilities.
