Pavlyutkin, under the rubric: "Distress Signal": "The Elite... Has Been Left With Nothing"] [Text] To Reduce Like We've Never Reduced Before?! Nuclear Submarine Commander Captain 1st Rank A. Shchurenko, a generally unworried and smiling man, looked tired and tense during these last days before putting to sea. Among the multitude of commander's concerns, one especially did not give him any peace: An important piece of equipment had recently malfunctioned during operations. Under conditions of the large amount of work required to repair this mechanism, it would be best of all to replace it or, in the worst case, to call in the repairmen. But it turns out that the base does not have the required spare parts and the specialists are far away. Well commander, rely just on yourself and also on your subordinates who have been exhausted by evening watches. "By the way, the submarine is under warranty but it is currently practically impossible to eliminate the defect through the efforts of specialists," you couldn't even sense the irritation in Aleksey Grigoryevich's voice and, obviously, how much he hated everything. "And this while the guarantee enterprises have special maintenance teams. However, try to summon these specialists, especially from other republics!" "We receive the following telegrams in response to our requests: They say, so, the warranty is still in effect but, since we can't send specialists, do the repairs yourselves," Submarine Task Force Deputy Commander Captain 1st Rank V. Kotomkin entered the conversation. "Excuse me, what kind of strange warranty is that?", Vladimir Ivanovich shrugs his shoulders in bewilderment. "And the fact is that, having found themselves in a difficult economic situation, the enterprises have stopped paying temporary duty assignment expenses to their specialists. These people even receive their salaries on an irregular basis. The navy is simply incapable of assuming responsibility for all of the expenses, including the mandatory prepayment although that is what the guarantee enterprises insist on. In a word, a dead end..." Unfortunately, right now no one can say: Ultimately, how long will this "self-service" maintenance continue? Today it is senseless to count on appeals for order that aren't backed up or for the accomplishment of obligations. The current military-industrial complex's main argument is the economic slip-knot that is being increasingly tightened by the government. Moreover, many of its enterprises have turned out to be isolated from each other by the impenetrable fences of the sovereign states. And if we can still somehow solve the problems that arise using Russian producers and repairmen, matters are significantly more complicated with the "near-abroad". Indeed, the unregulated market relations in Russia also engender paradoxes. A simple example. A plant that specializes in the manufacture of fluorescent bulbs unilaterally reduced deliveries to the navy. It seems like a minor detail but try to find a replacement for them! A similar situation exists with spare parts kits and with many other things. The traditional question: "How can that be?" -- still requires a legitimate answer. It's quite obvious that neither the navy nor the Ministry of Defense can independently untie that knot. But we think that this problem is quite solvable at the intergovernmental level. Conclusion of the necessary agreements is the only rational solution to the situation today. Only, will we be able to find the resources to carry out those agreements? We recall that, after the "Komsomolets" tragedy, there were many conversations and many decisions were made to improve warranty maintenance of submarines that remain unfulfilled. As a result, the state of affairs has deteriorated even further today. Yes, and how could it be otherwise if the resources that are currently being allocated do not cover even minimal requirements? In our country at each step we have examples of borrowing experience from the West but for some reason this approach is not being employed with regard to the navy. For example, in the U.S. Navy, the strength of support subunits exceeds the number of shipborne specialists by a factor of 5-6. In our country, where we traditionally follow our own path, previously we did the opposite and even more so right now. In one nuclear submarine task force, while following the regulation to reduce so-called noncombat subunits, they eliminated the coastal base and are disbanding two maintenance crews. Well it turns out that sentries, the guard, galley details, policing the area, alert duty at the entry control point, patrols, and so on and so forth -- all of this will lie on the shoulders of submarine combat crews and one more or less important plan --preparation for winter -- hangs in the task force commander's office in a visible place alongside the BP [operation order] plan. And yet hope flickers within me that maybe matters are somewhat better in other garrisons? Alas.... "The situation is serious and there is an extreme shortage of material resources and financing," Rear-Admiral M. Motsak, commander of another task force, told me. "We are trying to allocate those crumbs that we do have in such a manner as to support at least the most combat capable ships. But that is difficult to do. We are increasingly delaying routine maintenance and the number of submarines with overdue periods between repairs is increasing. Today, only one of four warranty equipment repair and maintenance organizations is in full-fledged operation. But on the other hand, commercial structures and small enterprises are growing like mushrooms after the rain. These commercial structures and small enterprises are splitting off from the ship repair plants that are also experiencing hard times. They are enticing the best specialists to their organizations. The navy has been compelled to turn to their services in order not to remain without any repairs at all. And although they are asking high prices for work, the quality of repairs is not increasing because of this and the time periods for repairs are being continuously dragged out. Judge for yourself, under these conditions is it easy to maintain the required level of technical readiness of ships? "The duration of submarine service is drastically declining as a result of the disruption of their operating cycle (the most important element of which is maintenance). We are `doing everything we can' to maintain submarines at the combat capable level for as long as possible..." "Objectively, the navy's qualitative level has deteriorated," Nuclear Submarine Task Force Chief of Staff Captain 1st Rank V. Avlastimov said. "New models of weapons and equipment have nearly stopped entering the inventory. Those that were in the developmental stage at one time have remained drawings. Test ranges and NII [scientific research institutes] are being closed and high-tech production is being shutdown. Promising developments and experience and unique specialists are being lost. Before our eyes, we are retreating from formerly leading positions in this sphere. What will the navy be like tomorrow?" That question is far from rhetorical. According to some data, in recent years the number of technical developments has been reduced by nearly a factor of ten. The most important priorities have been lost, for example, in the sphere of the utilization of titanium, where domestic shipbuilding had far outstripped foreign shipbuilding. We continue to finish building certain series of nuclear submarines probably because that is cheaper and easier than to completely shutdown production. As for strategic submarines, here the situation is even worse. Existing future developments of submarines have practically been frozen when the time for medium repair is approaching for the submarines that we have in operation and for which we do not yet have resources nor do we have resources for their modernization. Meanwhile, in accordance with the START treaties, the strategic forces naval component is emerging in first place. Won't it turn out that Russia will be left without its nuclear shield? ... But We Have Nowhere To Go "How do you like the wardroom?", Captain 2nd Rank S. Fedorychev, deputy task force commander for personnel, sympathetically asked me. Having noted my embarrassment, he cleverly added from the reply: "Of course, the food is terrible and, as they say, we are switching over from millet to pearl barley. Standards are not being maintained but it's difficult to blame the supply people for that -- there's nothing in the warehouses. Even if some submarine or other is being prepared to put to sea, it is a problem to supply its crew with the most basic necessities. There is also a certain "innovation": There are frequently shortages in the boxes of provisions that are packed at the plants." We sat in a small cabin, we drank tea, and we talked "about life" at a leisurely pace. Sergey Anatolyevich has devoted 25 years of his life to the navy. He has primarily served in the surface fleet -- on combatants, on diesel ships, and later -- on nuclear submarines. He has performed 12 combat tours. "I have something with which to compare this," continued Fedorychev. White-haired, good-natured, and kind, he completely corresponded to the customary model of a man whom life has made wise. "In general, the people have not changed during this time but the attitude toward them has become worse. Many junior officers frankly say: You have no place to go, you have already served for so long, but we do not want to repeat your path. They see quite well in people like me the example of what prospects await them. If I am released into the reserve -- where will my family and I end up, without housing? Crowd ourselves in with my elderly parents? And the majority are finding themselves in that situation... That is why people are increasingly leaving the navy. "We had Senior Lieutenant Nikolay Matrosov -- commander of the mine-torpedo department -- on our submarine. A hard to find kind of specialist. And he served well and he showed great promise but, having written his request for release, he departed. Acoustic Team Commander Captain-Lieutenant Sergey Vasilevich is also planning to leave for the civilian sector. You could say he is going nowhere, he doesn't have any rear services support but even that, in his opinion, is better than continuing to serve. Right now it is not prestigious to be a submariner and the material position obviously does not correspond to the labor spent and to those dangers and deprivations that seamen experience. It's not surprising that, at the slightest opportunity, officers and warrant officers are leaving the navy for business. Yes, that's what I'm saying! My son finished school but he doesn't want to hear about any advantage whatsoever about becoming a submariner and I myself do not wish his fate to repeat mine with the possibility of finding himself left with nothing..." Having been silent for a while, Sergey Anatolyevich considered it necessary to add: "But then again, no matter how much we in the crew argue or are indignant, or how much we discuss, when the ship puts to sea -- everything else becomes secondary. For the time being, duty and the Fatherland is not an empty sound for people. The question is -- for how long? The social experience of the older generations is not passing without a trace and if today much is being maintained in the old mode, it's hard to say what will happen tomorrow..." The cause of that concern is understandable; already right now the cadre shortage is tenaciously grasping the throat. The loss of the Baku and Sevastopol naval schools hit the Russian submarine fleet especially hard. The shortage of people naturally is reflected in the combat readiness of ships; before putting out to sea, they have to be brought up to full strength with the required specialists, having immediately activated several crews. The number of temporary duty personnel sometimes reaches one fourth of the assigned strength! And, in violation of the requirements of guiding documents, replacements and transfers are being conducted until the very last moment. Commenting on the situation, Nuclear Submarine Task Force Commander Vice-Admiral A. Shevchenko stated in that same vein: "No matter where you go now, we are being held to that old strength reserve. But if the state does not change its attitude toward defense in the near future, the decline will continue. And this will be reflected most of all in cadres -- a real collapse can occur in a couple of years. We, military personnel, have completely performed our duty but the politicians must also understand: If there will be a reliable defense -- there will also be strong statehood..." I agreed with Anatoliy Ivanovich that it seems that this understanding is already beginning to force its way through. For the first time in many years, officers have sensed a real increase of their monetary salary. Although also relative -- with the current insane inflation! -- but still an improvement. The long-awaited law "On the Status of Servicemen" has been adopted. The law is good but (literally everyone has talked about that!) the overwhelming mass of its provisions still remain only on paper. "Why is this occurring? Well, because the law does not have the proper legal and financial support," thinks Northern Fleet Deputy Commander for Personnel Rear-Admiral M. Sviridov. "Let's take a specific example like supplying garrisons. If you believe the law, servicemen and their families can obtain goods and foodstuffs at beneficial prices through the military sales store system. But to do that, it seems the appropriate state subsidies, credits, and the state order are needed, in a word -- financial support. In the absence of that, we have what is available: Commercial sales have inundated the navy with alcoholic beverages, chewing gum and expensive, low-quality, consumer goods. In order to survive, the military sales store is also increasing prices which are becoming even higher than in ordinary state stores. What are the benefits here? "Or," continued Mikhail Ivanovich, "one more problem -- transportation. According to the law, servicemen are supposed to get free travel on all types of city and municipal public transportation. But in our area, people are paying full price on inter-garrison routes to get to their duty locations: We don't have our own buses and we have to lease them from oblast transportation organizations. Where do we get the money to pay? There is only one solution -- pass the hat." I will be frank: Only the lack of housing and the illusory hope for improvement of their situation holds many of the officers whom I've managed to meet on this temporary duty assignment in the service. But increasingly after release into the reserve, officers have been compelled to leave the military garrisons where their service that was full of concerns and deprivations occurred... A Little Bit Goes a Long Way I drove with apprehension into this military garrison where the submariners' families live: I had spent quite a bit of my childhood here. Much had changed in a little over 20 years. The garrison had deteriorated since that time and had become sort of lacking in comforts. Alongside the apartment buildings that had still not been subjected to the test of time are empty five-story buildings with gaping windows without panes, piles of garbage on untidy small streets, the dilapidated Officers' Club, and the boarded up swimming pool. There was the mark of desolation and neglect on everything. But there was a time when Party and state leaders were brought here on "tours", to a village that shined with cleanliness and tidiness. Since that time, as the village was transferred to the balance sheet of the local Soviet, it has not become a real caring owner. More precisely, there aren't resources for its full-fledged maintenance. Maybe the seamen could also help but they themselves, as they say, have deficiency after deficiency. What resources can reach the village right now, say, if we can't always manage to paint the submarines? Degrading poverty, like rust, is eating away all of the pores of the navy organism. It would seem that the nuclear submarines that are at the piers would be provided with the complete standard of high pressure air, feed water, steam and electricity... That is in theory. In fact, the submariners frequently have to count on only their own resources, more precisely, on the ship's service life. Mechanisms are wearing out much earlier than they should and numerous breakdowns are becoming inevitable. "There are submarines," says Nuclear Submarine Commander Captain 1st Rank M. Ivanisov, "that have fired `bubbles' for an entire year due to the shortage of practice torpedoes. Torpedo training schools and the struggles for survival of the ship are being lost..." "Recently, the intensity of cruises, including combat service, has been reduced by a factor of 2-2.5," says another Nuclear Submarine Commander Captain 1st Rank O. Gorelov. "The cruise time per year for any crews does not exceed 2-3 weeks. And actual sea cruises are the primary type of training for us." "Today we are striving to resolve on shore part of the problems associated with the limited number of times ships put to sea -- by training crews in simulators. But we need to improve the MTB [logistic and technical support facilities]; that is, to once again invest resources to do that," Northern Fleet Headquarters Department Chief Captain 1st Rank M. Kolbunov comments on the situation. "But where do we get the resources? There is primarily obsolete equipment at the task forces' training centers and we can't even talk about computers. And in order to acquire them -- you yourself can imagine what kind of resources we need to invest. We don't have money for ordinary light bulbs. Previously there was a powerful training center in Estonia's Paldiski where crews underwent between-cruise training twice a year. Now the center is not functioning. They plan to withdraw all of its equipment which is very complicated and terribly expensive." Currently all the problems of basic support of the navy's vital activities have deteriorated to the maximum extent possible. Say, we need to reload torpedoes but, as frequently happens now, there isn't a crane. But the neighboring construction unit has one. Well, the nuclear submarine commander goes over to beg to use it. Of course, they simply won't give him the crane just for that but they can probably come to an agreement for a couple liters of alcoholic beverages or for two or three boxes of food. It can also be carried to absurdity. The one and only tugboat, and it is not always in working order, serves an entire task force of attack submarines. But according to the standard, three tugs are required to moor other submarines. But then again, if there were three, it still isn't known which KPD [efficiency] they would manage to utilize: Right now diesel fuel is worth its weight in gold. An important problem is to tow a nuclear submarine to the neighboring bay (to do that, in turn you need to refuel the tug). It's sometimes easier and faster to start the nuclear reactor which they occasionally do. A truly Russian scale! It's not surprising that everyday life has also turned out to be in an extraordinarily neglected state. The temperature in some barracks did not rise above 10 degrees all last winter. All of the crew's officers have one cabin to work in and the warrant officers don't even have one. Essentially, the barracks has been turned into an ordinary flophouse. Poverty "has been able to touch" even here. They don't even have any cleaning supplies. When one of the submarines left on an endurance cruise, a surprise awaited its crew: The base had allocated a total of 1.5 boxes of soap! They intended, as they say -- to make a little bit go a long way... Before leaving the military garrison where the submariners' families live, I came to pay my respects at the monument erected on the summit of a small hill in honor of the seamen who died on the nuclear submarine "Komsomolets". Just like the crucifixion, it's as if it floated in the cold sky that was covered by storm clouds. I thought that the submariners, true sons of the Fatherland, had ascended to Calvary on behalf of it. Their comrades serve today for the sake of the Homeland's welfare. Will Mother Russia make it so that this service requires not titanic efforts from Northern Fleet seamen to overcome frequently unresolved problems but would make them happy and would nurture pride in the fact that they are defending a truly great state?
