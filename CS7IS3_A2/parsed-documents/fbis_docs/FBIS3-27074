"Literally they're moving out in convoys, not in individual vehicles," said UN Spokesman Lt. Col Bill Aikman. The pullout of Serb forces came soon after Russian announced that it had persuaded the Serbs to comply with an agreement concluded on February 9 with the United Nations forces and the Muslim-led Bosnian army. Aikman said that General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFER) in Bosnia, "has received information from senior levels of the Bosnian Serb government that they will have their equipment out of a 20-kilometer zone within 36 hours, that means well before the deadline of midnight Sunday night." On February 5, a mortar attack on a crowded market center in Sarajevo, the capital of the warring Bosnia-Herzegovina, killed 68 people and injured over 200. Four days later, the NATO asked all warring sides to withdraw from the area and issued an ultimatum threatening to impose air strikes on positions around the city. The ultimatum expires on Sunday.
