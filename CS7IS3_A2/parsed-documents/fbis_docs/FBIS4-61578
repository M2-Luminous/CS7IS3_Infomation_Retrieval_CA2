The meeting will help to prepare the upcoming Polish visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Shokhin told ITAR-TASS they discussed ways to settle the mutual debt problem, including the "null variants" suggested by the Polish side. Russian and polish ministers of finance will prepare proposals on the issue. Sources at the Polish Government and the Russian delegation told ITAR-TASS, gradual payment of Russian and Polish debts is possible. A partial payment of the debt on the parity basis is also suggested. The sides discussed Polish participation in the construction of the Yamal-Western Europe pipeline via Poland and joint modernization of the Moscow-Berlin highway via Minsk and Warsaw. New forms of payment relations were considered as well. Bearing in mind Russia is against the return to inter-state clearing, the Polish side agreed to consider the forms of payment relations previously suggested by Russian banks, said Shokhin. Poland is concerned over guarantees of the Russian gas delivery. Shokhin said there will be no problem if the Polish consumers pay for the gas as good as the western ones. Russia is also ready to take into account "special circumstances," he said. When in Warsaw, the Russian vice-premier also met his colleagues from the United States, Germany and Japan. A meeting with Japanese Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata resulted in a statement the Japanese Government does not plan to cut cooperation with Russia. The sides discussed aspects of investment cooperation. Aleksandr Shokhin offered Hata to abandon the demand for Russian Government guarantees on most profitable joint projects and the Japanese side agreed to think over this proposal.
