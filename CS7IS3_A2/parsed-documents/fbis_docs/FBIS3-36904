Yeltsin's recent visit to the republic remains the central theme which is being actively discussed both in the press and at an everyday level. And whereas the set of economic agreements has not inspired any particularly emotional assessments, the agreement designed to regulate the presence of the Russian military contingent on Georgian territory has not been spared that fate. It was that fact which predetermined Russia's decision to sign a full 25 documents with the leadership of the one of the most unstable states in the Commonwealth. And this was the main theme of the head of the state's traditional radio interview. "The presence of foreign troops on the country's territory is not a source of pleasure to anyone," E. Shevardnadze stated. "Georgia, which wants to create its own armed forces, has neither the corresponding base nor the armaments. The functioning of the internal troops and the police is being held up by this problem. We have been forced to agree to compromises in order to resolve these questions and obtain the corresponding aid from Russia." There has been no reaction from the Georgian parliament yet. Parliamentarians preferred to leave the satisfaction of setting Shevardnadze another obstacle till later -- until the next session -- so as first to analyze the agreements which have been reached and then be better prepared for the general battle ahead. Meanwhile, on 8 February the head of state signed an edict on the creation of working groups for the preparation of the state symbols of the Republic of Georgia and also for the drafting of an anti-crisis program and the main principles and predictable parameters of economic and social development for 1994-1995. Yesterday Shevardnadze paid an urgent visit to Western Georgia where two passenger trains had collided near the village of Kharagauli 200 km from Tbilisi. According to preliminary information three people were killed.
