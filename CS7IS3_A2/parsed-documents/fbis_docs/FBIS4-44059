Great Britain is also reported to be ready to provide logistic assistance. Italy, for its part, says it is ready to provide support in the form of troops, but with certain conditions attached. The French 60-man detachment, which arrived yesterday afternoon in Cyangugu, in the southwest of Rwanda, is continuing to supply the humanitarian needs of the civilian population of the region this morning, while violent fighting continued between the government forces and the rebels of the Patriotic Front in the capital, Kigali. A mortar shell hit the operating theater of the Red Cross hospital, and sick people may well have been wounded. The United Nations High Commission is expecting a further exodus of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans into neighboring countries, if the soldiers allow them to cross the border.
