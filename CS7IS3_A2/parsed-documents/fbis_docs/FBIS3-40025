I Hope Not'"--first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] [Text] Rome -- "How do you think things are? I am beset with problems and troubles over this business of the electoral lists. It is an absolute disaster. It is incredible, you know...the classic Italian mess." It was 2000 hours [1900 GMT] and Nicola Mancino really was struggling with innumerable problems in his office at the Interior Ministry. The telephone rang continuously, with calls from one "rejected" candidate after another. Some were furious and railed against the "unfair law." Others appealed for lenience and spoke -- or, rather, whispered -- the magic word, indemnity. [LA REPUBBLICA] Will there be an indemnity, Minister? [Mancino] I do not know what to tell you. I see that there is a great deal of talk about it, and that more and more people are urging the government to act. But if you want my opinion, this is properly a matter for the Court of Cassation. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you mean that there will be no indemnity? [Mancino] I did not say that. Let us look at this logically. What should the nature of this indemnity be? And above all, by what means should it be introduced? [LA REPUBBLICA] Well, actually, it is you who should explain that. [Mancino] Precisely, and I will explain: I think that the only way is a government decree. But for this to take place two preconditions must be met. The first is that such a measure be accepted unanimously by the conference of parliamentary group leaders. The second is that the government decide to introduce an indemnity decree. [LA REPUBBLICA] So? [Mancino] So I think it is really unlikely that all the political forces will be willing to accept the provision. As for the government's will to intervene, well, I can tell you that not a single meeting has been convened so far in connection with the disaster of the candidate lists. [LA REPUBBLICA] So, if this is the situation, and in view of the shortage of time, we could say that the indemnity is dead before it is even born. [Mancino] As things stand, I would say so. Be that as it may, for the present I will be sure not to propose a decree. [LA REPUBBLICA] What, then? What kind of election will this be? Is it not paradoxical that an election is taking place at a time when many political forces have been eliminated entirely from whole areas of the country? [Mancino] I do not know what to tell you. Be that as it may, I would not be so pessimistic. The decision lies with the Court of Cassation, which will certainly decide wisely. [LA REPUBBLICA] Perhaps but what does "wisely" mean? [Mancino] It means that I think that it will reach a flexible decision. Look, judging from what I know, I can tell you that there are many different reasons why candidates were rejected. There are some instances in which I think nothing can be done. But in others. [LA REPUBBLICA] Where do you think nothing can be done? [Mancino] Well, first of all, where there has been outright dishonesty. There are instances in which signatures were gathered for one list and then submitted in support of another list. And of course, there are instances where there was a shortage in the number of signatures gathered. Here the candidate or list concerned clearly lacked sufficient strength. Of course, this may be due to innumerable reasons -- bureaucratic impediments, a late start in gathering signatures... But I would say that in such instances the Court of Cassation has no choice but to turn down those lists and candidates. [LA REPUBBLICA] In which cases could it be more flexible? [Mancino] Well, there are instances of real errors due to negligence, instances of irregularities without any offense having been committed. To cite a few examples, a couple of Communist Renewal's candidates in Sicily, where the signatures submitted were exchanged, though still in support of Communist Renewal candidates; or the business of the senatorial constituencies of the Italian Popular Party in Lazio, where the error was the submission of signatures and candidates on the old forms, not the new ones; and also, I would say, where the number of signatures exceeded the ceiling set by the law. [LA REPUBBLICA] Flexibility also in cases where there were too many signatures? Do you not think that is going too far? [Mancino] No, but let us be clear about this. There is one instance of rejection, affecting the League, in which there are only a few dozen signatures more than the set maximum. I can understand the fact that gathering a thousand signatures for a candidate in a municipality of 2,000 inhabitants is impossible, is against the law. But in a major city, or in a constituency of 100,000 inhabitants, 50 signatures extra. [LA REPUBBLICA] But basically the entire business is a disaster. Be honest: There are parties and candidates here that are not even acquainted with the new electoral law. [Mancino] Well, that may perhaps be so. Or perhaps it is even worse than that -- that is, a confirmation that this is a country that is still lagging behind. Complex laws, a public administration that functions badly, and a permanently complex relationship between the citizens and the administration. Just as I was saying, a country that is lagging behind.
