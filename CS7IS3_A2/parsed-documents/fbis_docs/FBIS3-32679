For this reason, President Cristiani does not believe it will be possible for the United Nations to [words indistinct] international agreements on this matter. According to President Cristiani, human rights in El Salvador should not be placed under the same strict scrutiny it was placed under in the past. [Begin Cristiani recording] Our country is no longer within the same framework [words indistinct] constant supervision. On the other hand, we believe that it is more than enough [words indistinct]. [end recording] President Cristiani also shared the concern expressed yesterday on "KL Radio News" by General Mauricio Ernesto Vargas. Gen. Vargas said that some points in the peace agreements are not being respected by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN]. [Begin Cristiani recording] I would like to say that what creates doubt and unrest is the finding of caches and arsenals full of weapons that belong to the FMLN. The FMLN has tried to make the people believe they have surrendered all their weapons and this is not true. This creates some doubt. People wonder if they are planning something other than joining the country's political life. [end recording] Regarding the replacement of Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, director of the UN Observers for El Salvador, President Cristiani said that he has not been officially advised of the replacement by the United Nations. However, it has been said that he will be a Venezuelan.
