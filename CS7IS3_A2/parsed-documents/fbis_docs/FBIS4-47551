Its etiologic agent is a small helminth with an elongated shape and a size of (1-2.5)x(0.4-0.7) mm. The purpose of this study is to examine the morphological pattern of the thin intestine mucous membrane of fish-eating animals. Research material and methodology. The study was carried out in the Ulchskiy rayon of Khabarovsk kray with endemic metagonymiasis. Twelve cats were examined by the method of partial helminthological autopsy. The small intestine and liver were used for the histological study. The material fixed in a 10% formaldehyde solution was poured into paraffin. Five micrometer thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Findings and discussion. No pathological changes were discovered during the histological examination of the liver. A moderate lymphoidal infiltration of the portal tract was discovered only in four out of 12 cats. A study of the empty intestine revealed metagonima which were positioned one by one or in the form of large conglomerates in the intestine clearance, i.e., between the villi and in the crypts (see figure, a-d). Figure Thin feline intestine in the case of metagonymiasis. Magnification x100. Stained with hematoxylin and eosin: a--Metagonimus in the depth of the intestine crypt; b--Metagonimus in the intestinal clearance and freely positioned villi fragments; A large number of enterocytes and diffuse intestinal infiltration of the intrinsic villus plate; c--Two metagonima in the cryptal layer of the atrophic mucous membrane; d--Metagonima conglomeration.</graphic> The changes in the intestinal mucous membrane were mosaic in character. At times, the crypts were elongated, while in the other mucous membrane areas, they were shortened. The villi had different shapes and size. In addition to the usual finger- and leaf-shaped villi, one could also see highly shortened, expanded, and deformed shapes with nonuniform swelling and constrictions. The surface epithelium was deformed, and the boundaries between individual cells-- blurred; the height of the epitheliocytes was reduced, especially at the peaks of the villi where a subepithelial edema was often observed. The number of goblet-shaped cells was sharply decreased, and in some cases, they were arranged in groups (see figure, b, c). Goblet-shaped enterocytes were located not only near the base and in the mid third of the villi but also in the distal section and even at the tips of the villi. Interepithelial lymphocytes were often found among the enterocytes. In the mucous membrane plate proper (both in the villi and cryptal layers), considerable cellular infiltration was revealed (see figure, a, b, c) whereby neutrophile leukocytes were observed alongside lymphocytes and plasmocytes. The above morphological changes in the small intestine's mucous membrane in the case of metagonymiasis should be interpreted as chronic diffuse-focal chronic jejunitis with atrophic phenomena. We should note that detection of metagonima is complicated in histological preparations of the small intestine because their dimensions and shape are very close to those of the intestinal villi and their fragments (see figure, a, b, c). It has been established [1] that the luminal surface of the small intestine in humans and various animals in the case of not only enteropathy but also under physiological conditions contains three agglomerations of epithelial plasty and tubular structures as well as braided and isolated intact villi and their distal fragments with rounded ends (the phenomenon of mucous membrane structure rejection during the lifetime). The free-lying oval-elongated structures also formed in the histological preparations due to the random character of the villi sections (slices). On the other hand, the metagonima conglomerates filled with light brown eggs (see figure g) can be mistaken for unwashed intestinal contents under a low microscope magnification. Thus, metagonymiasis in fish-eating animals is a factor of intestinal disorder which facilitates the development of chronic diffuse-focal jejunitis with atrophic phenomena. Bibliography 1. M.V.
