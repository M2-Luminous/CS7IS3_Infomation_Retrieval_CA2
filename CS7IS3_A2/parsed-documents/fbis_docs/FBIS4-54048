Rice from the Ichon region southeast of Seoul is reputed to be as tasty as Japan's domestic varieties at about one-fourth the cost, said the Fukuoka branch of H.I.S. travel agency. Overseas travelers can bring into Japan up to 100 kilograms of foreign rice annually under Japanese law and with Seoul about an hour's flight from Fukuoka, the agency is hailing the rice tour concept as a "bargain." Tour participants will fly to Seoul and take a bus to Pubal, Kyonggi Province, some 100 kilometers southeast of Seoul, where they will be able to purchase rice from the local agricultural cooperative. According to Kim Kyo-hwan, an official with the farm group, 10 kilograms of rice will cost about 16,000 won or about 2,100 yen. He added that the cooperative can sell about 30 tons of rice. It will also be possible for the tour members to have any rice they cannot carry home with them shipped separately to Japan by the cooperative, the agency said. According to the agency, Japanese tourists have brought home small amounts of rice from overseas as gifts for friends and family members, but its tour will be the first time that the participants will be able to bring home 100 kilograms, which can last an average family two to three months.
