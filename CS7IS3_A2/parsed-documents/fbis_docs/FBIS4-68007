Joelle Aubron, Nathalie Menigon and Jean-March Rouillan fought with gendarmes after Judge Yves Jacob ordered Aubron, 35, to stop reading out a statement in which she denounced his "arrogance" and "simpering manner" and called the trial a "caricature of justice." Aubron resisted attempts to expel her and was badly beaten by gendarmes. Three guards jumped on Action Directe leader Rouillan, 41, who fell to the ground where he was copiously beaten. Menigon, 36, was abruptly removed as sympathisers in court shouted "murderers," prompting Jacob to order them expelled. The trial was adjourned until Tuesday [3 May]. The three are accused of the 1985 murder of General Rene Audran, who was in charge of arms sales at the Defence Ministry and two other attempted murders of defence-related personalities. A fourth accused, Georges Cipriani, 44, faces the same charges, but refused to appear at Monday's hearing. The four are also accused of bomb attacks on the Western European Union (WEU) and Interpol headquarters in Paris in 1984 and 1986. A fifth person, Aseime Rouabah, 47, is accused of supplying part of the explosives used in the Interpol attack. Action Directe grew out of the student revolt of May 1968 and used the same violent methods as the Red Army Faction (RAF) in Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy. Judge Jacob gave Aubron 15 minutes to read a three-page joint statement after all three said they did not intend to take part in the trial. But the judge interrupted Aubron after seven minutes and ordered the three expelled. Defence lawyer Bernard Ripert denounced the "brutality and savagery" of their treatment "although they only wanted to speak for a quarter-of-an-hour." Monday's trial began last November, but was adjourned after the accused rejected their defence lawyers. The four were already sentenced to life imprisonment in January 1989 for the 1986 murder of Renault president Georges Besse. Rouillan and Cipriani are held in solitary confinement but are allowed to meet for 30 minutes daily at exercise. Aubron and Menigon have a softer regime.
