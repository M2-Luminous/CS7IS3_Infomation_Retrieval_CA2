If the undertaking of Sino-foreign cooperative civil aviation is successful, the civil aviation market will be opened up further. This message came from a high-ranking official from CAAC in Beijing and should be described as one of the effective channels for the modernization of China's civil aviation. It is an undeniable fact that China's civil aviation has been developing very quickly since China started opening up, but many drawbacks also exist. By practically cooperating with foreign investors, the virtues can be brought into play to make up for defects, which will be beneficial to both the Chinese and the foreign sides in the cooperation. The undertaking of civil aviation has been monopolized by the state since New China's founding, thus forming a "unifying situation" encompassing investment, construction, and management. The greatest weakness of this practice is that everything relies on the state and that improvement is neglected. The contingent of aviators and air crew are mainly cadres transferred from the Air Force after strict political inspection, thus inevitably paying too much attention to this but setting no demand on the business. We must bear in mind that modern civil administration is closely bound up with high technology. High-precision computers, sophisticated meters, and an increasingly high degree of automation must all be put under human control. For example, new types of aircraft with a high degree of technology, such as Boeing-777, Euro Airbus A-300 and A-301, must be piloted by high-caliber aviators. In order to develop modern civil aviation, China cannot but introduce various new types of aircraft and hugely upgrade the overall quality of pilots and set a much higher demand on technology, otherwise problems will easily arise. Not long ago, a Taiwan airbus "A300-600R" crashed in Nagoya and caused more than 200 casualties, and the tragedy was, as far as we now know, precisely caused by pilot and co-pilot negligence. Normally speaking, "China Airlines" has a longer history, but many instances of "dangerous situations" unavoidably arose when its aviators piloted new types of aircraft. They also admitted that the quality and administration of pilots must be improved. Hence, as far as the training of aviators is concerned, the CAAC must exchange with advanced countries more frequently, and jointly running the business is precisely a realistic and feasible way. The situation is the same in aircraft maintenance. Another criticism of CAAC is that its service conditions are quite poor, in particular, its planes often take off behind schedule. Of course, this relates to such factors as the growth of air routes, frequent flights, inadequate airport facilities, and difficulties in aircraft transfer. Consequently, although the crux of the problem has been clearly known for years, improvement is slow. Under such circumstances, cooperating with foreign advanced airlines on an trial basis and assimilating their management skills in practice can make up China's own deficiencies. It is not the first time that the CAAC has cooperated with foreign investors. For example, the supply of air food is precisely this kind of cooperation with Hong Kong's catering business, whereas joint maintenance is another type of cooperation with Hong Kong enterprises engaging in aircraft engineering projects. This time, the stress will be laid on such key aspects as management and administration, which is an important step. CAAC is ready to cooperate with foreign investors, but there are also some preconditions. That is, under the principle of mainly relying on Chinese investment, foreign businesses can conditionally invest in or run the business of China's civil aviation, including the construction of civil airports and tarmacs (including runways and parking aprons) in China in such forms as joint ventures or joint operations. When cooperating with foreign investors, the Chinese side must invest over 51 percent of capital in the projects and assign personnel to take up the posts of chairmen of the board of directors and general managers. Foreign businessmen granted the right to run the above-mentioned joint-venture projects are welcome to invest in and run civil aviation service projects in such aspects as airport terminals, freight transport depositories, land service, air food, guesthouses, restaurants, and aviation fuel. All these are attractive targets of investment. China also said that foreign businessmen are welcome to invest in aviation enterprises engaging in agriculture and forestry, in the form of joint venture or joint operation. The proportion of foreign investment in this respect can be decided through consultation. However, the air traffic control system must still be financed and administered by China; whereas foreign airport and aircraft construction enterprises cannot invest in and set up air transport enterprises. It clearly indicates that foreign enterprises cannot take part in areas which have a bearing on state sovereignty and security, but they can cooperate with the Chinese side or set up joint ventures in all other areas. For example, foreign investors have become stockholders of Sanya Airport in Hainan Province. At present, the global civil aviation business is in a state of recession, and most foreign airlines are interested to develop their business in China. Now is the golden opportunity for CAAC to develop and expand further and to march to the international market.
