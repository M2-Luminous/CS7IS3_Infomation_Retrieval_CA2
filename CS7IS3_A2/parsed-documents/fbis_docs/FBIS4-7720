Bruner says the situation in Prijedor is much better following the order of Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, that an investigation into the killings in Prijedor be completed so that those responsible are discovered. Bruner says that it is only possible for permission to be granted for the resettlement of a number of people who have expressed great fear for their lives and who want to leave Prijedor. This resettlement will not begin tomorrow either but will be carried out over the next few days. He stresses that security guarantees from the Serb authorities are needed during their transportation for this resettlement to take place. He added that talks will begin tomorrow between ICRC representatives and the Srpska republic authorities and that he believes that all the necessary gaurantees will be given.
