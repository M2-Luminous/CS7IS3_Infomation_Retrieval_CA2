Yi Chun-ku, Seoul's liaison officer, phoned his Pyongyang counterpart Yi Song-tok to say that South Korea will not accept the letter. Pyongyang had notified Seoul Monday that it wanted to deliver a letter Wednesday addressed to the South Korean Government, political parties, social organizations and individuals. Officials here said the letter is believed to ask Southern figures to participate in a conference on Aug. 15, the 49th anniversary of Korean liberation from Japanese colonial rule, of party and social leaders on ending national division. Unification Board Spokesman Kim Hyong-ki issued a statement accusing North Korea of attempting yet "another tactic on the unification front." "Stop political propaganda which only stirs up distrust and confrontation among the people," the statement said. Kim urged North Korea to realize the mood of the international community and accept nuclear inspections and resumption of inter- Korean dialogue.
