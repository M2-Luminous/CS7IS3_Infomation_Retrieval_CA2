In a monthly economic diagnosis virtually unchanged from the previous month's, the agency said, "The Japanese economy is going through an adjustment phase and showing an overall slump." The agency said both consumers and corporations remain tight-fisted, despite a few signs in personal spending which some analysts say might indicate a pickup. An agency official briefing reporters on the report said there are some such signs, such as upturns in household spending and recovery in department store sales and in durable goods sales. But all of them are unconvincing as they are caused by temporary factors rather than by a steadfast change in the consumer trend. "We have to watch these more carefully," the official said. The EPA report also noted that inventory reductions have hardly progressed recently, leaving industrial production sluggish. With their finances under a squeeze, corporations are pessimistic over the future of their businesses, it said. On the labor front, the jobless rate has steadily increased while job offers have decreased, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The only bright spots, the report said, are public works spending, boosted by the government's efforts to galvanize the economy, booming housing construction, resulting from low interest rates, and stable prices.
