IEC chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler told a news conference in Pretoria the IEC was convinced that only severely limited balloting in kwaZulu/Natal would be possible. The IEC was therefore awaiting appropriate political and governmental action following its failed mission on Wednesday to convince the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly that free electioneering should be allowed in the homeland. Mr Justice Kriegler addressed the news conference immediately after he briefed President F. W. de Klerk and African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela on the IEC's Ulundi mission, during which he was repeatedly booed by kwaZulu Legislative Assembly members. Mr Justice Kriegler told the news conference that in order for the IEC to conduct free and fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal, the requisite degree of stability and co-operation had to be established in the region as a "matter of urgency". Referring to kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's reported conditional agreement to allow the IEC to prepare for the election, Mr Justice Kriegler said: "The inference is irresistible that the (Ulundi) proceedings were orchestrated so as to create, on the one hand, an impression of willingness to comply with the law, but on the other, make it plain that there would in fact be widespread and sustained resistance to the electoral process in kwaZulu." The IEC's ability to organise, administer and conduct free and fair elections in that province would remain "severely curtailed", Mr Justice Kriegler said. He did not want to elabrate on what the IEC viewed as appropriate political and governmental action. The IEC would continue with its preparations for the elections in the whole of the province. "It (the IEC) does so under manifest constraints and has conveyed its concerns to each of the governmental and political bodies with whom the power and responsibility rest to enable the IEC to fulfil its mandate in kwaZulu/Natal, Mr Justice Kriegler said. Responding to a question that the toppling of ex-president Lucas Mangope's Bophuthatswana government had followed an IEC visit to that territory, Judge Kriegler said that was a "malicious and uneducated" perception. The IEC had also failed on that mission, he said, adding there was no link between the visit and subsequent events in Bophuthatswana. Judge Kriegler ruled out the possibility that the April elections could be postponed because of the Natal/kwaZulu issue. It was not the IEC's function to pull free and fair elections "out of a hat". In spite of differences, political parties should realise that South Africans had a common destiny and the new South Africa should be ushered in by substabtially free and fair elections.
