The statement has prompted strong criticism of the government and president, particularly from the opposition, although some of the president's own party members have also been critical. Gaviria said that although citizens have a right to protest, behind these criticisms he perceives the presence of "dark forces" with personal interests that include drug trafficking. "I want to point out that U.S. soldiers have been in Colombia since the end of World War II. In every administration, military missions have provided cooperation in accordance with the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty," Gaviria said. Gaviria asserted that this cooperation is intended "to train, equip, and professionalize our Armed Forces in aerial matters and to provide cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking." The president said it is a paradox that while numerous clandestine flights "violate our sovereignty every day," such a fuss is being made over "cooperation requested by the Colombian Armed Forces." "Joint engineering exercises have also been carried out, such as those in Juanchaco, those in San Jose del Guavi, and those under way in Puerto Lopez, where a river outpost is being built. Most of the residents of the regions in question want these projects" Gaviria said. "This," he added, "does not mean that citizens should not demand explanations or ask why the cooperation is taking place, but many of the criticisms are ill-intentioned and the result of obscure interests linked to drug trafficking."
