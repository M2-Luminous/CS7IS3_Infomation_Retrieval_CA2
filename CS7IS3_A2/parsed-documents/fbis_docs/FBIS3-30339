On this occasion, a joint council made up of representatives from both former councils was formed to make preparations for the early congress. The council also comprised one representative from every PDP branch. This council will hold its first meeting on 3 February at the PDP headquarters in Tetove. Meanwhile, the Macedonian Assembly continued its suspended proceedings regarding the government's proposal to discuss the census law. The discussions by Macedonian deputies displayed the fear that by conducting an objective census, the number of Albanians will turn out to be greater than the present one, which the Macedonians used to manipulate. However, in drafting the law the government's main aim is not that it should be acceptable for Albanians as well. The Albanian deputies again presented their remarks requesting no more than a real and objective census and the return of lost belief in the Republic's Statistics Department. The debate was again suspended.
