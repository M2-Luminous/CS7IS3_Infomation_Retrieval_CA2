Mori, speaking at a lecture session in Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, said, "The party wants to finalize deliberations in the current Diet session after the government-proposed bills are revised to bring them nearer to the LDP-proposed ones." He said the LDP will start compiling its own compromise plan on the bills early next week. He cited three major modifications to be made to the government bills -- changes to the ratio of House of Representatives seats to be determined by direct and proportional election, to the controls on political funding of individual politicians, and to the electoral district basis for the proportional representation. The government and the ruling coalition parties have sought 274 single-seat districts and 226 seats chosen by proportional representation. The LDP wanted a combination of 300 single-seat constituencies and 171 proportional representation. It also favored seats votes in the proportional representation counted on a prefectural basis. Buth the LDP-sponsored political reform bills were voted down in the House of Representatives in November. The ruling coalition has vowed to complete debate on political reform in the House of Councillors special committee by January 14 even if the LDP boycotts the session. The government reform package cleared the lower house in mid-November but deliberations in the upper house stalled for over a month through late December due partly to the LDP's refusal to attend reform panel sessions.
