Regardless of their decision, the following requirements will be upheld, said Dlouhy. 1.) There will be no quotas or other trade barriers set for petrochemical products and oil imported into the Czech Republic; 2.) Certain uniform direction of the two main petrochemical enterprises, Kaucuk Kralupy and Chemopetrol Litvinov, must be ensured; 3.) The decision reached at the ministerial meeting on May 4, 1993 concerning the separation of refineries from petrochemical producers and the creation of one Czech refining company will have to be re-assessed and possibly revoked. The first possible method for the oil industry's privatization involves the international consortium of Agip, Conoco, Shell, and Total, who are interested in Kaucuk and Chemopetrol. The second method is the "Czech way," according to which the Czech refining and petrochemical industry will remain in Czech hands, provided 27 billion crowns be made available for its current needs. The latter method would lead to oil being imported mostly from Russia, whereas the consortium would import oil from other sources as well, said Dlouhy.
