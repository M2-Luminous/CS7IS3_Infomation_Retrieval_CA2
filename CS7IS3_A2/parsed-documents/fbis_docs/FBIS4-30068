Yamaguchi, a legislator without party affiliation, threw water at the seat of budget committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi to protest the committee's decision to summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for questioning over his financial affairs. Yamaguchi is not a committee member. "His behavior essentially deserves barring from the house, but he also expressed some feelings of regret," Yoshio Yatsu, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator, said in explaining the light punishment. All committee members from the two main opposition groups, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party, voted for the motion. The lower house is expected to adopt the committee's order for Yamaguchi to apologize at its next plenary session, which may be held as soon as Friday. The House of Representatives decided earlier in the day to bring Yamaguchi before the committee on discipline for his misbehavior. The last time disciplinary measures were taken against a lower house member was in June 1973, when Japanese Communist Party legislator Masako Kobayashi was barred from the chamber for 20 days.
