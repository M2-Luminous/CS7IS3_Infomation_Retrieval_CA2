Ma, the first ROC justice minister to visit the U.S. capital since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1979, said that he met with U.S. officials from the Justice Department and the State Department on proposed mutual legal assistance and extradition treaties. The minister said that there is a growing consensus between the two sides on the need for such agreements. Ma said that some 157 suspects wanted by authorities in Taiwan are either in the United States or are believed to be here but cannot be brought to justice because there is no extradition treaty between the two sides. Ma added that Washington has signed mutual legal assistance treaties with 15 different countries and is interested in signing a similar agreement with Taipei. Meanwhile, Ma met with officials from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Prisons, and the Government Ethics Office to discuss anti-drug efforts, prison administration and the enforcement of government ethics. Drug use is becoming a sejious problem in Taiwan, Ma told the officials. In 1933, law enforcement agents in Taiwan seized 1,110 kilograms of heroin, morphine and marijuana and 3,357 kilograms of amphetamine, up 133 percent and 17 percent respectively from the previous year, he said. He also refuted a State Department report released earlier this year which claimed Taiwan is an international drug transit point. Ma arrived in the United States last week to attend the convention of the National Association of State Attorneys General in San Antonio, Texas. He came to Washington Saturday and is scheduled to leave here for home Tuesday.
