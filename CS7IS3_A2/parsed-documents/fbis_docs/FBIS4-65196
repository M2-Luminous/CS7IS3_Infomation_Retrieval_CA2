This was announced by Federal Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt in a conversation with BERLINER ZEITUNG (Friday [13 May] edition). Rexrodt, who conducted negotiations with Russian counterpart Aleksandr Shokhin on the sidelines of the Yeltsin visit to Bonn, said that, with the exception of "a number of steel and textile products and the agricultural area," there will be "totally open markets." He, therefore, considers Moscow's complaints of blocked access to the markets as "not quite justified." The economics minister called the agreement achieved on future deliveries of railway cars by Deutsche Waggonbau AG Ammendorf to Russia a "breakthrough." The impending catastrophe for the company in Halle has been averted. Rexrodt confirmed during the conversation that Moscow had offered MiG-29's to pay the debts owed to Germany. However, "we have rejected that. It does not fit with our military and research plans. At present, we are unable to agree to such a deal," the minister said.
