According to some reliable sources, Basil was killed in Lebanon, having received threats in connection with the hush money he had been receiving from hashish growers and smugglers. He had been suspected of planning to swindle the traffickers and control the market. The sources indicate that the news of Basil's death, officially caused by an auto crash, was broken two days after its actual date. Nor was there any picture of the accident that could be shown on Syrian television. Observers note that Lebanese factions, the Maronites in particular, were keen to send delegations to pay their last respects, lest any be suspected of involvement in his assassination and then bear the vengeance of Syrian intelligence services. The observers are confident that the next few days will bear out their assessment. A tradition of the al-Nasiriyah sect calls for the deceased's face to be uncovered for a final glimpse, which was not observed in the case of Basil al-Asad.
