The Federal Government has officially refused to tolerate insults and threats Zhirinovskiy made yesterday when he was informed in Sofia that his visa application had been turned down. The Foreign Ministry confirmed reports from witnesses of Zhirinovskiy's behavior in Sofia. Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann, however, could not confirm a report from Sofia which reached DPA. It alludes to personal murder threats by Zhirinovskiy against German diplomats who explained the refusal. [passage omitted] A consular official from the [Sofia] embassy had informed Zhirinovskiy about the refusal to grant the visa at the Sofia airport. Zhirinovskiy, as the ministry has now confirmed, then made derogatory statements about the Federal Republic, made threats about future German-Russian relations, and "personally insulted" the German diplomat. The Foreign Ministry said this was "strongly rejected. These statements were a further reason, in addition to his previous statements, to disqualify Zhirinovskiy as an interlocutor."
