Israel has allowed 99 policemen to enter of the total of 450 individuals who were supposed to enter. The rest were returned to the Egyptian side after they had left the Egyptian borders. Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majaydah, commander of the Palestinian police force, stated that it was previously agreed upon that 450 members of the Palestinian police force would enter. Israel approved this, but the rest of the group has been turned back, and a postponement for technical reasons has been requested. The commander of the forces said the Palestinian forces are completely ready and prepared to enter immediately once Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat issues his instructions in accordance with Israel's approval. However, now this entry is being prevented and there are attempts to hamper the entry process. Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq praised Egypt's efforts and the facilities the government is providing to support the cause and facilitate the entry of the forces into the autonomy areas in Gaza and Jericho.
