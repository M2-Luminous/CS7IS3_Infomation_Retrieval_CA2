U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has scheduled a press conference at 2 P.M. Tuesday (4 A.M. Wednesday Japan time) to announce results of a U.S. probe into allegations by major U.S. cellular phone maker Motorola Inc. of unfair competition in the Japanese market. U.S. press reports said Kantor has decided to initiate sanctions. Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama said he has told the United States that Japan would take the issue to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if Washington took punitive action on the matter. The move, which is outside the so-called "framework" trade talks, marks Washington's first trade action against Japan following the collapse on Friday [11 February] of trade negotiations aimed at reducing Japan's global trade surplus. Washington has complained that sales in Japan of Motorola cellular phones have been markedly smaller than those made by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. The U.S. Government may levy higher tariffs on Japanese cellular phone imports in line with the 1974 Omnibus Trade Act. U.S. trade laws also allow the government to impose retaliatory tariffs in fields other than telecommunications, such as on autos and auto parts. In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura warned Washington on Tuesday against "taking unilateral retaliatory action," saying such a move would close the door to dialogue between the two nations. A senior official at the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry said he believes sanctions by the U.S. would be counterproductive, arguing that would ultimately hurt U.S. manufacturers. If the U.S. raises tariffs on Japanese auto parts, a move possible under U.S. trade law, it would affect U.S. automakers and even trigger possible layoffs in the U.S. auto industry, he said.
