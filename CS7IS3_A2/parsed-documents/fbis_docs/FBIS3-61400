In the morning, the ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions participated in a discussion held in the Seimas of our country's foreign policy. In the course of this Seimas meeting, an accusation was made from the rostrum that even among Lithuanian ambassadors there are some who act as politicians, not as officials of the nation. A. Januska, deputy foreign minister and director of the Political Department, requested by LIETUVOS RYTAS to assess these accusations and, if there are any such ambassadors, to identify them, said that the ministry did not believe that there were any such individuals and that there were no reproaches against any of them in this regard on the part of the ministry. According to Januska, this idea was voiced merely as a hope that there not be such diplomats. Yesterday, LIETUVOS RYTAS talked to the heads of the three probably most important Lithuanian diplomatic representations. The first thing we asked A. Eidintas, ambassador to the United States, was whether, in the wake of the departure of some of the workers at the embassy, he had now gotten his team together, and how the embassy was operating. The ambassador replied that this departure had not come as a great surprise and that the current workers are fully covering all aspects of the embassy's activity, that the work of the embassy did not stop for even one day, and that he had now come to Vilnius without any concerns regarding the embassy. Despite the fact that most emigre Lithuanians favor former ambassador S. Lozoraitis, the ambassador maintained that at this time, relations with the Lithuanian Community of America are businesslike. According to the ambassador, the embassy and the Lithuanian Community of America had succeeded in agreeing that they were working toward the same goal and that for this reason it was not important who might be in charge of the government or who the ambassador might be: relations ought to be businesslike. The Community was now assisting the embassy. On a five-point scale, the ambassador rated at a three the performance this year of the Lithuanian diplomatic service. He assigned this rating because he believes that the diplomatic service has been slow in getting on its feet. However, even this three reflects substantial achievement, in his opinion, because it is not easy to get going after such a long interlude. And the diplomatic representations are working and are of great political and especially economic use. When asked to assess the achievements of Lithuanian foreign policy on the same basis, Eidintas said that everything was overshadowed by the withdrawal of Russian armed forces and that because this was accomplished, he would assign a score of five, despite all the areas where performance fell short, e.g. lack of a conceptual framework and absence of strategy. Ambassador to Germany Z. Namavicius rated Lithuanian foreign policy this year with a score of four. He believes that truly a lot has been accomplished, and one can only be amazed by this, because our diplomats lack experience and there are almost no professionals among them. When asked about possible solutions to the problem relating to visas, he said that this problem really was being worked on in Germany and that the interior ministry had been provided with what German president R. von Weizsaecker had promised on the occasion of his visit to Lithuania. The only thing holding up the process is the absence of a treaty on the insurance of and provision of aid to citizens in the event of an accident, and other such situations. The preparatory work for this treaty ought to be concluded as quickly as possible, but otherwise everything is developing very favorably for us. The ambassador believes that the treaty governing entry without visas will be signed sooner or later, perhaps as early as next year. When asked what Lithuania could do to attract more direct investments from Germany, Namavicius said that the first thing Lithuania should do is something that it has not yet done, but which it may do in the future: sell land to be used for production facilities. Investors would then feel much more secure. The ambassador believes that Lithuania's duty and tax policy is sufficiently favorable, but it ought not change around every two months. With respect to where things stand on the investment front, the ambassador was pleased that the trends were good. In July, there were only somewhat more than 300 joint enterprises with Germany, whereas now the total is up to 443. There has not, though, been any large-scale investment, with the exception of the Siemens company, which may have broken the ice. We asked ambassador to Russia R. Kozyrovicius whether, in view of the election results and statements by certain of Russia's highest officials that corrections in economic policy are anticipated now that the elections are over, one should not also expect changes in Russia's foreign policy. Although the ambassador believed that it was difficult to make any kind of predictions at this time, he indicated that in a certain sense Russia's foreign policy can be expected to change. The difficulty is to say in which direction it will go. The ambassador has noticed that the tone of Russian foreign minister A. Kozyrev has even become less harsh. Kozyrovicius would not want to believe that--with the entire world watching--Russia will begin to implement a foreign policy reflecting the results of the parliamentary elections. He would expect the emergence of healthy and wise forces who will carry out a normal, non-dictatorial, and non-imperial policy. When reminded about the somewhat differing opinions of the main implementors of Lithuanian foreign policy as to whether Lithuanian foreign policy toward Russia will change or not--foreign minister P. Gylys maintained at a press conference on Tuesday that "there will be corrections" in the wake of the elections in Russia, whereas president A. Brazauskas indicated in an interview that appeared in a daily newspaper on Wednesday that our policy will not change--Kozyrovicius said that first there should be internal agreement, and foreign policy should be formed subsequently. The ambassador believes that Lithuanian policy should not change for the time being, because it is uncertain what kind of situation will evolve. According to Kozyrovicius, the results of the elections should not be totally ignored, however, and if Russian policy changes then Lithuania should change its policy as well.
