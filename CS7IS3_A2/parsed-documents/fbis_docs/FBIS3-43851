According to the communique, these forces, acting jointly with the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola and the riot police, have the mission of occupying all areas under control of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuanza Norte, particularly the city of Ndalatando, the provincial capital.
