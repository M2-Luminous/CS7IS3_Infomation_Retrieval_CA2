FR940525-1-00034 FR940525-1-00007 Section 3. Risk Categories/Weights for On-Balance Sheet Assets and Off-Balance Sheet Items * * * * * Assets transferred with recourse are treated in accordance with section 3(c) of this appendix A. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (i) Recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes, 13 in accordance with section 3(c) of this appendix A. 14 13 [Reserved] 14 Mortgage loans sold in transactions in which the bank retains only an insignificant amount of risk and makes concurrent provision for that risk are not considered assets sold with recourse under section 3. In order to qualify for sales treatment, such transactions must meet three conditions: (1) The bank has not retained any significant risk of loss, either directly or indirectly; (2) The bank's maximum contractual exposure under the recourse provision (or through the retention of a subordinated interest in the mortgages) at the time of the transfer is equal to or less than the amount of probable loss that the bank has reasonably estimated that it will incur on the transferred mortgages; and (3) The bank must have created a liability account or other special reserve in an amount equal to its maximum exposure. The amount of this liability account or other special reserve may not be included in capital for the purpose of determining compliance with either the risk-based capital requirement or the leverage ratio; nor may it be included in the allowance for loan and lease losses. (ii) Risk participations purchased in bankers acceptances. (iii) [Reserved] * * * * * (2) *␣*␣* (i) * * * 16 * * * 16 Participations in performance-based standby letters of credit are treated in accordance with section 3(c) of this appendix A.

(c) Recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes _(1) Risk-weighted asset amount_on-balance sheet assets. To calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for a recourse arrangement that is an on-balance sheet asset, multiply the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained by the appropriate risk weight using the criteria regarding obligors, guarantors, and collateral listed in section 3(a) of this appendix A. (2) Risk-weighted asset amount_off-balance sheet items. To calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute that is not an on-balance sheet asset, multiply the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount by the appropriate risk weight using the criteria regarding obligors, guarantors, and collateral listed in section 3(a) of this appendix A. (3) On-balance sheet credit equivalent amount. Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute is the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained or assumed. For purposes of this section 3(c) of this appendix A, the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained or assumed means: (i) For a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee, or other guarantee-type arrangement, the assets that the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports; (ii) For a subordinated interest or security, the amount of the subordinated interest or security plus all more senior interests or securities; (iii) For mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the outstanding amount of the loans serviced; (iv) For representations and warranties (other than standard representations and warranties), the amount of the loans subject to the representations or warranties; and (v) For loans strips that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the amount of the loans. (4) Second-loss position direct credit substitutes. The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a direct credit substitute is the face amount of the direct credit substitute if: (i) There is a prior credit enhancement that absorbs the first dollars of loss from the underlying assets that the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports; and (ii) The direct credit substitute is either: (A) A financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee or other guarantee-type arrangement that absorbs the second dollars of loss from the underlying assets; or (B) A purchased subordinated interest or security that absorbs the second dollars of loss from the underlying assets.
