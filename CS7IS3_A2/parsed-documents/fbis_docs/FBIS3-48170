Spokesman Kyd expects North Korea will officially give the IAEA a "diplomatic-level" answer, not a working-level one, sometime next week. Spokesman Kyd said: "North Korea and the IAEA agreed during the third contact on 17 January that future inspections will be held to see if there have been any abnormal change [pijonsangjogin pyonhwa] in North Korea's nuclear status [haek hyonhwang] since the last inspection in 1993 and that it will be a one-time only inspection." He stressed: "The IAEA is not demanding overall inspection of North Korea." He added: "The two sides have agreed to include the targets [taesang] being discussed in the current working-level contacts in the one-time-only limited inspection to ascertain any abnormal change." Regarding the scope and method of inspection to ascertain abnormal changes of North Korea's nuclear status, he said the IAEA insists on inspecting all items of technical requirements, while North Korea insists on limiting the targets considerably and reducing the scope. This difference in opinion is generating conflict.
