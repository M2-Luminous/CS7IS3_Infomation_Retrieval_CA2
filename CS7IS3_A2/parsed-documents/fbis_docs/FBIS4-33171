An extensive editorial by reporter Nicanor Leon Cotayo, highlights a wave of repudiation in Mexico of Torricelli's attempt to appoint himself a judge of Mexico. He adds that the chairman of the Western Hemisphere Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, this year inaugurated two hearings to examine the situation in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, arguing that NAFTA grants Washington this right. The U.S. Congressman also drew up a draft bill outlining the guidelines the Mexican electoral system should follow from now on. GRANMA's article emphasized that Torricelli, once again, defends a trend in U.S. policymaking to make meddling in the internal matters of other countries state policy. The Cuban daily concludes by indicating that what is of most concern is the increasing tendency among high-level U.S. officials to reveal their true intentions.
