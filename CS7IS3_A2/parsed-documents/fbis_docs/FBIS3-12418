The prime minister told Labor's caucus that it is Israel's aim to bring about gradual calm because in the final analysis the solution to the problem is political. We will, however, continue to act against Palestinian terrorism and Jewish extremists. The prime minister stressed that Israel is determined to uphold the agreements with the PLO and to continue the negotiations. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres sharply attacked right-wing extremists at the caucus meeting. Peres expressed shock not only at the appalling massacre, but also the rejoicing and gloating by the extreme right. What is most frightening is that Qiryat Arba' is a hotbed for the murder; we have no dialogue with those people, Peres said. They can cause a terrible catastrophe to the Jewish people, they are the enemies of the people, and they have to be treated like enemies. The man who perpetrated the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs has been damned to hell. His cohorts, who are now strutting like peacocks, have to have their weapons confiscated, and a series of measures have to be taken against them in order to prevent them from causing more damage and we must not hesitate.
