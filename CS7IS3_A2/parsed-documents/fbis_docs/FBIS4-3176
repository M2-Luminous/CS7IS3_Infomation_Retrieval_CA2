In a sense, the "Agenda" sketches for China a blueprint for development in the 21st century. China is a developing nation with nearly a 1.2 billion population. China's foremost goal and task at present is to develop the economy and shake off poverty and backwardness. Like many developing countries, China faces global environmental problems such as climatic changes, ozone layer depletion, and reduced species diversity. In developing the economy, it also needs to address the problem of environmental pollution, ecological destruction, and devastation of natural resources. Due to low productivity levels, in the past China opted for economic development on a grand scale, seeking to realize high levels of growth through massive investment in industries with high levels of energy consumption and pollution. This led to the depletion of natural resources, the worsening of environmental pollution, and ecological destruction. As China's economy has now entered a stage of high-speed development, greater pressure will surely be brought to bear on our natural resources and environment if we continue to stick to an outdated development pattern and only emphasize quantitative growth to the neglect of qualitative improvements to the economy. If we fail to change our direction, we will be forced to pay a greater price; China's modernization process will be delayed; and the foundation of the existence and development of the Chinese nation will even be undermined. Sustainable development is a great cause that has not yet been taken up in the course of human history. Sustainable development in China is an important component of global sustainable development. The only way for China to ensure sustainable and high-speed development is to opt for a development path that will not only promote the economy but also protect the environment. The idea behind the formulation of "China's Agenda 21" is to promote sustainable development in China. For human beings at the close of this century and the next, the issues of population, natural resources, and the environment will be common themes. As a developing country, China is entrusted with an important mission. The scope of the rational use of resources and environmental protection is no longer limited to the prevention of environmental pollution and to the restoration of the ecological system, but is being extended to a greater range of economic development and social progress. This marks a great leap in the cognitive level of human beings. It is precisely because of such a cognitive leap that we are presented with a new opportunity for development. It is necessary to realize high economic efficiency and to conserve natural resources and to lower energy consumption through setting a rational industrial setup, standardizing the types and scales of industrial enterprises, formulating and implementing correct industrial policies, accelerating the pace of readjusting industrial structure and technological transformation, and popularizing non-polluting production technologies and adopting non- polluting production methods. It is also necessary to continue experimenting with ecological farming projects; to greatly popularize non-polluting technologies for farming production; to rationally develop, utilize, and protect farmland; to enhance the capability to combat natural disasters; to gradually build an intensive-farming industry; and to help establish a rational structure for city planning. The birth of "China's Agenda 21" marks a good beginning for China's sustainable development. Now, the most important task for us is to advance the comprehensive implementation of "China's Agenda 21" in a down-to-earth manner. The Chinese people have made tremendous contributions to human civilization. The Chinese people, by adhering to the policy of reform and opening up, are now advancing step by step along the path of sustainable development. We will surely have a bright future. China will surely make new contributions to the global environment and development.
