These were the crushing words aimed at the Netherlands Cabinet by Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback on Friday [1 April] in an interview with Netherlands radio. Tobback, who is the Belgian coordinator for asylum-related policy, does not believe it is realistic on the part of the Netherlands Cabinet to try and send asylum seekers back to the respective country which first took them in, which is often Belgium. Moreover, he says that he is certainly prepared to consult with both the Netherlands and Germany on the possibility of an early entry into force of the Schengen Accord. In the Netherlands, the population appears to be convinced that the government cannot cope with the asylum problem any longer, that the government no longer has the situation under control, and that the problem is getting out of hand, claims Tobback. Consequently, he warns the Netherlands Government about this, saying: "If that is the case, then you are lost, because that is when panic reactions occur; then you will have extremist reactions." Tobback claims that sending asylum seekers back to the country which first took them in is neither a tenable nor a workable solution. Furthermore, he does not want to let himself to be tied down to such an approach by the Netherlands. "Anyone who reaches Belgium via an overland route comes from either France or Germany, or from the Netherlands or Luxembourg. So, I can send all those asylum seekers back again straight away, because only 5 percent of all asylum seekers arrive at Zaventem Airport. No more than that. So you see, that is one extreme of the argument. In this way, we will always only be passing them on to the next country." The plan drawn up by Netherlands Secretary of State for Justice Kosto to have flying brigades operating behind the borders, was also forcefully rejected by Tobback. According to him, such flying brigades will not help matters. "If one of us takes action against illegal immigrants, then the other will merely find themselves saddled with more illegal immigrants." Tobback's criticism comes a few days after Netherlands Development Aid Minister Pronk -- albeit in slightly less caustic tones -- openly criticized the policy of the Netherlands Cabinet. Pronk also spoke of a panicky policy, saying that although he appreciated that the more foreigners come to the Netherlands, the more supervision is required, "if you suddenly start talking about much more than just 1,000 extra policemen, then you are going to give rise to the impression of some sort of panic that definitely will occur."
