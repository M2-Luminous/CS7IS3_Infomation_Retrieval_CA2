FR941012-2-00121 FR941012-2-00080 12. No CDSC will be imposed with respect to: (a) redemptions of shares that were purchased more than a specified number of years prior to the redemptions: (b) shares derived from reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions; or (c) the amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, or the amount that represents such percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption. 13. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions and then of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time. This will result in the charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate. In addition, redemption requests placed by shareholders who own shares of more than one class will be satisfied first by redeeming the shareholder's shares of the class or classes not subject to a CDSC, unless the shareholder has specifically elected to redeem shares which are subject to a CDSC. 14. The CDSC will not be imposed on shares issued prior to the effective date of the order granting exemptive relief. 15. Applicants request relief to permit each Fund to waive or reduce the CDSC in certain circumstances. Any waiver or reduction will comply with the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d&hyph;1 under the Act. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe that, by implementing the multiple class distribution system, the Funds would be able to facilitate the distribution of their shares and permit shareholders to receive the benefits of mutual fund services and distribution arrangements and the added benefits of scale and other advantages that may result from combining investors' assets in a single portfolio. Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves, or increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund. 2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d), and rule 22c&hyph;1, to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of shares. Applicants believe that the CDSC arrangement would permit shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase than if a sales charge had been imposed. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) the impact of the disproportionate payments made under the rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan and the shareholder services plan, and any Class Expenses which are limited to (i) transfer agency fees attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) administrative services fees payable under each class' respective administrative services agreement, if any; and (vi) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order; (b) voting rights on matters which pertain to rule 12b&hyph;1 plans except as provided in condition 2 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (d) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund; and (e) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature.
