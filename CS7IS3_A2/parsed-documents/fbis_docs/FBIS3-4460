He said: Premier Li Peng's report is of essential, comprehensive, and profound importance and embodies the ideas of seeking truth, dealing with concrete matters relating to work, doing pioneering work, and making progress. I completely agree to it. As for Liaoning, an urgent task for understanding the basic guidelines of the report and fulfilling the tasks as set forth in the report is to start from the change of the managerial mechanism to speed up the enlivening of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. This is the key to deepening reform, promoting development, and realizing the second pioneering work. After that, Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech. He talked about the understanding about the report; introduced, in detail, to Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and NPC Vice Chairman Chen Muhua the province's achievements in reform and opening up made in 1993; and reported on the province's problems and difficulties in accelerating the setup of the market economy. Deputies (Li Huazhong) and (Bo Xilai) set forth their suggestions and viewpoints on how to accelerate the development of large and medium-sized enterprises and to promote agricultural production and the opening of the province to the outside world. Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, finally made a speech. He said: Today, we mainly want to hear your opinions on the report and what methods you have to solve the existing problems, to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas, to make preparations for the next-step arrangements, and to ensure a sound and orderly development of the economy. He said: Last year, Liaoning made better economic development and made a big headway in agriculture. Being self-sufficient in grain and nonstaple foods was a great achievement. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Therefore, strengthening the agricultural development is of great strategic significance and must be persisted in. He expressed his views on accelerating the transformation of large and medium-sized enterprises. He said: I completely agreed to your suggestions on conducting technological transformation. Liaoning's state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises have a good foundation. So, these enterprises should fully be transformed and utilized so as to become vigorous. He also stressed: The products produced after technological transformation must be marketable. Without marketing channels, the products, no matter how good they are, will be of no use.
