FBIS4-23220 "drafr105_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 1 Jun South African Press Review for 1 Jun MB0106133194 MB0106133194 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Need for Taxes -- An editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 1 June on page 22 begins by noting that President Mandela has "stirred a hornet's nest" by speaking of the need to raise taxes. The proposal to apply the top tax rate of 43 percent to income above 80,000 rand is especially controversial because it would affect so many people. While supporting the "upliftment of South Africa's poor" and the aims of the Reconstruction and Development Program, the editorial expresses reservations about the tax proposals: "What the Government needs to achieve is a measure of income redistribution without demotivating or -- worse -- driving out the nation's relatively small pool of highly skilled professional and business people. The conundrum of how to find more money might possibly be solved via the indirect (rather than direct) tax route. The Government should consider this as an option." SOWETAN KwaZulu State of Emergency -- "The state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal is clearly an impotent measure and should be lifted immediately." So argues an editorial in the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on page 8 on 1 June. It notes that "hundreds of people" have died there since the state of emergency was declared and goes on to assert: "While rivalry between IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC supporters is a contributing factor,...the primary causes of bloodshed can be traced to poverty, landlessness and the absence of basic amenities. The Reconstruction and Development Programme of the Government is aimed at addressing some of these problems and there seems little need for an ineffective state of emergency which is simply going to hinder the real work required in KwaZulu/Natal." BEELD New Police Plan Welcomed -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 30 May in a page-8 editorial says that the new police plan is welcome. "Doing away with military culture and tokens of rank will go a long way in creating an image of a more friendly police force. Such a change of image, and especially from the negative perceptions that exist in many parts of the South African community, is necessary to ensure that the police force plays its rightful role in the new South Africa." The rift between the police and the community which it serves has thus far disadvantaged the effectiveness of the force. "As a matter of urgency, politicians will have to educate communities to accept the new police force as their own and show appreciation for the work they do under difficult circumstances." Education Problem -- the second editorial in the 30 May BEELD notes that: "That South Africa is saddled with an enormous education problem in the black community is old news. This burning problem has been the center of discussion for over a decade. Apparently the will to tackle it effectively thus far has been lacking." As there has been no joint effort from the government, the parent community, teacher and youth organizations, discipline has deteriorated so much that in many parts of the country a constructive learning athmosphere no longer exists. Recently children of a certain school held teachers hostage in their classrooms, allegedly after racist remarks had been made by a white teacher. "If this is true, departmental action should be taken against her," "but such undisciplined action by school children should not be condoned. It is about time that authorities took a firm stand."
