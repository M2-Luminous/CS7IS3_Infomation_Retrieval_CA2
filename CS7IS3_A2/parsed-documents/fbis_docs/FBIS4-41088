The Russian Federation did not find it necessary to inform Estonia about this step through diplomatic channels. The Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that Russia's unilateral decision was made at a time when, pursuant to the decision made at the May meeting between the President of the Republic of Estonia Lennart Meri, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, a new impetus has been given to the finding of solutions to on-going problems in bi-lateral relations. In the framework of the Estonian-Russian negotiations, within the working group on border issues, Estonia has steadfastly sought solutions, including the creation of a legal basis for the operations of the border guards. In the international arena, Estonia has repeatedly presented initiatives to deal with border- related differences of opinion with the Russian Federation: last February Estonia proposed the naming of a special representative of the Chairman of the CSCE, Estonia has repeatedly offered to take the matter to the International Court in the Hague, likewise, Estonia has proposed discussing the border problem with Russia in the framework of the European Stability Pact. The only treaty in force which sets the border between the Republic of Estonia and the Russian Federation is the 1920 Peace Treaty of Tartu which the "National Border Book Between the Estonian Democratic Republic and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic records. The 1940 Soviet occupation of Estonia did not affect the validity of this treaty. The August 24, 1991 Russian presidential decree in principle recognizes the legal continuity of Estonia. Russia's decision to unilaterally demarcate the border "in the political and economic interests of the Russian Federation" clearly violates the charter of the UN as well as CSCE principles to resolve matters of dispute through negotiations, without unilateral actions and without the use or the threat of force. The carrying out of the the Russian presidential decree under the current conditions would mean that, without the consent of the other nation, one nation selects and proclaims an arbitrary line to be the border between two nations. A line whose delineation is not mutually agreed upon cannot be made a national border. In the complicated situation which has developed, the Republic of Estonia reaffirms its willingness to solve the question of the national border with Russia at the negotiating table and calls upon Russia to forego all kinds of unilateral actions in these questions. The June 21, 1994 Russian presidential decree on unilateral actions regarding the national border with Estonia leaves the impression that the Russian Federation is not interested in the normalization of relations with Estonia.
