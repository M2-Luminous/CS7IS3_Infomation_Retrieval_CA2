FR940819-2-00131 FR940819-2-00076 Documents Containing Reporting or Recordkeeping Requirements: Office of Management and Budget Review AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of the OMB review of information collection. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recently submitted to OMB for review the following proposal for collection of information under the provision of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). 1. Type of submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision. 2. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR Parts 20, Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning. 3. The form number if applicable: N/A. 4. How often is the collection required: A one-time notification is required when licensees seeking license termination under restricted conditions submit a decommissioning plan or a notification of intent to decommission. A one-time notification is also required from applicants for new licenses. 5. Who will be required or asked to report: Part 30, 40, 50, 70 and 72 NRC and Agreement State licensees seeking license termination under restricted conditions and applicants for new licenses. 6. An estimate of the number of responses: 19 per year. 7. An estimate of the number of hours needed annually to complete the requirement or request: 600 (31.6 hours per response). 8. An indication of whether Section 3504(h), Pub. L. 96&hyph;511 applies: Applicable. 9. Abstract: The proposed amendments to 10 CFR 20 will require (1) That licensees required to submit to the Commission a decommissioning plan or a notification of intent to decommission provide additional information to the Commission in these submissions when seeking license termination under restricted conditions, and (2) applicants for new licenses describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination, facilitate decommissioning, and minimize generation of radioactive waste. Those licensees proposing license termination under restricted conditions must submit a plan for establishing and supporting a Site Specific Advisory Board, and develop operating procedures for the Board. All records generated or reviewed by the SSAB become a part of the license docket. The rulemaking would ensure that decommissioning will be carried out without undue impact on public and occupational health and safety and the environment and would enhance the existing regulatory framework by providing a clear and consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which lands and structures must be remediated before a site can be decommissioned. The additional recordkeeping requirements would document the role of public participation in the licensing process and that sites have been decommissioned in accordance with the regulations. Copies of the submittal may be inspected or obtained for a fee from the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555.
