According to these details, the government, too, is seeking to make arms exports easier. According to information obtained by our Bonn office, talks on this have been conducted between the Defense, Economics, and Foreign Ministries. Yesterday the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] parliamentary group spoke in favor of easing the export provisions. The Social Democratic Party announced its resistance to this. Gerd H. Pelletier reports. [Pelletier] One day after the move forward by CDU deputies toward relaxing the arms export provisions, today it was revealed that the ministries concerned -- defense, economics, and foreign -- have been dealing with the European harmonization of the tricky issue for weeks already. The confidential file has lain at the Federal Chancellery since before the Christmas period. It says that a ruling on dual-use exports is urgent. For example, we have the case of the Libyan toxic gas factory in Rabta, which the German company Imhausen Chemie claimed was a fertilizer plant. When the deal was uncovered, company head Hippenstiel was sentenced and regulations on granting export permits were tightened drastically. All-European guidelines are being called for in this area. But Ruehe's Defense Ministry also wants to make it easier for the arms industry to export. Kinkel's Foreign Ministry, however, would prefer to adhere to the Arms Export Control Act of 1982. For example, if the British partners require the future Eurofighter to be desertworthy, the German manufacturing partners will know that it was to be sold outside the NATO area. Must our arms export restrictions be relaxed for that reason? [Begin Kinkel recording] For some time we have been considering in the responsible ministries -- in cooperation between the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry -- how we can deal with this sticky issue. We mustn't rush at it. We will look at the CDU/CSU proposals, which have now been submitted, in addition to our own ideas, and then decide in good time. [end recording] [Pelletier] The arms industry does not want to wait that long. European reality: The company Eurocopter is a DASA enterprise with French majority ownership. The German partners cannot and do not want to know where the French parent company, Aerospatiale, is selling the combat helicopters. Whatever happens, it is thought less likely that the European partners will give in to the cautious German arms export restrictions in the short or long term. It is more likely that the compromise will lie in the gradual relaxing of these German provisions.
