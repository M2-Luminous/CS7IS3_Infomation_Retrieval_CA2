Yi also said the administration will submit a market opening schedule to GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) after taking into account the contents of similar schedules to be submitted by major countries like the United States, Japan and the European Union (EU). The premier was answering questions at the fourth-day of the National Assembly interpellation of the administration on economic matters. He implied that South Korea may revise its original market opening plan depending on the outcome of the ongoing U.S.-Japan trade talks. The premier said that so far most other countries are withholding their market opening schedules. "This is due to their policy to cope with the outcome of the U.S.-Japan trade talks," Yi said. Also speaking on the Assembly floor, Agriculture Minister Kim Yang-pae said last year South Korea recorded a deficit of about $5,040 million in the trade of agricultural and fishery products. In a heated session, five lawmakers who took the floor called for additional steps to promote agriculture, to support small companies and to deregulate business activities. Rep. Kim Yong-chin of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) asked whether the government intends to negotiate with GATT member nations again over the multilateral agreement to partially open the domestic rice market which was agreed in the Uruguay Round trade talks. He noted that the United States and Japan are planning to hold talks to readjust agreements on trade in the agricultural field while delaying submitting their plans to implement UR accords. Kim demanded that the government invest more money in developing agriculture, charging that the 1.5 trillion won earmarked this year for restructuring the farming sector is far short of what is needed to implement government projects including farm mechanization. Rep. Pak U-pyong said the Foreign Ministry should be expanded so that the ministry's function could include external trade affairs. He also suggested lowering interest rates to relieve manufacturing industries of financial burdens and contribute to strengthening their international competitiveness. Rep. Pak Chong-hun of the DP suspected that there may be political motives behind the selection of the chief contractor for the second mobile telecommunication business. "The government handed over the right to select the winner to the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI). But actually, the government had already decided to choose Kolon as the main contractor in a secretive manner," Pak insisted. He also called for the government to overhaul the current taxation system in order to relieve wage earners of their high tax burden. He contended that the tax system runs counter to the principle of equity by imposing a low tax levels on those living off unearned incomes. O Chang-sop of the DLP said the nation's industries should be restructured so that the manufacturing sectors could be a key industry in achieving the nation's goal of boosting its competitive power. "In addition, administrative regulation son economic activities should be eased," O said. Finally, he called for the government to expand tax favors to private companies which have been eager to develop new technologies.
