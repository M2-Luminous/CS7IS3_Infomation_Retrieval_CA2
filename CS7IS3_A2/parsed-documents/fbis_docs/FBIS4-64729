Turkey's Sekerbank, in compliance with a court decision, has confiscated part of the assets of Akdeniz Garanti Bankasi, based in Nicosia and owned by the Semiler family. Akdeniz Garanti Bankasi owed $1 million to Sekerbank, half of which was said to have been repaid immediately after the confiscation. Akdeniz Garanti is controlled by Bulent Semiler, former general manager of the now bankrupt state-run Anadolu Bankasi and a close economic aide of the late President Turgut Ozal. Semiler is a major shareholder of Impexbank, which was the third and last bank to collapse on April 24. Impexbank, controlled by the Semiler and Eliyesil families, was owned by fugitive Turkish Cypriot businessman Asil Nadir. Bankers say that most Turkish Cypriot banks are closely linked with Turkish banks and that the most recent crisis in Turkey has had serious repercussions on the island. "The relationship between the Turkish banks and the Turkish Cypriot banks are [as published] very complex. In the coming days, this complexity will become more apparent," said one banker in an interview with the Anatolia news agency. Anatolia reported that Akdeniz Garanti had issued a statement saying that some circles in the TRNC had deliberately spread ominous rumors regarding this bank, in order to tarnish its image. "Those circles aim to take control of the bank," ran the statement. After the government's April 5 austerity package, the Turkish Treasury banned three private banks from carrying out any banking activities. Following the collapse of TYT [Foreign Trade] Bank, Marbank and Impexbank, eight stockbrokers and the leading brokerage house AOG Turkinvest have gone bankrupt. There were reports over the weekend that a number of creditors (unpaid investors) attacked the Istanbul headquarters of Turkinvest and smashed its windows. Turkinvest was banned last Friday [29 April] from trading activities, just a day after it offered a debt swap to its creditors, who claim 1.3 trillion Turkish lira ($38 million) from this firm. The Capital Markets Board (SPK) said in a statement that it had halted the activities of the leading brokerage house, Turkinvest; which now faces the threat of liquidation. Turkinvest was accused of becoming involved in fictitious repo (repurchase) transactions worth TL 100 trillion. Its chairman, Nasrullah Ayan, said he would not "give up so easily."
