"I'M NOT AFRAID TO GO INTO ANY VILLAGE"A For the philistine, the "trouble in Mingrelia" is not over. The philistine looks suspiciously at the man just in from Zugdidi or Tsalendzhikha and tries a "shrewd" guess: "Are there still roadblocks on the highways?" "Are people walking freely in the streets?" The philistine wants to know the truth, but he's still suspicious; for him, the truth is bounded by his own narrow vision. For him, therefore, the question that is on everyone's lips, "What's happening in Mingrelia?", still carries political import. Well, then, we will start by answering that question: What's happening in Mingrelia now is, in general, what's happening all over Georgia. There's hope and there's hopelessness; people are fearful of the morrow, people are tired of the uncertainty, people want work and quiet, people are less agitated about politics, and, to tell the truth, they couldn't care less about a lot of things that, we think, people here in Tbilisi worry about.... If there is anything that greatly stirs the emotions in Zugdidi these days, it is the adversities of the Abkhazian war and the refugee problem, because both matters are terribly close to them. These are probably the main concerns, although a city and rayon that are on the front lines have plenty of other problems too. Nevertheless, what is probably of most concern to readers is the present political confrontation and crime situation in the region. We have already partially mentioned this in general, but now we will elaborate. This lovely city is in dire straits. Everywhere you look there are burnt-out buildings. The streets are thronged with people--refugees who have nothing to do or anyplace to go, and so they kill time talking to each other, grasping at straws, fine-combing a thousand times through any bit of news in the desperate hope of a tangible chance to return to Abkhazia. A brief digression: Last year (and the year before last) were really difficult and extraordinary times for Zugdidi and its people. Between January 1992 and November 1993, about 30 buildings burned down--the Inguri Pulp and Paper Combine's Egrisi Hotel, the Odishi Hotel, the military commissariat, the city internal affairs department, the environmental protection building, municipal services buildings, the Tutarchela shopping center, the trade administration warehouse, School No 8, the main building of the boarding school.... The television tower was blown up, and dozens of industrial, agricultural, educational, cultural, consumer service, and other structures were trashed. The machine building plant has been looted (copper components have been removed from costly program-control machines, and a third of the equipment cannot be restored. The Music and Choreography Society's enterprise has been stripped clean, the Meat Combine is now nothing but a shell; everything else has simply been looted. The damage done by fires alone is estimated at over 60 billion rubles. That's just the estimate! But there is no way to calculate in rubles the spiritual and physical trauma suffered by society, or the lives of 130 Zugdidians sacrificed in the confrontation of brothers "on both sides." Colonel Pridon Adamia, chief of the Zugdidi Internal Affairs Administration, has this to say: I was appointed to this position last year, on 6 November. Before that, I served as Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister of Abkhazia. We had to fight our way out of Sukhumi, which was surrounded. I know Zugdidi very well; 20 years ago I served as its chief of militia. I almost got killed twice here last year in attacks by the ex-President's followers. First near Ingiri, and another time near Tsaishi, where I had come on business from Abkhazia, they caught me and were going to shoot me. When the Head of State appointed me and rayon head Edisher Chargazia, he said "You with your wise gray head and experience, and Edisher with his youthful energy and enthusiasm, will complement one another, and I hope we will soon return Zugdidi to normalcy." We gave him our word and are doing everything we can to keep it. Now about your question: The "Mingrelian resistance" is a myth, a concocted story designed to aid their side, and they even managed to convince some segments of the public, or rather they convinced themselves. There was no "Mingrelian resistance." What was happening here was absolutely unacceptable to 80 percent of the region's population. Eighty percent! What happened was that the ex-President's followers brought all their supporters together in Zugdidi, from all over the republic, where they indulged in violence and lawlessness, senseless sabotage and terror, which the law enforcement agencies, manned by weak and unprincipled cadres, could not cope with. Zugdidi and some neighboring rayons were virtually cut off from the rest of the republic. The public at large, its leaders, and--most important--the basic nucleus of the urban and rural intelligentsia, were afraid and downhearted. Hence, Mingrelia had nothing to do with it. The pace of stabilization that is underway in the region now will convince you of this. Until November 1993, when government troops entered Zugdidi and took control of the situation, the police were attacked repeatedly, resulting in the building being burned down and destroyed, officers being killed, and almost all weapons, equipment, and vehicles being stolen. The police were only guarding certain special and vital objects such as banks, the bakery combine, the milling combine, and the museum. In order to reinvigorate the Internal Affairs Administration, we reorganized the personnel. We discharged over 50 officers and demoted over 20. City and rayon departments were set up in the city's and rayon's territory. We recently added 100 staff slots. We are creating subdepartments in Narazeni, Darcheli, Tsaishi, Zeda Etseri, and Kuleshkari, which will enable us to deal more promptly and efficiently with crime and maintain closer contacts with the public. Today there is not a single armed supporter of the ex-President hiding in the woods of Zugdidskiy Rayon. We have brought them over to our side (about 500 men!); today they are wielding hoes or have been formed into official military outfits. A number of them have left the rayon. They voluntarily turned in about 500 automatic weapons (not to mention confiscated heavy equipment and lots and lots of shells and cartridges), and we are not prosecuting them. Forty men whose weapons we had to take by force are being prosecuted. These days I'm not afraid to go into any village. By this I mean, there are no more organized armed political opponents. On the other hand, the crime situation is very bad. For one thing, there are about 80,000 refugees in the city and rayon. Many low-lifes and criminal elements came with them, and they are continuing to engage in banditry and make trouble. For another thing, besides the police there are eight different armed formations in Zugdidi, and they do not obey one another--namely, Sukhumi, Ochamchire, Gali, and Zugdidi internal troop units, and Gali and Zugdidi Mkhedrioni units.... Eight different military units! Many of these fighters are obviously undisciplined, and some of them have been in jail three or four times. Moreover, the Abkhazian Military Police, headed by Colonel Temur Khazalia, which is supposed to be keeping order among them, is defending the temporary border on the Inguri--besides the fact that Abkhazian boyeviki [guerrillas] and their mercenaries have been attacking peaceful villages and engaging in criminal activities, stealing property and kidnapping people. We have caught many criminal gangs. Unfortunately, they include many military men.... [end of Adamia quote] Batoni Pridon Adamia told us that recently he had punished one officer because two of the man's cartridges were missing. He said it off-hand, while he was talking about strengthening discipline in the police administration, but that nuance caused us to draw a parallel several times when we heard confused gunfire in the city. One time we happened upon the boys of the "Gali Battalion" expending probably a couple of hundred cartridges on some bottles for target practice, just for fun. Another time, a warning shot by one "quick-on-the-trigger" officer of the property protection administration startled us right downtown. A third time, some unit's brave lads broke in on a gathering of refugees who were upset over a tasteless statement by Butros Butros-Ghali in the UN Security Council on 21 March, acted like bullies and shot up the place. This is just to illustrate that whenever the peace is disrupted in the city, it is generally due to the creative efforts of those numerous armed formations or news of the enemy's fresh attacks on villages across the Inguri, which are administratively part of Zugdidskiy Rayon. Nevertheless, life goes on relatively normally in this front-line city and rayon. The number one task today is to improve the region's economy and boost agriculture. Agroindustrial Association Chairman Vazha Pipia has this to say: Our rayon's agrarian sector includes 25 kolkhozes, 10 social-sector farms, 10 inter-farm enterprises, two agrocombines and five agrofirms and joint-stock companies. Last year left us a poor legacy. Instead of the planned 40,000 tonnes of tea leaf, only 9,400 were picked. Lack of control, disorganized labor and lack of discipline have brought it about that the tea plantations have not been tended properly, the necessary measures have not been carried out, 85 percent of the nut plantations have been appropriated by the people under the pretext of privatization, and the rest are in ruins and unfenced. Because of failure to carry out cropping operations properly, tung, bayleaf, mulberry, and other perennial plantings have declined. Things are critical in the livestock sector: only six social-sector farms still have a livestock section complex, and the cattle population is low. A lot of agricultural machinery and tools have been stolen or wrecked. Everything needs to be repaired and restored. Even though we suffer from a chronic shortage of fuel (at this stage we need at least 200 tonnes of diesel and 30 tonnes of gasoline for spring operations, but so far we have only received 30 tonnes of diesel), somehow or other the pruning and shaping of the tea plantations is going smoothly, also laochay procurement. About 200 tonnes of laochay have already been procured, and we could have boosted that to 1,000 tonnes if it weren't for the lack of fuel. We have customers for it too, who will pay in dollars. But instead of procuring it we're letting it rot in the ground. We also have an experimental tea pressing factory to make brick tea. So far we haven't received any kind of mineral fertilizer. But we took 800 tonnes of phosphorous and potassium fertilizer left over from last year and applied them to the soil. The power shortage is making it hard for us to prepare the tea factories for the season. The factories still have 150 tonnes of half-finished goods that have not been sorted. There is another problem that has us worried--we are afraid that the skyrocketing price of fuel and energy is going to make our tea industry unprofitable. According to preliminary estimates, a kilogram of packaged tea is now worth as much as 3,000 Russian rubles, but in barter exchange our tea is not worth more than 1,500 rubles. The government ought to take a protectionist attitude toward agriculture. The value of tea leaf has yet to be settled. Presumably, 5,000 coupons for hand-picked tea. The controversy goes on. The peasant demands either Russian money or goods in kind. This year we rectified one of last year's injustices: the tea factories made a lot of unearned profit by buying tea leaf cheaply from the social-sector farms (or, more accurately, at the current prices then), processing it, and then selling it dearly (the prices suddenly shot up), leaving the farms with the short end of the stick. Therefore, we made the factories give half their profits from last year back to the farms. This money will be used to save the plantations. In the past two or three years not a single gram of tea leaf has been picked on 45 percent of our plantations--2,400 hectares (more accurately, followers of the ex-President wouldn't let it be picked)--and the plantations reverted to the wild. There are 15 state-owned and 14 cooperative mini-factories in Zugdidskiy Rayon. These mini-factories have caused us no little trouble. They are currently being reregistered and relicensed, this in order to determine the legality of the sources of their tea leaf, allocation and construction of facilities, and compliance with technological specifications. As for the family-owned shops (there used to be more than 150 of them in the rayon), the Board has banned them. This is because they were not complying with the specifications of tea leaf processing, and because they were operating basically on stolen materials and electricity. [end of Pipia quote] Other qualitative changes are taking place in Zugdidi. People are in favor of retaining the social-sector farms. The Board's course of action is to create Agro Associations and Agrocombines. Integration is underway. Where farms and tea factories were once separate, they are now being joined in the form of combines; otherwise, the farms would inevitably go bankrupt, and that would be a heavy burden on the working man. The idea of creating agrofirms and agrocombines was necessitated by this injustice. The first agrocombine was created in Ingiri in 1986. Now tested in practice, the experiment is being adopted widely. Already created this year are the Zeda Etseri Agrocombine, the Rukhi Commercial Production Agrofirm, the Narazeni Agrofirm, and the Akhalsopeli Joint-Stock Company. So far, all the kolkhozes and farms have been preserved. It briefly rained that day in Zugdidi. What happened was, it suddenly clouded over, the way it does in coastal areas, but it didn't turn into a downpour. Soon the sky cleared again and the sun peeked through, just as sunshine is beginning to appear in all spheres of the life of Zugdidi. But that is a subject for future articles.
