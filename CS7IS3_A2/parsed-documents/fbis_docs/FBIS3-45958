Wang Maolin, provincial party committee secretary and provincial military district party committee first secretary, delivered a speech at the meeting in which he emphatically stated that the principle of the party running the Armed Forces is essential and fundamental to consolidating and developing the People's Armed Forces. Therefore, we should make redoubled efforts to strengthen rather than weaken the party leadership over the Armed Forces under the new situation of reform and opening up. Comrade Wang Maolin said: Since the party should run the Armed Forces, we should make every possible endeavor to successfully manage the Armed Forces, this being at once a traditional CPC system and an important duty of local leaders. To this end, it is imperative to enhance a sense of the people's militia. I hope that party committees and governments at all levels in Hunan will strive to successfully manage the Armed Forces and contribute more to province-wide reform, opening up, economic construction, and national defense reserve forces building. Chen Bangzhu, provincial governor and chairman of the provincial armed forces work committee, also delivered a speech at the meeting in which he called on party committees and governments at all levels in Hunan to fully understand the importance of stepping up people's militia and reserve forces building under the new situation of building a socialist market economic structure; attach great importance to and tackle practical problems hindering people's militia and reserve forces building; strengthen unity between the Armed Forces and the people, between the police forces and the people, as well as between the Armed Forces and the police forces; and carry out Armed Forces work under CPC leadership in a responsible manner. Major General Pang Weiqiang, provincial party committee standing committee member and provincial military district commander, delivered a work report at the meeting presided over by Major General Deng Hanmin, provincial military district political commissar. The meeting was attended by a number of provincial party, government and military leaders, including Yang Zhengwu; Liu Fusheng [provincial people's congress standing committee chairman]; Chu Bo; Hu Biao; Wang Keying; Zhu Miaoquan; Xiao Qiuru; He Yaodong; Wang Zhushi; Liu Shiying; and Ma Chongbiao; all prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party committee secretaries; all military subarea party committee first secretaries, and all city mayors, autonomous prefectural administrators, and prefectural commissioners who are concurrently city, autonomous prefectural, and prefectural Armed Forces work committees chairmen.
