In his speech, General Secretary Wataru Kubo said: "A party that cannot change its policies has no other choice but to stand isolated." Thus, he indicated his view that the SDPJ's basic policies on foreign affairs and defense have to be reviewed so the SDPJ will be able to deal with the future realignment of political parties. Kubo disclosed a plan to set up a "Project for Promoting Cooperation in Election Campaigns" (tentative name) within the SDPJ, pointing out that promoting cooperation among the ruling coalition parties in the next national election campaigns is the task to be dealt with at present. After indicating his view that full-fledged political realignment is close at hand, Kubo showed his resolution to unify various political forces centering around the social democratic and liberal forces. He said "we must prepare for the possibility that we may have to make a decision on transforming into a new party." Kubo further said, the SDPJ and Komeito failed to reach an accord aimed at obtaining political power in 1980; and the SDPJ, Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United Social Democratic Party also failed to reach an accord to this end in 1989 because of "discord on basic policies". He emphasized the need for party reform, including the review of the party's basic policies, indicating his concern over the possibility of being isolated as "a party that cannot respond to structural changes" if the SDPJ should fail to effect policy changes. With regard to electoral cooperation, Kubo admitted that several issues, such as the issue of the cabinet reshuffle, have revealed the existence of a "bipolar structure" in which the SDPJ, the DSP, and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] form one group and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito form another. However, he stressed: "We are not at odds with each other. It is premature to consider this as the fixed framework of the realignment." Thus, Kubo indicated that the ruling coalition parties, including both Shinseito and Komeito, should promote cooperation in election campaigns for the time being with the common objective of supporting the Hosokawa administration. Prior to Kubo's speech, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama gave a speech. While indicating a positive stance on cooperation among the ruling coalition parties in election campaigns, Murayama commented on the concept of forming a large floor group among the ruling coalition parties advocated by some members of the ruling parties, saying: "It is impossible for parties with different views on the state system and on the Constitution to unite as one force." Thus, Murayama indicated that the issue of cooperation in election campaigns should be discussed independently from the issue of realignment of the political parties.
