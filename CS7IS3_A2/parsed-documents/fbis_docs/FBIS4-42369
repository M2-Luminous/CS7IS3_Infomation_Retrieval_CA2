In an interview with DPA at the end of the discussions in New York on 27 May, the minister said it was a success that proposals for 14 areas had been worked out -- ranging from financing and technology transfer to sectors like water or chemicals. He said, however, that private organizations wanting a more intensive environmental and development policy criticized the fact that the many words are still not followed by deeds. This was urgently necessary both at the national and international levels and had not been dealt with in New York either. Toepfer said the developing countries had, "in particular, urged" "a change in the consumption habits of the industrialized nations." He said the Commission's work would be continued under his chairmanship for a whole year, and to this end, the policy course had been set. He said that good use had to be made of this year in order to consolidate the profile and decisionmaking power of the institution. Regarding the preservation of forests, "we must and can make progress and achieve more than we did in Rio," he said. The Commission was created to convert the resolutions adopted at the summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 into concrete action. The goal remained an international convention for the preservation of all forests in the world: "This is a heavily burdened field. Many people in the developing countries believe that the developed countries interfere in their own internal affairs and disregard their sovereignty. I believe, however, that something has changed here." The minister described his work in New York as "incredibly labor-intensive, difficult, and tough" -- even though the UN bureaucracy had demonstrated much goodwill. "The largest problems are clearly financial ones," he said, and added that the developing countries emphatically mentioned the fact that "new, predictable financial measures" had been promised in Rio. Commenting on the meeting, German observers from environmental groups and development initiatives said that "hardly any progress" had been made in New York. "As long as the governments confine themselves to continuously repeating noncommittal appeals and are not prepared to assume concrete political obligations, there is the great danger that the whole Rio process will come to nothing."
