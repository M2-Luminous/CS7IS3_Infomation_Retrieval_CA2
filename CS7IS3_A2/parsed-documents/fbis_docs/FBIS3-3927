Beginning today, RENMIN RIBAO will open a column entitled "Talks on Building a Modern Enterprise System," which is aimed at answering new questions as the are raised in practice. We hope that the readers will join us in thinking, exploring, and triumphantly fulfilling this major task entrusted by history. [end editor's note] As enterprise reform has entered the stage of the establishment of a modern enterprise system, does it mean that we are introducing something new with enterprise reform? The managers of some enterprises have even asked with doubt: Do we have to stop the ongoing enterprise reform and start over with the establishment of a modern enterprise system? This question shows that our publicity and explanation of the reform, specifically, the establishment of a modern enterprise system, is not sufficient. Thanks to the vigorous explorations in various fields over the past decade or so, enterprise reform has undergone the different stages of the delegation of power and the sharing of benefits, the two-step reform of substituting taxes for the delivery of profits, the enterprise contract responsibility system, and the transformation of the enterprise operational mechanism. A review of the course that has been taken clearly shows that it has developed from outside to inside, from shallow to deep, and from easy to difficult. The next stage of reform never negates the former. Conversely, the former reform is always the basis and prerequisite of the one that follows, which is introduced on the basis of the priorities and difficult points raised by the former. The relationship between the two is between inheritance and development. The four aspects of a modern enterprise system constitute the highest objective of enterprise reform. Now this objective has been clearly set forth before us. It is the result of constant explorations over the past decade or so. This objective is not the result of one individual's sudden inspiration. Instead, it lay latent in every stage of enterprise reform. The "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Economic Structural Reform" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee clearly stated that the purpose of enterprise reform is that "the enterprise should truly be made a relatively independent economic entity and should become a producer and operator in socialist commodity production which is independent and responsible for its own profits and losses, which is capable of transforming and developing itself, and which acts as a legal person with certain rights and duties." When the "regulations" were promulgated, the objective of enterprise reform were expressed in more explicit terms: "The enterprise should meet market demand and become a producer and operational unit of commodity production which is independent and responsible for its own profits and losses, which is capable of developing itself and exercising self restraint, and acts which as a legal person enjoying independent civil rights and undertaking civil duties." The different expressions may inevitably indicate the characteristics of the specific stage, but the theme of pushing enterprises to the market and changing their status of being attached to the government is the same. There are successful experiences as well as setbacks and lessons to be drawn from the past decade of enterprise reform. The formulation of establishing a modern enterprise system derives from summing up both experience and lessons. Separating government administration from enterprise management and ownership from operation has been the clear guiding ideology of enterprise reform. With the further deepening of reform, we are making more explorations in this field. As both the contract system and the "regulations" have not touched on the central question of enterprise property rights, there will be numerous difficulties in implementing the guiding ideology. Proceeding from the analysis of these circumstances, we have come to the following conclusion: When property rights are not clearly defined, it will be impossible to separate government administration from enterprise management and ownership from operation. Therefore, we say that the establishment of a modern enterprise system, which clearly defines property rights, is being proposed to meet the needs of deepened enterprise reform. It is aimed at developing and improving rather than negating the measures of enterprise reform, which include the contracted responsibility system and the "regulations." When the establishment of a modern enterprise system is still being tried out, the enterprises that have not been selected for undergoing the experiment should continue the effective reform methods, which have been implemented or are being implemented and which conform to enterprise reality. In the course of practice, they should try to move closer to the standard of a modern enterprise system.
