Such observation has persuasive power because of the fact that toward the end of last year North Korea finalized laws pertaining to opening up, including the law on lease of land and the foreign investment law, and that President Kim Il-song emphasized the trade-first policy in his New Year address. The North Korean nuclear issue, which has been blocking external cooperation up to now, still remains unsolved. However, with the possibility of the resolution of the problem during the first half of the year, the people will pay attention to North Korea's moves toward opening up. In fact, North Korea was reported to have been suffering from economic difficulties, including negative growth, during the past three years. As the result, it is likely that North Korea will inevitably take steps for economic revitalization in any form, even for the sake of maintaining its political system. President Kim unusually admitted the failure in the third Seven Year Plan during the 21st Plenary Session of the sixth party Central Committee last year. Under these circumstances, North Korea dispatched Hwang Chang-yop, one of the real power holders within the government, to Beijing with a view to improving relations with China and to grasping the real situation of Chinese-style reform. It is believed that he visited China so that North Korea could review its own opening up. During his stay in China for eight days, from 15 to 22 January, Hwang Chang-yop intensively toured Zhuhai's special economic district, an agricultural science research institute, plants, enterprises and other major industrial facilities in Guangdong Province. The government-operated Beijing broadcast reported that in meeting with Hwang Chang-yop, Chinese President Jiang Zemin explained the reform and opening implemented by China and on successes in socialist market economy, and that Hwang praised the achievements made by China in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It was also learned that before and after Hwang's visit to China, North Korea sent a group of economic experts to special economic districts and other areas in China in a bid to grasp the practical situation there. Concerning such moves by North Korea, Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK ambassador to China, revealed that "North Korea recently sent a number of people to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, to personally learn from Chinese-style reform and opening by touring the actual sites and spots. Thus, something appears to be changing in North Korea." North Korea also seems to be interested in economic cooperation with many nations in Asia, other than China, that have grown rapidly in recent years. Amid this situation, Kim Chong-u, vice chairman of the External Economic Commission, who is actually leading the economic opening up, revealed early this month North Korea's willingness to join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Kim Chong-u toured Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong and Vietnam last year. All these moves show that North Korea is seeking economic cooperation with other countries. Experts in North Korean affairs note that North Korea already expressed its will to open up during the Sixth Party Congress in 1980. That time, President Kim expressed for the first time the will to expand exchanges with capitalist countries. According to this, North Korea formulated the Joint Venture Law in 1984 and actively attempted to induce foreign capital. However, since its efforts were not successful, North Korea began to show interest in Chinese-style opening up through special economic zones in the nineties. In the earlier stage, North Korea believed that Chinese-style economic opening up would destroy the socialist political system at last. Therefore, North Korea tried to distance itself from it. However, seeing the economic development successes in the special zones in China and that the political system remained intact, North Korea seemed to have changed its mind. This can be noted from the fact that President Kim Il-song and then Premier Yon Hyong-muk made consecutive tours to special economic zones in China in October 1991. In December of the same year, North Korea officially designated Najin and Sonbong in North Hamgyong Province as "free economic trade zone" as decided by the Administration Council. President Kim Il-song openly expressed his interest in and support for China's economic reform during the events marking the 9 September holiday [DPRK founding anniversary] last year. Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Asian-Pacific Peace Foundation in the ROK, said that "North Korea, finally realizing that there is a road for economic development even by maintaining the socialist system, is advancing along this road." Thus, he stressed that North Korea has already begun to implement the policy of Chinese-style opening up. North Korea is expected to attain the increase in employment and growth in the light industry through opening up and, thus, to upgrade the people's standard of living by revitalizing its stagnant economy. On the other hand, it is likely that North Korea, while operating special economic zones in the district far away from the central area like China does, will apply laws and regulations pertaining to opening up only to these special zones so that the wind of reform will not influence other areas. The prevailing consideration is that North Korea, with not as vast land and as large population as China's, may be able to prevent the wind of reform from expanding on a short-term basis. However, overall opening up of the entire society will be inevitable in the long run.
