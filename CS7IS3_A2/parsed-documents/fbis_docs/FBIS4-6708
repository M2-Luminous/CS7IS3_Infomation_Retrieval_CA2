There would be "essentially no growth in the absence of the package," the IMF said in a study on the macroeconomic effects of the 15.3 trillion yen economic program. The package, which consists of a mix of government spending plus a one-time tax reduction, "will raise the level of output by about three-fourths of 1 percent in both 1994 and 1995," the IMF said in its semiannual review of the world economy. The IMF study also said the stimulative effect of the economic package is expected to cut Japan's current-account surplus by 1.5 percent this year and by a lesser margin in 1995. Without the package, the IMF projects the surplus in Japan's current account, which provides the broadest measure of foreign trade, will rise from 131.4 billion dollars last year to 135.5 billion dollars this year. With the package in place, this year's surplus is expected to shrink by 2.1 billion dollars to 133.4 billion dollars. For 1995, the package is expected to produce a 1.5 billion dollar difference in Japan's projected current-account surplus, from 127.2 billion dollars to 125.7 billion dollars.
