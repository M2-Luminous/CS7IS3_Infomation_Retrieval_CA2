He made a long speech on the current conditions affecting the manufacturing industry and on the basic measures the next government must implement to shore up industrial activities. He began by saying that he generally believes in the government's economic policies, including the opening of the economy, Uruguayan participation in the regional integration project, and the struggle against the fiscal deficit and inflation. [passage omitted] Aguirre said this concept could be applied to industrial policies and industries in general because when you seek prosperity and competitiveness it is not merely to protect industrialists; it is to ensure the contribution of industry to society and its capacity to create genuine jobs and general well-being. [passage omitted] Aguirre talked about the role of the state in society. He said: "The state should not suffocate private companies with regulations, bureaucratic requirements, state competition, and inefficient monopolies. The private sector is the power behind economic development." He added: "The state should not, however, become a spectator--leaving each individual free to do as he pleases--or abandon individuals--even if their efforts are not in the interests of society as a whole." Aguirre said: "The state must decide on priorities, establish controls, orient, stimulate, and simultaneously discourage certain activities through credits, tax exemptions, or foreign exchange rates. These are just a few of the ways the state can guide economic activities." He dismissed the idea that Uruguayans are pessimistic, reluctant to change habits and mental dispositions, or that the small size of the country hinders growth. Talking about the concerns of industry, "government officials, and those of us who wish to govern the country for the next five years," Gonzalo Aguirre said that the so-called "unreal foreign exchange rate" and the loss of competitiveness it causes despite the undeniable industrial increase in productivity "are real factors." He added, however, that the situation did not follow a deliberate government policy. On the contrary, "had the Central Bank not intervened, the difference would be much greater," Aguirre said. [passage omitted] Aguirre said Central Bank policies on foreign exchange have been contradictory because of the general decisions implemented by this government. "If the market determines prices, the value of the dollar--which is just one type of merchandise--should be freely determined by the market. We should not intervene, creating an artificial demand," said Aguirre referring to the Central Bank purchase of dollars when the exchange rate falls due to a lack of demand. Aguirre said the solution is not to implement an abrupt devaluation "on which there is general consensus, except for some groups." Devaluation would temporarily bring the exchange rate to more realistic levels but it would also affect the prices of all products, Aguirre added. Aguirre said: "The solution is not simple, but I would support a proposal to let the dollar float freely. There would be little risk that the foreign exchange rate will fall drastically, given our market conditions. Besides, inflation will also drop when the Central Bank stops issuing money to intervene in the market (through monetary contention)." The vice president admitted that to be competitive we must reduce inefficiencies in industry as well as in the state, and possibly seek a compromise between devaluation and inflation. Aguirre then talked about the need to reform the state. He said the problem is not just the size of the state. The real problem centers on operating costs, public spending structures, and the fiscal pressure to finance an oversized state. He said the state influences costs when it determines public utility rates, the price of gasoline, interest rates through the Bank of the Republic, bus fares, insurance rates, taxes, and social security contributions. He said the government has been implementing measures to reduce the size of the state as of 1990. In some ways it has succeeded and in some ways it has not, partly due to resistance to change by politicians and the population. Aguirre said that despite some progress, the state as a whole continues to be inefficient and the cost of this inefficiency is transferred to local consumers and foreign consumers in the case of products we export. Among the reforms, Aguirre mentioned the social security system, which must be reformed without altering acquired rights. He said that workers compensations (family subsidies, health insurance, unemployment insurance, etc.) must be corrected because they do not have genuine financing, as should the funds that operate in the red--particularly rural funds. These items are a burden on the Industry and Commerce Fund (which operates in the black) because they prevent it from lowering costs. [passage omitted] Aguirre said other factors harming industries are the compensatory mechanisms, which do not exist or are insufficient to face direct or indirect protectionist policies. Aguirre said: "Tariff reductions implemented within the framework of the Asuncion Treaty [which created the Common Market of the South, Mercosur], or practiced in general in a gradual manner, are not bad and the productive apparatus has accepted them. What is unreasonable is to implement them under unfair or unequal conditions without full reciprocity inside and outside Mercosur." The vice president said Uruguay must adopt compensatory mechanisms when Argentina and Brazil adopt protectionist measures against Uruguayan exports through their statistic rates or other mechanisms. He added that this does not mean we will abandon the policy of economic opening. They will be implemented only to prevent suffering undue and unnecessary damage. Aguirre closed his speech by citing some items of what could be a considered a tentative Program of Industrial Policy as of 1995. Objective: A. To create the minimum conditions for industries to compete in the international market. B. To maintain policies to cover the entire field, seeking competitiveness among our industries without neglecting official support to specific groups. C. To increase worker training in new technologies. D. To reform the state. E. To reform the Social Security System, the tax system, and interest rates, and to eliminate state monopolies. F. To introduce flexibility into the labor market. G. To continue the program of economic opening and regional integration on the basis of reciprocity and compensatory mechanisms for specific situations.
