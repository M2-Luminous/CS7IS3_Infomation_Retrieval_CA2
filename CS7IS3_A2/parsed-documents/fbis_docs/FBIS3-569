There are no ethnic territories, but the ethnic factor has been used in the struggle for power. (?In this framework), ethnic feelings have been created and have become a reality. Democratization has fallen into the trap of ethnicity--first during the elections and then afterwards. I think the use of force on 21 October was the manifestation of the ethnic radicalism--of the ethnic extremism--of certain elements who, using the Army as a base, committed (?a crime). So what followed after that--the massacre of people inside the country--is the manifestation of ethnic radicalism. On the one hand, there is Tutsi radicalism, and then there is Hutu radicalism. When the extremists met, that created the tragedy we have seen. [Mas] Nevertheless, the government and parliament--in other words, the institutions--have been set up in spite of everything. However, there is one institution, the Army, which seems to have great problems with regard to one part of the nation. A majority of the Burundian nation appears to feel great mistrust for the Army. [Buyoya] The Burundian Army is, first, a consequence of the history of Burundi. Indeed, there is today an ethnic component--the Tutsis--who are the majority in the Army. So the problem we face is that, because of propaganda and politics, the Hutus have been led to mistrust the Army. The question is: What can we do to change the situation? I think that reforms had been started to make all segments of the population of Burundi (?feel at home) in this Army. The Army has probably also been manipulated and used by politicians. I did not think it was an Army initiative to protect this or that individual, or to adopt this or that political position. The fact is, however, that the Army was used for political ends by other people--people who think that to be against the Army is politically advantageous, and others who think that to get the Army to take part in shows of force like that of 21 October is advantageous. Moreover, the Army had even agreed that reforms could be carried out. Those who need to make the reforms-- in other words, the political authorities, the politicians--must know then that the troops must be reeducated to learn what their place and their role is today. [Mas] So the Army has to be reformed. Meanwhile, how is security to be ensured in the country? [Buyoya] For me, to create security does not mean increasing the number of policemen, the number of troops or anything. It means, first and foremost, clear and precise orientation toward peace by the authorities. We sometimes find equivocal attitudes and speeches, which means that organized groups in this or that category even believe they have support when they create chaos. First, we need to drop this tendency that we have had for so long of walking a tightrope ethnically and politically when dealing with certain questions-- especially the question of security. There must be a consensus for peace. To take the actual case of the Army: It is true that the tragedy started off from the Army. Today, however, I think the Burundian Army--or at least its staff, its organized structures--has declared its loyalty to the government. Now the government, the political authorities, must be able to use the Army like the other structures of the state to make peace. So, if tomorrow the Army rejects this, if there are elements in the Army working in the opposite direction of this loyalty, this is a problem that has to be solved. The political authorities have to solve it. I think what we need today is this determination to be able to reverse the tendency. This is essential: If we do not manage to do this, Burundi will be on the way to civil war.
