In terms of the number of statesmen attending it, the summit also proved useful for bilateral contacts that otherwise would not be made. Aside from that, however, it simply served to emphasize the contradictions and the discrepancies between the two Ibero-American worlds and point out the differences inside each of these worlds. It is, therefore, almost impossible to reach agreements at these summits, particularly on principles so broad that their contents prove to be obvious and end up by becoming almost irrelevant. There is, however, one noticeable exception. Cuba invariably takes the opportunity afforded to it by Argentine President Carlos Menem to recruit supporters for its sad cause. This time, after Menem's customary attack on the Castroist regime, President Itamar Franco sympathized with Cuba's plight, seeing "positive signs of a reform" being implemented on the island and defended Cuba's readmission into the Inter-American system. Commander Fidel Castro decided to contribute to the agenda of the Summit of the Americas, which will be held in Miami in December, even though Cuba has not been invited to attend. As expected, Castro calls for the end of the economic embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States, the evacuation of Guantanamo Base and of the U.S. bases in Panama, the pardoning of the Latin American foreign debt, and the abolition of Super Law 301. Ibero-American countries should really do their best to clarify the distorted image Cuba reflects. For the past decade, no Latin American country has subjected the island to any important or special trade restrictions and for the past decade European countries have been trading with Cuba as they wish. Despite all this, Cuba's misery is attributed to an embargo imposed on it by the United States. This is one of those lies that run the risk of becoming accepted as true out of sheer repetition. Cuba faces dreadful economic hardships because Fidel Castro perseveres with his clumsy policies -- maybe because he chose socialism instead of capitalism, maybe because he remains in power thanks to his caudillo-like dictatorship instead of trusting the virtues of liberal democracy. The U.S. embargo is the best excuse for Fidel Castro's failure. There is, however, another side to this coin. There is harsh criticism in the United States of the embargo on Cuba and its exclusion from the Inter-American system. The U.S. people understand that Castro uses the embargo to remain in power without having to commit himself to any reform that would undoubtedly lead to the redemocratization of the island. An ever-increasing number of influential U.S. citizens, including members of the active Cuban colony in Florida, openly call for normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations. As to Cuba's readmission into the OAS, it must be recalled that the reasons for suspending Cuba from this forum have ceased to exist. Cuba no longer exports the revolution and the original reasons for temporarily preventing the Cuban Government from fulfilling its functions at the OAS no longer exist either. In addition, most OAS member countries have diplomatic and trade relations with Havana. In spite of what President Itamar Franco said, there are no signs in Cuba that democracy is being restored. Economic dogmas are more lax as a result of the increasing shortage of basic products and the opening of the country to tourism is the only way the government could at least partially replace the inflow of strong currencies previously received from Russia. The democracies of the hemisphere and President Itamar Franco should, however, press the Cuban dictator in a friendly way to agree to freedom-promoting political reforms. This is the goodwill sign Fidel Castro should give before the Inter-American community takes another step forward.
