Official talks between the Russian and Serbian patriarchs and President Milosevic lasted for about an hour, after which a luncheon was given in honor of the respected guest from Russia. After that the Serbian president told reporters: "Let me express my great satisfaction on behalf of citizens of our country and on my own behalf that we have had the opportunity to welcome Aleksiy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. "We interpret this visit as a symbol of his efforts to have peace prevail in this area, a sign of great solidarity with our people who are experiencing great difficulties, and a sign of goodwill and resolve to find the best possible solution for the big crisis in the area," Milosevic said. Recalling that the friendship between the Serb and Russian peoples has historic traditions, President Milosevic stressed: "We do not live in history, we live in the present time and for the sake of the present time we highly respect this moral, brave, and peacemaking gesture by the Russian patriarch -- his visit to our country." Patriarch Aleksiy expressed satisfaction with the warm welcome in the "fraternal Serbian state." He said: "We are deeply grateful to the Serb people who are warmly receiving us, as representatives of Russia, wherever we go. This is a fraternal visit, but at this time we cannot remain indifferent to the bloodshed and suffering of the innocent people in the area," the patriarch said. "We will be happy if we succeed in making a contribution toward achieving peace in the area," he said, and expressed his gratitude to President Milosevic for the cordial reception and "for enabling us to hold joint talks about all key isses which are troubling this area." Patriarch Aleksiy stressed that the visit is to continue and the bishop of Backa, Irinej, has specified that a trip to Sokolac and Sarajevo is planned for tomorrow, when the Serbian and Russian patriarchs are expected to meet Cardinal Franjo Kuharic and Reis ul-Ulema Mustafa Ceric. To a journalist's remark that Sarajevo Radio has reported that Mustafa Ceric refused to meet [Serbian] Patriarch Pavle, Bishop Irinej said the meeting has been officially confirmed, and the Serbian church is not taking media reports as an official refusal. After a meeting in the afternoon with Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic, the guest from Russia will visit Sremski Karlovci and Novi Sad. Patriarch Aleksiy is expected to visit Sokolac and Sarajevo tomorrow.
