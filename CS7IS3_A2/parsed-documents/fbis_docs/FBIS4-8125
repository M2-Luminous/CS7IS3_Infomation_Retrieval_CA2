Bosnian general Rasim Delic and Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic will now have a 48-hour cooling off period during which they will both hold consultations with political authorities, said United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander in Bosnia, General Michael Rose. The meeting was called to reach an agreement on a ceasefire for the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde, where the Serbs launched a major offensive two weeks ago, and on ways of securing a global solution to the Bosnia crisis. But Delic insisted on a "short-term arrangement" for Gorazde while the Bosnian Serbs were seeking an overall ceasefire, UNPROFOR spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon said. [passage omitted] Despite the breakdown, the UNPROFOR spokesman said Rose remained confident an agreement would eventually be signed. [passage omitted]
