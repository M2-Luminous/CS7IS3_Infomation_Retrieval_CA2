Rather the reverse: Parties and movements that have jumped into the election race threw themselves with gusto into mutual score-settling at all sorts of meetings, in newspapers, and on the air. The accents at political battlefields have shifted perceptibly. Just a few months ago it was considered good manners in the local political establishment to blame all troubles on the ill-fated parliament. A complete fiasco in the economy, the impoverishment of the people, the republic split into pieces... Now that the parliament is living through its last days, the role of a scapegoat more often is attached to representatives of the parties that already had deputy mandates and are vying for them again (of whom, we should note, there are quite a few). The logic is simple: They have already messed up everything and now they are going for it again. Elections by party lists, by the way, is not the only innovation in the election law adopted in October of last year. The number of seats in Moldova's supreme legislative body has been cut by more than a factor of three--to 104. Only those parties and movements which will gather at least 4 percent of the total number of the electorate vote may count on these mandates. Such rigid restrictions have predetermined to a large extent high heat since the very early stage of the election marathon. Of 26 parties and movements officially registered in Moldova only half have been able to register their lists with the Central Electoral Commission [CEC]. Only on the third try did CEC members vote to register the list of candidates from the bloc of leftist forces, formed by the Socialist Party of Moldova and the "Unitata-Unity" intermovement, and even that after removing from the title the words "leftist forces" and dropping from the list Petr Shornikov--a current deputy and one of the intermovement's founders--whose name was close to the top of the list. Shornikov's "transgression" was that he had delivered a series of lectures in Tiraspol university (after he had lost his job in Chisinau, by the way). "...What we have is an attempt by representatives of parties and organizations of unionist-frontist orientation in the CEC to perpetrate a purge of the future parliament already at the start of the election campaign," KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI newspaper commented on this fact. From the very beginning, the Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova [ADPM] positioned itself as one of the leaders in the race. The agrarian deputy faction had been a rather impressive political force in the "departing" parliament as well, which more than once determined the fate of principal battles. The peasant tendency for caution and deliberation is reflected appropriately in the centrist position taken by this party, which cannot fail to appeal to a majority of rural voters. In addition, at the very threshold of the election the ADPM received a solid boost in the personae of current Parliament Speaker Petru Lucinschi and Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, who are listed in the agrarians' electoral list as Nos. 2 and 3, respectively. Next, most observers line up the contender parties in approximately the following order: social democratic; socialist; republican and the party of reform; the CDPF (Christian-Democratic Popular Front) alliance, and so on. Local press is currently filled with electoral lists of parties and blocs and their programs. Most of these lengthy documents contain very correct ideas and words regarding the sociopolitical situation in the republic, the necessity of urgent measures aimed at reanimation of the economy, combating crime and corruption, and protection of the indigent. The difference begins to come through as soon as it comes to the point of discussing the method of future development of Moldova. Agrarians, social democrats, republicans, and socialists aim at building an independent state. The other part of the spectrum of parties--the CDPF, the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Labor Party--advocate unification with Romania. Unfortunately, this position of the latter costs the republic very, very dearly--from the still oozing wounds of the bloody conflict on Dniester to immense economic losses stemming from Moldova's long procrastination regarding joining the CIS and all resulting consequences. Through suffering, deprivation, and pain, the society is coming to an understanding of harsh realities of current life. All last year's sociological surveys invariably registered the decline in the rating of the Popular Front and its fixation on unification with Romania, which, in the opinion of some observers, prompted some CDPF leaders to hastily distance themselves from it and quickly put together their own parties and movements. Others see in it only a pre-election operational maneuver, a peculiar attempt to achieve victory if not by aptitude (in this case it would be more appropriate to say--political authority) then by numbers. Actually, it is unlikely that the "unionists" themselves believe in their victory. Hence their vicious attacks in the local radical press against leaders and parties that are considered likely to succeed. In short, there is no shortage of predictions. As there is, actually, no substantial spread of opinions. In all probability the Agrarian-Democratic Party will win the election with 33-35 percent of the vote--this is the opinion, for instance, of Anatoliy Gudym [name as transliterated], the head of the expert center of the Industrialists Union of Moldova. Social democrats' chances are considered to be quite good (among their assets are a score of political initiatives and the European model of reforming the economy), the party of reform (or, as it is unofficially called, the directors party), and socialists, who are most consistent in defending the rights of citizens regardless of nationality. Overall, many experts believe that the new parliament will be an improvement over the previous one. First and foremost by its qualitative composition: Its core will be comprised of professional politicians, economists, and jurists. They will, of course, inherit a terrible legacy. In its legislative "itch" the previous parliament over three years has "baked" over 200 laws, which nevertheless did not save the republic from political and economic cataclysms. Now instead of such a long running in place (or sometimes backwards) several very serious steps forward will be required simultaneously: adoption of a new constitution; ratification of documents on CIS membership; moving the economy forward; and resolution of the Dniester area and Gagauz problems. Because in a split Moldova even a new constitution will remain more of a symbolic document, and one cannot speak, of course, of an integrated economic organism without the 37 percent of the republic's industrial potential that is located on the Dniester left bank. Or a reform aimed at nursing this organism to health. Will the new parliament be able to rid itself of the intolerance syndrome of its predecessor and set up an effective political dialog with the Dniester area? For the time being, however, Tiraspol and Komrat authorities decided not to hold elections to the Moldovan Parliament in their regions, which, in the opinion of a number of observers, only plays into the hands of radicals of all colors. Finally, one more circumstance that has a most immediate bearing on the election campaign. President Mircea Snegur, who somewhat demonstratively had maintained his distance from this campaign, finally did break his neutrality. He said that he would support in the elections those parties that advocate an independent Moldova. And literally a few days ago Snegur proposed to conduct a national sociological survey--"consult with the people"--asking just one question: on independence and integrity of Moldova (the Parliament Presidium accepted this proposal). In this way the president is, first, trying to gain support in his struggle against the opposition, which increasingly vehemently accuses him of blocking the process of unification with Romania, and, second, wants through the mouth of the people to give a sort of mandate to future members of the country's supreme legislative body.
