FR940727-1-00004 FR940727-1-00001 4. Provide for the Pasteurization of Oil (Highly Concentrated Milkfat) in the Manufacture of Anhydrous Milkfat Pasteurization of dairy products ensures the destruction of pathogenic organisms. The General Specifications require cream to be pasteurized in the production of anhydrous milkfat. In some segments of the dairy industry, this pasteurization step occurs when the milkfat in the cream has been concentrated to a level where it is considered to be ``oil'' rather than cream. Changes in the General Specifications are being proposed to provide for this industry practice. 5. Restrict the Amount of Other Butter Constituents in Anhydrous Milkfat When Butter is used as an Ingredient When butter is used in anhydrous milkfat, the majority of the non-milkfat constituents normally found in butter are removed during the manufacture of the product. The non-milkfat constituents which are removed include protein, ash, and salt. Changes are being proposed to restrict the amount of these non-milkfat constituents that would be permitted to remain in anhydrous milkfat. Anhydrous milkfat specifications established by USDA are voluntary specifications that are developed to facilitate the orderly marketing process. Dairy plants are free to choose whether or not to use the specifications. When manufactured or processed dairy products are graded or inspected, the USDA regulations governing the grading or inspection of dairy products are used. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 58 Dairy products, Food grades and standards, Food labeling, Reporting and record keeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, it is proposed that 7 CFR Part 58, Subpart B, be amended to read as follows: PART 58_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR Part 58, Subpart B, continues to read as follows: Authority: Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, Secs. 202&hyph;208, 60 Stat. 1087, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 1621&hyph;1627, unless otherwise noted. 2. In ยง58.305, paragraphs (b) and (c) are revised to read as follows: ยง58.305 Meaning of words. * * * * * (b) Butteroil.

It contains not less than 99.6 percent fat and not more than 0.3 percent moisture and not more than 0.1 percent other butter constituents, of which the salt shall be not more than 0.05 percent. Antioxidants permitted to be used are as follows:
