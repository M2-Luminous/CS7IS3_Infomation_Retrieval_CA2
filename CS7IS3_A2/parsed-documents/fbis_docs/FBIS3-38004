He told Interfax-Ukraine that the statement of the president's press service made public Wednesday had not said anything of his unwillingness to run n the elections. What Kravchuk is doing, Chornovil thinks, is trying to foil the presidential elections, at least in June. Chornovil was one of Kravchuk's rivals in the December 1991 presidential elections.
