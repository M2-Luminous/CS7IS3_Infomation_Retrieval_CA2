How serious is it? [Borowski] Well, one can illustrate this through several examples. Let us take the 1994 expenditures devoted to the health service, which amount to a total of about 84 trillion zlotys [Z], whereas servicing our domestic debt amounts to Z82 trillion. The Defense Ministry's entire budget, about which there is currently a huge ongoing fight and debate, amounts to Z47 trillion. The Internal Affairs Ministry's entire budget--that is to say, for public security--amounts to more than Z20 trillion, and the budget of the Education Ministry is Z67 trillion. Or let us look at this from a different perspective: If it was not for the domestic debt incurred toward domestic banks and other institutions, we would have no budget deficit in 1994 at all. [passage omitted] [Baczynski, addressing viewers] We are waiting for your responses to the following question, and let me remind you what it is: In a situation where the state lacks money to devote to important expenditures like the health service, education, or retirement pensions, should the state borrow money or not? Should it incur debts or should it not? We are waiting for your responses, and right now I can see that the result is, I think, four to one to No, so most of you so far think that the state budget should not incur a debt. We will see whether you will change your minds as the program continues. Let me remind you that the biggest part of our debt is made up of debts incurred toward foreign creditors, which right now, Mr. Prime Minister [addressing Borowski], I think amounts to $47.5 billion, as far as I can recall.... [Borowski] The figure keeps changing everyday because the foreign-currency rates keep changing, but it is something like that. [Baczynski] Please, tell us--how much will we have to spend this year to service this foreign debt? [Borowski] Our assumptions are that it will have to be about Z30 trillion, which, taking the average dollar exchange rate for 1994, is about $1.3 billion. [Baczynski] But this is based on the assumption that we will manage to get the debt reduction talked about during the background report? [Borowski] Yes, it is based on that assumption. [passage omitted] [Baczynski] So the situation looks like quite a paradox indeed: We are making efforts to have our debts--incurred in commercial banks--reduced, but if we manage to obtain the reduction, we will have to repay more than we have been paying up to now since up to now we have been servicing the debt only to some extent. But we are doing this--it is my understanding--among other things in order to obtain new credits. Which brings me to my next question to the minister and deputy prime minister: It is bad enough that we have this enormous burden of old debts, but we also keep incurring new ones. We heard data during the background report concerning the amount of money lent to us by the IMF, the World Bank, and the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]. After having had some experience with the state's finances already, do you think that we were justified in incurring those new credits? Are we using them the right way? [Borowski] To kind of continue the tradition that Professor Osiatynski has initiated, I will also begin with something other than what the question was about. Namely, the professor talked here about the great success of "Solidarity" governments concerning the form of foreign-debt reduction. I share this view and that was indeed an achievement, but, in all fairness, we should add something that was not an achievement of "Solidarity" governments--namely, that these governments failed to sufficiently develop a proexport economy in Poland. What was supposed to be a lesser burden as a result of export development after a few years, after the reduction, when both the debt repayments and interest-rate repayments were supposed to begin increasing--unfortunately, that is getting ever less realistic currently, or it is being made very difficult since we are facing a major foreign-trade deficit and that is also a major problem that our economy is facing. [passage omitted] But I would like to answer Mr. Baczynski's question now. [Baczynski] Thank you. [Borowski] Well, regarding the credits you asked about, if we are to conduct a restructuring--I apologize to Mr. Student here for using the word--of the economy, and if we are to modernize industry, build highways, or modernize the telecommunications network, Poland of course does not have its own internal capital to accomplish all that. So Poland has to borrow money, but these are the types of loans that will pay back in the future, on the condition of course that they were made the right way.... [Baczynski] And were they in fact? [Borowski, hesitating] I think we do not know everything regarding this issue right now since there are different messages coming in. I want to say that a World Bank mission will come to Poland in the near future to conduct evaluations along with us on how these credits are being used. There are some already known cases, which were also questioned by the Supreme Chamber of Control, of not very good use of these credits, but I would not like to make general statements in this regard. I think there are quite a few loans that are being implemented the right way. [passage omitted] [Baczynski, addressing Kolodko] You just said, Professor: Is there anybody to borrow money from? I think we should return to the question asked by Mr. Poleski here--namely, who does the state borrow money from? [Borowski] Exactly. Perhaps we should explain this since it is a fundamental issue. Well, in a situation of a budget deficit, which means revenue from taxes and other sources are lower than the budget expenditures, one must find a way of getting money from some source. People in Poland often talk in terms of: Well, the deficit is just something you can live with, there is always a way to finance it, we can always write it down and then spend the money somehow. But the problem is the budget must have a way of finding the money that is the deficit, so where will it find it? Well, the government can of course sell its securities among other things, such as television commercials, and perhaps our student colleague here has even purchased one already, and, if not, I recommend it highly since it really pays back.... [passage omitted] So like I said, government securities are one way but there is not much to be gained this way, and the other possibility that was used extensively was simply through bank loans. Banks have money they collect from citizens.... [passage omitted] I would like to present an interesting interpretation of the domestic debt issue here. Let us look at it this way: Banks have collected money from citizens, then they lent the money to the state Treasury, that is the budget. The budget then spent the money.... [Baczynski, interrupting] For socially justifiable reasons? [Borowski] Undoubtedly they were socially justifiable reasons, and this way the citizens also used the money because, after all, employees of the health service, the education system, the Army, and so forth--all of them are citizens. So one can put it this way, at the expense of some simplification: Some citizens lent money to some other citizens. Perhaps in some cases they were even the same people since after all, the savings were collected by everyone. All this money was processed through the banks and through the budget itself and so what am I getting at? Well, what I am getting at is that if there are some people out there today who perhaps say: Why don't we just not repay that? After all, these are state-owned banks and a state-owned budget so what is the fuss all about? Well, what I am saying to that is that would simply mean that somebody will not get his money if the debt is not repaid. So not repaying the debt is out of the question here. What is possible with foreign debt for instance, in terms of some form of negotiation of debt remission, delays in repayments and so forth since at the other end you have enormous banks with enormous potentials--well, that is not possible with regard to domestic debt.
