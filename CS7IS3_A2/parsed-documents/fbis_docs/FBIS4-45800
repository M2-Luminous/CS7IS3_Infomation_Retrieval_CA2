The Elbe is supposed to be made clean again. According to new tests, the river has actually been spared much pollution since the [political changes in 1989], but over the years high levels of heavy metals and organic contaminants have collected in the sediment of the Elbe and its tributaries. At 1,165 km in length and up to nine km in width [in some places] with a average current of 710 m[.sup]3[/] of water per second, the Elbe is one of the largest rivers in Europe. But at the same time, it is also one of the dirtiest: the Elbe is highly polluted and in some stretches ecologically destroyed. Around 7.6 million people in the nine German states either permanently or for long periods of time receive drinking water which does not meet the requirements of the European Union (EU) and the drinking water regulations. Germany, the Czech Republic and the EU under the roof of the International Commission for the Protection of the Elbe (IKSE) already joined together years ago to save the Elbe. By 1995 pollution of the Elbe and her tributaries is supposed to be substantially reduced, and a clear improvement in the water quality up to grade II ("moderately polluted") is supposed to have been reached. Moreover, the Ministry of Research and Technology has also taken on the Elbe and her tributaries with its "Elbe 2000" project. The goal: to win back stretches of the river as renaturalized river meadows left to nature. By the year 2000 the pollution of the Elbe should have been reduced to such an extent that, according to the BMFT, "the basis [will have been created] for a water system which can be used in an ecologically balanced, sensible manner in harmony with nature." The BMFT has made 61 million German marks available, and all investigations by the "Elbe Research" working group of the International Commission for the Protection of the Elbe (IKSE) are being coordinated. The numerous factory shut-downs after the political upheaval have done the Elbe good. She carried less ammonium and mercury in 1993 than in 1985, but more chlorinated hydrocarbons. According to tests by the Elbe's water quality station in Schnackenberg, the amount of ammonium sank from 54,000 metric tons in 1985 to 7,700 metric tons in 1992 and to 6,900 metric tons in 1993. The amount of mercury dropped from 28 metric tons in 1985 to 4.2 in 1992 and 1.9 in 1993. In contrast, pollution of the Elbe from chlorinated hydrocarbons climbed in 1993 to 1985 levels. Last year the concentrations of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, a waste product in the production of the insecticide Lindane, were at 110 kg far higher than the 1985 level of 85 kg. According to Hamburg's senator for the environment Fritz Vahrenholt, it is suspected that the pollution can be traced back to illegal dumping. In the meantime the first results of the joint "Elbe Tributaries" project are available. They show "that a persistent improvement in the Elbe's water quality is only possible if at least the large main tributaries are included in the clean-up measures," since it is through them that much of the pollution gets into the river, especially the heavy metals. Scientists are particularly directing their attention to the heavy metal contamination of the sediment, since this can be determined not only at certain points but can also be followed along downstream. Sediment provides a "long-term memory" which mirrors for a longer period of time the accumulation of suspended materials. The fine grain fraction with a granulation of up to 0.02 mm is being studied, because it corresponds to the suspended material transported in water which, because of its grain fineness, has a high bonding cability with heavy metals and numerous organic pollutants, and [thus] accumulates them. The natural (geologic) heavy metal concentration is used as a reference base: values at the level of this geologic concentration correspond to class zero ("unpolluted"), and each doubling of the values means a move to a new classification. The analyses show that the sediment in the basin near Leipzig is "heavily polluted" (class four) with cadmium. The scientists also found arsenic and lead in high concentrations: in Muenzbach near Freiberg sediment was sampled which contained a class seven (extremely polluted) level of arsenic concentration. The researchers trace this back to the steel and iron industry there, which is also responsible for the high levels of lead. Nickel was found in the sediment beneath the Aue nickel plant at levels up to class five ("heavily to excessively polluted"). At the lower reaches of the Joint Basin east of Bitterfeld lies the man-made Muldenstein lake which at the beginning of the sixties was laid out in a former brown coal opencast mining area. As it turned out, the [lake] forms a sediment trap, as the sediment brought in from the basin had accumulated here in a layer averaging about 30 cm high. In all, the researchers calculated that about 25,000 metric tons per year accumulate in the sediment of the artificial lake, or about 400,000 metric tons since its flooding. It contains about 1,030 metric tons of zinc, 114 metric tons of lead, 101 metric tons arsenic, 98 metric tons copper, 71 metric tons chromium, 43 metric tons nickel, 32 metric tons cadmium and about 1 metric ton of mercury. The uranium level is estimated to be 50 to 70 metric tons. Accumulation in the basin constitutes a serious potential danger, since if it is stirred up again and comes in contact with oxygen, the highly toxic cadmium in particular can become mobilized and pass into the food chain or the ground water. Keeping the public's drinking water safe is, according to the BMFT, an urgent goal, since the nine German states, which in great part constitute areas of water shortage, will even in the future not be able to dispense with obtaining drinking water from the bank filtrate of the Elbe. Therefore, four pilot or demonstration facilities for obtaining drinking water from bank filtrate or from the ground water in the Elbe's drainage area have been being funded since 1990. It is also being studied here whether using activated carbon filters can make it easier to obtain drinking water from heavily polluted bank filtrate.

It is still a long way off before the pollution of the rivers is reduced to acceptable levels.
