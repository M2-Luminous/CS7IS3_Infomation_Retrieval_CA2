This basic philosophy of the social market economy has come under pressure to prove its worth in the course of international economic developments. We are able to produce an increasing amount of goods, at increasingly cheaper prices, with an increasingly smaller work force. And what stands at the end of this scenario: one part of the work force doing highly qualified jobs, one part working but nevertheless poor, and the rest without work but "provided for?" In this situation it deserves our respect that U.S. President Clinton asked the economics, finance, and also the labor ministers of the seven major industrial nations to gather into "conclave" to discuss a single issue: Jobs. For once, far away from the traditional ritual of world economic summits, where participants only discuss interests, inflation rates, monetary relations, budget and balance of payments deficits. These are undoubtedly decisive macroeconomic parameters on which investments and economic growth depend not only at the national but the international level. Yet with any investment and growth one must also ask whether, and what kind of, jobs will be created. Employment provides possibilities for life, guarantees participation in the social processes, creates personal and social security, and allows people to show solidarity for others. New technologies, new structures, new demands for qualification -- all this is seen not as progress but as threat, unless they provide the ground for new jobs. Germany Comes Second in Unemployment Rate Statistics The situation in the industrialized nations is serious. As a result of the international recession, unemployment has reached terrifying dimensions. Nobody would challenge the total that was presented at the opening of the G-7 Jobs Conference in Detroit. Yet, as far as the question "What must be done?" is concerned, the German delegation did not come empty-handed. After all, we are fighting unemployment with enormous political and financial expense. And by international standards, our situation is not quite as bad as the self-torturing debates on Germany as an investment center would have us believe. Here are two facts in this connection: 1. Regarding the unemployment rate, Germany comes in excellent second place -- behind Japan, but still ahead of the United States, which had often been presented as "employment wonderland." 2. Germany's fine position as far as unemployment among young people is concerned is particularly noteworthy -- particularly thanks to our excellent system of apprentice training, where modern theory and practical work in the enterprises guided by the market have established a constructive symbiosis. The condition for overcoming the employment crisis is that people go along with it. People must not feel that progress and change are a threat but rather a positive challenge. However, to be able to come to that, man has to be given the means to hold his own in the process of technological-structural changes and take an active share in these changes. And, if at one point he is unable to do so, if he loses his job, he must be protected against social decline. Social Partnership Is an Important Advantage for Germany Labor market policy, as we have developed it here in Germany, fulfills both of these tasks. It allows for and maintains people's ability to overcome the changes -- among other things through information, consultation, training, and mainly through professional qualification. Labor market policy is therefore a bridge between the economic and social spheres, an indispensable addition to economic and financial policy. Our labor administration technique, which combines singly handly both areas of labor market policy, namely the active shaping of labor promotion and social unemployment benefits and is financed through the contribution payments of employers and employees, met with great interest. Self-administration, which is based on the technique, is an expression of the comprehensive effort of the social partnership to be the decisive element of our social and societal structures. This is strengthening social peace, and for other countries [this represents] a German advantage as economic center that must not be underestimated. The great efforts of social partners at the enterprise, industry, and labor levels, under the current critical situation in which we have to protect jobs, initiate the necessary revisions of our policy, and set the course for higher competitive strength and economic growth, have been noted with interest. Our mature and time-tested culture of social partnership is also an advantage for Germany as an industrial center! Including employers and trade unions in the implementation of labor market policy strengthens the attempt to reach joint solutions. Thus, we also achieve a sensible balance between the two sides of labor market policy, the economic and the social sphere. In some countries, however, forces are gaining the upper hand that are trying to get the job crisis under control through radical cuts in social security, the underlying idea being: cut costs, cut prices, create more jobs. Examples for this can be found in the United States. Many new jobs have been created there over the past 20 years. The percentage of gainfully employed people greatly increased, and it has been possible to tackle the employment problem better then elsewhere. However -- as President Clinton frankly and self-critically admitted in his opening address -- the employment problem has been exchanged for an income problem. The average workweek for American employees is longer today, yet Americans do not earn more than they did 20 years ago. Many of them belong to the so-called working poor. These are people who, despite the fact that they have a job, are unable to sufficiently provide for themselves and their families. This kind of job creation cannot be a sensible objective. Why should somebody work if he remains dependent on the state at the same time? A gap must remain between work and poverty. It was mainly this understanding that made President Clinton take the initiative for the Detroit Jobs Conference. Experiences were to be exchanged on an alternative to the "working poor" employment model. Germany was able to point to good experiences and results. Due to the Federal Government's policy, some 3.3 million new jobs were created by 1992 in the old laender, most of them good, self-sustaining jobs with good pay and a clear distance from the poverty line. Yet, sufficiently high wages are possible in the long run only with adequate productivity, which is mainly dependent on innovative products and procedures and the quality of work. Here we are now reaping the fruits of decades of efforts in vocational training and adapting the qualifications of our gainfully employed to the challenges of technological-structural change. All that has been well-recognized by our friends and partners. Yet, because of it, we cannot and will not mount the high horse. High incomes and high quality social security systems are the result of a healthy economy. In a world economy based on the division of labor, an internationally outstanding standard of living must be won and safeguarded again and again through excellent performance. Worldwide changes in international economic relations will lead to a new positioning of individual economic areas. Only those who react adequately will be able to maintain or improve their current standards. It is here, in the flexible adaptation to new constellations, that Germany seems to be experiencing a certain weakness right now. One term that came up again and again in the discussions in Detroit was "information superhighways." This new system of information transfer will change the world. Just as with any normal transport route it will engender development and exclusion. Those who do not keep up will stay behind. If prosperity and jobs are important, then we must not retire to Podunk. In Germany we will have to try as hard as we can to maintain our scientific-technological competence, which has secured for us excellence in the sphere of production, and use it to build up and further develop a modern service sector. This is certainly one area where we must catch up with the others. No Single Recipe But No Isolation Either And we will have to make working hours more flexible, not only for the better coordination of production and sales or for better utilization of available machinery. It is also a question of working hours that allows for better coordination of the job with other vital individual needs. Considering the many people who are condemned to idleness it is narrow-minded and, at the same time, we continue to force millions of employees to work more than they actually want to or can. The age at which elderly colleagues have been asked by managements to retire prematurely is also inhuman, and these age levels are being continually forced down. When I presented my German view of this unfair development in Detroit, the other ministers agreed immediately. In virtually all industrialized nations the mentality of writing off elderly employees has begun to prevail, one which eliminates experience and other qualities from the economic process. The developments of the past 20 years have led us into a dead-end street from which we must quickly find a way out. All in all, Detroit was the successful attempt to emphasize to the international public that employment is the main target of all spheres of policy related to the economy. Still, considering all the international interrelations and interdependencies, one thing was clear: The basic situation and the economic and social framework conditions are so different from one country to the next that single and patent solutions are not possible and would not be helpful. Nevertheless, in view of the miserable international job situation, the path of national-egotistical isolation has to be ruled out. This was the unanimous opinion voiced by all participants. No country will be able in the long run to secure prosperity and employment unless it is included in the international division of labor and unless there is global growth. Employment is a result of the efforts of all parties involved in economic activities, not least the business community. It was this community that American Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich warned before the opening of the conference to cease their frenzy for lean companies and dismissing people. The businessman will not be judged by the extent to which he reduces the work force but by what he does with the "capital" of the work force. Bake instead of slaughter! This was Reich's motto. This appeal should reach across the Atlantic.
