This has happened because the wages for the officials at some organizations, maintained from the budget, have not been included in good time. Lithuanian TV forecasts that the payment of wages will be late in May, too. According to Sarkinas, the situation in the fulfillment of the budget became especially bad during the first three months of this year. For example, in December 1993 the national budget received revenue in sum of 385 million litas, whereas in February and March only 285 million litas were received in each month. [passage omitted]
