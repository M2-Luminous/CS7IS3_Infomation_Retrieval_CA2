Promulgated and issued jointly by the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities and the Ministry of Finance, the rules break down into 28 clauses, which clearly state the aims and application scope of the rules and other related matters, such as who to appraise, what to appraise and how to appraise it as well as what the legal responsibilities are for the parties concerned. The administration will use spot examinations, technical surveys and check-ups, value appraising and other methods mapped out by the rules to assess foreign-supplied equipment, whose value will be measured according to their existing conditions, performance indicators, technical parameters and profit-making power. The value appraising method is based on three factors: the market situation, cost and profitability potential. According to the rules, the administration will refer to the current market prices for the same or similar assets to decide the value of foreign assets. The assessing process will also take into account the assets' real condition, life expectancy, functional development, projected profit-earning power and appropriate discounting rate, the rules added. An official from the administration said that foreign-invested enterprises have flourished in recent years, and China has so far actually utilized more than 60 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment. However, the official said, the proportion of foreign investment in kind has been increasing over the years to reach more than 40 percent of the total at present. He noted that inaccurate appraisal, overvaluing of foreign assets, substituting the new with the old and high-quality assets with low-quality items and other foreign investment cheats have taken place frequently. The official said that the healthy development of China's foreign-invested enterprises will be harmed if such problems are not solved promptly, adding that fairly and accurately assessing foreign assets has become a major guarantee for the legal interests of all parties involved.
