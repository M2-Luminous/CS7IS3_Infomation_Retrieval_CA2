FBIS4-29427 "dreas117_d_94029" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 South Korea Court To Try Pak Chol-on for Bribery Case Court To Try Pak Chol-on for Bribery Case SK1506074894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0726 GMT 15 Jun 94 SK1506074894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme Court will render a final decision on Rep. Pak Chol-on's last appeal on June 28. Should the court dismiss Rep. Park's final appeal, the original decision will be upheld and his application for bail automatically rejected. But if the court reverses the original decision, it is likely that he may be released immediately since his prison term ends in less than six months. Rep. Pak was convicted of bribery and sentenced to one and a half years in prison and fined 600 million won (about 743,500 U.S. dollars) in an appeal hearing held on March 14. He then appealed to the Supreme Court and asked to be released on bail. Park, once called the "crown prince" during the days of the No Tae-u government, was arrested in May last year on charges of taking bribes totaling 600 million won in three installments from slot-machine kingpin Chong Tok-il in October and November 1990. If Pak is found guilty, he will lose his parliamentary seat and the right to run for parliament or other public office for the coming five years. A special election to replace him would be held within 90 days in the Susong-a Electoral District of Taegu City.
