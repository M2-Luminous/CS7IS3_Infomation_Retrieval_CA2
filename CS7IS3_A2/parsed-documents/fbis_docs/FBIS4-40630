The penalty [neustoyka] has reached the immense figure of 60 billion rubles. While cast in the role of debtor, the "Lenenergo" Joint-Stock Company, for its part, cannot obtain the money owed to it by its own big customers -- enterprises in the former "defense sector." For the people of St. Petersburg the result of this clash between the two giants could be that their apartments will be lit at the end of June not by electricity, but by the dim glow of the white nights.
