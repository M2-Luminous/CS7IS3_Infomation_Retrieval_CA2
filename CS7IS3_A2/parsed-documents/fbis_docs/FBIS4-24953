He only uttered four characters in conclusion: "Full of unpredictable crises and dangers." He said: The current political situation is extremely complicated. Various signs show that Deng Xiaoping is no longer able to control the overall situation. Since the end of last year, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji have held the power in their hands and have been going their own ways. They even wantonly changed Deng's policies. Some conservatives also acted more flagrantly, and even tried to totally overthrow the reform line set forth by Deng in the past more than 10 years. In an article about Beijing's situation I wrote in April, I quoted an authoritative source saying that Deng Xiaoping could not say anything when meeting Shanghai leaders at the last Spring Festival. The remarks quoted by the newspapers were all uttered by his daughter. Moreover, Deng Xiaoping had not given any policy instruction in the past few months. The remarks by Deng being spread outside the mainland might all be cooked up by Deng's family members and Deng's personal office. The information was recently reconfirmed by another Beijing source, who told this author that Deng Xiaoping always stayed at home in Beijing and had become completely senile. He could only utter some indistinct murmurs and could not say even a complete sentence. What he wanted to say was completed and expressed by his daughter Deng Rong, and Deng was also rather confused and muddle-headed. The source said that as Deng's health was getting worse, he was no longer able to concern himself about any political affairs. In September last year, the mainland newspapers suddenly made public some of Deng's remarks, and stressed "development is the last word." This reflected Deng's discontent with Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic control. In fact, the remark was created by Deng Rong and the Deng Xiaoping Office, who tried to issue the paramount order in the name of Deng Xiaoping. However, Deng Rong's action could only play a temporary role. After Deng Xiaoping appeared on television during the Spring Festival this year, Jiang Zemin and other leaders no longer gave any consideration to his existence. The source said that political circles in Beijing generally agreed that Deng Xiaoping was already a living dead man, and the political situation would not be affected by his existence or nonexistence. The fact that showed Deng Xiaoping's inability to control the political situation was that de-Dengism had appeared in Beijing. At the national propaganda work conference last January, Jiang Z emin suddenly again mentioned the subject of "peaceful evolution," which became taboo after Deng's inspection tour of the south in 1992, and talked a lot about criticizing bourgeois liberalization. After that, a number of leaders in Beijing also talked about the issue of "peaceful evolution." Moreover, the CPC authorities also gave a new interpretation to Deng's opinion on guarding against and opposing Leftism. Not long ago, an instruction of the Central Propaganda Department was issued to the press institutions in Beijing, saying that Deng Xiaoping's opinion on guarding against Leftism mainly referred to things in the economic field rather than in the political and ideological field. In the political and ideological field, there should not be anti-Leftism. Some people in political circles in Beijing said that Lu Ping's remark that Hong Kong cannot become a political city was a new interpretation by the CPC authorities of the "one country, two systems" principle. If "one country, two systems" is applied to the political field, that will mean that China will give up the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. In fact, the leftist turn of China's political situation from the beginning of this year indicated the beginning of de-Dengism pursued by the CPC authorities. The Beijing sources said that at present, only Chen Yun among the old guard still maintains a certain influence in the CPC leadership. Chen Yun was satisfied at Jiang Zemin's tough performance, and also expressed appreciation of Jiang Zemin's ploy of alternately releasing and arresting pro-democracy activists. Recently, when commenting on Jiang Zemin's work, Chen Yun said that Jiang could "correctly assess the situation and take resolute and realistic action." As the economic reform in the mainland of China entered the throes of the stage marked by the agricultural crisis, the runaway inflation, the strained state treasury, and the upsurge of labor unrest, the CPC authorities shifted the top priority from economic growth to the maintenance of stability and the prevention of popular unrest. Before another anniversary of the 4 June incident, the CPC Political Bureau held an enlarged meeting, once again stressing the need to take all necessary means to prevent troublemakers' activities. It stressed that dissidents should be caught boldly, and it does not matter if anybody is wrongly caught. Anyhow, troublemakers must not be given any opportunity to do what they want. In order to tighten control over pro-democracy activists, an addition will be made to Article 18 of the Penalty Regulations for the Management of Public Security concerning the treatment of those convicted who are put under surveillance, deprived of political rights, released on parole, or sentenced with suspension, so that pro-democracy activists released from prison may be rearrested at any time. In accordance with a central instruction, the local authorities in all parts of the country have tightened up surveillance over dissidents. According to Guangdong sources, former pro-democracy activities working in Guangdong were all investigated and interrogated. Recently, many dissidents in various parts of the country were arrested or suddenly disappeared. Wei Jingsheng, a leading figure in China's pro-democracy movement, was arrested in March. Since then, nobody knows his whereabouts. Although the CPC authorities denied that Wei would be charged with treason, Beijing sources said that the authorities would apply the new Penalty Regulations for the Management of Public Security to accuse Wei of violating the rules for release on parole. In the new arrest spree, many ex-activists were wronged as the CPC authorities pursued the policy of "rather arresting 1,000 innocent people than letting one activist off." A former activist in Hunan went to do business in Beijing and met a friend who was also a former activist. In the sensitive pre-4 June period, he was detained for more than 10 days in Beijing, and was again taken away by the local public security authorities after returning to Changsha. His whereabouts remain unknown to other people. Many localities have set up special bodies for preventing turmoil and set up riot police brigades in accordance with the central instruction. Two months ago 10 antiriot regiments of the People's Liberation Army were on the highest level of alert. A mainland intellectual told me that China was now experiencing a white terror. The degree of such terror was demonstrated by the parade of 10,000 antiriot troops in Changsha. During the pro-democracy movement in 1989, Changsha City in Hunan was one of the cities witnessing the strongest popular ferment. In early April, the city set up a 10,000-strong antiriot force composed of public security personnel, armed police troops, and militia units. The headquarters of the antiriot force was located in the college district on the west bank of the Xiang Jiang. In order to intimidate the public, on 17 May, the antiriot force staged a large-scale parade around the city. The policemen carried machine-guns and rode motorcycles; and the militiamen carried wooden clubs and rode on large trucks. The mighty procession was filled with an atmosphere of killing, which made people recall the dramatic scenes of the worker guards during the Cultural Revolution. According to Changsha people, when the antiriot force was founded, the daily allowances issued to its members were collected from random fines imposed on taxi drivers and drivers of other vehicles. This aroused strong resentment among the taxi drivers, and their business was seriously affected. As the CPC authorities, which had turned to the leftist side, feared the appearance of popular unrest, the conservatives, on the contrary, tried hard to stir up trouble in society and abet workers in staging strikes. After Zhu Rongji exercised macrocontrol to tighten up the supply of credit, the state-owned enterprises whose business results were always poor were suddenly faced with a halt to blood transfusions. Innumerable large factories and mines were forced to suspend operation wholly or partly, and workers there could not maintain their basic livelihood. Incidents of labor unrest arose one after another in all parts of the country. An official trade union cadre told me that strikes are happening almost every day in China. In the previous issue of KAI FANG, I wrote a report about the incident in which 100,000 workers in Heilongjiang took to the streets to stage a petition-demonstration. The latest news is that somebody in the central authorities was fanning such strikes behind the scenes. The sources said that some people of the former Wang Zhen Office recently became very active in some factories and mines, where workers were living in difficult conditions. They agitated for people there to stage strikes and disturbances. The sources said that such people acted according to the ideas of some conservatives in the central authorities. Labor unrest mainly took place in state-owned enterprises. The conservatives said that the reforms had driven workers to a position of losing their means of livelihood, so the disturbances staged by the workers could defend the socialist public ownership system. Obviously, these people tried to add to the troubles of the top leadership and thus force the top leadership to back down from the ongoing reforms. The underground labor activists were confused after learning about this. They organized workers to struggle for their own rights and interests, but they did not want to be used by the conservatives. So they did not know what they should do.
