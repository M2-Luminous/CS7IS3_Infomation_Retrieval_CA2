MacLennan] [Text] East London March 24 SAPA -- The South African Defence Force [SADF] was monitoring Ciskei but there appeared to be no need for it to move into the territory, an SADF spokesman said on Thursday [24 March]. She said SADF personnel in King William's Town were scheduled to meet the joint administrators of Ciskei later on Thursday, and would then "decide what is happening". At the moment, however, the situation was "quite quiet". It was reported that the ANC had called a rally in Bisho on Thursday morning. A rally called on Wednesday dissolved inconclusively after former Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo failed to turn up, and representatives of the African National Congress and the Transitional Executive Council were prevented from addressing the crowd by a failure in the public address system. Ciskei police, whose strike on Tuesday led to the toppling of the Gqozo government, met on Thursday afternoon at the Bisho Police College. A warrant officer, who answered the telephone in the office of the commander of the college, would not say what the meeting was about. A police captain described the situation as tense.
