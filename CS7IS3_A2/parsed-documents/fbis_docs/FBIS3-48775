Even if Hosokawa's political reform bills are killed, said Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Association (Nikkeiren), "it would be irresponsible (for Hosokawa) to dissolve the house without even compiling the budget for the next fiscal year." Noting that two prime ministers in the past resigned after their political reform bills failed in the Diet, Nagano said Japan would lose its international credibility if Hosokawa follows such a course just two weeks before the summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Hosokawa administration's political reform package is on the verge of collapse following a rejection of the bills by the House of Councillors last week.
