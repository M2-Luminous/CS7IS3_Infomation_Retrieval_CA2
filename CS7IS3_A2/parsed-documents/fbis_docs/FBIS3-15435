The staff considers the Russian-Georgian treaty on friendship, neighborliness, and cooperation signed in February in Tbilisi to be an example of Georgia's practical cooperation within the framework of the Commonwealth. This document, in particular, reflects the intentions of the sides to adopt measures to implement effectively agreements on the temporary stay of Russian military formations on the territory of Georgia, and also to conclude agreements on lending assistance in setting up Georgian Armed Forces, in fitting them out, and in their acquisition of armaments, military weapons, and technological equipment without the right to hand them over to third countries.
