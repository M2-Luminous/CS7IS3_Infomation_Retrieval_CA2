In a statement made before leaving Geneva, Simic described as exceptionally important the acceptance of the Yugoslav delegation's suggestion as to how the assets of former Yugoslavia should be inventoried. The working group's agreement [words indistinct] the Yugoslav suggestion on an equal footing, after almost two years of denying this, practically means that the legal and economic postulates of the former Yugoslav federation must be recognized, which in turn means that there can be no arbitrary interpretation of the entitlement to state property, explained Simic. The insistence of the other former Yugoslav republics that a division of assets was made unde the 1974 constitution collapsed when a debate on a partial division of assets was taken off the agenda, he added. He further said he had held an important discussion on the crisis in former Yugoslavia with the deputy co-chairman of the former Yugoslavia conference, Ambassador Geerd Ahrens. Simic said the Yugoslav delegation was satisfied with the session of the working group on humanitarian issues, which for the first time publicly voiced the view that international sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) had done incalculable harm and had unjustly punished the most vulnerable section of the population -- the elderly, the children, the ill and the refugees -- thus [word indistinct] the efforts of humanitarian organisations. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata has also voiced this view, so that it might be expected without a doubt to produce some political effect, said Simic. Yugoslavia has fulfilled all the conditions as set down by the international community, and now expects the European Union to show in deed what it undertook late last year to do in word, namely to take the necessary steps to ease or lift the economic sanctions which have been proven so utterly inappropriate, said Simic. The views voiced at Geneva indicate that the international community is becoming more amenable to arguments Yugoslavia has been presenting since before the outbreak of the crisis, said Simic.
