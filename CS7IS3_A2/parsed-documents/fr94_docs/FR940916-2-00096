FR940916-2-00096 FR940916-2-00079 While Dr. Kusmik did not cooperate during the OI investigation, he did provide information during the transcribed enforcement conference on June 7, 1994. Specifically, Dr. Kusmik stated that he: (1) directed an employee to falsify NRC-required wipe test records; and (2) provided false or misleading information to the NRC in a letter, dated September 21, 1992, in response to a Notice of Violation. The NRC recognizes Dr. Kusmik was candid and straightforward with the NRC when questioned during the enforcement conference. The NRC also recognizes that Dr. Kusmik was contrite and expressed remorse for his actions. However, Dr. Kusmik's actions cannot and will not be tolerated by the NRC. Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that information provided to the NRC by Dr. Kusmik, or required to be maintained by Dr. Kusmik or the Licensee, will be complete and accurate in all material respects, and that the health and safety of the public will be protected if Dr. Kusmik were permitted at this time to be an authorized user listed on any NRC license or act as an RSO. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that Dr. Kusmik: (1) be prohibited from being an authorized user and from acting as an RSO for a period of one year from the date of this Order; (2) for a period of three years from the date of the Order, notify the NRC within 20 days of his acceptance of an employment offer involving NRC-licensed activities; and (3) Dr. Kusmik, within 30 days from the date of this Order, provide a statement of his commitment to comply with NRC requirements and the basis why the Commission should have confidence that he will comply with applicable NRC requirements. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the conduct described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be effective immediately. IV Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR 30.10, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that: A. Dr. William F. Kusmik is prohibited from being an authorized user and from acting as an RSO on any NRC license for a period of one year from the date of this Order. During this one-year period, an NRC licensee may allow Dr. Kusmik to perform NRC-licensed activities only if he is under the direct supervision of an authorized user as defined below. NRC-licensed activities are those activities that are conducted pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licensees conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20. During this time period, Dr. Kusmik must also provide a copy of this Order to prospective employers who engage in NRC-licensed activities. Supervision of Dr. Kusmik during this period shall be performed as follows: 1. The licensee must document the name of the authorized user responsible for supervising Dr. Kusmik's activities and ensuring compliance with all applicable NRC requirements. 2. The authorized user supervising Dr. Kusmik shall routinely observe and review all radiological safety records generated by Dr. Kusmik's activities. On monthly basis, records generated by Dr. Kusmik will be reviewed and initialed by the supervising authorized user to assure that the records are complete and accurate. Any record found not to be in accordance with NRC requirements shall be reported to the RSO.
