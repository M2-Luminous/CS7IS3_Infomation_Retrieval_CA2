The elections are to be held according to the old electoral law passed in 1990, Ewa Wachowicz, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's press secretary, told PAP. The prime minister has ordered that the elections be held without waiting for the president to make his decision--a few days ago the president announced that he would veto the new electoral law (passed by the Sejm on 18 March)--and without waiting for the Sejm, which can reject the president's veto by a majority of two-thirds of the votes. The president has until 21 April to make his decision. The most important difference between the two laws is the threshold where proportional representation applies. According to the old law, the threshold is 40,000 citizens, and, according to the new one, the threshold stands at 15,000 citizens.
