The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] instructed Ferenc Kosa to draw up the Socialists' media law concept when the party went into opposition in 1990. We interviewed Kosa on the media plans of the MSZP. [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is the MSZP adhering to the basic principles that it professed when it was an opposition party? [Kosa] Already in the transitional period before the 1990 elections, the MSZP was aware that an unbiased, honest, and socially supervised operation of the information system -- especially public service radio and television -- is a necessary prerequisite for democracy. I would like to remind people that, after the 40 years of party state dictatorship, the Nemeth government set up the Public Supervisory Committee, which, with the participation of experts and parties that had national lists, ensured television's impartiality during the elections. As for the media law, the MSZP's concept has three cardinal points: public ownership, public supervision, and clear and unequivocal public service statutes. In respect to public service media, we rejected both state ownership and free market ownership. If the radio and television are in state ownership then the government of the day can influence their operation. We do not support the free market, either, because foreign interests can endanger national sovereignty. [MAGYAR NEMZET] Who should own the public service media? [Kosa] The MSZP considers socialist ownership in its classical sense appropriate, namely public ownership. Legally, the public foundation corresponds to this. The public foundation is a form of ownership that cannot be sold, which is created by a two-thirds majority decision of Parliament, and which does not operate under the government's or any party's influence, and not even solely under Parliament's influence. Its Supervisory Board consists of a broad social basis: The delegates of political forces, professional trade unions, independent personalities, trade unions, and churches. Its members can be replaced. This way, it is possible to eliminate disproportionately large personal or group interests that can appear in the public service media. The Board cannot exercise censorship rights. [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is there any chance for the MSZP's media plans to be accepted by parliament? [Kosa] Even in the past, the MSZP's media policy was a consensus-making alternative to the government's state ownership and the liberals' free market solutions. If the MSZP comes to power, it will continue to insist on its basic principles. Accordingly, it wants a media and press that are independent of the government and political forces. It is a precondition of democracy that the press be able to operate freely as a criticizing counterbalance to the governing power. [MAGYAR NEMZET] In recent days, a list of names has come to light that foreshadows the dismissals in television that are to follow the change of the government.... [Kosa] The Socialists do not have any intentions to clear up; the MSZP does not want to replace the personnel in the media. We would like the country to be among the leaders in Europe as regards democracy and the independence of the public service media. The draft bill proposed by us serves this goal. [MAGYAR NEMZET] What are the MSZP's views on the rules of appointing radio and television chairmen? [Kosa] The appointment of the chairmen is one paragraph in an 800-paragraph draft bill. In accordance with the constitutional rules in this area, the prime minister proposes the media chairmen, the parliamentary Cultural Committee hears them and forms an opinion on them, and finally the president of the republic appoints them. In our view, this system is democratic. The freely elected responsible government of the day should have the possibility to make a proposal on the people, but it should not have the sole right to appoint them. In this sense, the president of the Republic and the Cultural Committee form a counterweight to the government. The basis of the process of appointment should not be changed, but it is expedient to make minor amendments. It would not be fortuitous if parliament appointed the chairmen because it cannot have the rights of an employer. The fact that we do not have a legal order in this area is the reason for the speculations surrounding the issue of media chairmen. When we have a media law, the appointment of the chairmen will be a natural procedure without any hysteria. This is the reason the MSZP insists that the issue of the media chairmen only be put on the agenda once the media law is passed.
