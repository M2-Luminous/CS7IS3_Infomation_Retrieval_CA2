He said that ``the Serbs have shown readiness to allow local governing and autonomy, but within the expanded borders of Serbia. "I also know that the Albanian community considers this solution as unjust", Mr. Hogg said. "The international community holds that a constant control is indispensable to make sure that the Albanians attain broader political rights in Kosova", he said. Hogg said that the aim of his visit to Kosova was to negotiate further developments, express his views on Rugova's moderated policy "which is absolutely right and in the long-term interest of the Albanian population". Mr. Rugova assessed this high-ranking visit as "a special honour" and confirmed that they discussed the possibility of opening the dialogue through the mediation of a third party. "As any party, we, too, have our own views on the talks. We must negotiate without prejudices", said Rugova, who reiterated the stance of the Kosovar Albanians on an independent and neutral Kosova.
