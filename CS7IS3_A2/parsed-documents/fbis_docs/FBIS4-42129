Ankara considers the decision unacceptable, and the view that we should reject all the aid is gaining ground. The lack of lobbying activity by Turkey also had its effect on the decision of the House of Representatives. [Unidentified reporter] Yesterday the House of Representatives decided to put conditions on the aid requested for Turkey by the Administration and cut it by 25 percent. The southeastern problem and Cyprus were put forward as conditions. The decision of the House of Representatives will also be discussed in the U.S. Senate. If the Senate also approves the decision, then the whole thing will depend on the signature of U.S. President Clinton. There was a reaction in Ankara against the decision of the House of Representatives. Rejection of all the aid is gaining ground within the True Path Party-Social Democrat Populist Party coalition. Lack of lobbying by Turkey in the U.S. Congress also played a role in the decision of the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller cancelled the agreements with firms engaged in lobbying for Turkey. At present, there is no firm in the U.S. lobbying for Turkey.
