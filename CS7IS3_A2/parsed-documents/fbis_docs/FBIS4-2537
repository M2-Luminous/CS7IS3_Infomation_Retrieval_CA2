According to information from various localities, tens of millions of surplus rural laborers left home to find jobs elsewhere after the Spring Festival. Many of them left home to find urban jobs for the first time and became new members of the migrant community. The most striking feature of the migrant upsurge is that tens of millions of peasants travel here and there to find jobs after the Chinese New Year, at a time when urban residents return home after visiting relatives in the countryside, and the two groups of travelers create a "spring travel tide." On the crest of the tide are the migrant peasants, who are particularly noticeable because of their large numbers. What Causes the Upsurge in Migrant Workers The flow of large numbers of rural laborers began in the second half of the 1980's with the readjustment of the rural production structure and further economic development in the coastal regions. The migration reached its first high tide at about the time of the 1988 Spring Festival. Some of the rural laborers who worked in urban and coastal areas went home as a result of the economic retrenchment over the next three years, but the general trend of migration did not decrease. Since 1991, the annual exodus of rural laborers has become larger and larger, causing concern among both the government and the people. In a certain sense, the upsurge of migrant workers is a concentrated indication of the problems of rural areas, agriculture and peasants, showing fully the impedance caused by an excessive population to China's economic and social development after the opening up of the market. The household contract responsibility system, which links remuneration to output, has solved the problem of feeding the rural population, but a growing surplus labor force has been created due to limitations on the availability of land. New village and town enterprises have created nearly 1 million jobs for the surplus rural labor force. However, job creation has been uneven from region to region and the problems of the surplus rural labor force are becoming worse and worse in central and western regions and in some of the less developed areas in coastal regions. In these regions peasant income has increased slowly and they lack development opportunities. Some of these peasants, not content with the situation, were the first to leave home and look for opportunities elsewhere. Following their lead, other villagers left home for coastal regions and cities. As a result, the exodus of rural laborers after each Spring Festival has become the biggest social news every year. Generally speaking, the flow of the rural labor force from one province to another is part of the great historical process. Such spontaneous regulation and balancing of the labor force has, to a certain extent, helped some less developed rural areas become better off sooner, and has greatly supported economic development in the developed regions. In Jiangsu's Wuxi County, which has the greatest economic strength of any county in China, migrant workers yield an annual output value of more than 5 billion yuan. The leaders of some northwestern provinces and regions have openly pointed out: "After one person leaves home, the entire family will be freed from poverty." We should send surplus rural labor force to work elsewhere and deem the action an important way or even a strategic measure to free the people from poverty. The peasants of Sichuan and Hunan Provinces working in other provinces send home their earnings of more than 10 billion yuan a year, and they are the major source of increased income of peasants. In many places where village and town enterprises are of weak foundation and poor economic efficiency, the total earnings of peasants working away from home are much greater than the total earnings of those enterprises. According to a most conservative estimate by the department concerned, the total annual earnings sent home by peasants across the country amount to 50 billion yuan. According to another estimate, the social wealth created by migrant workers across the country exceeds 3 billion yuan a year. Of course the upsurge of migrant workers also poses a series of problems concerning urban and rural political affairs, economy, culture, and population. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has unequivocally pointed out that the existing household registration system will be reformed in the near future. How to guide, coordinate, and organize such a large flow of migrant workers among provinces is a social problem demanding prompt solution. Useful Exploration and Trial Guangdong Province was the first to disperse, guide, and manage migrant workers. Since as early as 1988, Guangdong has stepped up the management of the inter-provincial labor service market and promoted labor service cooperation. Now, some major labor-export provinces have set up labor service management offices in Guangdong. In this regard, Guangdong has found out some effective labor control methods. For instance, it invariably stops hiring migrant workers during the peak spring travel period -- January and February -- and migrant workers from other provinces must carry at all times in their person three certificates -- ID card, permit to work away from home issued by a labor department at the county level or above, and single status certificate or family planning certificate. Through the establishment of a labor service market base, Beijing since 1991 has effectively managed migrant workers from other parts of the country. The municipal labor department has successively established a cooperative relationship in labor service with Hebei, Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Gansu; and has gradually formulated rules and regulations which standardize the procedures for hiring migrant laborers to work in the construction, textile, and environmental protection fields. Sichuan, a major labor export province, has adopted concrete measures. The provincial government has stipulated that each migrant worker group must have a leader or coordinator. If it is a very large group, the government will assign a cadre to travel with it and manage it. The province has set up labor service development leading groups and offices at and above the county level and established labor service training bases and labor service exchange markets. Five million migrant workers from Hunan are working in other provinces. The provincial labor department has already joined Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and five other southern provinces and regions in establishing a labor service cooperation information network. It has also set up labor service offices in Guangdong and Zhuhai. More than 60 percent of the counties in Hunan have had offices in coastal regions. Those offices are responsible for collecting information, issuing certificates and registrations, arranging transportation, and providing escorts to travel with migrant groups. In this way, large numbers of laborers are organized to leave for labor service markets in coastal regions. Tianjin Municipality in the past tried to expel and block migrant workers and imposed fines on them, but none of those efforts worked. In recent years, it has shifted its efforts from "blocking" to "dispersal" and the new efforts prove remarkably effective. For instance, Tianjin's Hongqiao District used to be the gathering place of a large number of rural laborers. The district labor department has set up an employment agency which can accommodate several hundred job seekers and even provide food and lodging service to some of them. Tianjin Municipality has also built labor service bases in Shandong, Hebei, Jiangxi, and Anhui Provinces so that the job seekers can wait there for employment opportunities. Since the employment is through the labor service market, the blind flow of migrant workers has decreased. While various localities were actively exploring ways for managing labor export, the Ministry of Labor in October 1993 published an "urban and rural employment coordination plan." The plan specifically calls for organized efforts to guide rural labor exodus through legitimate channels, for the hiring regions to formulate necessary labor market rules and management system to manage incoming laborers, and for offering and improving services to migrant rural laborers during the entire course of their trans-regional travel. By implementing the plan, the Ministry of Labor expects to ensure an orderly labor force flow in all localities by the end of 1996. Get at the Root of the Problem While it is necessary to organize and guide the flow of migrant workers at present, the permanent solution of the problem is to accelerate the economic development in the central and western regions so that more jobs will be created for the local surplus labor force. Village and town enterprises are a large "container" to accept rural surplus labor force. They created 9.72 million jobs in 1992 and more than 7 million jobs in 1993. However, they are still far from being able to accept all the rural surplus labor force which is in hundreds of millions. The places of origin of migrant workers should consider local realities and make more efforts to develop economic projects that need smaller investment, yield quicker results, and hire more workers. Developed coastal regions should accelerate the relocation of their labor-intensive industries to less developed regions and absorb more surplus labor force into the secondary and the tertiary industries. The development of "three-dimensional agriculture [li ti nong ye 4539 7555 6393 2814]" and high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture can refine the division of labor within the primary industry and absorb more rural labor force. In recent years, there have been a number of townships and towns with quite developed secondary and tertiary industries in the central and western regions. They are like "sparks" illuminating the local economy. We can expect that with the rise of those industries, most of the central and western regions will be like coastal regions where some peasants leave crops field but not the village as they work for factories without having to go to cities.
