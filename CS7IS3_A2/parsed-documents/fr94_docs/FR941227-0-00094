FR941227-0-00094 FR941227-0-00019 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 652 [Docket No. 900124&hyph;0127; I.D. 120794A] Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notification of suspension of surf clam minimum size limit. SUMMARY: NMFS informs the public that the minimum size limit of 4.75 inches (12.065 cm) for Atlantic surf clams is suspended for the 1995 fishing year. The intended effect is to reduce a regulatory burden while safeguarding the resource. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Myles Raizin, Resource Policy Analyst, National Marine Fisheries Service, One Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930; telephone: 508-281-9104. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A final rule implementing Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog Fishery (FMP) was published on June 14, 1990 (55 FR 24184). Section 652.22(a)(1) allows the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to suspend annually, by publication of a document in the Federal Register , the minimum size limit for Atlantic surf clams. This action may be taken unless discard, catch, and survey data indicate that 30 percent of the Atlantic surf clam resource is smaller than 4.75 inches (12.065 cm), and the overall reduced size is not attributable to beds where growth of the individual clams has been reduced because of density-dependent factors. At its September meeting, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) accepted the recommendations of its Statistical and Scientific Committee and Surf Clam/Ocean Quahog Committee and voted to recommend that the Regional Director suspend the minimum size limit. NMFS port agents conducted a random sample of landed surf clams in 1994. Results indicate that only 27.33 percent of the sample was composed of clams that were less than 4.75 inches (12.065 cm). Based on the sampling results, the Regional Director adopts the Council's recommendation and publishes this notice to suspend the minimum size limit for Atlantic surf clams for the period January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1995. Classification This action is authorized by 50 CFR part 652 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: December 20, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
