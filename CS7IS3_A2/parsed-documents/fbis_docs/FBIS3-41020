Kazakhstan is a country which has unequivocally stated that it has joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Lisbon protocol on this issue, and its intention to eliminate the nuclear weapons it has on its territory." Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told this to the special correspondent when replying to a request to comment on the report in the Iranian newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI about an alleged "Kazakhstan's special stance" in respect of the nuclear weapons it has. "It is rather difficult for me to comment on that newspaper's report or even on the ambassador's statement until I have official information on this issue," the minister said.
