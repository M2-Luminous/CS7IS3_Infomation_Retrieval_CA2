For the friends of future surgical intervention aimed at ousting General Raoul Cedras and his military command from power -- under the umbrella of a "multilateral force" comprising English-speaking Caribbean countries and organized by the Pentagon -- word got out that Washington is promoting "a golden exile" for those that were once its allies. The administration sponsors, protects, and, if necessary, sacrifices its allies, but it sometimes -- as seems to be the current case -- protects them when they fall from grace. It is no secret that, when Jean-Claude Duvalier fled, the U.S. State Department prepared a "democratic transition" for the island that was to become legitimized by free elections, of course. Washington had its candidate for the first clean elections following several decades of the U.S.-backed Duvalier dictatorship. The only thing was that it did not take imponderable factors into consideration and lost. The majority of the people of Haiti voted for a man who won the masses with his charisma, a Salesian priest, and supporter of the doctrine of liberation, who is therefore at odds with Karol Wojtyla [Pope John Paul II]. From the day of Jean-Bertrand's victory, the U.S. intelligence community began to conspire to oust him. Aristide barely lasted seven months in power. The man who toppled him, General Raoul Cedras, has close ties with the Pentagon. He did not act, therefore, on his own initiative. One must keep in mind that during the republican administration of George Bush, Haiti was handled under the Cold War perception, and a sign of that was the presence of Alvin Adams in the U.S. mission in Port-au-Prince. He is a man with outdated views, a career diplomat who was in Saigon and served as assistant secretary to Henry Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state. An expert on the counterinsurgency struggle, Alvin coordinated matters against terrorism at the State Department from 1987 to 1989. It was no coincidence, either, that the first one to be promoted to chief of the coupist junta was Marc Charles, who served as military attache in Washington, although the decision was later rescinded. There are sufficient elements that show the U.S. double standard. While condemning the coup, it sent signals to the members of the de facto government that they were allies. The UN and OAS involvement, as well as the active participation of France and Venezuela, which have specific interests in Haiti, in search of a solution that would restore constitutional rule with the ouster of the coupists and the reinstatement of Aristide, complicated Washington's original plans. The double standard remained a constant. That way, while on the one hand an apartment was arranged for Aristide in Washington and he was given facilities to maintain his own activities as president in exile, on the other hand, the CIA was orchestrating a dirty propaganda campaign against Aristide, depicting him as a messianic madman, who instigated the practice of "necklacing" -- inserting victims in burning tires -- against men in uniform. Today, confused by his own contradictions and encumbered by several unresolved international conflicts, Clinton seems to be determined to find a cheap solution to the Haitian problem. It all seems to indicate that there will be an end to the crisis in the short-term. THE MIAMI HERALD newspaper reported that a true invasion of secret agents has taken place on the island. "Every U.S. espionage service has sent its agents and collaborators to the Caribbean island," the newspaper reported. Obviously, they did not go to Port-au-Prince as tourists. Likewise, a confidential CIA report on the "increasing uneasiness" within the Haitian military has been disclosed, according to THE NEW YORK TIMES. The newspaper revealed that the United States is reportedly trying to convince Gen. Cedras, the head of the junta; Michel Francois, chief of police and, for many, the real power behind the throne; and Philippe Biamby, cabinet chief of the Army, to abandon power in exchange for a comfortable life in exile. To encourage military dissent, Clinton has reportedly decided to promote an old Aristide demand: to set up a radio station from a mobile ship to transmit hostile propaganda against the military. The project, called Radio Democracy, would have three objectives: to persuade the troops to get rid of the military threesome, to convince the mid-level officers that they would not be punished for the repression unleashed during the military regime, and to discourage the Haitian population from massively leaving the island because they will not be given political exile in the United States. According to Pentagon officials, Radio Democracy could begin transmitting in a few weeks through special units operating from planes that will fly over Haiti at low speeds. Some of these measures, which are now being promoted by the Black Caucus in the U.S. Congress, could have been taken 15 months ago and the deaths of thousands of Haitians could have been avoided. According to Steven Forester, Haitian Refugee Center supervisor, the Armed Forces under the command of Gen. Cedras have executed at least 7,000 persons since the 1991 coup. Forester described the U.S. immigration policy as "obscene, racist, and criminal." According to him, not even the 7,000 persons who have been executed since the coup could have met the requirements of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to find asylum in the United States. On the other hand, he pointed out that Washington approves 96 percent of the requests for refugee status filed by immigrants from the defunct USSR and 83 percent of those from citizens of Asian countries and welcomes Cuban boat people as long as they leave the island illegally, and as a reward it grants them U.S. citizenship within a year. Forester indicated that the United States has been a "deaf accomplice" of the atrocities committed by Haitian military officers and their paramilitary groups and pointed out that the obligatory repatriation of the boat people never had a humanitarian distinction. Obviously, the departure of Cedras, Francois, Biamby, and company and the return of Aristide to the Presidency is a desirable and appropriate thing. The big question is why Washington decided to promote the change now.
