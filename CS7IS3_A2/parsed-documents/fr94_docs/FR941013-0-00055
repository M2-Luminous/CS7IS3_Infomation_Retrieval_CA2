FR941013-0-00055 FR941013-0-00032 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 100694A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the Pacific ocean perch total allowable catch (TAC) in the BS. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), October 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Pacific ocean perch TAC for the BS was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 1,624 metric tons (mt). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), that the Pacific ocean perch TAC in the BS soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 1,524 mt, with consideration that 100 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BS. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the BS, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 6, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
