Today it is fortunately not the case that Norway is facing an obvious threat to its security. At the same time Norwegians are for the first time taking part in UN operations for peace in Europe. A few hours' travel from Norway a brutal war is raging in a country which has been close to the hearts of Norwegians and which is now being torn to pieces by antagonisms and violence. The Yugoslavia crisis is a reminder that peace cannot be taken for granted. And while Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs approach the festival of Christmas under a tragic sky, developments in Europe lead one's thoughts in the direction of past times' harrowing events on our continent. The map of Europe has changed in the course of just a few years. New states of which we had scarcely been aware are now striving to take root in the security policy landscape. For four decades we knew what we were organized against by virtue of our membership of NATO. Today the threats have no clear face or thrust. The elections to the new national assembly in Russia were a reminder of the difficulties involved in transforming a totalitarian superpower into a democracy based on sharing and devolving power, both political and economic. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union there has been broad agreement in the West that the danger of an armed Russian attack on West European territory is now extremely small. The West has no clear opponent. The threats which terrorized Europe during Berlin crises, the invasion of Hungary, and the Czechoslovakia crisis in 1968 are gone. What we are now facing are less defined dangers and uncertainties. The rise of nationalist movements in the former Soviet Union has been mentioned most often as a source of uncertainty which could have repercussions for security policy. The sensational election result for the nationalist forces in Russia has sent shock waves through the West. Parallels have been drawn with the Nazis' successes in Germany in the thirties. There is every indication that the Russian voters were attracted by a mood and by promises of simple solutions, of a rapid improvement in their difficult material circumstances. The nationalists' vociferous foreign policy line has probably not been of decisive importance for the election result. But there is a danger that the recreation of Soviet power could be a political plus and be used as a symbol of a different and prouder future than that which characterizes everyday life in Russia today. The election shows that it is too simple to view developments in Russia as a smooth process characterized by progress toward a society more like our own. We were prepared for the possibility that there might be setbacks. But in the total picture we must not overlook the fact that the election itself was carried through in a way of which Russia can be proud. A new constitution was adopted which clarifies the power relationships between the national assembly, the government, and the president, and from January the president will have to deal with a national assembly with democratic legitimacy. It will now be possible to replace the battle we saw between Yeltsin and the former Supreme Soviet with normal everyday politics in russia. At the same time as the new Russian State Duma meets for the first time in January, NATO's heads of state and government will meet for a summit in Brussels. This will be President Clinton's first meeting with NATO's heads of state and government and many people are looking forward to hearing his view of transatlantic ties and NATO's future mission. There is every reason to expect that the President will confirm that the United States will have a military presence in Europe in the future too, although with a smaller number of troops than during the Cold War. NATO's contingency planning is also being reshaped. Whereas in the past NATO was directed toward preventing a large-scale attack, planning is nowadays directed more toward crisis and conflict management on a smaller scale. There is much interest in how NATO will approach the former members of the Warsaw Pact and the new states in the former Soviet Union. Full NATO membership is a desire that several countries have expressed. As well as representing a security guarantee, NATO membership would make an important contribution to the strengthening of the national identity of many countries. So far the West has been unwilling to rule out NATO membership for these countries, but there are conflicting views on how rapidly such membership should come about. NATO membership has been seen as the end of a process rather than as a beginning. To underline that the cooperation in the NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], in which former dictatorships are now members alongside the NATO nations, ought now to be able to develop into even closer cooperation, an offer to these countries of "Partnership for Peace" agreements is being worked on. Here countries which so wish will be given an invitation to enter into significant security agreements with NATO. In recent years in Europe the EC and the Western European Union have become increasingly important in the security context. For 30 years the United States has been arguing that Europe must shoulder a larger part of the responsibility for its own security. On the European side this determination is now being expressed more strongly than previously. While the United Sates can be counted on as a guarantor against Soviet attack, the Yugoslavia crisis and the new dangers in other countries are now showing that NATO's security guarantees are not enough. When NATO was formed, no one paid any attention at all to the thought that inside the Soviet-dominated bloc civil wars or unrest could arise with the concomitant danger that they could spread to the countries of the West. Developments show that military cooperation alone -- as in the NATO alliance -- is not able to predict and prevent the growth of unrest and hostilities. As a result the nonmilitary sides of security policy have become more important. In particular, the EC's economic and political role is constantly growing in security policy importance. The year we are leaving behind us shows that we are living in a period of transition in which institutions which were created for a different age must form part of the response to challenges of the new age. Since Germany and France came together after the war, the EC has had an effect in the field of security policy for 35 years without any great fuss being made. In the years to come, we will see greater demands being made on EC cooperation from the security policy angle. The new NATO will always be the guarantee that we will have a defense against attack. But it will become increasingly clear that NATO cannot contribute that type of economic cooperation which will make crises, revolts, and wars things of the past.
