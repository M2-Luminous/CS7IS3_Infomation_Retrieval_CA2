The government should be firm and act maturely as the Cambodian allegations could be made for domestic gain or to resolve internal problems. Surin's comments came amidst strong criticism by Cambodian leaders, who have repeatedly charged that Thailand has assisted the Khmer Rouge to launch offensives and sheltered the Maoist faction's leaders. Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut has threatened to take the matter to the UN Security Council. He also warned that bilateral relations between the two governments could be jeopardized.
