FR940124-2-00045 FR940124-2-00039 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33488; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;3] January 18, 1994. Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Credit Against the Annual Assessments and Fees on Members Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on January 14, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one establishing or changing a fee under Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is proposing a rule change to amend Schedule A to the By-Laws to adjust the amount of credit as set forth in Section 1(d) of Schedule A, which is currently 67%, to 59%, and to amend the calendar year dates from 1993 to 1994. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Pursuant to Article VI of the By-Laws of the Corporation, the NASD requires its members to pay an annual assessment fee based on gross income as defined by Schedule A, Section 1 to the By-Laws. 1 The NASD also allows a credit against such assessment pursuant to Section 1(d). The NASD calculates the gross income assessment from the gross income reported for the calendar or fiscal year preceding the NASD's calendar budget year. Based on the operating budget for 1994, and subject to revision based on final actual gross income reports for 1993, the NASD is proposing to amend the credit to adjust member assessments to reflect the estimated revenue needed to fund 1994 operations. This proposed rule change, therefore, amends the amount of credit set forth in Section 1(d) of Schedule A to the By-Laws, which is currently 67%, to 59%, and applies the credit to the entire 1994 calendar budget year, and amends the calendar year dates from 1993 to 1994. 2 1 NASD Manual, Schedule A to the By-Laws, Sec. 1(d), (CCH) Â¶1752. 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33363 (December 21, 1993), 58 FR 68974 (December 29, 1993) (noticing file SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;71). The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act, 3 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among members in that the proposed rule change equitably adjusts the 1994 assessment credit rate based on the projected 1994 budget. 3 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;3 (1988). (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and Section (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 promulgated there under in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge imposed by a self-regulatory organization. At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
