The human rights organizations' petition agrees with another petition signed by 23 Latin American, Spanish, and Portuguese newspaper directors who participated in a press seminar in Cartagena de Indias, where the Fourth Ibero-American Summit is being held. Luis Alberto Lacalle signed a decree three months ago approving cable television operations by a private group that dominates Montevideo's three open channels. A communique issued by these human rights organizations points out that the presidential decision, which is under congressional investigation, "effects the right to gain information and to report with no other restrictions than those established by law." The communique bears the signatures of representatives from the Latin American Institute for Alternative Legal Services [Instituto Latinoamericano de Servicios Legales Alternativos] (ILSA), the Peace and Justice Service (Serpaj) of Argentina, and the Caribbean Human Rights (CAR) organization of the Caribbean English-speaking countries. The human rights organizations, all of them non-governmental, met in Cartagena de Indias to review the policies currently implemented by the Latin American countries while their respective heads of state and heads of government were holding a "summit." Newspaper directors, including those of LA REPUBLICA of Montevideo and EL PAIS of Spain, stressed that Lacalle's decree "is unprecedented in the Ibero-American community." In this regard the newspaper directors stressed that Ibero-America "does not report a single country in which there is a private monopoly on open television and cable television."
