Dubovoy and S. Baskov, experts of the Association of Practitioners of Space Science, under the rubric "Space Science Abroad": "The `Spot'--Commerce or Reconnaissance?"] [Text] Space systems for Earth observation have traditionally been divided into civilian and military reconnaissance. Many countries, however, can purchase and use the information obtained by civilian satellites as reconnaissance information if they do not possess their own space hardware. One visible example of this is the commercial application of the French Spot-1 remote Earth sounding satellite, equipped with two cameras with a resolution of 10 meters in the visible and 20 meters in the visible and near infrared spectrums. Its first launch into space from the Kourou space facility into a heliosynchronous orbit 832 km [kilometers] high was accomplished by an Ariane launch vehicle in 1986. This resolution of the special gear makes it possible to distinguish many objects--roads, buildings, the dividing strips between agricultural lands etc., but the pictures obtained are not considered to be reconnaissance pictures in accordance with a decision by the French government. This became the pledge of commercial success for the firm of Spot-Image, which had captured half of the world market for the sale of satellite data as early as 1987. A broad opportunity appeared for the acquisition and use of photography of various sections of the Earth's surface, including secret military facilities and the areas of combat operation and weapons deployment, by governments, organizations and the mass media. The fact that the information being disseminated could be used for reconnaissance purposes was not only not a secret, but was even vigorously advertised. Assistance was offered in some materials for the identification of targets outside the limits of accessibility of reconnaissance aircraft, including determination of the positions of air-defense complexes, the structuring of stereoscopic depictions of them and the approach routes to targets. It was also pointed out that high-precision digital models of the terrain created using the information obtained from the spacecraft make it possible to create databases for target designation for ground-attack aviation. Many foreign specialists feel that the use of civilian remote Earth sounding satellites in the interests of various agencies, including military ones, is the sole expedient way of making highly efficient use of expensive space hardware. There are few scientifically sophisticated and very expensive reconnaissance systems of the American KH-11 type. The opportunity thus appears, to the extent of improvements in the quality of information from commercial satellites and reductions in the time between requests and the receipt of materials, for the use of the necessary data in a large number of fields with relevance to national security. The U.S. Defense Department, for example, spent six million dollars in 1990-91 for the procurement of 5,000 photos from the Spot satellites from the American affiliate of the Spot-Image firm in Reston (Virginia). Some of them (data on 24 airfields in the former USSR) were employed in laying out routes to non-traditional destinations for the U.S. Air Force, to ensure the safety of flights of American C-5 and C-141 military-transport aircraft delivering humanitarian aid to our cities. There were about 240 portable systems for flight support available to the U.S. Air Force at the beginning of 1992, which could be programmed for the automatic modeling of images of sections of terrain from any flight altitude according to the information from Spot. The systems compare photos from the spacecraft with digital geometric data on the terrain. The use of this technology was launched after its successful utilization during the war in the Persian Gulf. Another interesting direction is the use of these satellites for monitoring in the interests of maintaining peace and international security. The Carnegie Worldwide Assistance Fund was engaged in a study of this problem in 1988. Pictures from the Spot and Landsat satellites and some other space systems were studied. It was established that the Spot apparatus made it possible to obtain images with high resolution that contained more useful information than the Landsat pictures. All bridges proved to be detectable in them, and measurement of the images made it possible to obtain such important characteristics as the traffic capacity of bridges. They were also able to determine the deployment areas of headquarters, barracks and other buildings, and the sites of motor-vehicle pools, airports and air bases. Boeing-727 aircraft were also visible in the pictures. The international community, based on the results of the Carnegie Fund, has been discussing the possible creation (with the presumed participation of the United Nations) of means to provide for arms control in the interests of preserving peace and stability. The tasks that could be accomplished with the aid of such a space system include monitoring the observance of arms treaty obligations, ceasefires and troop disbanding, as well as supporting the efforts of popular diplomacy to defuse tense situations. Proceeding from this, the trend toward increasing the resolution of the photos received remains as topical as before. The Spot-4 spacecraft, planned to be launched in 1995, will be equipped with modern HRVIR high-resolution cameras (visible and near and middle infrared bands). The Helios satellite is presumably being developed on this basis in two versions--for reconnaissance in the optical band and for radar reconnaissance. The resolution at the ground in the optical band is expected to be no worse than one meter in surveillance from an altitude of 600--700 km. The frequency of observation of a system of two spacecraft should be one day. Italy and Spain are taking part in the Helios project along with France. The first launch of the satellite is planned for 1994, and the second in 1997. The extent to which they will be able to be used as commercial satellites can be judged after their launch. Footnote 1.
