President Yeltsin has directed that the republic's legal acts be verified for conformity to the Russian Constitution. The ink was not yet dry on the directive when Mordovian parliamentarians dealt yet another blow to the prestige of the head of state by deciding to abolish the post of his representative in the republic. Having put a stranglehold on the Council of Ministers, whose chairman, Valeriy Shvetsov, was hospitalized following a heart attack, the deputies set about the president's representative, Prof. Valentin Konakov. An authoritative man in the republic, he occupies a firmly reformist stance and is erecting substantial obstacles to the implementation of the idea of full power for the soviets. At a closed sitting of the Supreme Soviet Presidium the deputies decided to propose that President Yeltsin abolish the institution of his representative in the republic. Probably not hopeful that the head of state would look kindly on their demarche, they decided to take a shortcut and try to remove V. Konakov. A report, framed in black, appeared in the prosoviet paper MORDOVIYA about a recent meeting between Nikolay Biryukov, chairman of the Mordovian Supreme Soviet, and Boris Yeltsin. It talks of the warm reception accorded to the Mordovian speaker by the president. During the conversation Biryukov apparently asked the president what kind of state system he had in mind for Mordovia -- parliamentary or presidential? To which Yeltsin allegedly replied that it was a matter for the republic itself. The speaker then raised the question of the removal of V. Konakov from his post, describing him as a man who had fallen out with the representative and executive authorities in Mordovia. The president apparently reacted by saying: "We can do without representatives like that." Knowing the predilection of the speaker and his newspaper for wishful thinking, people in the republic doubt whether the report is authentic. But it is bound to cause serious concern. If the president does "abandon" Konakov the proccess of restoring the old order in Mordovia will be complete.
