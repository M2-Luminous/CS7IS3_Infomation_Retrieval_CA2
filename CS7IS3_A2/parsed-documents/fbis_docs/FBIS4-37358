Maj. Gen. Yusuf, who met in Tunis yesterday with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who had summoned him to Tunis, stressed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 'Arafat was keen to pay the policemen their allowances to face the high cost of living and the difficult economic conditions in Gaza and Jericho. Maj. Gen. Yusuf, who was accompanied to Tunis by his assistant Brigadier Ziyad al-Atrash, added that he submitted to President 'Arafat, with whom he met yesterday separately, a comprehensive assessment of the previous stage and the present security conditions in the National Authority area. He stressed that "we are going to adopt a new approach for the next stage." He declined to give any details about the nature of this approach. Maj. Gen. Yusuf expressed his utmost discontent at and regret for the accusations made recently by prominent figures like Faysal al-Husayni and Jamil al-Tarifi with regard to what they termed a "Gaza-Jericho agreement for detainees." He described these claims as "absolutely untrue." He added: "We regret that some of the brothers who participated in all stages of the negotiations, and who have full knowledge of the details, are ignoring this reality and accusing us of concluding agreements with Israel which are not final." He said that he and Ziyad al-Atrash had not signed a single letter with Israel, and that what some quarters have said is untrue. He said: "We are implementing an agreement, not conducting negotiations. We are liaison committees tasked with implementing an agreement signed by the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships. We are eager to secure credibility for the leadership by implementing what has been signed." Maj. Gen. Yusuf stressed that he had not signed any documents regarding detainees, and that the clauses concerning detainees are stipulated in the Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed on 4 May in Cairo. So "we have not signed any agreement on the detainees, nor have we been dragged into any negotiations with Israel in this connection. If that had been the case, we would have asked the leadership to do that. But we are field officers whose work is based on the field implementation of the agreement on the ground." Concluding his statement, Maj. Gen. Yusuf stressed that he is going to return to his work in Gaza and Jericho in the next two days, refuting the rumors circulating in Tunis to the effect that 'Arafat is going to replace the police forces commander.
