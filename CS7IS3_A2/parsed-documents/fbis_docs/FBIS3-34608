FBIS3-34608 "drnes028_o_94005" FBIS-NES-94-028 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Feb 1994 SYRIA Press Rejects Blame for Lebanese `Resistance' JN0902092494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 9 Feb 94 JN0902092494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Press review] [Text] Commenting on the results of the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, AL-THAWRAH says: The news conference held following the summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton demonstrated genuine agreement on a peace that rests on Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. There was also agreement that true peace is that which removes all the factors of conflict, primarily Israeli occupation and guaranteeing Arab rights. AL-THAWRAH notes the worldwide support for the results of the Geneva summit and the world's appreciation for Syria's position, which opened the doors for peace and completely paved the way for a just and comprehensive peace. The paper says: Israel is now facing a real test. It has to prove practically that it is part of the peace camp by responding to the Geneva call for establishing the peace of the brave. AL-THAWRAH notes the strange claims of Yitzhaq Rabin, head of the Israeli Government, that he does not know Syria's true position on peace. Only a few days ago, Rabin acknowledged that peace with Syria is very important. The paper says: Rabin's acknowledgement of the importance of making peace with Syria must be accompanied by action to achieve this just and comprehensive peace. Rabin should be courageous enough to declare accepting the principle of full and comprehensive withdrawal, which is a condition for full peace. Is this not what President al-Asad meant when he called for the peace of the brave? Is this not more useful than fabrications against Syria and attempts to hold it responsible for the killing of Israeli soldiers at the hands of Lebanese national resistance and on occupied Lebanese territory? Under the headline "Occupation Is the Reason," TISHRIN says: Israel is lying to itself when it blames others for the continuation of resistance and ignores that it alone, by its occupation of the south, is directly responsible for the developments and operations in southern Lebanon. Resistance is a natural outcome of occupation. National duty urges the Lebanese people to join the resistance to restore their occupied territory and uproot the occupation, because the occupation is the reason for all the tragedies and catastrophes that Lebanon and its people have suffered. Besides, resistance against the occupation is guaranteed by international law and all charters. Therefore, neither Israel nor anybody else can call for stopping the resistance as long as occupation is continuing. If Israel wants to see a calm situation in the south and not to escalate matters, then it should eliminate the reasons for this resistance, specifically, the occupation and the policy of suppression, terrorism, and expansion. TISHRIN adds: Israel has to date refused to abide by the will of international legitimacy. Therefore, Syria can, under no circumstances, accept to act as a policeman for this occupation. Israel should not pursue its claims and allegations by blaming Syria for the resistance operations. TISHRIN concludes: It is necessary now to clarify matters, since Israel alone, by virtue of its occupation, is responsible for the developments and tension in the south. Israel's aggressive, expansionist policy could trigger further serious results and have a negative impact on the situation in the region, starting with the south. Under the headline "National Resistance Is Continuing Until Its Cause Is Removed," AL-BA'TH says: The military reinforcements dispatched by Israel to southern Lebanon were accompanied by aggressive threats that remind us of Israel's campaign against defenseless villages late last July, which claimed dozens of martyrs. Amid this escalation, Rabin and others did not forget to launch a disinformation campaign against Syria in a bid to undermine its clear positions on the peace process and blame it for the explosive resistance in southern Lebanon. The paper adds: The launching of the resistance was in no need of permission from Syria or others. The resistance was the outcome of a direct reason which lies in the occupation of territory. The Lebanese people, who belong to a nation that has never surrendered to occupiers throughout its history, rose to resist the usurper to liberate their sacred soil from the filth of the occupation. Since the cause has not been removed, the resistance will continue. AL-BA'TH says Israel's twisted logic by involving Syria in the business of the valiant national resistance to the brute occupier is within the Rabin government's constant attempts to circumvent the peace process and avoid implementing Resolution 425 stipulating immediate withdrawal from southern Lebanon. AL-BA'TH concludes: If Rabin thinks that his threats and military operations against southern Lebanon would enable him to somehow avoid fulfilling the obligations of peace, then he is entertaining illusions that would not stall peace efforts that aim at achieving security and stability in the region. If he fears the resistance operations, all he has to do is submit to Resolution 425 as soon as possible.
