Informed Kurdish sources informed the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH that among the people killed were five agent Kurdish elements known for their links to the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence circles. They explained that the five dead Kurds were Salih Sa'id, a translator, born in 1962; 'Abd-al-Sattar 'Arab, born in 1969; Nadir Mikhu, born in 1964; Ghandi Husayn, born in 1968; and Ahmad Muhammad Sulayman, born in 1956. These elements were carrying extremely important reports which were to be discussed in a meeting in Salah al-Din, which was not convened due to the helicopters' downing. The Kurdish sources asserted that the meeting in Salah al-Din was designed to expand the circle of conspiracy and discuss reports on proposals aimed at entrenching the separatist movement and detach Kurdistan from Iraq as part of the comprehensive fragmentation scheme prepared by U.S. and Zionist circles. The sources explained that many Mosad agents were present at the scene of the accident. A group was spotted, led by Marlin Bogos [name as received], who plays the role of coordinator, and Barbara Schell, political adviser to the forces of aggression in the Turkish base of Incerlik. The newspaper sources revealed a U.S. report which was to be discussed during the Salah al-Din meeting. This report aims to entrench the United States in the region, loot the mineral resources in Iraq's Kurdistan, and transfer them to California under the supervision of scientists specialized in exploring uranium, gold, tin, and other minerals.
