Under the deals with the State Planning Commission, AT&T will provide technology, products and services to China. Last year the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a long-term partnership. Ceremony in U.S. Yesterday's agreements, signed in the U.S., called for AT&T to establish: -- Two joint ventures capable of producing 2 million switching lines per year for China, with factories located in Chengdu, Sichuan Province and Qingdao, Shandong; -- A microelectronics joint venture to design and produce integrated circuits known as VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration); the location will be decided this summer; -- An AT&T Bell research and development facility; -- Training courses for mid-level and senior Chinese managers in planning, communications, electronics and other industries; -- And a comprehensive network management programme with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications that will handle the sale and development of hardware and software systems for network surveillance, management and control. The programme should alleviate problems in China's vast telecommunications system. ``AT&T is committed to providing China with digital and fibre-optic technologies that are the latest and best in the world so it can leapfrog almost overnight into the information age,'' said William Warwick, chairman of AT&T China. The company yesterday also agreed to explore remaining areas of co-operation outlined in last year's memorandum. Since the signing in February 1993, AT&T has secured more than $500 million in sales contracts and last year doubled its 1992 revenues in China. The company has already set up nine joint ventures in the country; they are engaged in marketing wireless systems, international long-distance services, computer products and networks.
