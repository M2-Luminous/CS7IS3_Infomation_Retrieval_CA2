Based on statements made by several people, we surmise that the population is angry because although economists close to the administration say that the increase in the price of fuel is the best way to collect funds for the treasury without having a major effect on the increase in the price of other articles, the theory does not work in practice because even before the economic package was implemented, prices began to rise rapidly, thus adversely affecting the prices of basic foods in several cases. The outlook at the marketplace was disheartening. Vegetable prices doubled and sometimes tripled. The increase in the price of gasoline, according to some experts, will also lead to an increase in medical fees, medicines, education, plane tickets, and other goods.
