FR940513-2-00181 FR940513-2-00086 Under the separate 1989 participation agreements relative to the sale of the Undivided Interests, LP&L issued three separate promissory notes to the owner-participants in an aggregate principal amount equal to the highest of either the maximum net casualty value or the maximum net special casualty value payable under the Leases during the basic lease term._$208,236,768 on July 2, 1994, which is expected to be the approximate date of the sale. Redemption of the Original Bonds could, in some circumstances, cause an increase in these values and therefore, require an increase in the principal amount of the related promissory notes. In addition, LP&L is required to collateralize its obligations to the owner-participants five years after the sales either through first mortgage bonds in a principal amount equal to that of the promissory notes or a letter of credit (HCAR No. 24956, September 26, 1989). To the extent the proposed transactions would necessitate the issuance of promissory notes or first mortgage bonds in a principal amount in excess of that previously authorized, LP&L also seeks authorization of such increases. Metropolitan Edison Company (70&hyph;8401) Metropolitan Edison Company (``Met-Ed''), 2800 Pottsville Pike, Muhlenberg Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania 19640, a public-utility subsidiary company of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), a registered holding company, has filed an amended application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and rules 45, 50(a)(5) and 54 thereunder. A notice of the application-declaration was issued by the Commission on April 22, 1993 (HCAR No. 26034) (``Prior Notice''). As described in the Prior Notice, Met-Ed proposes to organize a special purpose subsidiary (``Met-Ed Capital'') as either a limited liability company under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (``LLC Act'') or a limited partnership under the Pennsylvania or Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Met-Ed may also organize a second special purpose wholly owned subsidiary under the Delaware General Corporation Law (``Investment Sub'') for the sole purpose of either: (i) Acquiring and holding a second class of Met-Ed Capital common interests so as to comply with the requirement under the LLC Act that a limited liability company have at least two members or (ii) acting as the general partner of Met-Ed Capital, assuming a limited partnership structure. Met-Ed Capital will then issue and sell from time to time in one or more series through June 30, 1996 up to $125 million aggregate stated value of preferred limited liability company interests or limited partnership interests, in the form of Monthly Income Preferred Stock, $25 per share stated value (``MIPS''). Met-Ed states that there are certain changes to the transactions as described in the Prior Notice. First, each note or Subordinated Debenture, as described in the Prior Notice, will have a term of up to 50 years, rather than 30 years that may be extended for up to an additional 20 years, subject to certain specified conditions.
