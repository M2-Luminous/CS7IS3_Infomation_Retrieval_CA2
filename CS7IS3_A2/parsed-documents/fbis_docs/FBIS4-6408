The federation also sought an easing of regulations on rice and liquor sales and railway fares. The government maintains tight controls on licensing rice retailers. The federation expressed hope that its appeal will be reflected in a deregulation program to be formulated by the government by the end of fiscal 1994. It said deregulation in the retail business will help narrow the price gap between domestic and imported goods. The federation said passenger and freight fares should be decontrolled while the existing regulation on shipbuilding should also be reviewed to allow newcomers to enter the coastal shipping market.
