FBIS4-923 "drafr076_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Calls For End to Violence Calls For End to Violence MB2004065794 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in Afrikaans 0605 GMT 20 Apr 94 MB2004065794 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network Afrikaans BFN [From the "Good Morning South Africa" program; italicized passage in English] [Text] Soon after the announcement yesterday that the Inkatha Freedom Party was to participate in the election, Gary Alfonso spoke to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on his call to the Zulus to vote, and the possibility that violence would now begin to decline. [Begin recording] [Zwelithini] The king doesn't particpate in politics, in political party politics, so I don't think it would be good for a king to dictate to the people who must they vote for, and who must they not vote for, because I don't think by doing that, that wouldn't mean that the king now stands with other political parties. [sentence as heard] So I think the Zulus, as I know that they are affiliated in all different political aparties, so it's not the duty for the king, actually, to tell them who must they vote for, who must they not vote for. [Alfonso] Your Majesty, do you think all people in South Africa, or most people in South Africa, the overwhelming majority now going to the polls and voting, do you think that's enough to stop the violence? [Zwelithini] Actually, it's something that needs to be looked at. It's not the throne, or the Zul? throne, that has caused violence in this country. The king has been there as a symbol of unity of his people, so the king was very much surprised to see that people are killing each other because of their differences in politics. So now, as far as I am concerned, the tension that has been increasing in between the political parties needs to come down, especially from the followers themselves, because the political leaders have been pleading to the people to stop this violence. But it means to me that it has never been actually addressed so much to the grass-root level, because those are the people who need actually to be addressed and to be reminded about peaceful structures which need to be put in practise most of the time. So I hope that with the announcements today in kwaZulu-Natal, the violence that has erupted in this province, it needs to come to an end today, and tomorrow. [end recording]
