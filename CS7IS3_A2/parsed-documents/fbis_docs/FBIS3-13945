As is known, the Israeli delegation is led by Amnon Shahaq while the Palestinian delegation is made up of Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Ahmad Quray', and Akram Haniyah. Yesterday, the two delegations held a meeting that was also attended by President Yasir 'Arafat and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. According to Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee member, the Israeli delegation did not present serious proposals on the safety of Palestinians in the occupied territories. What he proposed, Ghawshah said, did not meet the minimum requirements. This, he added, means practically emptying the Security Council Resolution [904] of its substance. Speaking to our radio, the Palestinian official said the Israelis had, for example, proposed turning the International Red Cross representatives in the occupied territories into international observers, according to an Israeli concept of the way to implement the Security Council's call for a temporary international presence in the occupied territories. It seems that during its talks here in Tunis, the Israeli delegation showed no positive response to proposals by Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Larsen on the security measures that should be taken in the occupied territories as Yitzhaq Rabin promised in his telephone call with Yasir 'Arafat last Friday. U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross is due in Tunis this afternoon. According to some sources, a quadrapartite meeting of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations as well as Ross and Larsen is expected to be held to help develop the Israeli proposals to protect the Palestinians. It will be according to these proposals that the Palestinian stand toward the resumption of negotiations will be determined.
