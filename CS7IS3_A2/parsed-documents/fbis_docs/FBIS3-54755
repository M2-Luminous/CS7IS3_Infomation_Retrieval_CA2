Skvortsov including recorded remarks by V. Kucher, editor in chief of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Skvortsov] Without waiting for New Year's eve, when the old and unnecessary are thrown away, our fellow journalists at the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI have freed themselves from the intrusive stewardship of their masters, the Council of Ministers. [Kucher] I will be honest about this. We have taken advantage of an edict by President Boris Yeltsin about reorganizing the government, and which has brought us an unexpected New Year's present. According to Clause 4 of Article 18 of the Law on the Press, if a founder is reorganized, then all rights are transferred to its successor at the newspaper, which is the work force. We held a meeting of journalists yesterday, and we became founders of the newspaper. We are profoundly convinced that if Russia is becoming a truly democratic state, then there should be no newspapers speaking in the name of the state or newspapers working under the diktat of any state authorities. Newspapers should perform another vital function: Supervision of the authorities by society. [Skvortsov] They plan to solve the problem of finance themselves, with only part coming from the state budget. [Kucher] We were not building up a newspaper business. We felt like a castrated tom cat in the hands of a rich boss. [Skvortsov] We will find out the government's reaction to this breakaway next year.
