Again, the authorities have prevented, in an elegant way, it is true, the visit of the Sovereign. After the royal family had handed in their passports [for the granting of the visa] on 8 April to the Romanian embassy in Bern and the King reasserted his declaration according to which he does not intend to contest the constitutional order (which does not mean that he also acknowledges the Constitution), the Bucharest authorities sent their representative to Versoix [royal headquarters in Switzerland]. That representative was Ion Gorita, state secretary of the ministry of foreign affairs. Being in Paris, accompanying President Ion Iliescu on his visit in France, Gorita contacted His Majesty's secretariat over the telephone. In the afternoon of the same day, 16 April, he received an audience at Versoix. At that time the point of view expressed by the envoy of the Romanian authorities was that "the government sees no impediment to the visit of the King." Thus, a significant change in the stance of the authorities began to take shape, a shift compared to the hysteria that they referred to whenever the king previously tried to return to his native country. They agreed that during the following days the King would designate the persons who were to represent him at the negotiations scheduled to take place in Bucharest with the representatives of the authorities. His Majesty the King designated Messrs. Gheorghe Antoniade and Dan Badic to conduct the talks. On behalf of the Romanian authorities the talks were attended, in the first phase, by Messrs. Ion Gorita, George Ioan Danescu, state secretary at the ministry of interior, and other officials. Initially they raised the issue of his visit to Timisoara, as the King had been officially invited by the mayor of that municipality, Viorel Oancea, and His Holiness Nicolae Corneanu, the Metropolitan of Banat. The talks were also attended by the Timis County prefect and the head of the county police. Their first stipulation was the King's isolation from Timisoara. The authorities suggested that his residence should be at one of Ceausescu's former Houses, in the locality of Pischia, 27 kilometers away from Timisoara. The royal house could not accept that offer, first because the king had wanted to stay in a house owned by the church and, second, because having been invited by Timisoara, he could not understand why he should keep out of Timisoara. Then the authorities invented further pretexts, such as the fact that the king's protection (against whom?) could not be ensured in Timisoara, or they claimed they held information (from what source?) according to which during the royal visit in Timisoara both pro-monarchy and anti-monarchy (?!?) demonstrations were planned. Eventually, after further discussions, the authorities openly admitted that Timisoara could in no way be the scene of the royal visit. Trying to stall reaching an agreement, the government then invented an extreme solution: They would officially invite the King to visit, "wherever" else he wishes to go. The King pondered this new proposal a great deal, after which he authorized his representatives in Bucharest to state that for the good of the country and for the sake of national reconciliation, the King accepts, in principle, that proposal, provided that Viorel Oancea, the Timisoara mayor, as well as Metropolitan Corneanu should accompany him wherever he goes. It was quite difficult for the King to accept that government proposal as he felt bound by very deep feelings to Timisoara, the martyr city, which the authorities had several times prevented him from visiting. On Wednesday [27 April] evening, at government headquarters, new talks were held between the King's representatives and those of the executive, among whom Mr. Viorel Hrebenciuc, the general secretary of the government, also attended. They came up with yet another thing: Having said that the king could visit "wherever" he wished, the government now suggested a new variant containing three possibilities: The king should visit Curtea de Arges, Putna, or Olanesti [monasteries], where he would be sheltered in "palaces" and "copious meals" would be served to him. It is worth noting that the representatives of the authorities were constantly trying to flatter the king's envoys by mentioning the palaces, meals, and other such "favors" that the government would be ready to provide for His Majesty. What is more, the government suggested that they would send a BAC-type aircraft to Geneva solely for the transportation of the royal family to Romania, which would mean spending a huge amount of money. The King's representatives replied that there was no need for such a thing, as the King wished to travel by a normal airline flight and he did not intend to stay in palaces or dine copiously. The government people found it very difficult to comprehend that point of view. Eventually, the King expressed his wish to visit Bucharest, a thing that originally had been suggested by the Government. However, now they did not accept. This is, in general terms, how the 10-day Bucharest talks among the representatives of the king and those of the government evolved. Anyone can easily see that the authorities changed their stance each time the wind changed direction. The final impression was that actually they were merely trying to delay making a decision and to finally convince His Majesty to accept that the visit should be as secretive as possible and in a place selected by the government. Having requested that the visit should have a private character, the government wanted an official one, kept secret, the schedule of which was also to be established by the government. All this happened after Ion Gorita, on 16 April, in Versoix, had said that "there are no problems." No comment needed!
