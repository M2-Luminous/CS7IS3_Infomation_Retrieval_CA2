"Should United Nations measures be decided, it is desirable that Japan cooperate in these," Kakizawa said in answering a question from a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. In case the UN Security Council cannot reach agreement over the sanctions issue due to anticipated opposition from China, North Korea's traditional ally which favors a soft approach in the nuclear controversy, Japan would offer "maximum cooperation" in multilateral punitive measures, he said. Japan could do its part by halting cash remittances to North Korea from pro-Pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan and suspending trade with the communist country, Kakizawa said. Taking into account that the situation on the Korean peninsula is Japan's direct security interest, Tokyo's "basic foreign policy stance" is to do its utmost to support Washington should it decide to move independently from the UN, he said. He said, however, such U.S. measures would have to be "effective" to gain Tokyo's approval. Kakizawa also stressed that without winning China's support the UN Security council would not be able to exert any pressure on North Korea to accept the international calls for inspections. In response to another question from the opposition LDP, Kakizawa said Japan would resume normalization talks with North Korea as soon as possible if Pyongyang "displays a sincere attitude toward dispelling suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons." Asked for an assessment of U.S. moves toward sanctions, Yutaka Kawashima, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asia Affairs Bureau, said "there are various opinions" within U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration and no unified stance has been formulated yet. "There are calls for sanctions as anger has built up after one year of endurance" in the nuclear controversy, he said, adding "the American Government's stance has not hardened yet." Following a regular cabinet meeting in the morning, chief Government Spokesman Hiroshi Kumagai reiterated Tokyo's concern over North Korea's defiance of the inspection demands. "We are deeply concerned about this situation," Kumagai told a news conference. "We would like to weigh what action to take in close concert with the countries involved such as the United States, South Korea and China," he said. Kumagai later said before a lower house panel, "we have no specific sanctions in mind. We will tenaciously try to persuade" North Korea to reach a negotiated settlement of the nuclear row. On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) informed the UN Security Council that Pyongyang's refusal to let inspectors conduct an unimpeded check of discharged fuel rods has made it impossible to verify whether plutonium has been diverted in the past to manufacture atomic bombs. North Korea last month started to exchange without IAEA supervision the 8,000 fuel rods in its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, sparking another security council statement last week urging compliance with the agency's inspection demands.
