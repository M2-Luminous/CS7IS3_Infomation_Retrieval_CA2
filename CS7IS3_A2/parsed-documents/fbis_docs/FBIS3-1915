This was a remarkable piece of writing and a very good negative example which may serve as a lesson. The fourth part of the White Paper, "Conclusion and the Way Forward," says: "Many of the individual issues covered in the talks were, in themselves, technical. But the fundamental difference between the two sides was simple." This remark is quite true; however, the British side's description of the "fundamental difference" was absolutely absurd. According to its White Paper, the difference was that the British side's proposal on the political structure was prodemocratic, but the Chinese side's proposal was antidemocratic. Here, facts were simply stood on their head, and things were turned completely upside down. The differences between the Chinese and British sides were absolutely not about whether there should be democracy or how much democracy should be adopted. What Britain is now practicing is a system of constitutional monarchy, and the British people themselves may judge whether such a system is good or bad. Britain, however, has no right to impose its system on other countries. Hong Kong is a place that belongs to China, and China will soon resume sovereignty over Hong Kong. It is a matter of course that Britain has no right to demand that China also adopt its system in Hong Kong. The appointment of a failed politician by the British ruling authorities to be governor in a territory forcefully occupied by Britain was itself not an event representative of democracy at all, and this is self-evident. When Chris Patten took office as governor of Hong Kong, he decided to play tricks like he did in the British political circles and stir up trouble in Hong Kong. The so-called democratic political reform was just a fig leaf. Proceeding from some Westerners' prejudices, he blamed China for not practicing democracy and not allowing Hong Kong to practice democracy. Using the Western mass media to spread this point of view was Patten's primary method for deceiving the Hong Kong people. However, British Foreign Secretary Hurd said in the preface for the White Paper: "The Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and China's Basic Law for Hong Kong, which will come into force as of 1 July 1997, between them set the pace for democratic development in Hong Kong. There is no argument about that." Here, Hurd slapped his own face as well as Patten's. Since the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law have already set the pace of democracy in Hong Kong, why did the British not adopt a constitutional package which converges with the Basic Law, and why did the British authorities abet the Legislative Council members they had appointed to attack such convergence by saying that "the theory of convergence is our enemy"? Obviously, the British side had another intention, and what they actually hoped was to extend colonial rule under the pretense of seeking "democracy." People have often pointed out that the fundamental differences between the Chinese side and the British side lay in whether one should keep one's promise in international relations. Hurd admitted that the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law already set the pace of democracy in Hong Kong, but the British authorities still perversely went against the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The consultation mechanism specified by the Joint Declaration was also cast aside by the British authorities. Hurd avoided mentioning the seven letters he exchanged with the Chinese foreign minister in early 1990 on the election arrangements in Hong Kong and the agreements and understandings reached by these letters. The White Paper even said that the seven diplomatic letters "did not reach any agreement (on the 1995 election arrangements)." What Patten did in the first 18 months after he took office in Hong Kong showed that the British completely disregarded the basic norm of acting in good faith in international relations, and moved as far as shamelessly denying that the process of democracy in Hong Kong had been specified by the Joint Declaration and the seven diplomatic letters and insisting that Patten's "three violation" package be arbitrarily enforced in the last months of British colonial rule. Britain is a major power, but it still can behave so shamelessly as ignoring diplomatic documents which it had already signed. What international credibility will such a country maintain? The behavior of the British authorities since Patten become governor of Hong Kong only recorded their perfidy. This time, they violated the principle of keeping the talks confidential and unilaterally published the White Paper. This just added one more page to the record of their dishonor. Will they still be able to really bring any democracy to Hong Kong in the last 40 months of their rule? By contrast, the Chinese Government always faithfully honors its international commitments, and this is a fact admitted by the international community. The British side behaved perfidiously under the pretense of "democracy." What was their real intention? Patten's package and the political structure that the British side tried to impose on Hong Kong beyond 1997 as revealed by the White Paper showed that they were unwilling to give up the territory that they had occupied for over 150 years. That is to say, London was trying by every possible means to extend its rule in Hong Kong. The British authorities have been attempting to simply return Hong Kong to China in a formalistic way and continue their de facto control over Hong Kong. This was self-evident. Approximately 10 years ago, Mrs Thatcher tried to impede China from resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and she inevitably ran into snags. Deng Xiaoping made it clear to her: "Sovereignty is not a question which is open for discussion." In July 1984, when meeting with then British Foreign Secretary Howe, Deng Xiaoping showed his foresight and pointed out: "We hope that the British Hong Kong Government will not set up a body in order to impose it on the government of the Special Administrative Region." Patten's constitutional package was precisely a plan for unilaterally setting up a body in the transitional period in an attempt to impose it on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This represented a serious challenge to China's sovereign power. Sovereignty is the crucial issue and the essence of the fundamental nature of the Sino-British fundamental differences over Hong Kong's political structure. On this issue, the British side was unable to advance further arguments and justify itself and had no strength to confront itself with China. Patten and his ilk were as ridiculous as an ant trying to topple a giant tree.
