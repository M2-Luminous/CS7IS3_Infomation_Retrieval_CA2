Aznar justified this decision in terms of the need to achieve tangible results in the talks with the Socialist group and, especially, of the advisability of setting limits to the public dialogue with the Socialists in order to avoid reaching the preliminary campaign for the European and Andalusian autonomous community elections in June with the leaders of the two major parties "taking photographs of each other." Nevertheless, the People's Party leader emphasized that this decision involves no change of tactics; rather, it means adjusting them to different political situations. The decision to end the negotiation for the present, until after the June elections, was presented by Aznar in the Canary Islands, in a secret conversation prior to the meeting held by the People's Party National Executive Committee in the islands 17 January. The People's Party chairman convened what some leaders know as a "sanhedrin" or "conclave," and what Aznar himself calls "the usual meetings." These meetings, which are devoted to reflection at decisive moments but at which no decision is ever taken, are attended by the main national leaders, the parliamentary spokesmen, a select group of Executive Committee members, and some people who do not belong to any party body, such as Pedro Arriola, Aznar's adviser. The People's Party chairman argued at that meeting that it would not be intelligent to allow the PSOE to prolong the democratic impetus negotiations indefinitely. It would be tantamount, he said, to giving the public the impression that there is a basic consensus between government and opposition and that, essentially, the government is conducting the only policy that the situation allows, given the absence of a serious alternative. Aznar, who is rather disappointed by the results of the democratic impetus, from which he was hoping for more, gave precise instructions to continue to negotiate, but only until the end of February. During that period, he demanded, every effort must be made to secure the greatest possible agreement, then the democratic impetus of which the Socialists speak or the democratic regeneration -- the term which the People's Party prefers -- will be wound up, at least by the People's Party. Strategy Review Aznar tried to make it clear that this decision to suspend any dialogue with the PSOE from March does not mean a change of course. He is prepared to continue to hold talks with Felipe Gonzalez when they both see fit, and remains convinced that he should not return to all-out opposition because it would serve only to exacerbate the country's situation, according to People's Party leadership sources. Since last year all Aznar has personally curbed the PSOE's attempts to extend the democratic impetus to areas other than the central government, the Congress of Deputies, and the Senate. For instance, the Socialists' offers to attempt parallel negotiations in autonomous communities were interpreted from the outset as a mere attempt to eliminate or blur his opposition role. The review of the party's overall strategy will come, as Aznar himself has explained, after the European elections and with their results on the table. Reviewing does not necessarily imply changing. Party leadership sources state that no attempt will be made to hasten legislative elections, even with a major victory for the People's Party over the PSOE. When Aznar says that he wants the legislative term to be completed he "is telling the truth," the same sources stress, because what the People's Party should seriously consider is whether it wishes to win in order to govern for three or four years or in order to stay in the Moncloa Palace for 10 or 12 years. According to this semiofficial analysis circulating in the party's upper echelons, an election victory before the municipal and autonomous community elections scheduled for May 1995 could prove suicidal, because it would confront the central government with a dense network of municipal councils and autonomous communities in the Socialist Party's hands.
