For the moment, the tense atmosphere between the two countries has cooled off. This disclosure was made this afternoon by Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Babagana Kingibe who was granted audience in Lome II by the head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema. Let's listen to the Nigerian diplomat. [Begin recording] [Kingibe] My visit to Togo today is in line with regular consultations between Nigeria and Togo especially when a problem arises in our region or between our two countries. As you are aware, the Togolese president has taken an initiative which has deeply touched all Nigerians by going to Cameroon and Nigeria to see if he could offer some sort of mediation in this small problem between Nigeria and Cameroon. So, I have come here in this context and presently there is a Togolese delegation in Abuja. My Togolese counterpart is currently in Abuja. So, you see that it is normal for Nigeria and Togo to always have regular and very close contacts and consultations. I have come here in this context and I am highly satisfied with the outcome of my talks with the president. I came to convey some suggestions and viewpoints of President Sani Abacha and I am very pleased with the observations made by President Eyadema on this viewpoints. I am happy to confirm that, thanks to President Eyadema's personal intervention and also to other measures adopted by President Sani Abacha and President Paul Biya, the present tension has cooled off a great deal. Calm prevails now, and the two governments -- the two leaders -- have demonstrated their desire to engage in fraternal dialogue and to avoid internationalizing the dispute. So, the prevailing atmosphere is very, very satisfactory now. Calm now prevails. [Unidentified correspondent] Will the heads of state meet? [Kingibe] By the grace of God. [Correspondent] And will the meeting come very soon? [Kingibe] I hope very, very soon. But the truth is that no precise date has been fixed now. However, I am very confident that a meeting will be held very, very soon. [end recording]
