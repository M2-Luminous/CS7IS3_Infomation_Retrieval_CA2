FBIS4-27545 "dreas106_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 31 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Europeans on `U.S. Bias' in Aircraft Development Europeans on `U.S. Bias' in Aircraft Development OW0106061894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 31 May 94 Morning Edition p 13 OW0106061894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] European aircraft makers, including France's Aerospatiale and Britain's British Aerospace, complained to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] on 30 May of the "U.S. bias" in the process of selecting a partner to develop the small passenger jetliner YSX, a joint project of the Japanese Government and private sector, and asked MITI to correct this tendency. The Boeing Company of the United States and the Japanese have already started a feasibility study on YSX. The Europeans seriously regard "Boeing's entry into the market of small aircraft to be a threat," and competition between the United States and Europe is bound to intensify. The complaint was made in a letter from the Aerospace Committee (chaired by De Fontaine [name as published], Japan representative of Eurocopter) of the European Business Association in Japan. The letter says that if partnership between Japan and Boeing in small passenger aircraft materializes, this will: 1) aggravate the disparity between Europe and the United States in Japan's cooperation with foreign countries in the aerospace sector; and 2) threaten the existence of European companies. YSX is the passenger jetliner that will succeed the Japanese-made YS-11. MITI has obtained appropriations for research on this aircraft since fiscal 1989. However, joint international development is considered indispensable to share development costs and strengthen marketing potential. For this reason, the Japanese Government and private sector have been negotiating with a number of foreign companies, including Boeing and ATR, a joint venture company formed by Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia, and plan to select a development partner by this summer. Boeing has already started a feasibility study with Japan and China on small passenger aircraft in preparation for the YSX project. This complaint by the European companies seems to have been filed amid speculation that "Boeing will be the probable partner in the YSX project," and is meant to remind Japan of the presence of the European companies.
