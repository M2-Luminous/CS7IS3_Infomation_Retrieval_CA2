FBIS4-34095 "drlat115_l_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-115 Daily Report 9 May 1994 Bolivia Capitalization of State Companies Progresses Capitalization of State Companies Progresses 94SM0357A La Paz HOY in Spanish 9 May 94 p 13 94SM0357A La Paz HOY Spanish CSO [Report by German Velasquez Clavijo] [Text] Three months after the Capitalization Law was passed, the process is moving along nicely, according to the government. Apparently, judging by reports from the top officials of the executive branch, the sectoral laws governing the National Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), the National Electric Power Enterprise (Ende), the National Smelting Enterprise (Enaf), the National Railway Enterprise (Enfe), and Bolivian Government Oil Deposits (YPFB) are in the process of being revised, and investors have shown great interest. The national government set a deadline of 18 months for this process to be completed. By the end of that period, state enterprises should have been converted into mixed corporations, their book value should have been appraised at the financial and market levels, regulatory bodies should have been formed, and an international call for bids should have been issued for the purchase of shares. Legal Progress The framework law on capitalization has been enacted, but the legal instrument of the regulatory bodies responsible for monitoring the provision of communication, electricity, fuel, and transportation services has not been completed yet. Moreover, the strategies for obtaining more fresh money have not yet been finalized. The sectoral laws for the regulation and organization of markets, which will set policy on concessions, authorizations, rates, and fees for the five companies, are being analyzed and evaluated. The president and his cabinet will be approving them any day now, and then they will be sent to Congress. In short, the procedures for carrying out the capitalization process have not yet been defined, and therefore it would be premature to take a stand on the viability of the process or its pros and cons. It is important to know in advance what regulatory frameworks will govern the different sectors, what criteria will be followed for selecting strategic partners, what strategy will be followed for each company, and what costs and benefits the process will entail. So far, however, the first steps in the process have already been taken by the principal executives of the six enterprises to be capitalized: Bolivian Government Oil Deposits (YPFB), the National Electric Power Enterprise (Ende), the National Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), the Metallurgical Enterprise of Vinto (formerly Enaf), the National Railway Enterprise (Enfe), and the Lloyd Bolivian Airline (LAB). YPFB Any day now, the employees of the state petroleum enterprise will become the first shareholders in the enterprise, once its legal status is officially converted to that of mixed corporation. Its bylaws are now being revised. The Hydrocarbon Law is also under consideration. It is currently in the hands of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who is expected to approve it and send it on to Congress. According to Capitalization Minister Alfonso Revollo, the new legal instrument will include a tax system for the hydrocarbons sector (an excise tax on gasoline) and other measures aimed at attracting investors. Value Declined Sources say off the record that the value of YPFB has dropped from $1.5 billion to less than $1 billion. The president of the enterprise, Mauricio Gonzales, has urged caution, however, noting that it is premature to discuss specific amounts because higher offers may be made on the market. It is not known officially what YPFB's book value is; all that is available is estimates from recent audits. The final results will be released after the consulting firm completes the appraisal of assets. Principal Problem One of the problems that will beset the YPFB capitalization process is its heavy debt. The state petroleum enterprise owes more than 1.4 billion bolivianos, equivalent to $300 million, primarily because of the agreement with Argentina to "start from scratch." This situation may be resolved by the replacement of the TGN [expansion unknown], but Minister Revollo stated that first the macroeconomic impact must be studied, or failing that, liabilities must be included in the process. National Electric Power Enterprise The capitalization of the National Electric Power Enterprise (Ende) may allow for the sale of energy to the neighboring countries of Argentina, Chile, and Peru, said President Sanchez de Lozada. For this reason, an infusion of fresh investment funds is necessary. He stated that Bolivia is now the country with the smallest electricity production, 700 megawatts. An effort will be made to reverse this situation with incentives and foreign investment. To carry out this task, the electricity market must be deregulated and Ende must be regarded as just one more company competing with others in power generation and distribution. To achieve that end, experts at the Energy Secretariat have begun to revise the Electricity Code in consultation with experts from the World Bank. Ende Value Unknown The minister of capitalization indicated that no one yet knows Ende's book value, but this month the figures will be released after an external audit is performed. He explained that it is a profitable and well-run enterprise, which makes it more attractive on the investment market. Metallurgical Enterprise of Vinto In the mining sector, capitalization will take place in the smelting company of Vinto (formerly Enaf), since this is the only company in the sector that is still in production and making a profit. That fact will arouse the interest of the private sector. This month, company executives will hire a consulting firm to appraise the firm and evaluate its situation. In addition, all the instruments necessary to regulate the process are now being drawn up. Company Value The latest appraisal of the Metallurgical Enterprise of Vinto indicates that its value is $50 million. This figure may be high, however, considering that Minsur [expansion not given] invested $17.5 million installing its own smelting plant, with a production capacity of 13,000 fine tons of tin, 5,500 tons less than that of the national smelting enterprise. LAB The capitalization of the country's first airline is now under way. Top executives are reorganizing and restructuring the firm to make it more attractive to the private sector. Analysts say that under current conditions, the company could only last two more years. Thus, a capital infusion is essential, especially considering that it lost $12 million in the last fiscal year. Despite these circumstances, LAB executives say the airline has great potential for capitalization. Most airlines in the world are going through crises, and the Bolivian company is no exception. Entel The government considers the capitalization of Entel of vital importance, so it has invited a dozen foreign business executives representing Korean Telecom, AT&T (of the United States), GTE Corporation, France Telecom, Titan Corp., and Telefonica de Espana to become familiar with the process and with the company's potential. In addition, the Sectoral Law on Communications, the Law on Regulatory and Arbitration Bodies, and amendments to the tax provisions of Law 843 are now being drafted. Book Value According to accounting records from previous fiscal years, Entel should sell for $141 million to $200 million, but the consulting firm will release the official information after appraising the company's assets and liabilities. National Railway Enterprise The National Railway Enterprise (Enfe) has already begun the capitalization process in an effort to strengthen the transportation system and provide more efficient service to the public, in hauling freight, and in import and export activities. It is also in the process of reorganizing its assets and liabilities and studying the Railroad Law that will regulate its activities with a view to making the railroad company more attractive to foreign investors. Excess Workers a Problem One of the problems that will hinder capitalization is the large number of superfluous personnel. In 1985, there were 7,199 employees, but layoffs have brought that figure down to about 4,000. This total is not ideal, said Revollo, because the company cannot support that many employees. He explained that this matter will be negotiated during the capitalization process.
