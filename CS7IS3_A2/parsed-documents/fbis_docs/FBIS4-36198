FBIS4-36198 "drnes109_r_94005" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 India Opposition: GATT Not `An Issue' in By-Elections Opposition: GATT Not `An Issue' in By-Elections BK0606123594 Delhi THE ECONOMIC TIMES in English 1 Jun 94 p 1 BK0606123594 Delhi THE ECONOMIC TIMES English BFN [Text] New Delhi 31 May -- Even as the heat and dust raised by the campaigning for the seven Lok Sabha and 10 assembly seats has subsided, the outcome has given rise to a new debate in the political circles with the various parties discussing whether the GATT treaty was an issue or not in Thursday's `trial of strength'. The provocation for this has come from the Congress(I) which was quick to term its success in winning five of the seven Lok Sabha seats that were at stake as popular endorsement of the government's signing the multilateral trade pact. The party's official spokesman, Mr V N Gadgil, fired the first salvo in this regard when he asserted on Monday that the success of the Congress(I) represented a definite rejection of the Opposition's "propaganda" on GATT. To buttress his point, Mr Gadgil stressed the fact that all the constituencies which went the Congress(I) way happened to be rural ones and that it clearly showed that the people in the countryside have not bought the Opposition's charge of sell-out by the government. While the Opposition parties are not as elated as the Congress(I), they nevertheless are not ready to let Mr Gadgil's claim go uncontested. "Who said GATT was an electoral issue," snapped the Janata Dal leader, Mr Jaipal Reddy when asked to react on Mr Gadgil's assertion. He reeled off detailed statistics to substantiate his contention. "The Congress(I) has not wrested any seat but retained the 5 seats and that too with reduced margins. In UP [Uttar Pradesh], Bihar and Tamil Nadu, which account for 178 Lok Sabha seats, the Congress(I) has come third or fourth. In fact, they have been losing in these states since 1989," the leader of the Janata Dal said. Mr Reddy further argued that "if anything, the results only show a steady decline of Congress(I)'s influence and the premise that their stand on Gatt stood vindicated was clearly wrong." Mr Sitaram Yechury, member of the CPI(M) [Communist Party of India -- Marxist] politburo, was equally dismissive of Mr Gadgil's contention. "A bogus claim" was how Mr Yechury described the Congress(I)'s statement. "The return of 5 sitting MPs and that too with vastly reduced margins can hardly be described as an index of Congress(I)'s popularity and in no case a popular vindication of its stand on Gatt". Significantly, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], which is pulling in a different direction than the left parties and the Janata Dal on a host of issues, seems to be for a change in agreement with them at least on this one. Mr K N Govindacharya, party's general secretary, hotly disputed the claim of Mr Gadgil. According to him, the elections were not contested on any specific issue like GATT. "The agenda this time was scattered and varied from place to place with the local issues dominating." The BJP leader went to the extent of calling it an issueless election. Questioning Mr Gadgil's interpretation of his party's performance, Mr Govindacharya was of the opinion that the victory of the ruling party in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh had more to do with the `honeymoon factor' than anything else. For his part, however, Mr Gadgil remains totally unfazed. Asked to comment on the arguments put forward by the Opposition parties the Congress(I)'s spokesman said that the "Opposition did make the GATT an issue in the by-polls. In fact, if there was one issue they chose to highlight all over, it was GATT and nothing else." He also remains unimpressed by the opinion in the political circles that the Congress(I) did not perform too well in West Bengal where the CPI(M) had really done its best to use the Union government's stand on GATT as its principal weapon against the Congress(I). The debate is likely to intensify further, especially when the government brings forward in Parliament the legislations it needs to enact for complying with its obligations under the GATT agreement. And if the Congress(I) is hoping that the outcome would make the Opposition parties relent on their stand, it is certain that its expectations may not quite materialise.
