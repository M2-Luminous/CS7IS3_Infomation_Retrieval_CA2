A Qualitatively New Point Has Been Reached in the Russian-Latvian Talks"] [Text] Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, told KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that the 7 February meeting with Martins Virsis, his Latvian colleague, was highly productive. It makes it possible to say that we are approaching a qualitatively new point in the talks, since one of the most difficult problems -- the period of operation of the radar station at Skrunda after the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia -- has been removed. An accord was reached at the level of the delegations that the radar station will be retained for four more years, with 18 months being allocated thereafter to dismantle it. The delegation heads believe that all other questions could also be resolved in the very near future. Thus, Sergey Zotov stated, if in the very near future the Latvian Government approves the accord that has been reached on the radar station, then the way will be opened up to signing an entire package of treaties and agreements connected with the troop withdrawal. As is known, Russia links the signing of the main treaty on the troop withdrawal with agreement on the radar station and on social protection for military pensioners. An accord has been reached on the Skrunda installation, and a second agreement is practically ready, although a number of recent statements by the Russian foreign minister on questions of relations with the Baltic countries have caused the Latvian Government to waver on certain points of the agreement, but in Sergey Zotov's opinion, this is still no reason to jeopardize the whole package of treaties and agreements that have been worked out. It will obviously become clear whether or not this is so as early as 14-17 February in Riga, where the next round of the Russian-Latvian talks will be held. Talking with Sergey Zotov, I could not fail to touch on the fact of the reelection of Andrejs Rucs, who was to blame for the 10 January incident involving two Russian generals, to the post of chief of the council of Riga's Vidzeme suburb. "In this connection we expressed concern to the head of the Latvian state delegation," Sergey Zotov replied. "He informed us that the republic General Prosecutor's Office is submitting for the Saeima's consideration a corresponding proposal to create a legal basis for Rucs' removal from the post and the institution of criminal proceedings."
