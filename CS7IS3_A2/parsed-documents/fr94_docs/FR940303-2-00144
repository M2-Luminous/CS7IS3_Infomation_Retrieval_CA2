FR940303-2-00144 FR940303-2-00077 [Release No. 34&hyph;33671; File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;13] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating to An Increase in the Fixed Net Debit Cap Employed in the Depository Trust Company's Same-Day Funds Settlement System February 23, 1994. On December 1, 1993, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;13) under section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 to increase the fixed net debit cap employed in DTC's same-day funds settlement (``SDFS'') system. Notice of the proposal was published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1994. 2 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33457 (January 11, 1994), 59 FR 2887. I. Description For each participant, DTC establishes a net debit cap in its SDFS system 3 in order to assure that DTC's liquidity resources are sufficient to complete settlement if an SDFS participant fails to settle its net debit obligation. Each participant's net debit in the SDFS system is limited throughout the processing day by a net debit cap that is the lesser of: (1) The adjustable net debit cap, which is a multiple of the participant's deposits to the SDFS participants fund, or (2) the fixed net debit cap. 4 The fixed net debit cap is set at 75% of: (1) the aggregate cash deposits to the SDFS participants fund and (2) DTC's internal and external lines of credit. The fixed net debit cap is currently set at $387 million. 3 For a detailed description of DTC's SDFS system, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26051 (August 31, 1988), 53 FR 34852 (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;88&hyph;06) (order granting permanent approval of the SDFS system). 4 As of February 15, 1994, there were 238 participants in the SDFS program. The fixed net debit cap is the operative cap for twenty-two of these SDFS participants. Telephone conversation between Carl H. Urist, Deputy General Counsel, DTC, and Peter R. Geraghty, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission (February 15, 1994). DTC has on deposit approximately 72% of the commercial paper (``CP'') outstanding in the U.S. and expects that virtually all CP outstanding in the U.S., except CP that is in direct issuers' proprietary book-entry systems, will be included in DTC's CP program sometime in 1994. With the anticipated increase in volume of commercial paper settlements in its SDFS system, DTC is concerned that the fixed net debit cap at its current level could have the undesirable effect of temporarily blocking substantial numbers of book-entry deliveries. To prevent such occurrences, DTC has decided to increase its external committed lines of credit by $250 million in order to raise the fixed net debit cap of SDFS participants that elect to share DTC's cost of obtaining the increase in the external lines of credit. The $250 million increase in external lines of credit should raise the fixed net debit to approximately $574 million. DTC believes that the securities resources available to it to collateralize any borrowing it should have to make under the increased external lines of credit are more than adequate. 5 5 DTC's line of credit agreements provide that any borrowing may be collateralized by securities in the account of a failing participant as well as by securities that have been deposited by DTC participants to the SDFS participants fund. On February 1, 1994, deposits to the SDFS participants fund included securities having a market value of approximately $627 million. Letter from Richard B. Nesson, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, DTC, to Jonathan Kallman, Associate Director, Division, Commission (February 1, 1994). II. Discussion Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible. 6 The Commission previously acknowledged the risk reduction benefits of the net debit cap in the order granting permanent approval of DTC's CP program. 7 The Commission continues to believe that the net debit cap is a integral part of the risk reduction measures taken by DTC to protect the securities and funds in its SDFS system. 6 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). 7 For a detailed description and discussion of the SDFS system and the CP program's risk controls, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30986 (July 31, 1992), 57 FR 35856 (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;92&hyph;01) (order approving implementation of CP program). Section 17A(b)(3)(F) also requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that increasing the fixed net debit cap should help promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in the SDFS system by decreasing the possibility that book-entry deliveries could be temporarily blocked from processing due to a participant exceeding its fixed net debit cap. III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, of section 17A of the Act in particular, and of the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 8 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;13) be, and hereby is, approved. 8 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 9 9 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
