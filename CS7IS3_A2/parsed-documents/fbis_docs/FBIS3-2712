Preparations have started, according to Vice-President of the CAS Psychology Institute Zhang Kan today. He said that the new project will help psychologists from the two countries to carry out psychology research from different cultural contexts, and study psychological problems of common interest. The official said that 14 cooperation projects have been listed, and others are being negotiated. With China's reform and opening up, Chinese psychologists have done a lot to promote cooperation with their American counterparts. In 1993, the CAS Psychology Institute sent 15 scientists abroad for international cooperation and received 21 prominent overseas colleagues. Chinese Mainland psychologists visited Taiwan in September last year for the first time since 1949. The Department of Psychology of the University of Michigan is one of the largest in the U.S.
