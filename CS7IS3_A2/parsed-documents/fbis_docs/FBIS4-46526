Savenkov, director of the Russian Federal Employment Service's "Intellectual Resources" interregional center, by Inna Rozanova; date and place of interview not stated: "If You Have No Job You Cannot Lose It" -- first paragraph is introduction; passages between slantlines are Rozanova insertions] [Text] The clan of defense monsters accustomed to a comfortable existence at the state's expense has found itself in the clutches of conversion. The panic over the absence of orders for research and development and production reigns not only in the top echelons of the military-industrial complex leadership. Highly qualified cadres -- society's intellectual elite and virtuoso workers -- have found themselves unemployed. A. Savenkov, director of the Russian Federal Employment Service "Intellectual Resources" interregional center, tells the tale. [Rozanova] Aleksandr Valentinovich, in periods of social upheavals the Russian intelligentsia traditionally asks age-old questions: "Who is to blame?" and "what is to be done?" How would you answer the first question? [Savenkov] It is not the government, not any parties or legislative organs, but solely the leaders of the military-industrial complex enterprises who are to blame for the situation which has taken shape. The economic situation dictates its own laws. And, of course, one can name dozens of enterprises where the leaders perform miracles of heroism, saving the unique formations entrusted to them. A fine example is the capital's steel scientific research institute, which has now become a joint-stock company and continues to work for the defense industry. The collective headed by director Vladimir Shashkin has been able to face up to the market. [Rozanova] The concept of conversion has been in existence for a long time now.... [Savenkov] There are conceptual documents. But a concept is something unsteady, a subjective view of objective processes. It is not even a program, not a plan of measures, still less a law. What is needed is a law, a clear law down to the trivial details, so that when it is implemented the features of the country's sectors and regions can be considered. I myself am a supporter of swift, resolute actions and am entirely in favor of the transformations initiated by Yegor Gaydar. But the most complex thing is that each person, whether he is unemployed, a scientist or a millionaire, is a person, not a machine. So the law on conversion should first of all consider the realities of the person and only second should it consider the economic aspect of the problem. [Rozanova] Last year alone about 1.5 million people were laid off from defense production facilities. Are the unemployment growth rates in the defense industry high now? [Savenkov] By the end of last year the rate in the defense complex was lower. People are being misled into thinking that all financing problems will soon be resolved and state orders and credits will be issued. But that faith is leaving people. Another layoff of manpower from military-industrial complex enterprises is forecast. /From the newspaper's files According to the figures of the Russian Federal Employment Service as of early 1994: -- in "closed" cities every second unemployed person is aged 18-29 while throughout Russia as a whole young people make up one-third of the total number of unemployed; -- the unemployed who have been unable to find work for 12 months or more comprise 17.9 percent of the total number of unemployed in the "closed" cities. Throughout Russia as a whole this figure is considerably lower, to wit 12.9 percent./ [Rozanova] Well, is there any concealed unemployment -- switching to a part-time working day or week? [Savenkov] Yes, and this is now one way of preserving the cadres potential. The military-industrial complex knows that usually there are no more than five high-class specialists in a particular avenue of scientific research at the defense industry's enterprises and scientific research institutes and it is enough for two of them to "fall out of the nest" for the remaining three to be unable to do anything to ensure that the enterprise is not reduced to chaos and is not faced with the need to change its technological orientation, its sectorial direction, and its products list. But in general terms, relying on salvation with the aid of concealed unemployment is to hope that a soap bubble will last an eternity. [Rozanova] One of the main cadres problems of conversion is the loss of the level of skill of defense production workers. But there is also the opinion that, on the contrary, workers from military plants will have to improve their qualifications in order to learn to make teapots instead of missiles -- after all, these people were used to fulfilling orders on supermodern equipment while workers in civilian industry are literally working miracles on antiquated machine tools. [Savenkov] Paradoxical though it may seem, those deprived of their ultramodern equipment will have to be retrained: They will be unable to compete with workers on obsolete machine tools. And these people will have to summon up the courage to realize that nothing terrible has happened. The demands of the day -- to be prepared to change your profession and undergo retraining -- will enable people to survive in the most difficult situation. Another characteristic of the current period is the education of the population in the spirit of professional mobility. So they do not try to chain themselves to the city or settlement where their nearest and dearest are buried, where they have developed friendships with colleagues, or even where they have family. People must be taught to move around in search of work -- in order to save their families, their friendships, and even their cities or settlements. [Rozanova] Outstanding specialists, once preoccupied with defense topics, are now free to think and work. Many of them have decided to change their lifestyle, setting up small businesses, for example, based on their departments or design bureaus, and without demanding massive credits from the state. But can you say that small businesses are a solution? [Savenkov] They are one of the most effective and honest ways out of the present grim situation. They are a way of helping people not lose their skills, but retain them for better days. But some leaders are finding it difficult to take such steps, because it deprives them of their power monopoly. They are clinging to power to the bitter end and are even refusing to lease premises and equipment to their own people and are not registering small businesses, and this is a bad policy by bad leaders. What would I recommend? Under the guidance of the administration, conclude articles of association with small businesses based on departments or design bureaus, so that when the "light at the end of the tunnel" appears, all this potential will work for the benefit of the mother enterprise. Not allowing premises and equipment to be privatized, but leasing them out. /From the newspaper's files According to the figures of the Russian Federal Employment Service, as of 1 January 1994 in the "closed" cities the proportion of unemployed people with higher and secondary specialized education was 53.2 percent of the total number of unemployed, while for Russia as a whole this indicator was much lower -- 37.9 percent./ [Rozanova] The mono-cities are literally on the brink of extinction now.... [Savenkov] The mono-cities are the result of the GULAG principle in the building of our society. There are two diametrically opposed options for resolving the problem. The first is a dead city which all the people have left and where all the windows are broken, which, incidentally, is not uncommon abroad. The second option is that the state shrugs aside all principles and market laws and simply provides the money to feed these people. The best option of all is that of compromise. I think the first thing the administration should do in each city is to make an inventory of manpower resources in conjunction with the employment service. Usually, the employment service's team of experts consists of leading specialists in the sphere of economics, law, business, sociology, and psychology, and as a rule the group is able to make a diagnosis within a week. Then, with the active participation of the local trade union and administration, the working people should be briefed on the situation the enterprise is in and on what could happen if this or that path is taken. They should be asked what other jobs they could do. What other speciality are they prepared to be retrained in? [Rozanova] And what is your view of the problem of the "nuclear brain drain" abroad? [Savenkov] If you think about it, what exactly are we trying to ban? The spread of knowledge on the most efficient and ecologically clean form of energy, which resembles in its parameters the energy of the sun, wind, and tides? If it is a question of weapons, that is a problem for the politicians. But let us not drag into political battles scientists who can find a solution to practically any problem if the finance is available. If there is a financially advantageous order to be had, even if it is directed against humanity, people will always be found who will carry it out. The fight should be against the "clients for death," not the engineers and workers. And what if you look at the "brain drain" the other way round? If the transplantation of specialists to other countries is regarded as aid to neighbors, as a friendly act? This will help our country's science too. After working for a given period, our specialists will come home rich and happy. [Rozanova] Judging by your answers to my questions, the "Intellectual Resources" center has done good theoretical work. But has it yielded a practical return? [Savenkov] Of course. We are testing our theory at about 10 settlements in Moscow Oblast -- in the cities of Zhukovskiy, Odintsovo, Fryazino, Balashikha, Kaliningrad, Pushkino, Pavlovo-Posada, and Dubna, and the settlement of Kurovskoye in Orekhovo-Zuyevskiy Rayon. For instance, at the "Istok" enterprise which is undergoing conversion in the science city of Fryazino, in less than six weeks this year, with active financial and organizational assistance from Viktor Ponomarev, director of the Moscow Oblast Employment Center, more than 50 new jobs for women were created, for the "Istok" employees who had been subject to cuts and for the unemployed people of the city of Fryazino. A line was installed and production started up for the production of Russian-designed hearing aids at "Istok" in record time. /From the newspaper's files According to the figures of the Russian Federal Employment Service: -- In the first quarter of 1994 in Russia as a whole the number of unemployed increased 29.7 percent, whereas in the "closed" cities it increased 22.8 percent. -- As of 1 April 1994 in Russia as a whole there were 4.7 unemployed citizens for every vacancy registered with the employment service. In the "closed" cities this indicator was, on average, 4.1./ [Rozanova] All the same, can we end our conversation today on an optimistic note? [Savenkov] We not only can, but should. Because Russia is still here, whether people like it or not. Russia is an unsinkable cruiser, and no storms will make it sink to the bottom of history.
