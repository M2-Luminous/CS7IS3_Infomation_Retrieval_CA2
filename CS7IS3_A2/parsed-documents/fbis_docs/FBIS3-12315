His majesty the king had spearheaded a nationwide fundraising campaign and donated 100,000 dinars to support the families of the Palestinians killed by the Jewish settler. The government announced a similar donation in addition to private donations from cabinet ministers, civil servants, deputies, and senators. Three popular fundraising committees reported warm public response to calls for helping the victims' families. Amman Mayor Mamduh al-'Abbadi, who heads a popular committee helping the Palestinians, said it would give 1,000 dinars to each of the families of Palestinians killed in the mosque and the ensuing violence. He said the committee would also give 300 dinars to families of the Palestinians injured in the mosque massacre.
