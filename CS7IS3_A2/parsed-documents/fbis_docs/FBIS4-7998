A radio bridge with Gorazde has been organized for foreign and domestic reporters in Sarajevo this afternoon. Our reporter Mediha Colo listened to the radio bridge and prepared the following reportage: [Begin recording] [Colo] Riad Rasic, president of the Gorazde district assembly; Esad Orhanovic, president of the Gorazde district executive council; and Alija Begovic, director of the Gorazde war hospital, were answering the questions of domestic and foreign reporters via radio link. Riad Rasic, president of the Gorazde district assembly, gave a brief [word indistinct] of the latest situation in Gorazde. [passage omitted] [Rasic] The situation is also difficult in the hospital, regarding the number of beds, accommodation space, lack of medication, and so forth. At 0800, that is to say, from the beginning of the offensive until 0800 this morning 67 people have died and 325 have been injured. Of these, 10 were children and 19 women and older people, while 38 children and 49 women have been injured. [passage omitted] [Colo] One of the reporters' questions referred to the critical line on the right bank of the Drina River in the vicinity of Vidkovic and the aggressor's current intentions. [Rasic] Yes, the lines have been consolidated a little there and most probably we will hear better news from Gorazde. Ferocious battles are being fought in that direction and our defenders are holding well, therefore, we can expect better news from that part, which is the only [word indistinct] at this moment, as all other lines are holding (?extremely) well. [passage omitted] [Colo] Alija Begovic, director of the Gorazde hospital, answered questions about the situation in the Gorazde war hospital. Dr. Begovic said the following about the most urgent requirements of the Gorazde hospital: [Begovic] In brief, we need sanitary articles, [word indistinct] material, gauze, bandages, and powerful analgesics. Regarding [word indistinct], also surgical implements, string, certain substances to stop bleeding such as [word indistinct] or similar. We have not had oxygen for a year and a half almost, we had it only at the beginning for a short while. Therefore, we do not even have oxygen for [word indistinct] and, therefore, I cannot even talk about this. We more or less have the most basic antibiotics, therefore, we (?need more sophisticated) antibiotics for bone infections and so forth, we lack this. Then, [words indistinct] in the present situation when there is a great number of injuries. Otherwise, we suffer constant shortages of medication for chronic patients, for example, eye patients with glaucoma, for patients with diseases of the thyroid gland, patients in need of cancer therapy, and so forth. Regarding blood plasma, we have not received any. However, since we have a marvelous response of volunteer blood donors, mostly women, who at any moment... [pauses] It has not happened yet that we would not have enough of any blood type, therefore, we more or less supplement blood with blood and we use very little blood plasma. Actually, at the beginning when we had some we used it for a while but now not any more. I must say that the number of medical staff in Gorazde has been cut down to a third of that before the war, therefore, far below the requirements. The scope and the type of work [words indistinct]. There never was a hospital, a surgical department, and this secondary aspect of medical care here. There are really very few physicians and we all do three or four jobs at once. [Colo] According to the information that we have obtained via the radio bridge, the latest offensive at Gorazde resulted in the number of refugees in this town increasing by 2,000.
