Hong indicated a decision soon on canceling South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise "Team Spirit," saying the two countries will consult on the matter. Widespread speculation is that the two countries will announce the cancellation around the time the IAEA inspection team begins activities in North Korea. "This is only a beginning," said Hong after welcoming North Korea's decision to accept IAEA inspections after nearly a one-year break. "But to completely resolve the situation, North Korea must accept special inspection on its two undeclared facilities, fully return to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), and implement inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization," he said. Hong repeated earlier position by Seoul and Washington that North Korea must reopen inter-Korean dialogue before the United States will hold next round of high-level talks with it. "There are many issues to be settled through South-North Korea dialogue," the vice foreign minister said. The dialogue is not necessarily linked to the outcome of IAEA inspections, to begin as early as this week, he said, "the talks can be held before or after the results are out."
