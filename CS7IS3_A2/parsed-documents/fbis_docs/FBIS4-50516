Answer [A]: The reform in the preceding stage was only a policy readjustment characterized by delegating power and conceding benefits. The enthusiasm mobilized through this reform was limited. Simultaneously, this reform also brought about some short-term activities and some other problems. Enterprises had no effective mechanisms for restriction of property rights because state-owned assets lacked definite personified representatives. The fundamental way for solving these problems is to reform the enterprise property right system and to set up a modern enterprise system. Carrying out the shareholding system among state-owned enterprises is an important form to set up the modern enterprise system as well as a fundamental orientation for deepening the enterprise reform. Through the implementation of the shareholding system, we can not only collect funds for enterprises to make development but also help change the enterprise managerial mechanism. Q: What targets shall we attain by setting up the modern enterprise system? A: The targets that we will attain by setting up the modern enterprise system are as follows: First, the relations of property rights will be clear. The state-owned assets of enterprises belong to the state. Enterprises possess the property rights of the whole legal persons which are composed of the investors, including the state. Second, enterprises with the property owned by the whole legal persons will be independent for management, assume sole responsibility for profits or losses, pay taxes according to regulations, and hold themselves responsible to the investors in guaranteeing and increasing the assets. Investors enjoy the rights and interests of owners according to the amounts of the investment they have made. Third, the system of separating government functions from enterprise management will be carried out. Fourth, an enterprise leadership system and an organizational managerial system will be set up. A managerial mechanism of linking encouragement with restriction should take shape. Q: What achievements and experiences has our province made and gained in carrying out the shareholding system? A: In 1993, our province had 535 shareholding enterprises (excluding shareholding cooperative enterprises,) an increase of 640 percent over the figure in 1992; 135 limited companies, an increase of 575 percent; and 400 limited liability companies, an increase of 670 percent. The value of shares totaled 15.847 billion yuan, an increase of 487 percent over the figure in 1992. By carrying out the shareholding system, enterprises collected more than four billion yuan of funds from society (excluding the shareholders as legal persons.) Our province is among the best in the whole country in terms of the number of shareholding enterprises and the value of total shares. The newly organized shareholding enterprises have high enthusiasm and more flexible managerial mechanisms. These enterprises are full of vitality and become more prosperous by bringing into play the advantages of independent management and sufficient capital. The investigations on 100 enterprises made by a provincial-level organ last July showed that only 10 percent of the enterprises were full of vitality and three types of foreign-funded enterprises, town and township enterprises, and shareholding enterprises accounted for a larger proportion. Practice showed that the shareholding system has advantages. The shareholding system, as a kind of managerial mechanism, has a long-standing history. However, it has been regarded as a form of the modern enterprise system in China only for several years. In a sense, the shareholding system is comparatively strange to us in terms of theory and practice. Through the practice over the past years, we have made some theoretical breakthroughs, gained some experiences, grasped some things of regularity, and created some new ways for changing the managerial mechanism. Q: Do you think any problems exist in the trial implementation of the shareholding system? A: First, the shareholding rights are set up in a plural and complicated way. There are shares held by the state, legal persons, the masses in society, and the staff and workers of enterprises as well as A-shares, B-shares, and H-shares. But, the shareholders with the same amounts of shares are not guaranteed to enjoy the same rights, gain the same profits, run the same risks, and assume the same responsibilities. All this affects the normal operation of the stock markets and the shareholding system. Second, speaking from a macroeconomic point of view, we know that the stock markets throughout the country have a limited capacity. Speaking from a microeconomic point of view, we know that supply exceeds demand on the stock markets. The stock markets are slump, and the stock price levels fall. All this is not well coordinated with the national economic development situation, enterprises' achievements, and the price hike tendency. The people ideologically pay more attention speculation to the neglect of investment. Therefore, speculation activities exist in the deals on stock markets. But, we must regard the long- and medium-term investment as the foundation and take the industrial policies into consideration. 3. We pay excessively more attention to the collection of funds to the neglect of the change of managerial mechanisms. 4. Viewing the overall situation, we know that the legislative stagnation affects the sound development of the stock markets and the shareholding system. 5. There are no sufficient talented persons with the ability in standardizing the operation of the shareholding system and publicly distributing stocks. Q: What plans for the trial implementation of the shareholding system does the province have in 1994? A: In 1994, we should put the trial implementation of the shareholding system in the overall situation of setting up the modern enterprise system and the socialist market economic system, standardize the system strictly according to the "law governing companies," develop it in the course of standardization, and standardize it in the course of development. Specifically speaking, we should consolidate and improve limited companies (including the companies whose shares are listed,) positively develop limited liability companies, and vigorously carry out the shareholding system. 1. We should conscientiously sum up the experiences in carrying out the shareholding system on a trial basis gained in the preceding stage and conscientiously examine the situation in the operation of the limited companies where reform has been carried out so as to standardize these companies and set up brand-new shareholding enterprise management and operation mechanisms; with the focus on defining the limits of duties and the work procedures for boards of directors, boards of supervisors, shareholders congresses, general managers, party committees, and trade unions; and to make the shareholding enterprises be worthy of the name. 2. It is necessary to carry out, on a trial basis, the system where enterprises' property is "owned by the state and the property rights are wholly sold to the enterprises themselves." We should start from balancing the relations of property rights to establish main operators for the management of state-owned assets. According to the forms of "state ownership and commissioned management" and "state ownership and enterprise management," we should establish limited liability companies with the "rights to management of state-owned property." 3. We should carry out the shareholding cooperative management system. On the basis of checking up on assets, evaluating assets, and defining property rights and according to the standards for the shareholding system, we should conduct reform among collective enterprises and some small state-owned enterprises. The assets of former enterprises are converted into stocks according to relevant regulations, staff members and workers are allowed to be shareholders, and new enterprise organizational system and new managerial entities should be set up so that enterprises will become new managers that assume responsibility for their own profits, run risks, and undertake limited responsibilities. 4. The departments concerned under the governments should positively attend to the setup of intermediate organizations and provide high-quality service for stock markets and the shareholding system. 5. We should strengthen theoretical research and media propaganda on stock markets and the shareholding system, cultivate skilled persons, accurately give guidance, and ensure the smooth development of stock markets and the shareholding system.
