The Panamanian negotiator presented an analysis to the members of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Panama on the "Negotiation of Panama's Incorporation into GATT" which concludes that the Panamanian service sector receives too much protection. The expert emphasized that the service sector receives too much protection [sentence as published]. He explained that according to the analysis, the service sector is protected in two ways: the prohibition of retail sales and the protection of various professions, which means that a large portion of trade and services are protected from foreign competition. Gonzalez Ramirez added that state monopolies of services such as electricity, ports, water, and communications are also protected. The official said that Panama's incorporation into GATT will provide great benefits, but entry requires that the country grant some concessions such as the gradual elimination of export tariffs [aranceles a la exportacion]. Gonzalez Ramirez explained the main benefits of GATT membership: For the first time Panama will have a foreign trade strategy; exports will be based on the security of law; and market opening negotiations for our products will be held, especially for services. He also indicated that the fiscal exemptions granted on the basis of laws that promote industry and agriculture represent unearned income for the treasury estimated at 150 million balboas. Since 1947 Panama has participated as an observer in the GATT negotiation rounds, but according to Gonzalez Ramirez, there was no real interest in joining the organization because "we are not an exporting country." Panama currently meets all requirements set forth by that organization for membership. Regarding the Uruguay Round negotiations, Gonzalez Ramirez stated that tariffs on industrial goods in industrialized countries will fall by more than one-third, and more than 40 percent of imports will have free rates [tasas libres]. Meanwhile, trade distortions due to subsidies and import barriers must be reduced in six years. Domestic subsidies for agriculture will be reduced by 20 percent. Subsidized exports will be cut by 36 percent in value and volume. All import barriers will be converted into tariffs and must be reduced by some 36 percent. In the meantime, the United States has asked Panama to join the Multilateral Trade Agreement and pass the bill on intellectual property rights, which are key requirements for a free trade agreement between the countries.
