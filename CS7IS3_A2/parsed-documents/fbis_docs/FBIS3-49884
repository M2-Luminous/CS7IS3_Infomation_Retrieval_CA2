[Klaus] Partnership for Peace, as a global concept, does not say anything about the frequency of contacts between individual countries and NATO. This will be a matter for the next stage -- the conclusion of specific treaties between NATO and the individual countries that want to join the Partnership. Only then will the scope and intensity of this cooperation be specified. Undoubtedly, there will be major differences between countries. Undoubtedly, the Czech Republic's interests will be different than those of Kazakhstan. Therefore, let us not jump the gun. Nevertheless, it is evident that the financial aspect will play a role here. Of course, to assume that this will lead to an increase in our expenditure on defense is unrealistic. [Krasnicky] Have you seen the actual text of Partnership for Peace? [Klaus] I have seen it in the form of a xeroxed fax, but I think that, at the moment, there is no need to hurry. The Foreign Ministry will submit the appropriate material to the government at the appropriate time and will also draft a response to the North Atlantic Alliance. [Krasnicky] There has been talk recently about citizenship for the Volhynian Czechs and Czechs from Kazakhstan have shown an interest in returning to the republic. What is the reason behind the government's caution in dealing with these issues? [Klaus] The main reason for the caution was -- and, to a certain extent, still is -- our attempt not to complicate the internal situation in the Czech Republic by unexpected and excessive migration. This was a topical issue mainly during the breakup of Czechoslovakia. At that time, we required unambiguous and precise conditions so that, in the individual human sphere, we could clearly determine who was a citizen of the Czech Republic and who was a citizen of Slovakia. On the other hand, a few individuals -- whether Volhynian Czechs or anyone else -- are really extreme cases that do not cause any major problems in our country. The principal caution was not directed against them. [Krasnicky] The government will draw up a concept for the jurisdiction of the future regions or lands before the end of January. Why do you think the law on this jurisdiction has to be a constitutional law? In the opinion of some experts, jurisdiction should be a variable and not something preserved by a constitutional law.... [Klaus] Jurisdiction is a terribly important issue and -- as we saw once within the framework of the Czechoslovak state -- was the explosive that constantly destabilized relations between the partners. We do not want anything like this to happen in the united and unitary Czech Republic; we do not want to introduce any federalistic and autonomistic elements into it. On the contrary, I would again say that a constitutional law is not necessary to change the border, for example, between south Bohemia and central Bohemia because of a single zigzagging stream whose flow has changed.
