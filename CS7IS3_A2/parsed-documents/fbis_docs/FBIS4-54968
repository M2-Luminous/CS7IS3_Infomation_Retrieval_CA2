Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) Acting Chairman Leszak had the guts to declare, while visiting the sovereign Slovak Republic, that Hungarians are being denied their basic rights in Slovakia. His colleague from the same ruling party even said that covert and almost overt ethnic cleansing was taking place in Slovakia. Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) Chairman Horn, who is counting on electoral victory, and the chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), who is also counting on becoming prime minister, were more diplomatic. But all of them had one characteristic in common: They came here to score points, that is, to play in the election campaign the card of the Hungarian ethnic minority. Although gentlemen from the MDF were the most unscrupulous in playing this card, even in Hungary not everyone wants confrontation with their northern neighbor, particularly at a time when the Balkans are in flames and the conflict there is quite close. That is why Prime Minister Boross also had to score points, but, alas, not in the sense of holding much-needed businesslike and level-headed talks with Bratislava with the aim of concluding agreements accommodating both sides. One has to openly admit that Boross and the entire MDF did score points at the meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik on Sunday [1 May], a meeting that had already been written off because Budapest was not interested in telling the public anything about it. The MDF, which, with the support of 8 to 12 percent of voters, has found itself in fourth place in the preelection opinion polls, now has a chance of gaining more votes in the elections. It will be assisted by our infinite servility, which was coupled in Komarom and Komarno with naivete. This was confirmed by Boross himself when he said after his talks with Moravcik that he "considered the meeting significant for him personally from the long-term point of view." While Horn (MSZP) and Kuncze (SZDSZ) had at least given Moravcik a formal pledge that they would confirm the inviolability of the Slovak-Hungarian border when they became head of government, Boross was far from mentioning anything of that sort. And he was even given the assurance that the Slovak Government would not link the opening of several border crossings with the signing of a readmission treaty [providing for the repatriation of illegal immigrants]. Slovakia, particularly its southern part, could then become a real huge promenade.... The aims of the Hungarian politicians, particularly those who aspire to being future rulers, are obvious. But what, for God's sake, was the aim of our government and, in particular, its head, who eagerly swallows every Hungarian bait? Supposedly, we should show the world that we are acting as good neighbors. Every garden and family home owner or tenant surely appreciates good relations with his neighbor. Good neighborly relations between states are of even much greater value. However, as always and everywhere, this must be the aim of both neighbors. Whenever Budapest has sought good relations to date, it did so only for propaganda reasons. We have the impression that Moravcik's government is doing the same thing -- it wants to prove that things work better without Meciar. Let us concede that they do. In this case, however, servility and naivete could backfire ruthlessly.
