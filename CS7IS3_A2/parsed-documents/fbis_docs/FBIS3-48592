Local timber merchants contacted by AFP said they still needed clearance, however, from the military commanders with jurisdiction over the areas where timber concessions are located. Dozens of people were given stiff jail sentences in connection with shady deals uncovered during the investigation by military intelligence, highlighted in the state-owned press. But local observers noted that prices for timber and wood-based fuel had risen in the wake of the clampdown. Charcoal, used widely for cooking, now costs more than 500 kyats per basket, or around 12 kyats per pound -- almost three times the cost to consumers previously, the observers said. A would-be house-owner cited a similar rise: "I'm suddenly having to pay for my building material almost triple the prices of just three months ago." Under a new forest law promulgated in 1992, which strictly limits extraction of timber for commercial purposes, Burma -- which owns nearly 75 percent of the world's teak reserves -- said it intended to preserve its forest resources. The law required private timber merchants to apply for official permits through a competitive bidding system which was intended to encourage private sector investment in the industry while curbing illegal logging. But reports of widespread malpractice involving timber businessmen, abetted by corrupt officials, triggered a sudden halt to logging in November and the official investigation. Thousands of tons of illicit logs were seized and an unspecified number of smugglers and corrupt government officials were identified. A recent report in the official NEW LIGHT OF MYANMAR cited the example of 11 timber merchants and as many forest department employees who were sentenced this month by a special court in Rangoon to seven years in jail for illegal logging, smuggling and bribery. The daily said the government had recovered cash and assets which were declared state property. The money collected paid largely for a state-of-the-art multi-million-dollar international business center on the shores of Rangoon's Inya Lake. At its recent inauguration, a senior forestry official said the center had cost the state "next to nothing." "We constructed the building practically cost-free because all the expenses were paid for with fines and penalties slapped on timber merchants, both foreign and local, caught cheating us," he said, adding that the illegal logs confiscated had also gone a long way to defraying the costs. The official disclosed that one foreign logging company caught red-handed not only had to pay a hefty fine but was charged double for logs already extracted, even though the wood was of the "unreserved species." Reliable sources said meanwhile that some logging concessions had been given a three-month extension for extraction if companies paid stiff fines and double charges to take out the logs.
