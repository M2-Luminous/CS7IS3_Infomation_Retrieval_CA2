This was stated by Estonian Foreign Minister Indrek Kannik [title as received] at the airport today after his return from Israel. During a week-long trip he had also visited Luxembourg and France. Kannik announced that Estonia needed electronic systems for surveillance over its marine and land borders in order to ensure its security. This issue was discussed during his visit to Israel on the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. France, Italy, and Sweden have also proposed that Estonia purchase their radio radar equipment. Kannik said a special working commission would make the final decision on the issue. However, the seller state will have to allot the appropriate credit to Estonia since its budget situation provided for no direct deal. Kannik stressed that in any case this would not be such a big contract as that of the last year concluded with the Taas Israeli company, which had sold to Estonia weaponry costing a total $49 million. Kannik repeated that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania had been given associated partner status in the Western European Union at the meeting of the defense and foreign ministers of this organization in Luxembourg. Kannik emphasized that on this issue the Western European Union made no difference between the Baltic states and Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Speaking on his visit to France, Kannik pointed to the agreement on cooperation between the French and Estonian defense ministers signed in Paris.
