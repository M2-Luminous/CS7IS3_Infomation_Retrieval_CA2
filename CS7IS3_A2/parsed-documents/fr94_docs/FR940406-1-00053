FR940406-1-00053 FR940406-1-00013 48 CFR Parts 15 and 52 [FAR Case 92&hyph;10] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Nonprofit Institutions Clause Prescription AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to revise the prescriptions for use of the clauses Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and Reversion or Adjustment of Plans for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and to clarify the language in the clauses. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before June 6, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;10 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeremy F. Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;10. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The wording of the prescriptions at 15.804&hyph;8 (e) and (f) currently implies that the clauses at 52.215&hyph;27, Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and 52.215&hyph;39, Reversion or Adjustment of Plans for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, should also be used in solicitations and contracts with noncommercial organizations. The clauses refer to the cost principles applicable to commercial organizations in FAR subpart 31.2, whereas OMB Circulars A&hyph;21, A&hyph;87, and A&hyph;122 contain the cost principles governing contracts with noncommercial organizations. In addition, the prescriptions currently contain dissimilar criteria concerning the use of the clauses in preaward or postaward cost situations. The proposed revisions to the prescriptions at 15.804&hyph;8 (e) and (f) will correct these inconsistencies and clarify when the clauses at 52.215&hyph;27 and 52.215&hyph;39 should be used. Additional revisions to the clauses clarify the requirements specified in them. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles do not apply. An analysis of data available for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 reveals that, in the Department of Defense, the number of contract actions awarded to small businesses which required the submission of cost or pricing data averaged less than 1 percent of the total number of small business actions during the three-year period. In addition, for other than small business entities, any impact on such entities is considered to flow from the respective cost principles contained in the governing OMB Circular ( i.e. , A&hyph;21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions; A&hyph;87, Cost Principles for State and Local Governments; and A&hyph;122, Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations). An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 92&hyph;10), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
