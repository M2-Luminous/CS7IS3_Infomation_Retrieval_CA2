He says that many Federation Council deputies came to Chekhov St. to pay their last respects to actor Yevgeniy Leonov. As there was no morning session the deputies had plenty of spare time. They spent the time holding the first organizational sessions of committees and commissions of the Federation Council. Whereas, he says, in the Duma, the Duma Council met and agreed on who would head the committees, these people were ratified by overall vote and then each deputy could register in one committee or another. On the other hand, here in the Federation Council it was different. First, the composition of the actual committees was formed, and then within these committees the deputies themselves elected their own chairmen. This is because a factional party principle does not operate in the Federation Council. There were some surprises, Ruvinskiy continues. Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy became chairman of the Agrarian Committee. He is director of the scientific production association Nizhnyaya Volga in Astrakhan. On this committee are such deputies as Vasiliy Starodubtsev, [Vyacheslav] Lyubimov from Ryazan, an active member of the Communist Party, and others. Today, the first session of the committee was held. The first session of the Committee for Budget and Finance was also held. On this committee, deputies elected Nikolay Gonchar as their chairman, former chairman of Mossovet. Also on this committee are such deputies as Yuriy Boldyrev, well-known from the Congress of USSR People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet. Ruvinskiy then speaks to Boldyrev. He says that Boldyrev told him that he considers one of his main tasks as being to do everything necessary to fight corruption. He thinks a chamber of accounts should be set up and there should be a law on responsibility of government members for nonimplementation of legislation and for inappropriate expenditure. Ruvinskiy and the announcer discuss the question of extending the emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia.
