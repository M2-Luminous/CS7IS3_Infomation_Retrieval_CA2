FBIS4-10367 "drlat070_r_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Peru Cuba's Robaina Comments on Returning to OAS Cuba's Robaina Comments on Returning to OAS PY1204030694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0039 GMT 12 Apr 94 PY1204030694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said today that Cuba will not raise any obstacles to returning to the OAS if the members ask for it. Cuba was expelled from the OAS in 1962 at the request of the United States. Cuba has taken a very harsh attitude since then to this organization, which it labeled the "U.S. Ministry of Colonies." Robaina said that "nothing can be evaluated in the same manner after 30 years," and that the Latin American countries also are not "under the same conditions they were three decades ago in relation to the OAS." Robaina added: "Independently of the fact that the United States remains the same, which is something I cannot evaluate, I believe Latin America is not the same as 30 years ago. Therefore, the OAS can be an organization where Latin Americans can discuss their problems in an open, frank, and sincere manner." He said: "If this is achieved by the OAS, by [Secretary General-elect] Gaviria, we would have nothing against it." In reference to an eventual return of his country to that Latin American forum, Robaina said his country "has nothing to negotiate" and also does not demand that Cuba be allowed to return. Robaina said: "We were unjustly expelled from it and we will return to it if voices emerge, like the ones now emerging, proposing the idea that the OAS must be with Cuba and not without Cuba." He said: "If that idea becomes a reality, my country will raise no obstacles." Regarding relations with Peru, Robaina said that "they are normal but we should strengthen them and not resign ourselves to historic relations," in allusion to the participation of Peruvians in the war for Cuban independence. He added: "Strengthening relations means agreements like the one we signed today, visits like this one, visits we expect to receive in Cuba, and trade and economic agreements to put our relations at that historic level." Robaina today signed with his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain Goldenberg, an agreement on customs cooperation and another on the struggle against drug trafficking. Before the meeting, Robaina met about 200 Peruvian businessmen whom he invited to invest in Cuba after explaining the incentives offered by his country for foreign investment. In the afternoon, Robaina was received by Jaime Yoshiyama, president of Congress and vice president of the Republic. Robaina also met Industry, Tourism, and Integration Minister Liliana Canale. Tomorrow Robaina will pursue private activities and on 13 April he will leave for Paraguay to continue his South American tour that started last week in Uruguay and includes Argentina.
