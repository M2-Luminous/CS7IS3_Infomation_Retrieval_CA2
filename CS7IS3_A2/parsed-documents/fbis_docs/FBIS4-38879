FBIS4-38879 "drsov107_d_94012" FBIS-SOV-94-107 Daily Report 30 May 1994 Regional Affairs Novosibirsk Oblast Procurator Interviewed Novosibirsk Oblast Procurator Interviewed 944F0763A Novosibirsk VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK in Russian 30 May 94 p 5 944F0763A Novosibirsk VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK Russian CSO [Interview with Novosibirsk Oblast Procurator Vladimir Tokarev by VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent Irina Timofeyeva; place and date not given: "The Procuracy Never Handed Out Gingerbread..."] [Text] Last year Novosibirsk Oblast Procuracy investigators referred to courts 869 criminal cases, of which more than half concerned premeditated murders. It oversees the investigation of more than 100,000 criminal cases. The procuracy filed with the courts 1,347 claims for compensation for damages; about 1,000 of them on behalf of the state, and the rest--on behalf of individuals. Over four months of this year 14 cases in the economic sphere alone, involving a total amount of 1.624 billion rubles [R], were referred to the arbitration court. Some of them have been considered and resolved. These figures were given to our correspondent at the oblast procuracy shortly before the date when this state body celebrated its 72d anniversary--counting only the Soviet period. I think it is more correct to count its age since the time of Peter the Great, who created the procuracy at the beginning of the 18th century. The anniversary provided a pretext for asking Novosibirsk Oblast Procurator Vladimir Vasilyevich Tokarev a few questions. [Timofeyeva] Recent events are such that one gets the impression that there are forces trying if not destroy then at least to weaken the Russian procuracy. [Tokarev] Our function is to uphold the laws currently in effect. The procuracy cannot be everybody's favorite because it has never handed out gingerbread. The wave of criticism over the past few years, some of which was fair, was inevitable considering our history. It is quite possible that not everybody is happy with the very existence of an oversight body. Remember, just recently it was only through Kazannik's incredible efforts that the article on the procuracy was literally rammed through in the new constitution. [Timofeyeva] What is actually happening with general procurators? What is the view from here, from the provinces? [Tokarev] I know no more than you do--mainly what I read in the press. My opinion is that Stepankov, although he was young when he came into this job, had already earned authority and respect by then. He turned out to be a mature leader and did much to preserve and strengthen the procuracy. Kazannik is a highly educated, intelligent, and decent man, but not versed in political games. His problem was that he looked at life from the university chair viewpoint. As to what is next--we will see... In principle, no matter who is at the top we have to carry out our duty here. [Timofeyeva] It is bad taste these days to quote Lenin. Still, I will take a chance and quote a famous phrase: "...there cannot be a Kaluga legality and a Kazan legality--there) should be one, all-Russia legality..." How topical is this idea today? [Tokarev] I would say it is very topical. We live in a rapidly developing society. The new constitution says that krays and oblasts have the right to carry out their own legal regulation, including adopting laws. Apparently in the desire to make full use of this right the oblast council adopted a plan for legislative work. It envisages the adoption of nearly 40 different laws and decrees over a short period of time. Without belittling in any way the merits and abilities of the new deputy corps, I will dare to voice a certain doubt. I think that some deputies have a somewhat simplistic idea of the lawmaking process. The adoption of any law, even one limited to the oblast, requires quite lengthy and painstaking work. Another example. Currently the oblast administration, concerned at the way the situation is developing, is preparing a number of documents on matters of combating crime, stabilizing the economic situation, and others. Looking at some of them brings one to the conclusion that the authors attempt to resolve the accumulated problems by strong-arm, proscriptive methods, disregarding first of all current federal legislation. It is not good when each rayon begins to write its own "constitution." We, at least, do not expect an easy life. [Timofeyeva] This means that the role of your agency will grow. And what are your relations with the judiciary? In particular, with respect to appeals on arrests? [Tokarev] We have normal businesslike relations. Over more or less the past year and a half we have been preparing our staff for the competitiveness of the process, since the procurator's role in court will be somewhat different. With respect to appeals of arrests, a law has been adopted and it has to be complied with. There can be no argument about this. The courts do it, albeit not without mistakes. Now we are sorting out the situation, trying first and foremost to identify our own shortcomings. A serious oversight on the part of lawmakers is the impossibility of appealing such a court decision. [Timofeyeva] Vladimir Vasilyevich, what kind of crimes worry you most? [Tokarev] The number of so-called everyday murders keeps growing. In 1992 there were 134 of them in the oblast; last year there were 220, and 89 have already been committed over four months of this year. One can pontificate endlessly on the causes of everyday murders: apathy, bitterness, drinking, loss of the old forms of social work--which was not all that bad--with problem families. Very troublesome is the increase in the number of grave crimes against individuals motivated by greed. In April we opened a case on the murder of an Armenian family, including a four-year-old girl. A large sum of money had disappeared. The professionalism of the Dzerzhinskiy Rayon Department of Internal Affairs staff and their close interaction with oblast procuracy investigators produced results: Two weeks ago a suspect, also an Armenian, was detained and charged. [Timofeyeva] What about economic crime? [Tokarev] We are investigating, for instance, the case of the director of GPI [state design institute] Sibgiproelektro and his deputy, who are charged with extorting bribes for leasing space. So far the amounts involved are R3 million and $2,000. We recently referred to court a case that had been reported in the press, including by your newspaper. I mean the attempt to solicit a large bribe by the deputy chief of the oblast state trade inspectorate; she is also charged with embezzlement. Investigation is also underway in the case of employees of the Rosstrakh joint-stock company's security service. In order to "collect" debts, they took hostages. There have been instances of theft of arms and ammunition from military warehouses--handguns, ammunition, and dynamite sticks were stolen. Ten persons have been charged, eight of whom are under arrest. Speaking of the economy, I am concerned at the artificial washout of state property. For instance, in the total property of an enterprise converted to joint-stock holding only 5 percent belongs to physical persons, and the rest--to the state. Nevertheless, currently the lawmaker in the event of theft treats the entire property as private. The role of the state is falling. But we all know that if the state is strong, life will become easier for all its citizens--stockholders, entrepreneurs, and workers...
