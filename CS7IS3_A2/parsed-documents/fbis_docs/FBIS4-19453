Sueskind; place and date not given: "I Am Rendering Massive Election Assistance in Bavaria"] [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You fasted and meditated over Easter, Mr. Chancellor. How many pounds did you lose, and how fit do you feel for the contest in the coming months? [Kohl] I lost the same amount of weight as I do every year: 17 pounds. I believe in fasting, because fasting does not primarily mean losing weight. It mainly means developing a clear head. I did this out of religious convictions. I feel in to condition. I am ready to fight. I was already sure earlier on that I would win the Bundestag election, and now I am even more sure. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Also because Mr. Kinkel has issued a coalition statement to your advantage? Is that the FDP's [Freedom Democratic Party] final answer to a social-liberal coalition? [Kohl] I have no doubts at all that the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] and FDP coalition will gain a majority in the October Bundestag election. I consider the idea that the great people's parties are crumbling ridiculous. They are not crumbling in the wings, nor will the voters stay at home en masse. We will once again have an excellent election turnout, i.e. about 80 percent. I am not worried about the FDP. There is an occasional tendency to sound death-knells for the FDP. But clever people inside the FDP know that this is only to their advantage, because Germany needs a party like that. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the presidential elections, differences of opinion inside the FDP could cause a loss of Liberal votes for the Union candidate Roman Herzog. Do you see such a danger? [Kohl] No, I do not. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When you take a look at the other partner, the CSU, which is having trouble carrying on its own past that is stamped with the personality of Franz-Josef Strauss, is there no danger to your election victory? [Kohl] It is true that the CSU is having difficulty with this matter right now. That the problem has arisen just now is no coincidence, but deliberate, and has something to do with the Landtag and Bundestag elections. I see a good chance of the CSU winning both the Landtag and Bundestag elections. As far as Franz-Josef Strauss is concerned, I am better qualified to speak out than most of the others. There is hardly anyone who has had more arguments with him than me. There is no denying, however, that Franz-Josef Strauss was one of the greatest and most impressive figures in German postwar politics, and that he, together with other figures such as Alfons Goppel, made a decisive contribution to the reconstruction of modern Bavaria as one of the leading laender. I know better than many others that Strauss had many facets. I find it terrible that many people are dissociating themselves from Strauss now that he is dead. When he was alive, they just could not get close enough to him. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] How many voters must the CSU have in Bavaria for you to succeed in Bonn? [Kohl] I have never attached much importance to arithmetical sums. I tell you, we the coalition will attain a sufficient majority in the Bundestag election. I have no doubt at all about that. In any case, you must not forget that the joint CDU-CSU chancellor is a good candidate for the Bavarians. As a man of the Palatinate, I myself am a born Bavarian. My father was a Frank. I am going to render massive election assistance in Bavaria. I am quite sure that we have good changes again there. And when the Bavarians are faced with the choice of either Rudolf Scharping or Helmut Kohl, I do not think they will need a long time to decide who is closer to them. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But you and your party do not appear to be winners in the opinion polls. [Kohl] I do not think much of the opinion polls these days. It is tomorrow's results that count, primarily the election results themselves, of course. People are only just beginning to make comparisons. Mr. Scharping has only been prime minister in Mainz since 1991. He has never faced the need to make difficult and frequently unpopular decisions. In 1991, the earlier weaknesses of the CDU in Rhineland-Palatinate made it easy for him to win the Landtag election. He has realized the need to throw his internal party rivals out of the race. That is his greatest achievement so far. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] That alone is something. [Kohl] Agreed. I appreciate people who know how to use power. But it is quite a different thing to retain power at the top, and I should know, because I have been doing it for over two decades. I take things as they come. I am trying to do my duty. Herr Scharping is doing his And then the voters will decide. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If you run in Bavaria, you will also have dealings with the Republikaner. What if the CSU fails to achieve an absolute majority? [Kohl] Who told you the Republikaner will win? They need 5 percent of the votes in the Bundestag election. And it is not so easy to get 5 percent out of 80 million Germans and a 80 percent election turnout. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But what if they do succeed? [Kohl] Why should I talk about that? I tell you they will not win. The huge majority of Germans know very well that every vote cast for the Republikaner is a vote against internal stability and our country's foreign image. Apart from that, most voters know that we cannot afford a red-green experiment. That would endanger our country's future potential. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Protest voters might not worry about that. [Kohl] People find it easier to cast protest votes at a Landtag election because it carried less risk than a Bundestag election. But I consider it wrong to underestimate Landtag elections. The September Landtag election is very important for Bavaria. At the Bundestag elections, the voter knows that the future of the entire country is at stake. We will fight the Republikaner without compunction, but we will not rebuke those who voted for them, because only a few of these voters were right-wing radicals. We want to win back as many protest voters as possible. I see a good chance of chance of that. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Chancellor, the current debate has reached the following question: Should one fight the Republikaner with special laws, such as a law against the "Auschwitz lie," or perhaps by banning the party altogether? [Kohl] Those are two different things. I consider a party ban out of the question, and I wish to make it clear that I would not do such a thing. A political party must be fought with political-intellectual resources. As far as legislation is concerned, for example the "Auschwitz lie," then I am not quite sure. The "Auschwitz lie" is already punishable, but only legal loopholes are being discussed. But that is completely different from banning a party, let me make that quite clear. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us get back to Bavaria. If you put up a strong presence there, how will you handle the difference of opinion with Prime Minister Stoiber on the subject of European policy? Can this differences simply be ironed out? [Kohl] I have nothing to iron out. The CDU and its chairman have been in favor of a continuity of European policy ever since Konrad Adenauer. But I have also learned something more. We adopted the term "United States of Europe" from Winston Churchill. But that never meant a European duplication of the United States of America. I discovered that in the minds of the citizens, association with Europe was something completely different; not just in Germany, but all over Europe. Therefore I no longer use the term "United States of Europe." Each one of us is rooted to his own home territory -- you in Bavaria, and I in the Palatinate. We remain Germans, Frenchmen, or Italians. And at the same time we are Europeans. I have no problems about that when, for example, Edmund Stoiber or the CSU emphasize the topic of subsidiarity. I am open to that. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But Finance Minister Waigel gets quite upset about the subject of Europe. He is worried about our growing contributions to the EC budget. Can this be an election topic for the 12 June European elections or later? You are accused of having been too generous in Maastricht. [Kohl] Never. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Can this turn into an issue? [Kohl] Of course it can. We need European unity, the EU, mainly for two reasons. For me, the decisive question is how we can guarantee peace and freedom in Europe, and therefore in Germany also in the future. I am convinced this is only possible as a member of the EU. We all see the horror pictures from ex-Yugoslavia, where hatred, murder, and homelesssness are on the daily agenda. The evil ghosts of the past are at home not only in the Balkans. They can also emerge in other parts of Europe. We must take early action against this. Only European unity can guarantee peace for good. In second place, I would put the economy. We Germans have the greatest economic advantage to gain from European unity. When the EEC was founded in 1957, German exports worth 14 billion marks went to the 12 countries that make up the EU today. In 1992 we exported a good 360 million marks worth of goods to these countries. Therefore our exports to the EU countries have risen as sharply as our exports to the rest of the world. We owe many million jobs to the close economic ties with our European partners. One quarter of the jobs in Germany are dependent on these ties. As you see, Europe is no luxury for Germany, but a vital necessity. Therefore it is short- sighted to complain that we make the heaviest contributions to the EU budget. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What does Waigel say when you tell him that? [Kohl] Theo Waigel agrees. However, it is true that we have now reached our financial limits. That also applies to our aid to Central and East European countries. Germany is not a hen that keeps laying golden eggs. We must see to it that other countries also make their contribution, and we must bear in mind that the present distribution of burdens within the EU -- I am not talking about the poorer countries like Ireland or Portugal -- is not in order. There are some things that have to be checked, and we will also do so. But that does not alter the fact that we are paying the most and that we have the most advantages. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us remain on the subject of the economy. You have often referred to the "boom" trends here, but are these trends not too weak, and are they not appearing too late to be of advantage to you on election day? [Kohl] I am not a prophet. All I know is that it is the economic institutes that are again using the term "boom" these days, not me. I can see that exports are clearly increasing in some areas. I think the signs show an improvement and that the economic path has been set correctly. Wise tariff agreements have been concluded, and we are achieving a good overall climate. It is obvious that we are emerging from the depths of the recession and that the German economy is once again moving ahead. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You see optimistic signs, but your coalition partner has already announced changes to your concept. The FDP is suggesting a limitation to the solidarity-supplement on income tax. [Kohl] I do not consider such thoughts. I have told the voters clearly -- we need the money for a few more years in order to encourage the economic and social growth in the new laender. By the way, the capital we are investing there will be repaid with interest, for we are investing in the future of the whole of Germany. Flourishing landscapes -- I have been insulted and ridiculed for a long time because of this term -- are arising. We will abolish the tax supplement as soon as a good control over ther budget permits us to do so. But I will not say when that will happen. There is something else that I will not say even after the elections. I am not going to repeat a mistake I once made. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The mistake was to allow the FDP to commit you to a one-year limitation of the income tax supplement that was introduced at that time? [Kohl] Yes. Needless to say, the faster we get this business going, the better. I am not keen on tax increases. I am a keen supporter of a social market economy, which cannot be made to suffer as far as services are concerned, but must be profitable for society's sake. Between 1982 and 1989, we reduced state involvement in the economy from over 50 percent to under 46 percent. For reasons that are generally known, we now have to increase this involvement to 52 percent. But I want to reduce it to its 1989 level as soon as possible. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When you talk of a comprehensible tax policy, then you must explain what you meant when you said in your television interview that additional funds are required in order to tidy up traffic policy. What does that mean? Will there be an increase in the tax on crude oil? [Kohl] We need cars and railroads. The congestion on our roads is increasing in line with prosperity, and there is no solution to the problem right now. We need a sensible combination of rail and road. An overall concept is required for this purpose, and we are working on such a concept right now. We must make the railroad competitive. But I am very much against outlawing road traffic by means of red-green ideology. There is too much shouting going on. Demonstrations against road traffic are held, yet people travel to these demonstrations in their own cars! For many people, cars are a part of their well-earned freedom. We need a concept that combines road, rail, and water in a sensible manner. Naturally, we will have to meet the costs of such a concept. We need more funds for traffic policy. We will make the appropriate suggestions in our election program, whereby both the economic and the ecological aspects of the matter have to be considered. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The SPD is taking the CDU's place in many spheres -- in internal security, for example -- and it is acting as if it were a better version of the CDU and as if nothing is possible without it. How do you intend to break this stranglehold? [Kohl]. Easy. I will tell the people that nothing is right in the front and in the rear. What makes the SPD a better version of the CDU? I see nothing. The Social Democrats will try to appear like the CDU, but one can see the difference. Remember how long it took the SPD to finally agree on the new asylum law. Our country would have been spared many problems if the SPD had not delayed the issue for such a long time. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If you are planning a massive election campaign in Bavaria, you must be able to afford a massive campaign in the new laender as well. [Kohl] Yes, of course. In the new laender I will take up all the major positions that I occupied in 1990. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But the CDU does not have a good reputation in eastern Germany right now. [Kohl] We will see during the elections. When I look at the latest opinion polls in the new laender, I can see that people's conviction about the economic and social success of German unity is becoming clearer from one day to the next; 67 percent of respondents there have said the economic upturn is reaching the east, and 59 percent claim that their personal situation has improved as a result of German unity. Only 21 percent say that they are in a worse situation than they were before unity. At the end of 1990, 34 percent said they could afford to buy more than they could under the GDR. In 1991, 39 percent said so, and today 47 percent are saying so. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But people do not seem to be thanking you for it. [Kohl] When I look at these figures and consider my own personal experience, then all I can say is that one must talk to people. Of course the wind is blowing back in our faces right now, and of course some people are shamelessly stirring up emotions, for example Mrs. Hildebrandt, the social minister of Brandenburg. In the eastern part of the country, I will speak to the people on the same streets and in the same squares that I spoke to them in 1990, and other places besides. I will tell them: I promised you that together we would create flourishing landscapes in the reunited Germany. If I said this would happen four or five years into the future, I was mistaken. In 1990 I assumed that our trading partner the Soviet Union would continue to exist. No one imagined that just one year later the Soviet Union would collapse and that eastern trade would practically disintegrate. As recently as summer 1991 I spoke to Mikhail Gorbachev about supplies from the new laender worth 25 billion marks. Today we are happy if we deliver just 5 million marks worth of supplies with the help of Hermes [export credit] guarantees. As a result of all this, many jobs were lost in the new laender. The reconstruction will now take longer than expected, but it is already in full steam, and the emergence of "flourishing landscapes" can be seen in many places. I might have got the time scale wrong, but unlike my critics I have made my contribution to German unity, while others gave up and betrayed this objective a long time ago. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali visited you the day before yesterday. If the peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina takes shape, will Germany take part in a UN peace mission to implement it? [Kohl] Let me tell you first of all that in a few weeks time, the Constitutional Court will decide whether such involvement is in keeping with the Basic Law. We await this decision. That is the first important thing. The second is -- of course we will help millions of suffering people in a ravaged land, and not stand aside. But that does not indicate the type and extent of our help. What are our German worries compared to the worries of the people who live there? One would have to have a heart of stone to say that their fate does not concern us. Therefore, we will offer assistance where needed, also because one cannot permit the Serbs and Croats to subdue the Muslims, who are the weaker group. We cannot just stand by and watch this happen. As for a military involvement, I am extremely skeptical. Memories of World War II are particularly vivid in that part of Europe. Therefore, one must ask to what extent German help is at all desirable, and what form it should assume. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] It could be a combination of the help already given in Cambodia and Somalia, in other words medical and technical aid. [Kohl] But we are not in Cambodia or Somalia. We will have to quietly discuss the question of help. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us get back to the subject of Bosnia once again. Tension has arisen with Moscow on account of the NATO operations. Do you intend to mediate in this matter? [Kohl] No. I do not like the term "mediation" in this context. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But you could telephone your friend Boris Yeltsin. [Kohl] That is something else altogether. It is not mediation. Let me tell you something. Ever since unity, enormous expectations are being made of us Germans, and we are quite incapable of fulfilling some of them. Many people say that the Germans should help whenever something happens in the world. Today we have excellent relations with Washington, Moscow, Paris, and London, and we want to use them. But we must guard against assuming the role of mediator. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You have had a dispute with your justice minister about the deportation of the Kurds. Has it been settled? [Kohl] There was no dispute. My position on the deportation of the Kurds is well known. It conforms to the position of all members of the government. We are a law-governed country that respects human rights. We do not deport anyone who is threatened with a death sentence or torture. Because we are a law-governed country and because our country has to protect its internal peace, it is quite unacceptable for people who are guests in our country to intimidate or terrorize others, for whatever reason. I cannot accept an abuse of the right to demonstrate for the purposes of violence or street terror. He who adheres to our laws, as well as the rules governing aliens, is in no danger of being deported. We behave just like all civilized countries on earth. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The law applies to everyone equally. [Kohl] No one in his right mind denies that. No one who has not violated the laws in this country is deported. By the way, the side-effects of such violent misdeeds have to be considered. We want to remain a county friendly to foreigners, a country open to the world. That is essential for our future. If we permit such occurrences, no wonder people complain. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The last question, Mr. Chancellor. What do you tell voters who ask why Helmut Kohl should run in elections for the fourth time after 12 years in office? [Kohl] There are two major reasons. In the time that I have at my disposal, I want to achieve as much progress as possible concerning Germany's internal unity and, concerning European unity, to do everything I can to prevent a regression, so that we may never experience developments we thought belonged to the past, for example the European civil wars that are again taking place in front of our door in the Balkans. Guaranteeing peace and freedom for us and future generations is the most important thing for me. For 49 years we have had the fortune to live in peace. But that does not mean that peace and freedom are granted once and for all. Peace and freedom are no simple gift from heaven. We have to do something for them. We need a united Germany in a united Europe. I want to continue to work on that.
