Whether the situation will subside or tend to intensify will depend to a considerable extent on the leaders of the national republic and its old and new politicians, those who are in the structures of administration today and those who will replace them after the elections to the local organs of power: A presidential election is due on 16 January, parliamentary elections 27 March. Our correspondent's interlocutor is Sergey Valentinovich Khetagurov, chairman of the Republic of North Ossetia Council of Ministers and a deputy to the Federation Council. [Beldyugina] About the elections. You are taking part in the election race, but at the same time it is well-known that you are an opponent of the very institution of presidency in the republic. How do you reconcile these two facts? [Khetagurov] I cannot imagine a more inappropriate occupation for an anxious republic preoccupied with quite different concerns and problems than yet another political campaign accompanied by the fueling of public passions, struggles among different teams and groups, scandals, intrigues... In short, all this tends to split a society, which more than ever before needs consolidation, a pooling of efforts to stabilize the situation in the state of emergency zone and give help to refugees and those who have suffered during the conflict, and the restoration of a national economy badly damaged by the war with our neighbors. For example, 28 people have contested three Federal Assembly seats! Eight candidates are now running for the presidency. I do not think that any of the contenders for the presidency is entirely suited to the role, and that includes myself. But in the republic's present government and in my team there are many people who are simply irreplaceable today. However, my defeat will mean the inevitable resignation of the whole team. Under the Republic of North Ossetia Constitution the president is both head of the republic and chief executive. There is no equivalent in any fundamental law. [Beldyugina] I attended one of your election meetings with the voters in the village of Olginskoye. For the most part people were interested not in politics but in social problems -- the bad roads, communications, the lack of heat in people's homes, and other problems. [Khetagurov] That is the point. For the government the social sphere is indeed the priority. The appalling psychological tension can be defused by improving the population's well-being and by combating unemployment and poverty. Not only have we prevented the social sphere from disintegrating but we have even made some real progress. North Ossetia today has one of the highest per capita incomes. In the North Caucasus at least we are in first place in that regard. The slump in production in the republic has been halted and overall production volumes are increasing. [Beldyugina] Nevertheless, the tension in the state of emergency region is high and could erupt. People seem to be expecting the worst. The intention to return Ingush refugees to four settlements in Prigorodnyy Rayon has caused a storm of protests from the population. You also consider this step hasty. Why? [Khetagurov] Because you cannot reconcile by force people who yesterday were enemies and who lost their near ones in bloody battle. How can you make people live together when their predominant feeling today is one of fear? [Beldyugina] What is your relationship like with the leadership of the interim administration of Ingushetia? [Khetagurov] It is a normal, businesslike relationship. We seek a path of mutual understanding and cooperation in the solution of any question. The main thing is to avoid a head-on confrontation and harm caused by intolerance or harsh and ill-considered actions. But the military presence in the region must be reduced. For three years the republic has been living in a state of emergency. This is too long and has traumatized people's psyche. [Beldyugina] In that case who will ensure their security? [Khetagurov] There are teams of internal troops and a border regiment quartered in North Ossetia -- these forces are sufficient to maintain law and order in the republic. [Beldyugina] Nevertheless, people must return to their homes. Especially those who were not caught up in the bloody events of 1992. After all, the situation cannot be maintained. Perhaps you know of another way out? [Khetagurov] I am convinced that events cannot be forced. This is a question of the security not just of the Ossetian population but also of the Ingush. Furthermore, there is the problem of preserving an already too fragile peace throughout the North Caucasus and in southern Russia. Time is the best healer. It is necessary to use popular diplomacy, the laws, traditions, and the custom of reconciliation typical of the mountain people. People must become reconciled with one another -- neighbor with neighbor. Conciliation commissions have been created in all our population centers.
