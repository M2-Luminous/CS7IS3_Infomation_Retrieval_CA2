Will They Get It?"] [Text] How wonderful a lieutenant's years are! How can any of us, servicemen who have already lived and seen a few things, possibly not recollect an officer's youth with trepidation! I remember three of us, lieutenants still wet behind the ears, arriving at our assigned unit. The surprises started almost right away. The equipment of the unit turned out to be more recent than what we had in the school. That meant doing some retraining. And there was a platoon-full of subordinates, every other one of whom was far from an expert. How were we to work with them? And even we weren't much of a gift to the company commander--there was always something about us that displeased him. Nevertheless, life went on. In the evening, upon returning from our work area, we would wash off the dust and grease, fry some potatoes, and then spruce up and head for the Officers Club for some dancing and some socializing with tenth-year coeds. But what is most memorable to me from those times is the people under whose direction I served, and the people with whom I was fortunate to serve. Of course we had different commanders, but I remember that first company commander we had, who seemed at first to be such an overly stiff, has-been soldier: How much unpleasantness he shielded us from, how many lessons he taught us about life! There were many of this sort who were truly concerned for us. These of course aren't just idle recollections. Today the situation in the reforming Russian Army is such that we have to ask ourselves this question: Will today's young officers have such memories of father-figure commanders? Will they remain in the army, or will they leave for greener pastures? The problem of young personnel has become extremely painful to the army and navy. In 1990-1993 (as of the beginning of this year) more than 95,000 young officers, up to 30 years old, left the army ranks. This was in a time when there is no one in the troops to appoint to primary officer positions. If you look at each of the armed services separately, you will find that the situation is most favorable in the Strategic Missile Forces. At least in recent times a tendency for young officers not to want to revert to civilian life can be clearly discerned. In the ground forces, 6,623 young officers left in 1993. Of 3,214 who left the Air Defense Forces, 1,206 did so because they wanted to, while the rest left because of incompatibility with service and for discrediting the honor of the military. In the navy, in the words of Rear Admiral Vasiliy Viktorov, chief of the navy's Personnel Training and Placement Directorate, the number of vacant primary positions now reaches into the thousands. Even with regard for this year's military school graduates, the personnel hunger in the lowest ship units will be less than 50 percent satisfied. The picture is similar in the air force as well. The reasons why young people leave are generally well known. Some long for the motherland--for what are now sovereign states, while others part with the army because of problems in establishing homes for their families, and still others are simply unable to feed their families. This is on the backdrop of a general decline in the prestige of military service. But I think it would be wrong to reduce everything just to this. There can of course be no debate that a young person possessing the diploma of a military engineer and radio technician, a programmer, or a motor mechanic could set himself up reasonably well in civilian life. But let's think about the particular reasons why junior officers leave. Let's consider the two main ones--because they want to, and because of incompatibility with service. As it turns out, in most cases lieutenants and captains don't leave on their own, but are forced out. This is even considering the fact that some junior officers (who were unable to get an honorable discharge) were forced to commit violations, and thus they fell into the category of officers leaving due to "incompatibility with service." What is behind this? Are they really professionally unsuited, or is there something else here, and namely, were they unable to find a person at the beginning of their career who could have supported them, taught them, and reinforced their faith in their own strengths? Can it really be true that there are no longer mentors of this sort in the army or, if you wish, the sort of educators that we associated with when we were lieutenants? Of course there are. But our democratic society has become calloused and indifferent to the fate of others, and this bitter cup has not passed by the army either. Tell me, is it really normal for a school graduate arriving in his unit to begin his military career by serving as a sentry or unloading coal for a boiler plant? But even this could be understood. Because a battalion commander has only three soldiers to help him, and the post can't go without heat. A lieutenant, I believe, would understand this. If only they would talk with him in a civilized manner, speak kindly, explain the situation, and perhaps even ask him to participate. But no! His superiors wouldn't stoop to such pampering: That's an order, so do it! In former times, and not really that long ago, a commander had to work directly with people. And he did. Now, with the advent of deputy commanders for educational work, many commanders took all of this all too literally: Our business is to lead, to command, and yours is to educate. So educate! In the meantime these deputies are often themselves unsure of what their new station means, and consequently junior officers find themselves left to their own devices. It is well known what can happen when junior officers fail to sense any real concern on the part of their superiors. And such a commander easily writes off the loss of a junior officer due to objective factors--our times are hard, the impoverished existence of lieutenants--that's why they don't want to serve. The reason things aren't bad in the Strategic Missile Forces as an example is that real concern is shown here for junior officers. For each and every one of them. And they represent more than 40 percent of all officers in the forces. It is precisely upon them that the main burden of alert duty lies, especially where the work is the hardest--in the regiments. "Young people are the future of the missile forces," feels Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev, commander-in-chief of the Strategic Missile Forces. "We have developed and are implementing a program of social protection for junior officers and their families. And so, despite the great financial difficulties, all junior officers receive the 12 months' pay they are supposed to get after graduating from school in order to arrange their personal lives. Even before they arrive in the unit, commanders hunt up apartments for them, reserve places for their children in preschool institutions, and find jobs for their wives. Junior Officers' Day has become traditional in the forces. Commanders regularly visit their families, and delve into their needs." There isn't any need to invent anything new in the approaches to work with junior officers--the arsenal of these methods is sufficiently rich and diverse. The work itself creates the best impact upon the mood of people, if of course it is well organized--that is, if the officer is doing what he is supposed to be doing primarily--combat training. Many commanders in the forces and in the navy understand this well, and despite today's shortage of everything imaginable, they provide subordinates the possibility to exercise their lawful rights--the right to serve in their specialty, rather than being used as gofers and errand boys. A junior officer living in such an environment begins to develop work satisfaction, and pride in having the honor to belong to a glorious cohort of tankmen, or seamen, or paratroopers. I'm not of course trying to say that a guardian "uncle" needs to be assigned to every school graduate, like they used to do with new recruits way back when. What I'm talking about is concrete assistance to junior officers on the part of their elders, which has always been a tradition in the Russian officer corps. Whether or not they will get it depends on us.
