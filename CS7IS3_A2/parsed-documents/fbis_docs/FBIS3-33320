This is the plant responsible for refining the largest quantity of gasoline in the country. Nevertheless, the problems extend beyond this factory, and [fuel] availability remains low. From the very beginning of the year, fuel availability plummeted due to trade delays and the shutdowns in the nation's production plants. The latest situation at the Nico Lopez plant occurred because of a lack of input. However, once one difficulty is solved, others arise, such as the very important need for maintenance, which is a year behind schedule because of lack of financing. According to the director of Cupet [expansion unknown], the gasoline situation today depends on the nation's financial situation. [Begin Cupet director recording] Essentially, there is a financial problem that causes the availability of fuels to be considerably below the real demand today, below the amount needed to accomplish the economy's essential activities -- activities essential to both the economy and the population. The difficulties make it impossible for us to ensure a certain stability regarding the time and quantities in which the various fuel supplies are guaranteed for the nation's different activities. [end recording] What is happening regarding gasoline is also the case for kerosene and liquified gas. Availability levels have dropped considerably. In 1989, the amount of fuel oil was over 6 million, while in 1993, it exceeded only 3.5 million. [sentence as heard] As for liquified gas, 135,000 metric tons were distributed in 1989, while in 1993, there were only 59,900. Likewise, last year, only 299,000 tons of kerosene were distributed, compared to 613,000 in 1989. It was predicted that distribution levels would improve in 1994 due to important intergovernmental agreements, international price adjustments, and particularly, economizing. Nevertheless, the anticipated response has not been forthcoming during these first two months [of 1994]; and both private and state [enterprises], including priority sectors, have been affected. In order to predict what will happen in the future, one would have to make so many suppositions when only time itself will tell. What is true, however, is the nation's financial instability. We will be able to solve the fuel problem to the extent that financial instability is resolved.
