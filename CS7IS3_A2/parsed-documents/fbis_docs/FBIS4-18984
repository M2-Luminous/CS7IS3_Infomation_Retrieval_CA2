Two U.S. NATO F16 jets bombed a Bosnian Serb artillery command post near Gorazde, a designated "safe haven," yesterday after the Serbs ignored repeated warnings to stop attacks on the town. The strike was fully justified, John Major said during a visit to Birmingham. "It makes it perfectly clear to the Serbs or to anyone else that we are serious about making sure that United Nations Security Council resolutions are kept," he said. "I think the air strikes were justified -- they were certainly within the authority which the commanders on the ground have. They saw continued approach towards Goradze. They saw the shelling of Goradze. The Serbs were given a clear warning to stop. They didn't stop and I think they can be unsurprised at the subsequent action." Asked how much notice he was given about the air strike, Mr Major said: "It isn't a matter of anyone being given notice. The responsibility for this has been delegated to the Secretary General who has delegated to the commanders on the ground and it is for them to make the decisions, and not for the politicians a long way away." He went on: "The changes which we have seen in Bosnia in the last two months have been astonishing. We have moved at a rapid rate towards the possibility of an overall settlement now and that is being put in danger by what has happened in Goradze. I have not a shred of doubt that the commanders on the ground were right to act as they did."
