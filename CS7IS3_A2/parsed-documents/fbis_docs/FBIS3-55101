Analysing the current political and economic situation in Georgia, Shevardnadze listed three principal factors which he believes should determine joint activities within the CIS framework. These are strengthening the economy, fighting separatist sentiments and averting a threat of dictatorship. The Georgian leader said the Commonwealth of Independent States is presently charged with a historical mission, and "if all the countries work in agreement in these three directions, if we efficiently fight these evils, all citizens of newly-independent states will feel the goodness resulting from our unity."
