In the aftermath of Josef Jezek's resignation Jan. 19 from the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) the governing coalition's dominant partner looks a bit less like a well-oiled machine walking lockstep behind its guiding leader, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. ODS is so strongly against dissent that its 1992 political platform included a promise that no deputy would switch sides or leave the party. The ODS leadership has called on Jezek to resign his parliament seat, but it can't force him to leave. The departure of Jezek, an owlish expert on the thorny issue of devolving power to local governments, has brought long-standing whispers of discontent within ODS to the surface. ODS favors maintaining a strong central government. Amplifying the air of discord caused by Jezek's resignation, ODS parliamentary deputies have produced a study that points to tensions between the party leadership and its elected representatives. The issue of how to reform and structure local governments--which prompted Jezek's departure--helped introduce an unfamiliar level of disunity in the party. Jezek takes a stronger view, saying that party consensus had been lost forever. "The ODS is today a different party than the one that worked out its election platform in 1992," he said. "The differences in viewpoints of individual members is sometimes so broad that it seems a miracle that the party manages to stay together." Until now, ODS has formed the bulwark of a stable government, while other parliamentary parties, especially those in opposition, went through membership upheavals and conflicts. Now, ODS deputies talk openly of differences, something that was unheard of only a few months ago. "It's no mystery that ideas in our [parliamentary] club on land administration are not completely unified," said ODS Deputy Frantisek Kozel. "The majority of the club understands [Jezek's resignation] as a gesture that underlines a certain dissatisfaction." In contrast to this opinion, which has been carefully articulated by some ODS parliamentarians, Deputy Prime Minister Petr Cermak shrugged off Jezek's resignation as a personal decision that will have only a marginal effect on the party. "I don't think his opinion echoes to any great extent the opinions of other deputies in the ODS club," Cermak said. The deputy prime minister was also quick to dismiss any notion that deep divisions were developing in the ODS over the issue of local governance or the similarly controversial church- and Jewish-restitution debates. "We're simply looking for a point of view," he said. "That doesn't mean we're dividing into factions according to who holds what opinion." Yet the local government issue has steadily grown in importance as the fall local elections get closer and the perception grows that the government is dragging its feet on making a final decision. Last July, Jezek was part of an ad-hoc commission that studied the issue and drew up some proposals. Since then, the government has failed to come out with a single concrete point of view on the issue of land reform, enforcing the opinion that it is opposed to sharing power with localities. A very public debate has been waged over how many regional administrative districts there should be, what powers they should have and how many levels of government should exist under central rule from Prague. In Jezek, some believe the party is losing a credible voice on these questions. "Jezek was considered by people in the club as an expert who understood this area," said Kozel. Jiri Honajzer, ODS parliamentary chairman, said he told Jezek that instead of resigning over the issue, he should have stayed on and tried to convince people of his ideas. Instead, Honajzer said, Jezek was often away from parliamentary club meetings because he was off talking with local government experts and mayors. "I think it's better to stay in the arena and convince people," Honajzer said. He pointed out that the only action the party can take against a parliamentarian who votes against the majority on a major issue is to send a letter to the member's constituents alerting them to the fact. Honajzer said this measure has never been used. Despite these assertions, the ODS leadership's reaction to Jezek's defection was to demand his resignation from parliament. The day of his resignation, Jezek was called into a meeting of the top parliamentary and Cabinet members. After listening to his reasons for resigning, Klaus called on Jezek to resign his seat in parliament. This sparked a debate in which some of those present argued that Jezek was fully within his constitutional rights in resigning from the party and following his own conscience in parliament. Nothing came of the discussion, though, because the ODS leadership lacks legal authority to force Jezek to resign his seat. Among Chamber of Deputies members on both sides, the dominant reaction to Jezek's leaving ODS was complete surprise. Those who called for Jezek's resignation from parliament cited what they said was the party's electoral platform in 1992, in which a promise was made to the electorate that no deputy elected under the ODS banner would switch sides or leave the party. For his part, Jezek said, he doesn't remember ever having been informed of such a promise by the party. "I didn't [make the loyalty vow] ever during the campaign," he said. "I don't have the least bad conscience that I've cheated the voters or anyone else."
