Acting on the centralized plan, the Shenzhen City Culture Bureau, Administration for Industry and Commerce, Public Security Bureau, and news units deployed a large number of personnel for a massive sweep. At 1300, inspection teams made up of personnel from cultural, industry and commerce, public security, and news units were divided into three contingents, one heading toward Renmin Road South; one toward Tongjian Building; and one toward the railway station. A small detachment which this correspondent followed swooped down on the railway station and the Lianjian [Joint Inspection] Building nearby. Within 100 steps of the exit of the building were three kiosks selling illegal audio-visual publications. The sudden raid by the law-enforcement agents took the sellers completely by surprise; all illegal goods, numbering at least some 6,000 boxes, were either seized or confiscated. Then the same detachment turned back to head toward the railway station and ran up to the second floor. Around the train waiting room on the second floor were five to six shops selling illegal audio-visual publications, some of which, having been tipped off, had moved part of the illegal goods somewhere else. But for most of the shops, before they realized what was happening, the law- enforcement agents had impounded or seized all of their illegal goods. One small shop, called "Shop B2 of the Commercial City on the second floor of the railway station," about three to four square meters in size, contained all kinds of discs of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland movie stars and other items such as "Swimsuit Best," "Women and Their Bodies" and "Sex and Happiness." There were all kinds of weird and dazzling items. A rough estimation put the goods at over 10,000 boxes. It is understood that illegal audio-visual publications seized by the other contingents numbered 10,000 to 20,000 boxes. Wang Zengliang, Shenzhen City Culture Bureau Inspection commander, who was present at the scene, told this correspondent that there were about 1,000 shops which were issued licenses by the city culture bureau and district authorities to sell cultural items; and that most of the sales were legal. But there were a considerable number of cultural item shops, especially vendors without operating permits, which sold illegal audio-visual publications. This situation became increasingly worse and created a very bad influence. To crack down harshly on this practice, the city had established an inspection command center and staffed it with personnel drawn from the city government, cultural, industry and commerce, and public security departments. The city culture bureau has also set up full-time and part-time inspection teams and planned to adopt methods such as strengthening education, regular enforcement of laws and inspections, and rewarding people reporting illegal selling to ensure the healthy development of the cultural market.
