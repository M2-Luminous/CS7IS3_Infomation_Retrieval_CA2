FR941107-1-00011 FR941107-1-00004 §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Limited, Avro International Aerospace Division (Formerly British Aerospace, plc; British Aerospace Commercial Aircraft, Limited): Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;152&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the failure of the main fitting, which could lead to collapse of the nose land gear (NLG) during landing, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes on which NLG part number 200876001 or 200876003 has been installed: (1) Prior to the accumulation of 4,000 total landings or within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, conduct an eddy current or ultra high sensitivity penetrant inspection of the NLG, in accordance with British Aerospace Service Bulletin S.B. 32&hyph;131, Revision 2, dated July 10, 1993. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings. (2) If cracking is detected during any inspection required by this paragraph, prior to further flight, replace the currently installed NLG with a new or serviceable unit, or repair the crack, in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. After replacement or repair, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings. (b) For airplanes on which NLG part number 200876002, 200876004, or 201138002 has been installed: (1) Prior to the accumulation of 16,000 total landings or within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, conduct an eddy current or ultra sensitivity penetrant inspection of the NLG, in accordance with British Aerospace Service Bulletin S.B. 32&hyph;131, Revision 2, dated July 10, 1993. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 8,000 landings. (2) If cracking is detected during any inspection required by this paragraph, prior to further flight, replace the currently installed NLG with a new or serviceable unit, or repair the crack, in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. After replacement or repair, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 8,000 landings. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on November 1, 1994. S.R. Miller, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
