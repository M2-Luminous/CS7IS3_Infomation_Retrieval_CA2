However, Kono said he has not yet finalized possible topics for discussion with the premier. "I will consider what the contents of the meeting should be," he said. Hata, in his first policy speech to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, appealed to opposition parties to cooperate to help his fragile minority government steer Japan through difficult times on both domestic and international fronts. But Kono, in his parliamentary interpellation on Thursday, questioned the authority of the minority government and expressed readiness to take over power from the Hata administration. Kono has also arranged a meeting with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ], on Monday, a day before his planned talks with Prime Minister Hata, according to other LDP sources. The Kono-Murayama meeting marks the first between an LDP president and an SDP chairman since the LDP was ousted from power last summer, party officials said. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told reporters both Kono and Murayama have agreed to hold separate meetings next Tuesday with Hata, who is also leader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party). Kumagai said Hata may also seek similar dialogue with leaders of other parties, including new party Sakigake [Harbinger].
