The new chart synthesizes and summarizes data obtained from gamma-spectrometric analysis of numerous soil samples and gamma-spectrometric surveys from the air. ``This updated chart reflects the third post-Chernobyl period, which began in 1988,'' Yuriy Pokumeyko, head of the Belarus hydrometeorological service says. ``The radiation situation is now dominated by cesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium-238, -239, - 240, and -241, whose half-life ranges from a minimum of 12 years to a maximum of almost 25,000 years. The breakdown, by republics, of contamination by long-life radionuclides with a density of one curie per square kilometre and above is now as follows: Belarus -- 23 percent of the republic's total area, Ukraine -- 5.2 percent, and Russia 0.6 percent. The worst affected areas are Gomel, Mogilev, Zhitomir, Rovno, Kiev, Bryansk, Tula and Orel oblasts. I wish to point out that, as far as Russia is concerned, the chart has been augmented with information about strontium-90 contamination resulting from the Kyshtym accident in the Urals.''
