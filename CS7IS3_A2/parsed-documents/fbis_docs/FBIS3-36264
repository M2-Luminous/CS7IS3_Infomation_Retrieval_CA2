Von Ondarza, 60, who is to retire in April 1994, expressed satisfaction with the results of his visit and confessed that he had always looked at the Soviet Union and its allies through "the gun sight." His visit has become possible due to the political thaw in relations between the east and west, he said. In Moscow the general met with Vladimir Semenov, commander of the Russian land forces, Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General Staff, and other officials. He welcomed Kolesnikov's words that "the General Staff of the Russian armed forces is studying the Partnership for Peace programme with interest. It contains good ideas. The practical realisation of this programme will speed up our rapprochement with the North- Atlantic Alliance." The NATO general said NATO is ready to provide assistance to the peace-keeping forces of Russia and the CIS, including to train specialists for work in areas of inter-ethnic conflicts as observers. Von Ondarza's visit was part of the Russia-NATO programme of military cooperation which envisages over 50 joint projects in 1994, including senior officer and expert exchanges, joint military manoeuvres and other events.
