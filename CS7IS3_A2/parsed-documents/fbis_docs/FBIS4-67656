Michael H. Merson, WHO's executive director for the global program on AIDS, suggested that the Chinese central government should focus on preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Efforts should include expanded educational programs, increased use of condoms, and the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. And AIDS control work must not be confined to Yunnan Province, where reported cases make up about 80 per cent of the country's total. Education and publicity campaigns should be carried out regularly in all other parts of the country, especially in the economic development zones and the coastal regions that have experienced a sharp rise in transient populations, he suggested. Merson is in Beijing to help the government work out feasible policies to combat AIDS. He discussed the worldwide and Chinese AIDS situations with State Councillor Peng Peiyun and officials from the Ministry of Public Health. He warned that, like other Asian countries, China faces the possibility of a serious HIV and AIDS epidemic. Compared with the size of the country's population of 1.1 billion, the number of reported HIV infections and cases of AIDS is relatively low, he said, but there is no reason for complacency. Experience has shown that the actual number of infections and cases of AIDS is usually greater than the number of reported cases, and the risk factors fueling this pandemic elsewhere in the region also exist in China. So far, some 1,159 HIV infections and AIDS cases have been reported on the Chinese mainland. However, the actual figure could be much higher because of limited surveillance work. Experts warn that unless quick steps are taken now, the number of cases will grow rapidly in the next six years. However, the trend can still be slowed through extensive AIDS-prevention publicity and education. plays an effective role in preventing the spread of AIDS.
