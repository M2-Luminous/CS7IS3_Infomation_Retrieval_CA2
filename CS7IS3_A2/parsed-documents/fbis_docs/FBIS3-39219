In an interview with RTL-TVI [Luxembourg Radio and Television] Television, Mr. Claes added that even partial withdrawal of the artillery less than 20 km will not weaken NATO determination to launch air strikes against Serbian positions. Mr. Claes said that "any change of decision was out of question." "This time, they will have to withdraw beyond 20 km or NATO will implement its plan," Claes added. "I am convinced that this firm attitude has to be maintained... this time the Serbs will have to withdraw, so I do not rule out the possibility of reinforcing the ground troops. I still believe, however, that like good old Communists, they only understand harsh language and that military actions will not be necessary," Mr. Claes said. Furthermore, Mr. Claes said he totally agreed with the statement that NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner made on Wednesday when he called the NATO decision a "historic moment." "This shows that the Americans and the Europeans are once more on the same wavelength...this shows that even the Berlin Wall has fallen, NATO still has an important role to play in the future," concluded Mr. Claes.
