It happened straight after the abolition of Article 6 in the Constitution of the day -- one that stipulated the CPSU's monopoly on power. Today's issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA [LITERARY GAZETTE, a Moscow-based weekly] reports that Anatoliy Sobchak made this announcement during a ceremony at which he was presenting his new book, The Tbilisi Fracture, or Bloody Sunday 1989. A multiparty system is in the offing, so we must act before the event, words to that effect were, according to the mayor, said by Mikhail Gorbachev at a Politburo sitting at the time. We ourselves ought to set up the first alternative party, but one that would be malleable. The selection of a prospective party leader was left to the then-KGB, Sobchak says. As always, it rose to the task; it found among its so-called active reserve a man with the military rank of captain, whose name is now widely known. The name of the party, Liberal Democratic, was also invented there and then. It was a real success: After all, the word liberal has long been compromised in this country. Two weeks later the new party was officially registered. It was the first registered political party in the country, since the CPSU had never undergone the procedure; the party of Russian Communists was not registered until much later and under a slightly different name. This story, the St. Petersburg mayor said, will be told in his next book, which is to be entitled: Once Upon a Time There Was a Communist Party.
