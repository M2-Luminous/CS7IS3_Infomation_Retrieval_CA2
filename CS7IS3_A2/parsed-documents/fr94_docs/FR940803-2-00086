FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Billy Higginbotham, Division Administrator, Federal Highway Administration, 550 Eagan Street, Suite 300, Charleston, West Virginia 25304&hyph;0430.

Telephone (304) 558&hyph;3236. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the West Virginia Division of Highways will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to build a new expressway in Fairmont, West Virginia. The proposed project could involve construction of a new facility which would begin at the Pleasant Valley Interchange of I&hyph;79, cross either the Monongahela River or the Tygart Valley and West Fork Rivers, utilize a railroad right-of-way that runs along Fairmont adjacent to the Monongahela River, and end at U.S. 19 south of Rivesville. The project length is approximately six miles. Improvements in the corridor are considered necessary to reduce congestion in downtown Fairmont, to improve traffic flow, and to create a better environment for economic development. Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action; (2) improvements to existing routes; (3) alternate alignments at both ends and (4) alternate designs for the portion utilizing railroad right-of-way. Following the publishing of this notice of intent in the Federal Register, a formal scoping meeting will be held to provide other Federal and State agencies an opportunity to review the proposed project and to provide early input as to the areas of concern. The draft EIS and other pertinent materials will be made available for public and agency review and comment prior to a public hearing. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided here.
