Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated a few weeks ago that there exist privileged relations, such as the one between the Germans and the Croats, the Americans and the Muslims, and the Russians and the Serbs. Do you think Kozyrev is right, and if so, in which way do such relations influence the peace negotiations? [Jovanovic] That is a simplified assessment of the facts, because there are no such things as privileged relations, but rather merely interests. Privileged relations exist only in the sense that relations are based on common interests. In our case, we believe that as a consequence of the outbreak of the Yugoslav crisis, the interests of foreign powers suddenly increased in the Balkans. Above all, this is most displayed by Germany, which unfortunately bears the greatest part of the responsibility for the tragedy that is happening to us. Besides that, one can now also witness the massive penetration of the United States and Turkey. Russia is a country that is traditionally interested in the Balkans and it will always maintain that interest, because the Balkan region is close to their political and geographic consciousness and important for their own security. As far as we, as a country and a people, are concerned, we are the major victims of the Yugoslav crisis, because from the very beginning we have done everything possible to maintain the former Yugoslavia and to prevent secession as an action directed against people who decided to stay in Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, we did not succeed and that is why difficulties emerged that are now unfolding before our very eyes, especially in Bosnia or Krajina. As far as privileged relations are concerned, above all we are believers in the idea that the international community should adopt a fully unbiased, objective, and non-selective stance with respect to the Yugoslav crisis. That would be the best way of taking into consideration the equal rights of all the parties in the Yugoslav crisis and respecting the legitimate interests and rights of all the peoples who once made up Yugoslavia. We do not expect anyone to be on our side and against others. What we ask for and expect from all countries is that they be on the side of justice, facts, and the truth, and that, by adopting an unbiased stance, they contribute to finding, through the parties involved in the Yugoslav crisis, the proper path leading to rapid settlement [of the conflict]. [Popescu] The normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia is, in the opinion of many people, the key issue of the crisis. That process has already begun with the opening of liaison offices in Belgrade and Zagreb. How do you assess the future evolution of that process? [Jovanovic] Our problems with Croatia began when Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia; Croatia's problems began as a consequence of its unilateral secession by means of force. What we have to do now is find ways to regulate relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the loyal part of Yugoslavia, and the other secessionist republics that are now independent states. We made the first step in that direction and we are interested in achieving full normalization. This can be achieved parallel to successful steps taken to eliminate the negative effects of their secession. First of all I mean Krajina, which now is under the protection of the UN forces, and the political status of which will eventually have to be established by direct negotiations between Knin and Zagreb. Normalization is also related to the great problem of sanctions, because it is in the nature of sanctions that they prevent other countries from establishing political relations and achieving political objectives because of the sanctions. The establishment of diplomatic relations with Croatia, which also presupposes the establishment of normal economic relations, is theoretically and practically impossible as long as the sanctions stay in force. Therefore the sanctions, respectively the decision of the UN Security Council, actually represent an enormous obstacle for the normalization of relations in the Yugoslav region. [Popescu] The sanctions were adopted in view of the situation in Bosnia. Yugoslavia has complied with the preconditions established for their lifting. Have any new preconditions been imposed lately? [Jovanovic] The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was merely formally the cause of the sanctions. Actually, the principal goal is a political one, as they are intended to make the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia capitulate. This means that it is denied the right to dominion over its own country and that it is expected to accept the mercy of foreign power centers. Apart from all this, we are making our own policy, which is directed at achieving peace and the peaceful solution of existing problems. We have complied with all preconditions, that is, the ones stipulated by UN Security Council Resolution 757. However, meanwhile the situation in Bosnia contradicted their initial presuppositions on the basis of which they established the sanctions. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina proved to be a classic civil war, and this has been officially admitted by everyone, including the Security Council. Yugoslavia has never had and does not have a single soldier on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and could not perpetrate any aggression against that country. Furthermore, the Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina could not possibly act as aggressors against their own villages or towns. Civil wars are called civil precisely because they are not wars of aggression. However, certain countries, certain centers of power are trying to complicate and further prolong that crisis and are inventing new preconditions. This proves how little some desire the reestablishment of peace and how much they hope to exploit the situation in Yugoslavia in order to more deeply infiltrate with their interests in this area and achieve their geostrategic goals. There are no grounds, neither official nor political, to link the sanctions to any other issue except the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Any attempt to do otherwise would sabotage the peace efforts to halt the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Popescu] Still, in the last few days Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic declared he was very optimistic. Would you comment on that? [Jovanovic] Despite all the complications and hardships we are all experiencing as a consequence of the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina, we have to be optimistic. First because there is no such thing as a crisis or a problem that cannot be solved. And second, because the current situation is more favorable to achieving peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina than, let us say, the situation six months or a year ago. The number of countries and international entities involved in the solution of the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina -- and that are interested in the reestablishment of peace, stability, and prosperity in this part of Europe -- has increased significantly, whereas the number of countries interested in sabotaging peace is decreasing. The latter are now making their interests known and finding it increasingly difficult to achieve their goals. This is why they are now resorting to camouflaged means, presenting themselves as protectors of rights not related in any way to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina, all three of them, are fed up with war, they do not want war anymore. War is Now only desired by the fundamentalist leadership of the Muslim people, and that is in contradiction of the will and interests of their own Muslim people. They want this war because they are not free to make their own decisions and depend directly on the financial and political support they receive from abroad.
