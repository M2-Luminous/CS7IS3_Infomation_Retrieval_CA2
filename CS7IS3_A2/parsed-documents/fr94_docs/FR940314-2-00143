FR940314-2-00143 FR940314-2-00073 Internal Revenue Service Tax on Certain Imported Substances; Notice of Determination; Bisphenol-A, Etc. AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service, Treasury. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces a determination, under Notice 89&hyph;61, that the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code will be modified to include bisphenol-A and alpha-methylstyrene. EFFECTIVE DATE: This modification is effective July 1, 1990. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary determine whether such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance. This determination is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the determination process. Determination On March 5, 1990, the Secretary determined that bisphenol-A and alpha-methylstyrene should be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, effective July 1, 1990. The rate of tax prescribed for bisphenol-A, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.11 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for benzene of 0.68 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.37. The rate of tax prescribed for alpha-methylstyrene, under section 4671(b)(3), is $4.96 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for benzene of 0.66 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.36. The petitioner is Aristech Chemical Corporation, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. No material comments were received on these petitions. The following information is the basis for the determinations. Bisphenol-A HTS number: 2907.23.00.00 CAS number: 80&hyph;05&hyph;7 Bisphenol-A is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and propylene. Bisphenol-A is a solid produced predominantly by the acid catalyzed reaction of phenol with acetone. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for bisphenol-A is: 2 C 6 H 6 (benzene) + 2 C 3 H 6 (propylene) + 2 O 1 (oxygen) __> C 15 H 16 O 2 (bisphenol-A) + C 3 H 6 O (acetone) + H 2 O (water) Bisphenol-A has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 78.9 percent by weight of the materials used in its production. Alpha-methylstyrene HTS number: 2902.90.00.00 CAS number: 98&hyph;83&hyph;9 Alpha-methylstyrene is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and propylene. Alpha-methylstyrene is a liquid produced predominantly as a byproduct from the cumene oxidation process for the production of phenol-acetone. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for alpha- methylstyrene is: C 6 H 6 (benzene) + C 3 H 6 (propylene) + 0.5 O2 (oxygen) __> C 9 H 10 (alpha-methylstyrene) + H 2 O (water) Alpha-methylstyrene has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 88.2 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
