Last year, nearly 24,000 pilgrims travelled by road to perform the annual pilgrimage. According to information available to us, the Egyptian authorities have demanded that these Algerian pilgrims travel on coaches laid on by tourist agencies and not by private transport, as has been the practice so far. This decision, which applies to all nationals from the Arab Maghreb, is believed to be due to security considerations.
