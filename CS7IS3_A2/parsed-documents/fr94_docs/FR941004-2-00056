FR941004-2-00056 FR941004-2-00031 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;002, et al.] Pacific Gas Transmission Company, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings September 28, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Pacific Gas Transmission Company [Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;002] Take notice that on September 26, 1994, Pacific Gas Transmission Company (PGT), 160 Spear Street, San Francisco, California, 94105&hyph;1570, filed an Amendment to its Application in Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;000 and 001. In this proceeding, PGT is requesting a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity under Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, and Part 157, Subpart A of the Commission's Regulations. PGT seeks to construct and operate two extensions of its mainline facilities_the Coyote Springs Extension and the Medford Extension. These extensions would be used to provide firm transportation service to Portland General Electric Company (Portland General) and WP Natural Gas, a division of The Washington Water Power Company (Wash. Water), respectively. PGT proposes to recover the incremental cost-of-service of the respective extensions through surcharges to its existing FTS&hyph;1 Rate Schedule. In this amendment, PGT details the specific surcharge rate treatment for the volumes to be shipped by Portland General and Wash. Water over the two proposed extensions. PGT's proposal is more fully set forth in the application and amendments which are on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, PGT requests approval of a deferred cost recovery mechanism for part of Wash. Water's service on the Medford Extension. PGT states that the deferred mechanism does not alter the proposed incremental rate structure for service on the proposed extensions. PGT also states that the deferred mechanism is designed to permit Wash. Water to remain competitive with competing electric rates in its service area, and afford PGT an opportunity to recover the life cycle cost-of-service for the service for Wash. Water's on a deferred basis. PGT proposes to file annual reports containing the adjusted Wash. Water rate and related information on any deferred balance. Lastly, PGT proposes to recover the cost of extensions based upon a straight-line depreciation schedule which is equal to the length of the transportation agreements for each extension. For service to Portland General over the Coyote Springs Extension, the term of the contract is 20 years. For service to Wash. Water over the Medford Extension the, the term of the contracts is 30 years, (there are two contracts between PGT and Wash. Water). Comment date: October 14, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. However, any person who has already filed an intervention(s) in Docket No. CP93&hyph;618, et al. , need not file again. 2.
