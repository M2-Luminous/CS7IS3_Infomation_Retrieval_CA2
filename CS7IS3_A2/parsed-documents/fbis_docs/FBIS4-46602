The Sevastopol City Council, pursuing anti-state activity aimed at the departure of Crimea from Ukraine and the dissolution of Ukrainian statehood, resolved to conduct a poll on June 26 with the question, "Do you favor the status of the city of Sevastopol as the main base for the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation in accordance with the Russian-Ukrainian protocol of September 1993?" It simultaneously proposes the redeployment of the Ukrainian Navy from Sevastopol to some other city. "We feel that such appeals are anti-state. The City Council does not have the right to assume the functions of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The population does not have the right to determine the basing location of the Black Sea Fleet through a poll," indicates the statement.
