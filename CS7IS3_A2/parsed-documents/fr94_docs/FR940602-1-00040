FR940602-1-00040 FR940602-1-00013 (d) At least two legs of all strongback and pontoon bridles shall be equipped with a fibre lanyard at least 8 feet (2.4 m) long and in good condition. The bridle end of the lanyard shall be of chain or wire. §1918.43 Handling hatch beams and covers. Paragraphs (f)(2), (g), and (h) of this section apply only to folding, sliding, or hinged metal hatch covers or to those hatch covers handled by cranes. (a) (1) When hatch covers or pontoons are stowed on the weather deck abreast of hatches, they shall be arranged in stable piles not closer than 3 feet (.91 m) from the hatch coaming except, when on the working side of the hatch, they are spread one high between coaming and bulwark with no space between them and with not less than a 24-inch height of hatch coaming maintained. Under no circumstances shall hatch covers or pontoons be stacked higher than the hatch coaming or bulwark on the working side of the hatch. (2) On seagoing vessels, hatch boards or similar covers removed from the hatch beams in a section of partially opened hatch during cargo handling, cleaning or other operations, shall not be stowed on those left in place within that section. (b) Hatch beams shall be laid on their sides, or stood on edge close together and lashed. Except that: This paragraph (b) shall not apply in cases where hatch beams are of such design that: (1) The width of the flange is 50 percent or more of the height of the web; and (2) The flange rests flat on the deck when the hatch beam is stood upright. (c) Strongbacks, hatch covers, and pontoons removed from hatch openings and placed on the weather deck shall not obstruct clear fore and aft or coaming to bulwark passageways and shall be lashed or otherwise secured to prevent accidental dislodgement. Dunnage or other suitable material shall be placed under each tier, to prevent strongbacks and hatch covers from sliding, when stowed on steel decks. (d) Hatch covers unshipped in an intermediate deck shall be placed at least 3 feet (.91 m) from the coaming or they shall be removed to another deck. Strongbacks unshipped in an intermediate deck shall not be placed closer than 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the coaming, and if placed closer than 3 feet (.91 m), they shall be secured so that they cannot be tipped or dragged into a lower compartment. If such placement or securement is not possible, strongbacks shall be removed to another deck. (e) Any hatch beam or pontoon left in place adjacent to an open hatch section being worked shall be locked or otherwise secured, so that it cannot be accidently displaced. All portable, manually handled hatch covers, including those bound together to make a larger cover, shall be removed from any working section, and adjacent sections, unless securely lashed. (f) (1) The roller hatch beam at the edge of the open section of the hatch shall be lashed or pinned back so that it cannot be moved toward the open section. (2) Rolling, sectional or telescopic hatch covers of barges which open in a fore and aft direction shall be secured while in the open position against unintentional movement. (g) Hinged or folding hatch covers normally stowed in an approximately vertical position shall be positively secured when in the upright position, unless the design of the system otherwise prohibits unintentional movement. (h) Hatches shall not be opened or closed while employees are in the square of the hatch below. (i) All unsecured materials such as dunnage, lashings, twist-locks, or stacking cones shall be removed from the hatch cover before the hatch cover is moved. (j) When a hatch is to be covered, hatch covers or night tents shall be used. Any covering which only partially covers the hatch, such as alternate hatch covers or strips of dunnage, shall not be covered by a tarpaulin. Except that: A tarpaulin may be used to cover an open or partially open hatch in order to reduce dust emissions during bulk cargo loading operations, provided that employees are prevented from walking on top of the tarpaulin. Subpart F_Vessel's Cargo Handling Gear §1918.51 General requirements. (See also §1918.11). (a) Neither the safe working load as specified in the cargo gear certification papers, nor any safe working load marked on the booms, shall be exceeded. Any limitations imposed by the certificating authority shall be adhered to. (b) All components of cargo handling gear, including tent gantlines and associated rigging, shall be inspected by the employer or by a designated representative of the employer before each use and at intervals during use. Any gear which is found to be unsafe shall not be used until it is made safe. (c) The following limitations shall apply to the use of wire rope as a part of the ship's cargo handling gear: (1) Eye splices in wire ropes shall have at least three tucks with a whole strand of the rope and two tucks with one-half of the wire cut from each strand. Other forms of splices or connections which provide the same level of safety may be used; (2) Except for eye splices in the ends of wires, each wire rope used in hoisting or lowering, in guying derricks, or as a topping lift, preventer, segment of a multi-part preventer, or pendant, shall consist of one continuous piece without knot or splice; and (3) Wire rope or wire rope slings exhibiting any of the conditions specified in §1918.62(b)(4) (i) through (vi) shall not be used. (d) Natural and synthetic fibre rope slings exhibiting any of the conditions specified in §1918.62(e) (1) through (7) shall not be used.
