The first unit left from Valledupar. On orders from the Army Staff, 240 professional soldiers of the 35th Counterguerrilla Battalion traveled to the Uraba region this morning. All of the soldiers are young men between 20 and 25 years of age who are experienced in fighting subversives. For a year the troops have covered the mountains of regions where the irregulars are most active. For the last six months the soldiers have fought between the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Perija Hills against FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] and ELN [Army of National Liberation] guerrillas, who continuously intimidate the citizens and cattle ranchers of Cesar Department. [Begin German Guillermo Perico, commander of the 35th Counterguerrilla Battalion, recording; identified by caption] We will support military operations in the rural area and do our part to attain the peace that Colombia needs so much. [end recording] The Army's strategy in the Uraba region is to increase the presence of the public force to exercise greater control in this conflict area. Another counterguerrilla battalion could also be sent to that banana-producing region over the next few days. This counterguerrilla mobile unit will fight the dissident group of the EPL [Popular Liberation Army] and the FARC, who are responsible for killings in the rural areas of the Uraba region in Antioquia Department.
