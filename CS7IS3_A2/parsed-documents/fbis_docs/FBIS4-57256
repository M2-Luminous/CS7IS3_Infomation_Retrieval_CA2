Castro granted an interview to ESTADO in which he spoke about the economic blockade imposed on Cuba, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's position on the blockade, and Cuban policies. He was rather confused about the situation of former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who is now running for a seat in the Senate. "Here in Brazil officials must resign their posts six months before the elections if they want to compete in them," Magalhaes explained. "You are addicted to holding elections every month," Castro joked, provoking laughs among the guests of a banquet in his honor offered by Governor Antonio Imbassahy at Ondina Palace. He provoked even louder laughs when he said he was surprised to find so few presidential candidates in Brazil this year: "Brazilians could even reach the conclusion that a single candidate policy might be best." [Talento] What is Cuba doing to break the economic embargo? [Castro] We are doing everything possible. There is a movement against the blockade that is gaining momentum in the United States. Only two or three nations support the blockade in the United Nations. Cuba resisted, is resisting, and will continue to resist. [Talento] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva called for an end to the blockade against Cuba during his visit to the United States. What is your opinion on his position? [Castro] I appreciate it a lot. He always held that position. Many politicians and, in general, many members of progressive and democratic groups in the world are also opposed to the blockade. [Talento] What are your expectations regarding the economic plan now under implementation in Cuba? [Castro] It is not a new economic plan. We are implementing a series of measures. We are developing an opening adjusted to the special conditions we are living under today, without renouncing our social victories. The National Assembly adopted a series of measures seeking to straighten out our internal financial situation. [Talento] What do these new measures change? [Castro] They seek to reduce the excessive volume of money in circulation. Despite our current difficulties we did not throw anyone into the streets, or sacrifice our social and educational programs. [Talento] Are there any changes in public utility rates? [Castro] Yes. We changed some utility rates. We adjusted electricity and fuel prices. We also increased taxes on superfluous items, such as cigarettes and cigars. We will try to maintain basic items' current prices. [Talento] The world is splitting into markets. What prevents Latin America from having its own market? [Castro] The U.S. economy is in crisis as a result of the strong competition from other blocs (Europe, Asia), and wants to control the Latin American market completely. But many Latin American countries have stronger trade relations with Europe than with the United States. These countries have the obligation to defend regional mechanisms such as Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Andean Pact, or the Central American market in order to prevent the United States from completely absorbing them. [Talento] There is a lot of talk about Cuba's need to implement political reform. Is there any trend pointing in that direction? [Castro] There is a tendency to ignore all the reforms introduced by Cuba in the past few years. These reforms have just as much quality and democratic spirit than the reforms made by many other countries. But we do not have access to the multinationals that control the information, and our reforms are little known. [Talento] Do you still have another meeting after you leave here today (it was after 0100)? [Castro] I have a meeting with Morpheus [one of the gods of dreams in Greek mythology]. (laughs) [Talento] Will you visit the city? [Castro] I am in a hurry to return. I have been away from Cuba for over a week. [Talento] At what time are you leaving? [Castro] It is a military secret. (laughs)
