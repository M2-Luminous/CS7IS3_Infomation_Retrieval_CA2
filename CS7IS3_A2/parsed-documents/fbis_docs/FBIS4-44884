The future possibility will include the expansion of the city by tenfold, indicating a new opportunity for development of Sino-Japanese cooperation scheme. The Nanjing International Airport construction project ranks high in importance in China, aiming for the end of 1996 as a target date for the completion of the first phase of the construction work. Jiang Ning Province's Lu Kou Zhen, where the airport will be constructed, is positioned at the south shore of the Chang River approximately 30 km south of Nanjing. Here the international industrial city, a site of participating countries' high-tech research industries, will be constructed. In addition to the industrial zone, commerce, public administration, and residential zones will be established. As facilities, international conference halls, trade fair halls, universities, and management/maintenance buildings can be considered. China will be responsible for improving infrastructures. Within from 3 to 5 years' time, foreign companies will be able to move into the city. In the future, China is considering expanding the city to cover an area of up to 6,600 hectares. JTTAS plans to provide Japanese businesses with information on the project by June. As for attracting companies from Korea, Taiwan, the U.S., and Hong Kong, JTTAS will establish a third sector, fully cooperating with China in this matter.
