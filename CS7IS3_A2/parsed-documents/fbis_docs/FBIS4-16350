According to Valentyn Landyk, the general situation with gas does not evoke concern at present. The problem mainly lies in the fact that payments for the gas supplied are not made in time. For example, today our debt to Russia in this sphere reaches 600 million dollars. It was reported that a mechanism of settling accounts with Russia's Gazprom had been worked out during the negotiations held by our governmental delegation in Moscow on 12 April. It is envisaged that half of our debt will be paid off at the expense of the deliveries of Ukrainian-made pipes, pumps, and electrical equipment. Also, an agreement was reached on storing 10 billion cubic meters of Russian gas in our gas-holders and on paying relevant compensation to Ukraine for this. Valentyn Landyk also reported that national joint-stock company UkrHazProm would be set up in the near future. He expressed certainty that the problem of energy sources in our state would be solved by the end of the next year. It is envisaged that 37 billion cubic meters of gas and seven million tons of oil will be extracted in Ukraine itself.
