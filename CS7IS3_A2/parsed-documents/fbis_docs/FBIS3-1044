Speaking in Ulundi at a luncheon after the opening of the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly, King Zwelithini said it was "foolishness" to believe there could be a free and fair election in kwaZulu "when the election is being foisted on people without their approval". "If anyone believes that the vast majority of blacks in the kwaZulu/Natal region want an election, they can only be right to the extent that those people have not heard their king and their traditional prime minister (Mangosuthu Buthelezi) say `no' to their participation in the election." The Zulu monarch said he had never attempted to dissuade any Zulu from belonging to the political party of their choice. However, if he called an imbizo (traditional gathering) at which Zulus heard him admonish parties which approved the interim constitution, "they will not vote in the elections". "The word will spread rapidly that this election is death to `Zulu-ness' and that it must be resisted at all costs." He added that Zulu nationalism, irrespective of party politics, would gather in strength through "rolling Zulu mass action". Although stopping short of calling for a poll boycott the king said: "I will not encourage my people to enter the elections, enter the polling booths, and destroy the kingdom." On his demands for a sovereign monarchy, King Zwelithini expressed his frustration at "tedious discussions, as though the South African Government had some kind of proprietary right to the soul of the Zulu people". The king insisted his demands be dealt with immediately, saying he was not prepared to leave the future of the Zulu kingdom in the hands of a nationally-elected government. "The present constitution is totally unacceptable to me," he repeated, saying it would lead to the demise of the Zulu nation. He commended Mr Buthelezi's initiative on international mediation in the constitutional impasse, but added: "As far as I am concerned, mediation must be pinned to the question of entry into elections."
