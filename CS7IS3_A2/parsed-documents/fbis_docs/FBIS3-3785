After investigating a complaint filed by Taiwan Polypropylene Corp., the ministry's Tariff Commission found that 10 Japanese and eight South Korean polypropylene makers had sold their products to Taiwan at prices lower than fair market value. The commission decided to impose anti-dumping taxes ranging between 5.16 percent and 68.71 percent on polypropylene imports from those companies. The tax rates vary with import quantities and prices. The commission will also levy anti-dumping taxes on high-density and low-density polyethylene imports from five South Korean companies, including Daewoo, Samsung and Hyundai. The tax rates will range between 6.05 percent and 9.45 percent, retroactive to Feb. 25. A Finance Ministry official said the government has levied 6.77 to 29.16 percent temporary anti-dumping taxes on the five Korean firms since Feb. 25. As investigations showed the tax rates should not have been so high, the official said, the government will refund the excess tax revenues. The Tariff Commission is also investigating a dumping charge filed by Li Chang Yung Chemical Industry Corp. against some Japanese Penta Manufacturers and will decide whether to impose anti-dumping taxes on those makers next month, the official said. Taiwan has become more aggressive in handling dumping charges in response to mounting complaints by local manufacturers that many foreign companies have cashed in on Taiwan's trade liberalization policy by dumping their goods here. Finance Ministry sources said many dumping charges involve South Korean petrochemical and steel makers.
