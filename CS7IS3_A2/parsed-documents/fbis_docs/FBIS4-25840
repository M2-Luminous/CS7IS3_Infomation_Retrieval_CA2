The article is exciting and enlightening. The pioneering spirit of working hard with perseverance is the concrete embodiment of the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation as well as the quintessence of the pioneering spirit Comrade Jiang Zemin advocates during the new period. It has crystallized the national soul and sparkles with the light of the times. Materialist dialectics tells us that the basic impetus pushing the development of things lies in their internal movement of contradiction; the internal cause is the grounds for change, whereas the external cause is the conditions for the change. That being the case, the pioneering spirit of working hard with perseverance is applicable not only to those areas where the natural conditions are bad but also to other areas and trades; it is applicable not only to past years wherein the planned economy was mainly practiced but also today, when we are developing the socialist market economy and conducting modernization. True, the economic growth rate and the work accomplishments of a locality or department depend on their objective conditions. However, more importantly, they also depend on the efforts of the cadres and masses in the locality or department as to whether or not they boast the pioneering spirit of working hard with perseverance and going all out to make the country strong, as Linzhou's cadres and masses have displayed. Should cadres and masses work in concert, engage in their undertakings with one heart and soul, and follow the example of Linzhou in building a new project akin to the "Red Flag Canal" in reform, opening up, and economic development, those places with poor natural conditions will also become prosperous! Currently, China is in a period in which the new structure is replacing the old, reform is in a stage of tackling bottlenecks to resolve problems at deeper levels, and with greater scope in economic construction undertakings, hence the tasks are more arduous. This precisely calls for powerful political insurance and spiritual pillars. Compared with the past, our material conditions are now much better; however, should we be content with things as they are, not seek to make progress, forget the spirit of devotion, and give up the fine tradition of working hard with perseverance, we will lose the powerful spiritual impetus and we will bring extremely great losses to our cause. To bring forth the pioneering spirit of working hard with perseverance, party organizations at various levels must give full play to the role of a fighting bastion and the broad party members should play an exemplary role in taking the lead. For a long time, the mayor of Linzhou has precisely persisted in augmenting building party organizations at various levels, with party members taking the lead in playing an exemplary role. For the masses' common prosperity, Linzhou's Communists would rather sacrifice their personal interests to lead the masses to work hard in pioneering undertakings to strive for common prosperity. We believe that, with such party organizations, and party members, and people like those in Linzhou, the pioneering spirit of working hard with perseverance will pass from one generation to another and the socialist cause of reform and opening up will develop vigorously, flourishing with each passing day.
