"We took our base back at 12:45 P.M., captured eight government tanks in good condition and destroyed seven," the Khmer Rouge spokesman in the capital told AFP. Casualty figures were not yet confirmed, he said. The spokesman said the 3,000 guerrillas attacked and forced back some 7,000 government troops. "I am very excited to hear we can get back our houses," he said. The Khmer Rouge need to clear mines around the town, "then we can bring back the people who lived there before," the spokesman said. Co-Defence Minister Tie Banh, speaking from Battambang, admitted that the Khmer Rouge had recaptured part of Pailin. "But remember Pailin is a very big place," he said. "Some of our troops are countering the attack and there is fighting going on there." Tie Banh said the government had only six tanks in operation at Pailin and questioned how the guerrillas could talk about 15 tanks. Other military officials said the situation in Pailin was not yet clear. "We should wait until tomorrow," one general said. "The nature of military (operations) is like that, there is pushing up and down," he said. Co-premier Hun Sen also went to Battambang Province Tuesday, a government official said. The region's military headquarters is based in the city of Battambang, around 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Pailin. Military officials, confirmed there was shelling in Pailin early Tuesday and increased fighting in the area was been reported during the past week. A Western diplomat, however, cautioned there was "no hard evidence" to confirm the fall of Pailin. "The government was pouring all sorts of resources into the area. So even if they were knocked out of Pailin town, they could be in a good position to take it back," the diplomat said. The government forces captured Pailin March 19 and the Khmer Rouge, rather than face them in a conventional battle, retreated from the town and melted into the hills to the west along the Thai border. Generals said the capture of the resource-rich area was a major blow to the notorious guerrilla faction opposing the government that emerged from the UN-sponsored elections last May. The Khmer Rouge financed their organisation by selling gem-mining and logging concessions, primarily to Thai business consortia, many of which were reported to have links with the Thai military. The government commanders said at the time that if they could not hold Pailin "they did not deserve to be called the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces." The commanders swore that they would not let Pailin suffer the same fate as Anlung Veng, another major guerrilla base which the government forces seized -- only to be routed several weeks later when the guerrillas launched a major counter-attack. King Norodom Sihanouk expressed his support for the government's seizure of Pailin, and described the offensive as "legitimate, unavoidable and most laudable." But the king warned the victory could be a "double-edged sword" and the army could be entering a situation akin to Dien Bien Phu, where a static French force fell to a nimble force of Vietnamese guerrillas. If the guerrillas recaptured Pailin, it would seriously undermine government's and the army's credibility and morale and "hypothetically could threaten the very future of our new regime," the king said. Western military analysts had predicted that the guerrillas might try to recapture their base when the rainy season started in May-June. The rains would turn the already difficult supply routes into almost impassable, treacherous trails of mud, they said.
