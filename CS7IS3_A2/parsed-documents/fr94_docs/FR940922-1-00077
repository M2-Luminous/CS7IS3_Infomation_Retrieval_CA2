Authority: Secs. 201, 301, 501, 502, 503, 505, 506, 507, 510, 513&hyph;520, 701, 702, 703, 704, 705, 706, and 708 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 331, 351, 352, 353, 355, 356, 357, 360, 360c&hyph;360j, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, and 379); sec. 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262). §54.1 Purpose. (a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates clinical studies submitted in marketing applications as required by law for new human drugs and biological products and marketing applications and reclassification petitions for medical devices. (b) The agency reviews data generated in these clinical studies to determine whether the applications are approvable under the statutory requirements. FDA may consider clinical studies inadequate and the data inadequate if, among other things, appropriate steps have not been taken in the design, conduct, reporting, and analysis of the studies to minimize bias. One potential source of bias in clinical studies is a financial interest of the clinical investigator in the outcome of the study, either because the amount of compensation the investigator receives may be influenced by the outcome of the study, or because the investigator has a financial interest in the product under study or in the sponsor of the marketing application. This section and conforming regulations require the sponsor of a marketing application that relies in part on clinical data to disclose certain financial arrangements between the sponsor and its clinical investigators and certain interests of the clinical investigators in the product or in the sponsor. FDA will use this information, in conjunction with information about the design and purpose of the study, as well as information obtained through on-site inspections, in the agency's assessment of the reliability of the data. §54.2 Definitions. For the purposes of this part: (a) Compensation affected by the outcome of clinical studies means compensation that could be higher for a favorable outcome than for an unfavorable outcome, such as compensation explicitly greater in the event of a favorable result, or compensation to the investigator in the form of an equity interest in the sponsor's company or in the form of compensation tied to sales of the product, such as a royalty interest. (b) Significant equity interest in the applicant means any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial interest whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices, or any equity interest in a publicly traded corporation that exceeds 5 percent of total equity.
