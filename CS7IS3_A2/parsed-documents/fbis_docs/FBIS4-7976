Kaczmarek in Szczecin: Privatization of Shipyard a Success"] [Text] "The privatization of the Szczecin Shipyard is one of the most successful prototype models of privatization of Polish enterprises and of the whole process of ownership transformations," Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek said yesterday during a meeting with the leaders and representatives of the shipyard's trade unions. "Thanks to it," he added, "the shipyard returned to life from the condition of clinical death and entered a phase of development that can legitimately be the envy of other enterprises." During yesterday's visit to Szczecin, Wieslaw Kaczmarek, head of the Ownership Transformations Ministry, met first with the Szczecin Voivoda and a group of people representing various local institutions, including the Treasury Chamber, the Economic Tribunal, the West Pomeranian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, an employers union, and the region's sugar-manufacturing plants. The longest amount of time was devoted to the sugar-manufacturing industry and the projects to create holding groups to bring sugar-manufacturing plants together. There is a proposal stipulating that such holding groups should be set up before this year's sugar-refining campaign--that is, by August at the latest. The sugar manufacturers agreed with the proposal and added that, while they view the questions of ownership transformations as important, they regard the matter of proper organization of the sugar market--that is, an efficient sugar sales system designed to protect them against mounting interest liabilities on the loans they had taken out--as even more essential to them now. There was also discussion on the subject of ownership transformations in Szczecin Voivodship, backed up by figures and examples quoted to illustrate the current situation. During the visit to the Szczecin Shipyard that came next on his agenda, the minister spoke with approval of the shipyard management's achievements. However, he also observed that the tragedy of Polish shipyards consisted in the fact that each of them had its own, different political sponsor. "It would be best if these sponsors withdrew from that particular role and looked at the shipyards from the perspective of economic interests," Minister Kaczmarek added. Going back to the questions of privatization and the distribution of shares, the minister suggested to the trade union representatives that they abandon the demand that 5 percent of shares be allocated to their unions and, instead, have them placed in a pension fund as long-term capital investment against the future pensions of employees who are currently working at the shipyard. At the headquarters of the Board of Directors of the Port of Szczecin and Swinoujscie, where another press conference took place, the minister spoke in favor of preserving a uniform model for the port complex of Szczecin and Swinoujscie. He said that he would support this view in parliament during the coming Sejm debate on the maritime ports act. In the afternoon, Minister W. Kaczmarek met with the employees of the Ownership Transformations Ministry's Szczecin agency, and later with the directors of three large construction firms: ESPEBEPE SA [joint-stock company] Holding, Mostostal, and SPBO Trojka. Next on the minister's agenda came an open meeting with political activists representing the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] group. During the debate, the participants voiced an equal number of reservations about the methods used in the privatization process and its social and economic effects, and acknowledgments of the soundness of arguments pointing to the evident progress in the implementation of the Polish model of ownership transformations. A large number of questions asked and points raised concerned matters extending far beyond the minister's brief in relation to his sector.
