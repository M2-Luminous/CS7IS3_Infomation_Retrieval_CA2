Representatives of the Democratic Union announced some time ago that they would run independently. This will be no easy test for them. We talked to Jozef Moravcik, chairman of the Democratic Union and prime minister, about this difficulty and other issues. [Melicharkova] After our interview several months ago, you said in a certain context that you were not afraid of anything. Are you not afraid of the coming elections and their results? When you look at the results of the current public opinion polls.... [Moravcik] I am not at all afraid of the elections. To run in the elections, you need determination, above all. We have enough determination and the needed amount of self-confidence to run in the elections. We are trying to draft a very serious program that will be convincing--that is, we are creating the conditions for obtaining positive results in the elections. What is important is that we perform our duties well in order to convince the people that this style of government and politics, above all, are viable and capable of solving long-term problems of development in Slovakia. The current public opinion polls confirm that the coalition that has formed the government could continue. We will try to improve its position. [Melicharkova] Do you anticipate that this or a similar government coalition could exist after the elections? [Moravcik] This is one of the alternatives, and, in my opinion, it is quite likely. [Melicharkova] You intend to present a summary of your government's activity to parliament before the elections. What do you consider to be the greatest success of your government Cabinet? [Moravcik] We would like to develop in the economic field some activities that would stimulate development, which means outweighing a certain restriction that we have to impose in the state budget. This restriction is inevitable but should be counterbalanced by development stimuli. This is what we want to secure in the period before the elections. [Melicharkova] The coalition government is a very interesting compromise, and its seems to be a good one for Slovakia. On the other hand, this coalition is very fragile. The most interesting solutions are reportedly reached during strong differences of opinion. Have you ever experienced a tough conflict or difference of opinion in your government? [Moravcik] We cannot speak of conflicts. A difference of opinion is very natural and happens very often. It is quite a usual working method and a usual way of solving problems. From this point of view, everything is all right. Regarding the basic problem, I believe this coalition is less fragile than the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] was. The HZDS was unable to retain its compactness. It was unable to keep its election results. I am convinced that this coalition is stronger and capable of exercising its power in the period for which it has received a mandate or in the period for which it could possibly receive a mandate after the elections. [Melicharkova] It is often said that you have a calming effect on people. Was this not your main trait that you used to appeal to the people? Public opinion polls show that you are catching up with your predecessor. Or is there another reason for that? [Moravcik] Personally, I have never analyzed this problem, so I will leave it up to the people. Maybe everything you said plays a part. I believe that the Slovak electorate is very rational and can very well express or reflect values that are important for Slovakia in this or that period. Maybe in this very period it is important to be able to calm the public and introduce a certain amount of discretion into decisionmaking. [Melicharkova] One of our readers says that you are an artist when it comes to diplomatic answers. According to her, you can speak for a long time and say nothing. Why do politicians give diplomatic answers from time to time? [Moravcik] I only speak exceptionally for a long time. I always try to say what is essential. [Melicharkova] The Democratic Union wants to be a liberal party, but, in our part of the world, it has not been clearly explained yet what liberalism actually is. At a conference in the United States not so long ago, J. Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement, defined liberalism as being very dangerous. What is liberalism, which the Democratic Union, of which you are the chairman, is going to push for? [Moravcik] Liberalism is a basic orientation. We are interested in establishing a skeleton program for the development of Slovakia in which the basic ideas of liberalism would be used. Many publications and books have been written about the essence of liberalism. Liberalism emphasizes human values, human beings, and their responsibility. Liberal policy is also oriented that way. If we speak about economy, this policy is based on individual initiative, which means private ownership and emphasis on the responsibility of the individual not only in the sphere of economy but also in other spheres. For example, in the social sphere, liberalism prefers activities of the nongovernmental sector, various foundations, and similar organizations to the paternalism of the state, even if some paternalism cannot be avoided. Our intention is to create conditions for the people to be able to solve basic problems themselves, while the state should intervene where people are unable to solve these problems by their own activities or through institutions under civil law. This policy, in which the individual and his development have a central place, is based on support for education because education and cultural development, in fact, intensify the significance of the individual in society. Those are, in a certain sense, basic directions. [Melicharkova] When you speak about the responsibility of the individual, what is the responsibility of the politician according to this philosophy? [Moravcik] He secures the execution of the political power, state power, in a direction that makes it possible to develop society's mechanisms on these principles. This means that a liberal politician, above all, has to make it possible for the people to be able to secure the development of their own character and thus the development of society as a whole. [Melicharkova] Governments are either successful or unsuccessful according to the extent to which they are able to secure economic development, which is closely linked to cooperation with economic experts. Whom do you consider to be the top expert in Slovakia? If we look at the Czech Republic, the country is swarming with economists. What is your opinion of Prime Minister Klaus's policy in that respect? [Moravcik] Regarding your question on whom I consider to be the best economist...? I am a proponent of teamwork. I do not see any prominent person in Slovakia whom I could describe in that way. However, we have a lot of wise and competent experts, many of whom have a good chance of becoming good politicians. Regarding Mr. Klaus, I highly respect him as a politician. Above all, I appreciate his ability to make an unequivocal analysis that enables him to pinpoint and describe the essence of the matter very quickly and make a decision. Then there is the consistency in his policy. Despite the fact that I do not always agree with him politically, I have to respect the methods he is using. [Melicharkova] My previous question was also linked to the question of who would be a better prime minister, an economist or a lawyer.... Do you see any advantages in the prime minister being a professional? [Moravcik] This can have certain advantages. However, a politician should be universal--that is, the said criteria are only auxiliary. Of course, it depends on the function. You mentioned the function of prime minister: Here, universality is very important. The experience he acquires during his studies, as well as practical experience later on, is very important. However, professional orientation is only an auxiliary aspect. [passage omitted]
