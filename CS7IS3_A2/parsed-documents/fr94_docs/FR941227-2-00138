FR941227-2-00138 FR941227-2-00089 [Release No. 34&hyph;35117; File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;94&hyph;15] Self-Regulatory Organizations; the Midwest Securities Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change Deferring Its Next Annual Meeting December 19, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on November 4, 1994, the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;94&hyph;15) as described in Items I and II below, which items have been prepared primarily by MSTC. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change MSTC proposes to defer its next annual meeting until the regularly scheduled meeting in April 1995. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The Commission recently approved certain changes to MSTC's Rules and By-laws relating to the election of MSTC's Board of Directors. 2 MSTC's 1994 annual meeting was originally postponed because of the pending rule filing. Pursuant to the Commission's order approving the filing, the size of the MSTC Board was expanded to thirty-one, the same size as the Board of its parent, the Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX''). The filing also amended MSTC's By-laws to make the members of the MSTC Board and nominating committee the same as those of the CHX. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34608 (October 13, 1994), 59 FR 46074 [File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;94&hyph;09]. The Commission concluded at that time that the new rules were consistent with the fair representation requirements under the Act. The CHX/MSTC nominating committee imminently will be commencing deliberations for its slate of candidate for the 1995 annual meetings, of CHX, MCC, and MSTC to be held in April 1995. Because of this, MSTC and its shareholder CHX do not believe that it is in the best interests of MSTC to have a 1994 annual meeting in such close proximity to the 1995 annual meeting. To do so will not only make the nominating committee's work extremely difficult ( i.e., preparing for two meetings at once) but also could confuse participants of MSTC. Thus the purpose of the proposal is to avoid the confusion and burden of holding a 1994 annual meeting within a few months of the scheduled date of the 1995 annual meeting. The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17(A)(b)(3)(F) of the Act in that it fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements on Burden on Competition. MSTC believes that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others MSTC neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of the clearing agency foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 3 The proposal to not hold the 1994 annual meeting so close to the regularly scheduled 1995 annual meeting should avoid confusion among the participants arising from having to consider two director elections within a few months. ( I.e., directors elected in 1994 would only serve for the few months prior to the 1995 election held during the 1995 Board meeting.) In addition, the limited term of a few months for a Board elected at this time could create confusion for participants. 3 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). The proposal to not hold the 1994 annual meeting also should avoid the financial burden of holding two annual meetings within such a short period of time. The Commission agrees with MSTC that the burden and costs of holding a 1994 annual meeting at this time would be greatly in excess of its usefulness. Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that the rules of the clearing agency assure fair representation of its shareholders and participant in the selection of its directors. 4 Because the current Board was elected pursuant to MSTC rules designed to assure such fair representation, the Commission believes that retaining the current Board for a few additional months until the successor Board can be elected in an orderly fashion is consistent with the fair representation requirements under the Act. 4 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(C) (1988). MSTC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule because in order to hold their 1995 annual meeting in April, MSTC must begin preparations now. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of MSTC. All submissions should refer to the File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;94&hyph;15 and should be submitted by January 17, 1995. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;94&hyph;15) is hereby approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 5 5 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
