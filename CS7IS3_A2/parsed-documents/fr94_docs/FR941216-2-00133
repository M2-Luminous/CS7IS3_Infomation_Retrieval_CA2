FR941216-2-00133 FR941216-2-00079 [NAFTA_00224] Scab Rock Feeders, Incorporated, Othello, WA; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On October 27, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for NAFTA-Transitional Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on October 6, 1994 and was published in the Federal Register on October 21, 1994 (59 FR 53212). The petitioner claims that the imported cattle from Canada has been a major factor in the decline of Scab Rock Feeders. Also, the workers were certified earlier under petition TA&hyph;W&hyph;23,045. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claims are of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 7th day of December 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Progarm Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30911 Filed 12&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
