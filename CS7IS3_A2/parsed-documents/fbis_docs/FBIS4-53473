The biannual meeting was held to evaluate implementation of a set of measures both parties agreed during the paper trade talks in April 1992. A U.S. official who attended the meeting told reporters that the two countries discussed "several areas" of the world's second largest paper and paperboard market. But he refused to disclose the contents of the talks. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, only said, "we have yet to see results confirming a substantial increase in foreign access to the Japanese market." The official said the foreign share of the Japanese paper market was only 3.9 percent at the end of 1993, up only 0.2 percentage point from 1991. The official cited what Washington views as "the highly structured distribution system" and "discriminatory corporate purchasing practices" as major factors to thwart smooth American penetration of the 32 billion dollar market. Due to these "systemic obstacles, persistent and strong efforts by the world-class competitor" in other markets have not been rewarded, the official said.
