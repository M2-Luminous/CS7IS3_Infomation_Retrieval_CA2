I would like to stress that there will be no interpretation here, thus the foreign journalists should do their own interpretation. I know that you must have received the statement and communique of the Royal Government concerning this matter. I also know that Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, had already informed you and all our compatriots of the outcome of the Pyongyang meeting. I know also that our journalists might want to know about everything, or just a little more detail if not everything. This is why this conference is being held. I will not make a statement, but just spend all the time answering your questions. [Reporter] After leaving Pyongyang, did you travel to any other countries? Did you achieve any success during your trip to each of those countries? [Hun Sen] This trip was quite different from the previous ones. Someone may wonder why members of the joint delegation led by the National Assembly chairman and the two prime ministers made the trip on different planes. I must stress that it was because we were afraid of the risk involved if we took the same plane. Therefore, Samdech Chea Sim, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, and I agreed to make the trip separately on different planes. That was how the trip was made. As for me, after leaving Pyongyang, I went to Beijing. There were no specific discussions, except visiting some places there. My trip to Bangkok can be regarded as a significant blazing of the trail. I stopped in Bangkok on the way home as a guest of the Thai Foreign Ministry. I did not hold any official discussions with Thai officials, however. As you all know, I have many old friends in Bangkok. Therefore, following a period of tension in the relations between Cambodia and Thailand, I think that my stay in Bangkok can be said to have political significance. That is, it constituted a resumption of dialogue after a period of interruption. My meeting with a number of old friends constituted a discussion to seek mutual understanding and ways to solve the problems between our two countries. We think that all problems between our two countries can be solved because Thailand and Cambodia will always be neighbors. Therefore, we need to resolve all problems through peaceful means. This means that we do not want to confront several problems at the same time. The present problem with the Khmer Rouge is more than enough trouble for us. We do not want any problems, particularly with neighboring countries, now or in the future. This is because development requires not only internal security but stability and friendship with neighboring countries. This is (?the trip I made). Thank you. [Reporter] You have said that you met with Thai officials. I still wonder whether you have discussed (?the old problems concerning the Khmer Rouge) with the Thai officials? [Hun Sen] I must tell you that I did not hold any formal meetings in Bangkok. I can tell you frankly that I met yesterday with General Charan [Kulawanit], Thai National Security Council secretary general, and last night I had dinner with my old friend, former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan who is currently leading an opposition party. This morning, I had a breakfast with General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, also an old friend, (?who is now) minister of the Interior. The most important topic we discussed was how we should solve problems in the future [words indistinct]. We should forget whatever happened in the past because that will only give us a headache. What we want to know is how to solve our future problems. I must tell you that I did not discuss the Khmer Rouge issue with any country, let alone Thailand. I never discuss the Khmer Rouge problem with any country. I will hold no discussion about the problem with other countries, including Thailand. This is the stance of Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and mine as well as the common stance of the National Assembly and the Royal Government. The Khmer Rouge issue is solely an internal concern for Cambodia. What I wanted to discuss was Cambodian-Thai relations. These relations (?include) the development of cooperation in economics, culture, investment, trade, and so forth. There are so many things to discuss concerning relations between the two countries. [Hun Sen continues] I would like to return to your question on the Khmer Rouge. What is the Khmer Rouge doing now? They are striving to internationalize the Khmer Rouge problem. We should not fall into the dangerous games of the Khmer Rouge. Why did the Khmer Rouge refuse to meet in Phnom Penh? Why did they ask for the meeting to be held in Jakarta or Paris? If the government fell into this dangerous game, it would be tantamount to allowing the Khmer Rouge to destroy the outcome of the Paris agreement. As a way out for the roundtable, however, the government respected and followed his majesty's advice by agreeing to meet at the king's palace in Pyongyang. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge could not internationalize its problem. Generally speaking, they already made a false step politically when they refused to join the elections and opposed the Constitution, king, and government which resulted from the elections. Therefore, they have refused to accept the cease-fire because they made a false step politically, but they still have their military activities to resort to as a means of resurrecting their political fortunes. Therefore, I would like to stress once again that now or in the future, the Khmer Rouge problem is not an issue to be discussed with any other countries. The Khmer Rouge problem should be discussed within the Cambodian framework and might be discussed in the Cambodian National Assembly in the future. How do we solve the Khmer Rouge problem? Concerning this, I would like to stress the general policy of the government with regard to the Khmer Rouge issue [words indistinct] America, France, and all other countries, including the neighboring countries, such as Thailand. We will not discuss the Khmer Rouge issue (?with them). Thank you. [Reporter] I would like to know whether you will ask the National Assembly to outlaw the Khmer Rouge if the roundtable on 15 (?June) fails? [Hun Sen] We need to wait for the outcome of the 15 June meeting. Anyway, I, Samdech Krompreah, and Samdech Chea Sim are feebly optimistic. Why? It is because the delegates from our government and National Assembly to the negotiation at the Chhanghsu-on Palace in Pyongyang are all competent persons who can make decisions. As for the Khmer Rouge, they are represented by Khieu Samphan. Therefore, since the leaders who are authorized to make decisions promptly could not solve the problem, can we place any hope in this roundtable working group? I have no hope for it. I am not optimistic about this. Prior to my departure (to Pyongyang), you asked whether I had any hope for success. I answered that I was only 0.1 percent hopeful and 99.99 percent hopeless. That was the summit negotiation. Now that the coming negotiation, the coming discussion, is just at the level of a specialized roundtable group, I really have no hope for it. Henceforth, we must think about what more we should do. Concerning this matter, I think that it is still too early for me to say what to do in the future [words indistinct] as in the football game. Sometimes, from one point to another, there might be a new situation. Nevertheless, how should we solve the Khmer Rouge issue? Do we agree to accept Cambodia as a federal state? In Pyongyang, it was fortunate that Samdech Chea Sim and Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh authorized negotiation with Khieu Samphan. During the negotiation, I told Khieu Samphan that it was a very good time for us to issue a joint statement expressing recognition for a unified Cambodia free from secession and division. But it would be totally meaningless if a cease-fire could not be implemented, because Cambodia [words indistinct], not just with Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. There are also borders between the government and the Khmer Rouge. If the cease-fire is not implemented, the process of national reconciliation will be impossible. Will we continue to accept such a divided Cambodia? This is the problem. Will we allow the Khmer Rouge to kill people at will? This is the problem that we must think of. I [words indistinct]. Some people have blamed the government of waging a meaningless war, of kindling the war. But let me ask you this: Suppose the Khmer Rouge were mosquitos. Should we allow them to bite us, or should we use a mosquito net or pesticide to prevent them from biting us? That is one matter. That is the government's duty. If we allowed the Khmer Rouge, the mosquitos, to bite people, it would be another matter. To protect the people from being bitten by the mosquitos, we must use mosquito nets or other means, such as pesticide, to drive away the mosquitos. The Khmer Rouge are the mosquitos and our people are their victims. But when the Royal Government carried out its duty of protecting the people and [words indistinct] as stated in the constitution, they said the government is the warmonger, the belligerent, while not mentioning the Khmer Rouge killed thousands of our people and burned down thousands of houses. What should the government do in such a case? The other day when I was in Sihanoukville, I told the Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh (?and announced) that if the people, through a referendum, want the Royal Government's troops to withdraw from all the cities, then I do not know what to do. The Prince Krompreah and I are the commanders in chief of the armed forces. If the people want the armed forces to withdraw from Phnom Penh and all the cities so as to let the Khmer Rouge control all areas, I really do not know what to do. We defend the people because they want us to. In defense, we naturally cannot avoid clashing with the Khmer Rouge. Defending the people does not mean that we must wait until we are attacked first. Do not forget that the constitution has defined that the government is duty-bound to control the entire territory without division. This is what I want to stress. So, what should we do next? I still do not know whether to put the Khmer Rouge outside or inside the law or what status to give it. But, it is very clear that the Royal Government will not give up its duty of preventing the people from being massacred by the Khmer Rouge. We will strengthen our capability in protecting the people. This is our vital task. Thank you. [Question by an unidentified correspondent] What do you [words indistinct]?. [Hun Sen] There has been no change. I must emphasize also that yesterday, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh met with the diplomats to explain the situation to them. He also expressed regret over the number of pessimists who see the Cambodian situation as being gloomy, so very gloomy that the government should be dissolved and a reelection held. But, as for me, I think that before talking about the present situation, we should first refer to what had happened on 3 June 1993, and what is happening today, 3 June 1994. We must talk about this so that we can clearly reflect on the situation. I am not going to talk about the impasse or this or that difficulties. But if we speak about the political situation. Today last year, we saw people fleeing the country, some to Bangkok and others to Vientiane, Vietnam, or abroad, or who were packing up and getting ready to flee. But today, we are together. All parties have turned from confrontation, politically, ideologically, and militarily, to a cooperation that has brought stability to Cambodia. This is what we must see. This situation [words indistinct]. As for the Khmer Rouge problem, it depends on what importance we give them. If we give them as much value as we did in the past, it would be as if Cambodia is facing a civil war. I do not understand this. I must boast a bit that no other prime minister in Cambodia can remain in this position longer than Hun Sen, that is if we speak about history. I served as prime minister in the former government for eight years and six months. And I have been prime minister of the new government for a year now. No one has served as prime minister for a longer term than I have. I do not understand why.... the Khmer Rouge are not that significant, but the Khmer Rouge issue has been emphasized to the point as if there is a civil war in Cambodia. There is no civil war in Cambodia right now. The present war is just a destructive one waged by Khmer Rouge rebels against a legally elected government. I [words indistinct] the situation. It is known to all that immediately after the signing of the Paris agreement, I was the only one who could cope with the (?military) situation, while the economic blockade continued against us. But we survived. We have survived all along in order to find a political solution. What else do we have to be afraid of now? All parties, all political parties which have their own armed forces, political and military parties have come together. All newly-formed political parties are joining hands except the Khmer Rouge. The whole world recognizes the (?Phnom Penh) government only and provides aid to them. So, what else must we be afraid of? I really do not understand this claim -- hotels are now unoccupied, because there are no conferences. Yesterday, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh told the diplomats in Phnom Penh that we have peace in 95 percent of the territory, while only five percent have none. Can we carry out development with this 95 percent peace? As I used to say, peace prevails in the majority of our territory at all times. As for war, it takes place only occasionally in some scattered areas. Then why is it not possible for us to carry out development? There is no war in Phnom Penh; fighting takes place only in Pailin. Why must the people in Phnom Penh be that alarmed? Tourism, restaurants, and so forth are in Phnom Penh, not Pailin. Thus, the situation has not changed. It all depends on us whether the Khmer Rouge issue is important or not. If we just forget about them, they would certainly be forgotten. They are so notorious. The most important thing is we must forget about them. [Hun Sen continued] I still remember in October, [changes thought] in November last year, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh declared (?at this Pochentong Airport] that the Khmer Rouge problem was not a major issue. The major issue was the socioeconomic development. At that time, the Khmer Rouge were alarmed. Why? Because they have already died politically. What they are so afraid of is being forgotten. Thus, they have tried hard to raise the Khmer Rouge issue so that a solution must be found for it. To seek a solution, so that they (?can stage a comeback). How can they come back? They can do so by internationalizing the Khmer Rouge issue [words indistinct]. Not only have they demanded a part in the current government, they have also proposed a maximum political program to establish a new government through the dismantling of the present National Assembly and government. Therefore, our people and compatriots should consider this situation for themselves. They should consider whether it is necessary to dissolve the National Assembly and government that were born of the elections organized through the joint effort of the Cambodian people and the international community. Should they dissolve this government and this National Assembly to form a new government with Khmer Rouge participation [words indistinct]. That is what they should think about. Again, I must stress that the Cambodian situation remains unchanged. It is still the same old Cambodia. It has not changed. Its territory is still 131,035 square kilometers. The Khmer Rouge remain in the same, old, and small area. I must emphasize also that the Khmer Rouge problem is not new. Some (?Cambodians) seem to have forgotten about the origins of the Khmer Rouge. Do not forget that the Khmer Rouge have not just been born. I have heard about them since I was a child. They have opposed the government since the time of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge issue is not an outstanding one. The Cambodian people have known about it all along. Therefore, we must not give any significance to the issue. And we must not also [words indistinct]. But, do not forget that in political and legal terms, the Khmer Rouge are already dead. However, if we want them to be alive, they will be alive. If we want them to be dead, they will be dead. We regard their military activities only as sabotage, espionage, and destructive acts. These acts should not be regarded as civil war. This is what I want to emphasize. I want also to stress a few more points to avoid any misunderstanding that the government only looks and speaks about good things while avoiding the bad ones. The government has many problems to solve. Not only the Cambodian Government, the Royal Government of Cambodia, even the Japanese, French, and U.S. Governments have one problem after another to solve. After solving the employment problem for the people, they face another problem, the AIDS problem. Our Cambodia also has many problems to solve. Such problems cannot be resolved within a day, a month, or a year. That is too short to evaluate the ability of the government and the capabilities of the ministers or the state secretaries. By saying so, it does not mean there are no more possibilities for changes among some government members or under state secretaries. [words indistinct] can be evaluated. The volume of our work is so enormous while our ability is (?so limited). [words indistinct] is the joint efforts of all sectors. The National Assembly, the royal government, the armed forces, and people must make efforts simultaneously toward building a prosperous Cambodia. Thank you. [Question indistinct]. [Hun Sen] [passage indistinct]. Therefore, we did not set any preconditions for negotiations. When we reached the negotiating table, the government also did not regard the cease-fire as a precondition for (?negotiation). Although the cease-fire proposal was not proposed at the Pyongyang talks, the government still adheres to the King's formula on the coming roundtable in Phnom Penh. But why does the King and the Royal Government want a cease-fire? Because this is an urgent wish of the people. We must know what the people want most right now. It is peace. To achieve peace, it is imperative to stop fighting first. During the negotiations, I spoke to Mr. Khieu Samphan on behalf of the Prince Krompreah and Samdech Chea Sim. I said: Your Excellency Khieu Samphan, I have heard your speeches where you said we should negotiate and that if we could not solve the problem now, we will face not only the Khmer Rouge issue but more problems if someone else creates another armed group. That was what I told him. Then the two supreme patriarchs and Venerable Patriarch Khousananda and Venerable Patriarch Mongkol Tepeacha also asked him repeatedly to accept the cease-fire. But Khieu Samphan refused. He regarded the cease-fire as part of the minimal policy program. He insisted on rearranging the Paris agreement. This is because the Paris agreement sets the cease-fire [words indistinct]. Therefore, with the aim of dumping the outcome of the Paris agreement implementation, Khieu Samphan has raised and termed the cease-fire issue as being in the minimal policy program. That is a contradictory stance, though not between the Royal Government and the Khmer Rouge. Rather, it is the Khmer Rouge's stance (?in opposing) the King. The Royal Government and the National Assembly support the King's proposal for the cease-fire to begin at noon on 15 June. But the Khmer Rouge have opposed it. This is what I want to stress. [Question indistinct]. [Hun Sen] I want to tell you that foreign aid has nothing to do with the negotiations between the Cambodians. It is imperative to clearly distinguish the aspects of this matter. The problem of the Khmer Rouge is solely an internal affair of Cambodia. The current circumstances are different from the time prior to the implementation of the Paris agreement. Then, the Paris agreement instructed all warring factions to stop procuring military aid. But today, according to the third phase defined in the Paris agreement, with or without the Khmer Rouge, this government is fully entitled to accept foreign aid, including economic, financial, technical, and military assistance. Therefore, these two aspects are not linked. I must stress that for (?Cambodia), the Royal Government dares to even do the following. Although the Royal Government is entitled by law to foreign military aid or to buy arms from foreign countries, to persuade the Khmer Rouge to agree with the cease-fire, the Royal Government has agreed to: 1. After the inter-Cambodian cease-fire overseeing commission is set up, this commission may monitor the presence of foreign troops in Cambodia. I told Khieu Samphan: I understand what you are up to. You keep talking about the presence of foreign troops, meaning Vietnamese troops. Therefore, if you suspect that foreign troops are still present, in addition to monitoring the cease-fire, you should go and look for them. That is the first point. 2. We dare to do this even -- that is, if you accept the cease-fire, the government will stop accepting foreign military aid for the time being to create an atmosphere of trust. That is also part of the King's proposal. The King said he has not yet discussed this with the Royal Government, but the Royal government would like to voice support for this proposal. That is for a permanent cease-fire to be observed first until the Khmer Rouge forces are integrated into the Royal Government's army. Only then will we arrange to use the military aid to strengthen Cambodia's national defense capability. Despite all that, the Khmer Rouge still disagreed. I must reiterate that the Royal Government has the full right to accept all foreign aid. [passage indistinct]. But we must accept the aid for national development and for consolidating our national defense capability. We are entitled to accept it. No one can say we should not get it. [passage indistinct]. This third step in the Paris agreement does not forbid Cambodia from accepting foreign military aid to strengthen the capability to defend Cambodia's [words indistinct] territorial integrity. Thank you. Now I think that this is enough explanation for you. [Question by an unidentified correspondent] [words indistinct] that there is little hope in settling the Khmer Rouge problem through peaceful means [words indistinct] military means to settle the Khmer Rouge problem. How much confidence do you have in the capability of our government troops to put an end to the Khmer Rouge threat? If you [words indistinct]. [Hun Sen] At first we believed [words indistinct] if the Khmer Rouge problem cannot be solved through political means, what should we do? As I said just now, we regard the Khmer Rouge as the mosquitoes -- so, should we let the mosquitoes bite us or should we use a mosquito-net to prevent them from biting us or use pesticide or charcoal smoke to chase them away? That is the point. The duty of the government as authorized by the constitution is to defend the nation's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. (passage indistinct]. I cannot evaluate the government troops' capability. But, one very clear point is that the Khmer Rouge can in no way eliminate or topple the government. That is one thing. Another is that the Khmer Rouge will not be able to expand their territory. I can assure you of this. To answer when we can get rid of all the Khmer Rouge forces, I can only say that it does not depend solely on military means. A bomb that is capable of causing the widest destruction is development in the social and economic domains. This is what we should resort to in order to solve the problem. The use of arms cannot solve the problem. The lessons from Malaysia and Thailand in disbanding the communist parties do not the involve the use of arms. It is true is the duty of the (?troops) to use arms to protect the citizens. But rural development and all-round economic development, eradicating social injustice, and the elimination of corruption are the important matters for the Royal Government. If these problems cannot be resolved, we will face not only the Khmer Rouge issue but more problems if someone else starts creating another armed group. Therefore, we should now mobilize all the efforts of our national forces and international assistance for social and economic development -- a most powerful bomb for destroying not only the Khmer Rouge but all other things, including corruption, which has caused social inertia. This is [words indistinct] not only the military and police forces. [Question by an unidentified correspondent] [words indistinct] do you still want to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge? [Hun Sen] It is clearly recognized across the world that Hun Sen is the advocator of negotiation. Because of this, during my term as the prime minister of the former State of Cambodia, I went everywhere to hold negotiations. The success of negotiations has already been recognized by the Cambodian people and the international community. His Excellency Sieng Lapresse [Information Ministry's spokesman], who was also in the negotiations, knows I have been a tireless negotiator. But now that I am fulfilling my duty as the prime minister of the King, I will follow whatever advice that is given by the King. But if asked whether I like it, I must say I do not. Why? Because I know that it is useless. When the King appealed for a cease-fire, the Khmer Rouge retorted that the cease-fire was a scheme of the aggressors. The Khmer Rouge charged the King's advice as being a scheme of the aggressors. In seeing that, I think there is no way to talk to them. [passage indistinct]. But if the King so wishes, I will [passage indistinct]. Now I want to talk about the harmony between Prince Krompreah and myself. We get along very well. This is why I have never [passage indistinct]. Some newspapers, I say some newspapers and am not going to say which ones, have said that the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] has breached its promise. Leaflets have also been distributed asking the FUNCINPEC to end its meaningless war. I said nothing about this. The Prince Krompreah has also said nothing. I have given support to all the efforts he made [words indistinct]. This is because I know and understand it well. Maybe Mr. Khieu Samphan does not want to negotiate with me. Thus, it will be useless for me to negotiate. If he wants to negotiate, then come to Phnom Penh. But why does he not want to come to Phnom Penh? It is not because it is inconvenient. [passage indistinct]. Why does he not want to come? It is because he wants to internationalize the Khmer Rouge issue. [passage indistinct].
