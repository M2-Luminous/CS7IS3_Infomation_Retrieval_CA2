The statement of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry was published on the latest incident which took place on January 10 and in which deep in Yugoslav territory an Albanian citizen lost his life after illegally crossing the border. A similar incident occurred on January 3 when an Albanian citizen was killed after he failed to respect the order of the Yugoslav border patrol following an illegal crossing to Yugoslav territory. The authorities in Belgrade accused Tirana of bearing full responsibility for the incident. With the aim of realizing its greater Albanian territorial aspirations towards the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Albanian leadership in a calculated manner incites illegal crossings of the Yugoslav-Albanian border disregarding the safety of its own citizens, it was said in a statement of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry published on Wednesday. The statement assessed that the policy of the Albanian government was being confirmed by the continual provoking of border incidents. This policy is aimed at relativizing the existence of the state border of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, realizing greater Albanian pretensions and causing tension and destabilization in the broader region of the Balkans, the statement added. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is strongly determined to energetically protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, it was underscored in the statement which expressed Yugoslavia's readiness for development of good-neighbourly relations with Albania. The Yugoslav authorities have on a number of ocassions warned Tirana to strictly control its border and not permit illegal crossings of Albanian citizens to Yugoslavia.
