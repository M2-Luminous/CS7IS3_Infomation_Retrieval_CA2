Over seven years before the accident, 111 cases of thyroid cancer had been registered in the oblast. Today the statistics show 546 cases. The incidence of this disease increased annually at a rate of 70 percent, while for other types of cancer this indicator was only 1.5-2.0 percent. Specialists associate the onslaught of thyroid cancer with the radiation the population had been subjected to during the first days of the catastrophe, when information about the tragedy was carefully kept under wraps and local party bosses led the people out to the May Day demonstration. Workers solidarity has cost the Bryansk region residents dearly: The radiation background in some areas of Bryansk Oblast reached 200 microroentgen an hour. Currently the oblast administration takes steps to provide social protection for those who were affected during the catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, However, it is also time for the federal authorities to pay their debts, which currently amount to about R50 billion.
