Significant and wide-ranging steps toward financial and taxation reform will affect the establishment of a socialist market economic system, long-term national stability, and this year's financial state and economic development. They are the centerpiece of reform of the entire economic system. We must work hard to ensure success. Liu Zhongli said: Since reform and opening up, we have not stopped reforming the financial and taxation systems. This has played an important role in promoting economic development. Constrained by the then-prevailing conditions, in our previous reform we emphasized readjustment of the distribution structure but failed to devote adequate efforts toward changing mechanisms. As reform has deepened continuously, the failings of the financial and taxation systems -- such as the irregular tax revenue system, the irrational distribution structure, and entrenched local interests -- have become increasingly pronounced, and they came to the fore when we implemented last year's budget. Therefore, faster financial and taxation reform is not only urgently required for creating a socialist market economic system but also for smoothing the relations of distribution and for ensuring sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. Liu Zhongli said: A financial and taxation reform package -- which encompasses reform of the taxation system, the tax-sharing system, and the profit distribution system for state-owned enterprises -- covers all main aspects of the financial and taxation systems. The goal of reform is to change mechanisms, and to establish a new financial and taxation management system and operating mechanisms in keeping with the demands of socialist market economic development. Specifically, the goal is to smooth and regularize the relations of distribution between the central and local authorities, and between the state and enterprises; to improve the state's financial function; to enhance the central government's macroeconomic regulation and control; and to promote a beneficial economic circle and rapid economic development in our country. Liu Zhongli said emphatically: Comprehensive reform of the financial and taxation systems can help coordinate various reform measures and avert friction between the old and new systems. He expressed the hope that all localities and departments would actively publicize the policy among cadres and people to dispel doubts, coordinate their actions with the overall situation of reform and development, promptly uncover and solve new problems in implementing reform measures, ensure that all reform measures would be put in place without delay, and achieve the desired results. It is understood that all the study and report sessions jointly held by the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department and the other four departments have come to an end. Earlier, leaders of relevant departments -- including Hong Hu, vice minister of the State Economic Restructuring Commission; Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of China; Jin Xin, director of the State General Administration of Taxation; Liu Xiangdong, assistant minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation; Yao Zhenyan, vice minister of the State Planning Commission; and Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the State Council Research Office -- expounded the content, goals, and major implications of reform of the financial, taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade systems. They had also introduced, theoretically and practically, our country's new ideas for future reform and development.
