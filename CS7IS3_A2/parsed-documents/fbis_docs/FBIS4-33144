Inflation, which in the past was used by successive Brazilian Governments as an instrument for development, has surpassed any type of control that can be applied and has turned into the main factor strangling our economy, thus seriously and adversely affecting productive investment and, consequently, the generation of jobs. At the same time, inflation feeds financial speculation that in turn generates unproductive profits and concentrates, in an intolerable way, income, thus demoralizing the traditional values of work, savings, planning for the future, and social solidarity. Today we are clearly aware that chronic inflation is the major obstacle the country has to fight in order to return to sustained growth and to correct the immense social distortions we are suffering. We also are fully aware that inflation seriously and inhumanely affects the poorest, the salary earners, and those who have no protection against price runs and the erosion of salaries. The results of years of chronic inflation can be seen in the low efficiency of the state, in its incapability of furnishing basic services, investing in infrastructure, and helping to improve the country's social indicators, especially in education, health, sanitation, and housing. Past governments tried shock treatments with measures that surprised the people and even included the temporary confiscation of savings. This shock treatment generated the passing impression that inflation was under control, but in the end it accelerated inflation even more, provoking new distortions and a lack of confidence. Those plans contained several fundamental factors for stability such as balancing the budget and the adjusting of the country's external debts that were not implemented, thus thwarting the illusory results that were obtained. We now are going to try a new and gradual formula, without apprehension, without surprises. In the first place have created the conditions to reach a fiscal balance. We then implemented a formula to free the economy from indexation and at the same time we re-established the comparability of prices; we have created a single index that is being applied to all prices -- rates, goods, and fiscal services. And it will not be until July that we will issue the new currency, the real, which will replace the cruzeiro real, and it will generate more rigorous rules pertaining to monetary and exchange policies and to guaranteeing stability. The plan's gradualism will allow us to help its evolution by making the necessary corrections and in helping the population and economic agents adapt to the prospects of an economy with a low inflation rate, in which production is given incentives, salaries maintain their purchasing power, and with stable prices. We are close to making the decisive step with the creation of the new currency. Thus this government can pass on to its successor, no matter whom, a country with a stabilized economy. We also are prepared to implement some structural reforms in order to guarantee this stability in the long term and to ensure that the sustained economic growth is socially efficient. Thus, Brazil will consolidate as a great nation and as an important international interlocutor. It is in our hands to make this hope a long-term reality as of 1 July.
