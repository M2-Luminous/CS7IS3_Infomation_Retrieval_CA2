[Jovanovic] I view them as encouraging, especially after what has happened recently. Namely, it is evident that the efforts to overcome the present situation and steer it back on the negotiating path to find a solution by political means in peace are again gaining in prominence. It is evident that Mr. Akashi is a man of peace, dialogue, and negotiations, and not a man of confrontation, threats, ultimatums, or punishment. On the other hand, the entire situation, despite this tragic event, contains elements of political dynamism [sentence as heard]. For example, Lord Owen and President Karadzic yesterday held very enterprising talks about Sarajevo and its placement under the UN administration without waiting for the final peace settlement. On the other hand, there is talk about the relaxation of the situation in Sarajevo itself, which is also encouraging. There has been some progress in the talks concerning Tuzla airport. A meeting in Geneva is forthcoming at which, beside the examination of the measures of trust, the issue of Sarajevo in the above mentioned context should also be discussed. Finally, a meeting of the neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia at a ministerial level will also probably take place, which means that the political momentum has been preserved despite all the temptations and we should expect further development in this direction rather than in the direction of confrontation and escalation of the war. [Unidentified reporter, in English with superimposed simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] Mr. Minister how do you assess the danger of air attacks on the Serbian positions in Bosnia. Is this possible? [Jovanovic, in English with superimposed simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] I believe that this is possible in this war, but not likely, I hope, because everybody is aware that this would not help in the present situation and definitely would not assist the peace process. First of all, the strain of the entire situation and the solution to the crisis can only be seen within the framework of the peace process and not in the possibility of escalating the conflict further. Finally, political activities, a visit by Mr. Akashi and the cochairmen not merely to Belgrade, but to some other counties in this region are the best proof that the majority of the international community believes that a political and not a military solution is needed here. We are definitely inclined to believe that the solution to the problem lies in the rejection of the existing structure of political negotiations. [Unidentified reporter, in English with superimposed simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] Do you foresee what will happen in Geneva? [Jovanovic, in English with superimposed simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] If it were up to us, peace can take place anytime. The lack of peace will depend upon the side that has been opposed to peace. Unfortunately, this side is still not in a mood to assist the peace. They prefer to obstruct the peace, however, there are chances that even this side might turn more cooperative in comparison to the readiness of the majority of the international community to assist the peace process and not the continuation of the war.
