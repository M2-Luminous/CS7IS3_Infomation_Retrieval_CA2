The students set up roadblocks of branches and burning tyres at all intersections and blocked off the bridge across the Niger River linking the city centre to their campus. About l00 police drove some 200 students back to the campus. The students were calling for the punishment of all those involved in the death of a student a week ago, when police raided the campus to break up a demonstration of protest against arrears in payment of study grants. The student was hit full in the face by a teargas canister and died of the wounds next day. Friday's demonstrators demanded in particular the immediate sacking of Niamey's Mayor Souleymane Abari, who is also district administrator with police powers. Government spokesman Mouctar Diallo set out a timetable for paying the missing subsidies late Thursday, but the student union said the gesture was a deliberate misreading of their call for punishment of the culprits in the campus death. Apart from the paramilitary police contingent, there were no policemen in the streets because their national union with 1,700 members has called a strike in support of the colleagues accused by the students.
