FR941128-2-00056 FR941128-2-00044 Discussion The 1994 fees approved by the Board were expected to recover 98.2 percent of the costs of providing priced services, including imputed expenses, automation consolidation special project costs budgeted for recovery, and targeted ROE. Through September 1994, the System recovered 97.1 percent of total priced services expenses, including targeted ROE. The Reserve Banks now estimate that priced services revenues will yield net income of $2.5 million for the year, compared with a targeted ROE of $34.6 million. The recovery rate after targeted ROE is expected to be 96.0 percent. Approximately $8.8 million in automation consolidation special project costs will be recovered in 1994 and an additional $20.5 million will be financed and recovered later. Although the Reserve Banks' current estimate of 1994 performance appears conservative, two significant factors contribute to the expected shortfall compared to the original plan. First, credits arising from accounting for pensions under FASB Statement 87 were revised downward by $21.3 million, pre-tax, from the estimate used to set fees. Final actuarial data became available following the adoption of 1994 fees that reflected (1) a lower discount rate used to value pension plan assets and (2) the costs of early retirement plans offered by the Reserve Banks during 1993 and 1994. If the actual pension credit had not changed from the estimate, the Reserve Banks' estimated full-year cost recovery would have been 97.8 percent, or 1.8 percentage points higher than now forecast. Estimated net income would have been $17.3 million, compared with the $20.2 million originally budgeted. Second, the check service's volume loss due to the implementation of the same-day settlement regulation in January 1994 and the continuing consolidation of the banking industry has been greater than anticipated. The lower check volume levels account for most of the Reserve Banks' $12 million shortfall in revenues compared to the original projections. In 1995, priced services expenses before special project costs are projected to decrease 5.7 percent compared with estimated 1994 levels. Approximately $18.3 million of current automation consolidation special project costs and $0.8 million of costs that were deferred and financed in prior years will be recovered, leaving $36.7 million of accumulated special project costs to be recovered in the future. Total revenues in 1995 are projected to increase by 0.2 percent compared with 1994 revenues. 3 Based on the Reserve Banks' estimates of costs, volumes, and revenues, the proposed 1995 fees will yield net income of $36.0 million for the year, compared with a targeted return on equity of $31.5 million. These estimates result in a 100.6 percent recovery rate, including targeted ROE. 3 The revenue forecasts include net income on clearing balances (NICB) based on the methodology used in previous years. The Board requested public comment on a proposed change to the NICB methodology on August 16, 1994. The Board's staff is currently analyzing several issues raised by the proposal. Table 1 summarizes the cost and revenue performance for priced services since 1989.

Credits for prepaid pension costs under FASB 87 and the charges for post-retirement benefits in accordance with FASB 106 are included beginning in 1993. (c) Targeted ROE has not been adjusted to reflect automation consolidation expenses deferred and financed. The Reserve Banks plan to recover these costs in the future. (d) Totals are cumulative and include financing costs. (e) Net income was less than targeted ROE during 1989 due to structural adjustments associated with implementing Regulation CC in 1988.
