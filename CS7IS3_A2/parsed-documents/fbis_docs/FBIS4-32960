In a communique read over state television, the Ministry of Interior and National Defense "informs border posts and those concerned of the formal prohibition against leaving the country effective immediately for those who have to give explanations on their use of public funds." This measure, which also involves all high-ranking officials appointed by exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide or Malval, is aimed at officially reviewing the country's accounts. According to observers in Port-au-Prince, however, this directive may cause tension between the authorities of the administrations of Jonassaint and Malval, who, despite tendering his resignation, continues to administer current affairs while waiting for President Aristide to appoint a new head of government. This measure was adopted "with the legitimate concern to guarantee the interests of the public administration and the state," the communique said. Former officials must present official proof of their handling of affairs at the moment of leaving the territory. Some of Malval's ministers are already abroad, according to well- placed sources. Following his election, Father Aristide ordered the same measure, which was denounced at the time as political vengeance.
