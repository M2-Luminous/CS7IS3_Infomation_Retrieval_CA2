Uurike said the country's government used 63 million dollars of total 109 million dollars received in loans. The rest was provided to the banking sector and regional governments, who have accepted the obligation to repay the loans. The energy, transport, environment and banking sectors were the main areas of the economy to receive additional funding from the loans. Many of those applying for the loan money, however, were unable to get a share in the funds, as the total investment capacity fell about 23 billion kroons short of the amount sought by the loan applicants. But the former finance minister also pointed out positive changes in the usage of the loan and foreign aid money. He said investments and cooperation projects have replaced fuel, medicines and cars purchases as the main destination of the loan money.
