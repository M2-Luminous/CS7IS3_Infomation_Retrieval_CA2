The situation in the consumer market continued to be strained, the rate of inflation increased, and the public's standard of living declined. Participants in the Cabinet of Ministers conference under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, which discussed the results of national economic activity in 1993 and the tasks ahead in the current year, arrived at these inauspicious conclusions. According to data from the Ministry of Economics, industrial production declined by 6.8 percent last year and the volume of national income dropped by 13.3 percent compared with 1992. Oil production decreased by 800,000 metric tons and natural gas production declined by 1 billion cubic meters. The situation in agriculture was especially bad; it failed to deliver 21 percent of the grain, 43 percent of the vegetables, 59 percent of the cotton, and the same amount of grapes to the state. Compared with 1992, 34 percent of the meat, 29 percent of the milk, and 60 percent of the eggs were delivered. The volume of foreign trade turnover was $545.4 million, including exports of $325.7 million and imports of $219 million. The exports were mainly petroleum products and the imports were mostly foodstuffs. It was noted at the same time that strategic products continue to be taken out of the republic because of lack of supervision by the State Customs Committee and law enforcement organs. The economic managers see the following reasons for the situation that has taken shape: the imperfect nature of the finance and credit system, insufficient capital investments or even the complete lack of them, and failure by a number of enterprises to complete deliveries in accordance with the settlement clearing stipulated by intergovernmental agreements. The head of government expressed his view with respect to the reasons for the crisis as well. He characterized the price liberalization announced 2 years ago and conducted before privatization and the land reform as an inexcusable error. In his opinion, this also led to an increase in the rate of inflation and a budget deficit of 25 billion manats last year, as well as the sharp stratification of society, impoverishment of most of the people, and excessive enrichment of a small proportion of the public. The conference participants were familiarized with the Cabinet of Ministers' draft decree giving clear-cut instructions to all ministries and departments on putting affairs in order in their organizations, as well as on improving the financial sitution in the republic. S. Guseynov reaffirmed the government's intention to issue a directive on the sale of state enterprises' products to commercial structures for a cash payment, as well as the collection of taxes from them in cash. He also told the conference participants that the republic government, together with the National Bank, is taking steps to pay wages, pensions, allowances, and stipends to the public on the threshold of the spring vacations. Summing up the conference results, the head of government again called upon all managers of economic and financial organs in the republic to direct their efforts toward fulfillment of the state's targets and normalization of the economic situation in the republic.
