Brathwaite, in a two-hour-long speech to the House of Representatives, also heeded calls from the chief of customs, geoff Thorne, and moved to crack a vibrant contraband trade between Grenada and the sister island, Carriacou. The measures included steep reductions in port charges on home appliances, audio and video cassette tapes, computer diskettes, wines and spirits, and a big cut in duties on cigars and cigarettes. "As a result of these changes, the prices of these items will fall significantly," Brathwaite told the House, making clear the measures were intended to fight the contraband trade. The budget of 278 million dollars (one EC dollar ; 37 cents US) puts recurrent expenditure at 195 million dollars and capital expenditure at 82.7 million dollars. Total revenue, including grants, was projected 266.5 million dollars, leaving a deficit of 12.5 million dollars to be financed. The reintroduction of personal income tax, abolished in 1986 and replaced with a value-added tax (VAT), accompanied other tax reform measures. VAT was downgraded to a consumption tax, and two tier system of company tax was introduced for one year. On profits of 45,000 dollars and lower, a rate of 30 per cent will apply while on profits above 45,000 dollars, the rate will be 35 per cent. From 1995, a single rate of 30 per cent will apply. Said Brathwaite: "Over the past years, our tax system had become too complicated to administer as a result of improperly drawn and frequently amended legislation, nuisance taxes and the decay of tax administration itself." The budget brought property tax relief for home owners who from 1985 paid rates of 0.2 per cent of the value of the land and 0.5 per cent of the value of buildings. A single rate of 0.2 per cent now applies on the value of the property. Under the new system of income tax, the first 10,000 dollars of income will be exempt. There is an allowance of 1,000 dollars for spouses and 1,500 dollars per child up to three children. Income tax is seen by the government as a gradual replacement for a two year old national debt service levy, which will come to an end on March 31, 1995. Reviewing the performance of the government's finances, Brathwaite reported a current account surplus of 17 million dollars, the first in five years. It was arrived at using methods employed by the International Monetary Fund and other international lending agencies. The largest chunk of the 1994 budget went to the Ministry of Communications and Works, reflecting the emphasis the government is giving to improving the infrastructure over the coming year.
