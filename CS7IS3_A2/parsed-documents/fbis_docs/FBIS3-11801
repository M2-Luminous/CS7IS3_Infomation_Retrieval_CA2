The additional measures are designed to help guarantee the candidates' personal safety. "There will be more (police) units at the political events they (the candidates) attend," Aguilera told reporters. "Some have accepted this, but others, such as Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the presidential candidate of the conservative National Action Party, oppose the move. I believe it would be desirable if they all would agree to accept the additional security." The move was ordered in the wake of the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who was killed at a political event in Tijuana in northern Mexico on Wednesday. All eight opposition candidates participating in the presidential elections scheduled for 21 August have condemned Colosio's murder.
