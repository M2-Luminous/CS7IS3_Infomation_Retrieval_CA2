In conjunction with the unique conditions of raising and breeding mice of specific lineage and likely probability of loss of the animals' homozygoticity when their breeding expanded, we tried to use the most popular nonpedigree albino mice in order to produce ascitic fluid containing specific monoclonal antibodies. One hundred fifty nonpedigree albino mice and 525 BALB/c mice obtained from the Mikrob institute's nursery were infected with the production strain of hybridoma Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp. The mice ranged from 18 to 25 g in weight and 2 to 6 months in age. One to 5 weeks before infection, they were given intraperitoneal injections of the mineral oil pristane (Sigma, United States) in the amount of 0.5 ml. The specific activity of the ascitic fluid was determined through a reaction of indirect hemagglutination with commercial plague erythrocytic antigen diagnosticum manufactured at the Central Asia Antiplague Institute (Alma-Ata) and through the indirect method of fluorescing antibodies (by using luminescing serum) to albino mouse globulins produced by the Epidemiology and Microbiology Scientific Research Institute imeni N.F. Gamaley of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow. Three groups of nonpedigree mice that each contained different numbers of hybridoma-inoculated cells (1-5, 5-10, and 10-15 million, respectively) were formed to study the efficiency of antibody formation. The number of passages of the hybridoma cells in the different groups of animals ranged from 3-4 to 6-8. It was established that the number of mice with an ascitic tumor in each of the different groups was approximately identical. Of the 150 nonpedigree mice used in the experiments, 78 (52.0 +/- 4.1 percent) were found to have an ascitic tumor. The time to autopsy of the animals amounted to 9.3 +/- 0.4 days, the volume of ascites amounted to 3.7 +/- 0.3 ml, and the concentration of hybridoma cells equaled 14.5 +/- 1.8 million/ml. The volume of ascitic fluid obtained per mouse fluctuated from 0.5 to 13 ml, and the concentration of cells ranged from 500,000 to 75 million/ml. A total of 25 mice (16.6 +/- 3.0 percent) died, 17 (11.3 +/- 2.6 percent) were found to be free of symptoms of ascitic tumor, and 55 (36.6 +/- 3.9 percent) survived after infection. There were no statistically significant differences with respect to the number of mice with ascites and the concentration of hybridoma cells in the ascitic fluid as a function of the infecting dose of hybridoma. Ascitic tumor formation took longer in the mice infected with 1-5 million hybridoma cells. The average volume of ascitic fluid obtained from one mouse was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the group of animals treated with higher doses of hybridoma. When the animals were divided into two groups based on passages performed, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) was found with respect to the number of ascitic mice in the group of animals infected with hybridoma after 3-5 passages (66.0 +/- 4.7 percent) compared with the group infected after 6-8 passages (26.0 +/- 6.2 percent). From the first group of mice, 227.3 ml of ascitic fluid was obtained, and from the second group, 31.7 ml was obtained. The average volume of ascitic fluid obtained from one mouse was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the second group of animals. The increased efficiency of ascites formation in the animals with an elevated infecting dose of hybridoma after 6-8 passages should also be noted. For comparison, ascitic tumor was recorded in 480 (91.4 +/- 2.4 million/ml) of the 525 BALB/c mice infected with the very same hybridoma in doses of 1-5 million cells after 2-12 passages. The ascites formation time averaged 7 +/- 0.1 days, the volume of ascitic fluid amounted to 7.1 +/- 0.1 ml, and the concentration of hybridoma cells equaled 12.4 +/- 2.4 million/ml. The results obtained with respect to the latter two indicators were virtually no different from the respective data for the group of nonpedigree mice. After 10-12 intertwinings of the hybridoma Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp in the bodies of the nonpedigree mice, it was virtually impossible to obtain ascitic tumors despite the injection of high infecting doses (10-20 million cells). The animals generally survived or yielded single solid tumors. The efficiency of ascites formation in mice of the BALB/c line remained high (80-88 percent) up to the 33rd passage (the observation period). The specific activity of the ascitic fluid obtained from the nonpedigree mice and the mice of BALB/c lineage were at the same level in the indirect hemagglutination reaction and when the indirect method of fluorescing antibodies was used. From the standpoint of its physicochemical properties and specific activity (working dilution of at least 1:32), the commercial luminescing preparation prepared on the basis of biological material from nonpedigree mice conformed to the requirements stipulated in technical norm references (Experimental-production Regulation No. 11-86 and Temporary Pharmacopoeia Article 42-66VS-87). It was thus established that nonpedigree mice may be used as a source of monoclonal antibodies to capsular plague microbe antigen when they are infected with the hybridoma Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp and that the efficiency of ascites formation decreases as the number of passages of the hybridoma cells in the bodies of nonpedigree mice increases. This is possibly a unique property of the specific hybridoma. It should be noted that the hybridoma used in this work was obtained in 1983. During the 7 years that followed, it was cloned several times and passaged numerous times during the process of scientific studies, scientific-technical development, and commercial production of the preparation on BALB/c mice that were acquired from various sources and that often were of dubious genetic standard. It may be hypothesized that a partial selection of cells with weakly expressed antigen properties and capable of adaptation in nonsyngeneic mice occurred a result of periodic culturing of the hybridoma Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp on genetically impure animals.
