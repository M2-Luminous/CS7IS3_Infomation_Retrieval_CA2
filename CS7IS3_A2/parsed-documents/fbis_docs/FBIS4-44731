The reformer enables methane to be converted into hydrogen. The goal would be to create a reformer which is smaller, more efficient, more esthetic, and cheaper, and which kicks off faster. A number of industrial partners are interested in the project. The ultimate goal is that Europe would have at its disposal an ultramodern technique in the field of fuel cells so as to strenghten its competitive position in a market where the Japanese and Americans have made great strides. The real project started in December and will continue for three and a half years.
