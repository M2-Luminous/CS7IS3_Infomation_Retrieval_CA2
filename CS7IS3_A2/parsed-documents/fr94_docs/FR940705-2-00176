FR940705-2-00176 FR940705-2-00091 The NIH Director is responsible for: Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(1). Promulgating requirements as necessary to implement the NIH Guidelines; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Establishing and maintaining the RAC to carry out the responsibilities set forth in Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;2 (RAC membership is specified in its charter and in Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;2); and Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(3). Establishing and maintaining ORDA to carry out the responsibilities defined in Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;3. Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b. Specific Responsibilities In carrying out the responsibilities set forth in this section, the NIH Director, or a designee shall weigh each proposed action through appropriate analysis and consultation to determine whether it complies with the NIH Guidelines and presents no significant risk to health or the environment. Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1). Major Actions To execute Major Actions, the NIH Director shall seek the advice of the RAC and provide an opportunity for public and Federal agency comment. Specifically, the Notice of Meeting and Proposed Actions to the NIH Guidelines shall be published in the Federal Register at least 15 days before the RAC meeting (not applicable for Expedited Review single patient human gene transfer experiments considered under Appendix M&hyph;VI). The NIH Director's decision, at his/her discretion, may be published in the Federal Register for 15 days of comment before final action is taken. The NIH Director's final decision, along with responses to public comments, shall be published in the Federal Register . The RAC and Institutional Biosafety Committee Chairs shall be notified of the following decisions: Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)&hyph;(a). Changing containment levels for types of experiments that are specified in the NIH Guidelines when a Major Action is involved; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)&hyph;(b). Assigning containment levels for types of experiments that are not explicitly considered in the NIH Guidelines when a Major Action is involved; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)&hyph;(c). Promulgating and amending a list of classes of recombinant DNA molecules to be exempt from the NIH Guidelines because they consist entirely of DNA segments from species that exchange DNA by known physiological processes or otherwise do not present a significant risk to health or the environment; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)&hyph;(d). Permitting experiments specified by Section III&hyph;A; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)&hyph;(e). Certifying new host-vector systems with the exception of minor modifications of already certified systems (the standards and procedures for certification are described in Appendix I&hyph;II). Minor modifications constitute (e.g., those of minimal or no consequence to the properties relevant to containment); and Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)&hyph;(f). Adopting other changes in the NIH Guidelines. Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2). Minor Actions NIH/ORDA shall carry out certain functions as delegated to it by the NIH Director (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;3). Minor Actions (as determined by NIH/ORDA in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary) will be transmitted to the RAC and Institutional Biosafety Committee Chairs: Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(a). Reviewing and approving certain experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects that qualify for the Accelerated Review process (see Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2); Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(b). Reviewing and approving minor changes to human gene transfer protocols under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(c). Changing containment levels for experiments that are specified in Section III; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(d). Assigning containment levels for experiments not explicitly considered in the NIH Guidelines; and Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(e). Revising the Classification of Etiologic Agents for the purpose of these NIH Guidelines (see Section V&hyph;A). Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(f). Interpreting the NIH Guidelines for experiments to which the NIH Guidelines do not specifically assign containment levels; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(g). Setting containment under Sections III&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;d and III&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph; b; Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(h). Approving minor modifications of already certified host-vector systems (the standards and procedures for such modifications are described in Appendix I&hyph;II); Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(i). Decertifying already certified host-vector systems;
