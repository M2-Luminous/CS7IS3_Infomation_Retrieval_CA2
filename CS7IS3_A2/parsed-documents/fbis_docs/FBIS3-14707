The Palestinian alliance forces have issued a statement in which they stressed that their meeting with the brother leader of the revolution falls within an awareness of the historic responsibility shouldered by the pan-Arab forces that are resisting the plans of submission and Zionist dominion. Within this framework, developments on the Arab and international arenas were discussed, in particular developments related to occupied Palestine in the aftermath of the massacres that are being committed by the Zionist enemy against the Palestinian people, the latest of which is the sacred Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The statement reiterated the rejection of the Palestinian people and its revolutionary and pan-Arab forces of the unjust and unfair measures that are imposed against the Great Jamahiriyah by the so-called UN Security Council. The statement underlined that these measures are a result of the principled and firm stance of the Great Jamahiriyah and its commitment to issues of the Arab nation, foremost of which is its fundamental issue, Palestine, and its rejection of the U.S.-Western-Zionist domination plan. These measures not only target the Arab Libyan people, but they also target the whole Arab nation. The sons of the Arab nations and its dynamic forces are called upon to work towards putting an end to the embargo, which they should not honor. The statement pointed out that the leader's view of these developments truly expressed the (?Arab nation's) goals and aspirations and its adherence to its national and historical rights to protect its interests, wealth, and sovereignty. The statement of the Palestinian alliance forces said that Jerusalem was a holy land for the divine religions and the capital of struggling Palestine. The masses of our people will never accept anything other than that and will resist the Zionist plan targeting its Arab nature, obliterating its history, and Judaising it. Accusing our Palestinian people and our Arab and Islamic nation of terrorism was only a conspiracy against our right to freedom and life in order to force us to neglect our just humanitarian demands. We do not practice terrorism, and we do not target unarmed innocents, as they do, but we seek freedom, which is guaranteed by all laws and divine codes and confirmed by human rights conventions. We are for the just peace that guarantees the legitimate rights for our struggling Palestinian people and our fighting Arab and Islamic nation. We reject and resist, and we call and mobilize the masses of the Arab and Islamic nation to resist and overthrow, the imposition of hegemony and domination in the name of peace. The submission projects put forward through the Madrid process and Washington, the bilateral and multilateral talks, and the Oslo talks are considered an abandonment of our people and nation's rights that will not achieve peace.
