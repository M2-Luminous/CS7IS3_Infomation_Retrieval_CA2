[Khalid] The summit itself is an important event. It reaffirms Syria's role in achieving a political settlement after the U.S. Administration tried to marginalize this role, especially after the signing of the Oslo agreement, and tried to show that a settlement could be conducted according to U.S. plans. The events reaffirmed Syria's importance in conducting a political settlement. Moreover, the summit affirmed basic principles since the aim is to achieve a comprehensive settlement. The U.S. Administration reiterated, through Clinton, its commitment to a comprehensive peace based on Resolutions 242 and 338, which stipulate Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967, and on Resolution 425, which stipulates Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, as well as the land-for-peace principle. These bases were violated when the Oslo agreement was signed and through the statements delivered at the signing ceremony. Therefore, we considered the reaffirmation of these bases as something important. Despite the positive aspect of this summit, we, as a democratic front, were hoping that the Syrian side would address the Palestinian dimension of the conflict and of its solution. We were also hoping that a solution would be based on the national legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This was absent during the Syrian-U.S. summit. [Al-Khatib] Some say that you adopted this stand in accordance with the political, geographical, and leadership stand in Syria. How do you respond to this, especially since the issue of the 10 opposition factions was on the agenda of the summit between the two presidents? [Khalid] We are always asked these questions and we have responded to them in the past. Our policy, as a democratic front, is not governed by the factor of geographic location in this country or that. Our standard is to adhere to the higher national interest of the Palestinian people. The DFLP has never submitted to anyone. We were often involved in political and non-political differences with some Arab countries, especially Syria, concerning Palestinian decisionmaking. This was in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly when there was a rift in the PLO ranks and we were centered in Damascus. At the time, we did not consider the geographic dimension in making our decisions, but we basically considered the interest of the Palestinian people and we frankly announced our stand toward the Syrian policy. In any case, the summit is not a magic key for a political settlement. This summit reaffirmed bases which could be a key toward progress on the various negotiating tracks, including the Syrian-Israeli track. The Israeli statements after the summit confirm that negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are not easy, not to mention that the Israeli lobby in the United States is exercising pressure to diminish the weight of U.S. affirmations expressed by President Clinton. Therefore, we say that fears about how this summit will affect Syria's relations with the Syrian-based opposition forces are highly exaggerated. We are not at all worried about this summit and its results. [Al-Khatib] What are the requisites for achieving progress on the Syrian-Israeli track with relation to the Palestinian opposition forces? And why don't you practice your opposition from within the future Palestinian authority? [Khalid] Our experience with Syria is long. We and our Syrian brothers learned lessons from this experience. In the past, Syria closed down the DFLP offices between 1983 and 1988 on the day leader Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir] was martyred. Despite this, the DFLP remained unshaken and did not retreat. The closing of its offices did not affect its weight among the ranks of our Palestinian people. On the contrary, the DFLP's effectiveness and respect increased among our Palestinian people. We in the DFLP will continue to be an independent force that does not submit to anyone. Even if we assume that Syria is doing what you are assuming, we are convinced that this will not affect our stand, role, and weight. This also applies to our comrades in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Hamas movement. Whoever has an entrenched and deep rooted presence within the ranks of his people does not take such calculations into account. As for the second part of your question, we will not take part in elections for the future self-rule agencies because the agencies that will emanate from these elections will have only one mission; that is, political responsibility toward the agreement reached in Oslo. The Oslo agreement is receiving opposition because it closed the doors to our people's right to return, to self-determination, and to establishing an independent state. Moreover, this agreement only seeks to turn the occupied territories into protected areas under Israeli control. However, we will definitely wage our political battles with those who signed this agreement. We will do so through wide participation in all the self-rule authorities that are of a popular nature, such as student, cultural, and professional unions as well as chambers of commerce, municipal and village councils, and clubs. We will go through with these elections in order to create a state of double authority between the administrative self-rule agencies and institutions and bodies that emerge from elections that have nothing to do with implementing the Oslo agreement. We will continue our struggle on the ground to prevent actual implementation of this agreement. [Al-Khalid] What do you think about the PLO's recent call to restore dialogue and coordination with Syria after the Geneva summit? [Khalid] The PLO leadership behaved unilaterally when it held secret negotiations in Oslo behind the backs of the Palestinian people, of their legitimate institutions and national factions, and of the Arab parties to the negotiations. In practice, the Oslo agreement was a form of separate political settlement. This leadership is responsible for the Arab reactions, for striking at Arab coordination, and for holding secret negotiations. As for now, we do not know on which common denominators coordination can be held. We call for canceling the Oslo agreement and returning to national constants. If this happens, then it is natural to call on the Arab countries, especially Syria, to return to coordination with the Palestinian side in order to reach a comprehensive solution on all fronts.
