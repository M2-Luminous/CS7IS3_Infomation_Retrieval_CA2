According to Japanese information, the draft G-7 declaration, which has already been drawn up, notes that the economic crisis in Ukraine has reached serious proportions and sovereign Kiev needs emergency Western aid so as not to slip into an abyss of instability and upheavals. The document proposes the holding urgently, in the fall of this year (and most likely in Canada), of a special G-7 meeting at ministerial level to discuss the details of both an aid package and a mechanism for granting the aid. A special meeting like this has been held only once before -- in Tokyo in April of last year, and on that occasion Western aid for the Russian reforms was on the agenda. The appearance of a clause on Ukraine in the fundamental document of the G-7 summit-level forum is, according to the Japanese version, attributable to two "firefighting" factors -- a further deterioration in the situation in Ukraine could result in dangerous consequences for international nuclear security in view of the existence on Ukrainian territory of nuclear weapons and the still operating Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station; and an escalation of the economic crisis could blow apart the political situation in Ukraine and present Europe with a "second Yugoslavia." The initiative to put the Ukrainian question on the G-7 agenda, the Japanese sources note, comes from Italy, and the subject itself was raised for discussion for the first time by the special personal representatives of the G-7 heads of state at the end of last week. The proposed pattern of economic aid to Kiev is thus far virtually a total repetition of the Russian version -- it is a question of granting credits from the IMF, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Developments, conditional on further progress in Ukraine's economic transformations. Here the G-7 intends to urge Kiev to proceed more quickly along the path of reforms. The volume of possible loans to keep the Ukrainian economy afloat remains a big secret -- there is not even a hint of this in the utterances of informed sources.
