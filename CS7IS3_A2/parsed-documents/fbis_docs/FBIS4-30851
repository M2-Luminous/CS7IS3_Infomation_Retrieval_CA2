Private banks which are members of the London Club should decide on a formula for the debt reduction by 29 June. The first presentation of the Polish proposals took place in Frankfurt am Main, with the participation of representatives of German, Swiss, and Austrian banks. The final date for the signing of an agreement between the Government of the Republic of Poland and the London Club, was announced as well -- it will take place in Warsaw on 13 September, followed by individual agreements with each of the 500 commercial banks which are Poland's creditors. Krzysztof Krowacki, the government plenipotentiary in negotiations with the London Club, has announced that work on creating legislative opportunities for investing bonds in Polish companies subject to privatization, should be finalized at the beginning of next year. By signing the agreement -- Krowacki added -- the banks are making an investment in Poland, but they will also benefit from Poland becoming a permanent element of the European economy. This is not irrelevant to the banks concerned because the new business will compensate very significantly for what they had lost in connection with the debt reduction. Ernst-Moritz Lipp of Dresdner Bank who is heading the negotiations of the London Club's working group stressed that unlike agreements on debt reduction with Latin American countries, the agreement with Poland sets no upper limits and the choice of the way of debt reduction is completely unrestricted. In Krowacki's assessment, there is a danger, theoretically speaking: If choosing the "buy back" [preceding two words in English] formula means that 20 percent of the entire debt would have to be bought back (about $2.5 billion), then that would be the upper limit of Poland's repayment capabilities. However, so much attention should not be directed at cash because in the unanimous view of the bankers present at the meeting, bonds are "more attractive." Krowacki announced that Warsaw will buy "collaterals" [preceding word in English] in the form of U.S. State Department bonds, which will constitute a guarantee of the Polish Government's repayment capability and which should increase the credibility of the operations for exchanging credit bills of exchange in return for parity and discount bonds; the operation is scheduled to begin 31 October.
