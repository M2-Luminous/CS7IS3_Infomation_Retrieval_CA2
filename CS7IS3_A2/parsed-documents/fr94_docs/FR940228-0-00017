FR940228-0-00017 FR940228-0-00002 Response: FCIC agrees with the comment and has specified the varieties in the Special Provisions. Comment: A comment suggested that the ``date of the final inspection for the unit'' be clarified. Response: The date of the final inspection is the date that the loss adjustor completes the claim. Comment: One comment recommended that the Malting Barley Option be revised to allow adjusting production for both (1) moisture exceeding the requirements in the policy and (2) exceeding the grade requirements stated in the Option. Response: FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified the paragraphs so that adjustments for moisture and quality are determined separately. During the interim between publication of the Small Grains Crop Provisions as a proposed rule and preparation of this final rule, provisions providing coverage for Late and Prevented Planting were added to the current Wheat Endorsement (§401.101), Barley Endorsement (§401.103), and Oat Endorsement (§401.105). These provisions for Late and Prevented Planting Coverage, which were published in the Federal Register on December 22, 1993, have been incorporated into this final rule to continue the coverage provided by the current endorsements for barley, oats, and wheat, and to provide the same coverage benefits to those insuring flax or rye. In addition, FCIC has determined that revised language is needed in subparagraph 11.(c)(1)(iv) regarding acreage an insured wants to put to another use prior to harvest. These provisions now allow an insured to destroy such acreage when an appraisal amount is not agreed upon, if the insured agrees to leave representative samples of the crop in place. The samples will be used to later determine the amount of production to count. Accordingly, the rule, ``General Crop Insurance Regulations; Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions'' published at 58 FR 32458 as revised as set out below is hereby adopted as final rule. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 457 Crop insurance; Barley, Flax, Malting barley, Oats, Rye, Wheat, Winter wheat. Final Rule Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. ), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation hereby amends the Common Crop Insurance Regulations (7 CFR part 457), effective for the 1995 and succeeding crop years, in the following instances: 1.
