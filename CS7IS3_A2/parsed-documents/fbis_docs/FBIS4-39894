They issued a joint statement "on the situation in the Korean peninsula" which was circulated in the lower house of parliament on Friday. These factons noted a sharp aggravation of the situation on the Korean peninsula, close to Russian borders. Deputies pointed out that "certain circles in the United States want to compel the DPRK to accept humiliating terms of the settlement of the so-called nuclear problem". In this connection representatives of the three above-mentioned Duma factions expressed "perplexity" at the statement of the Russian leadership which, in the opinion of deputies, "actually sided with one party in the conflict, South Korea". The deputies expressed disapproval of Russia's decision to join in the economic sanction against the DPRK. "Our national interests would be suited by giving up power methods, creating conditions for a dialogue between the north and south of Korea and implementing the concept of a non-nuclear zone in the Korean peninsula", the statement says.
