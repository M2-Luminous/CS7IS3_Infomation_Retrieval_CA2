Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told journalists that the explanation had been sought after the arrest Friday evening of dissident Wang Fucheng, secretary-general of the Shanghai-based Chinese Human Rights Association. "This is now rather a lot, and we are starting not to appreciate it," Juppe said. "We have asked for an explanation, and we are awaiting a reply." France has requested an explanation for 3:00 p.m. (0700 GMT), he said. Only hours after Wang's arrest, another leading dissident, Bao Ge, was picked up by police in Shanghai, a dissident source said. Bao was the fifth pro-democracy campaigner to be detained in China in eight days. The latest incidents happened as Balladur arrived in Shanghai, continuing a four-day trip aimed at mending fences with China. Balladur told the Chinese minister for electricity, Shi Dazhen, of his displeasure at the wave of arrests, Juppe told journalists in the plane from Beijing to Shanghai. "This is unacceptable," Balladur was quoted as saying.
