Wolfgang K. from Ruesselsheim is said to be the leader, and is currently in detention pending trial. The other four, who belong to the inner circle of the FRG neo-Nazi scene, have not been arrested. About two months ago DER EINBLICK was disseminated through a Danish post office box. The brochure contained 40 pages with names and addresses of political opponents. During a search last week, police arrested 25-year-old Wolfgang K. He is accused of having written the text and the introduction. In contrast with the other four suspects, Wolfgang K. was not previously known. In Rodach in Upper Franken, the Bavarian Land Office of Criminal Investigations searched the apartment of right-wing extremist Eberhard Hefendehl. Investigations were initiated against him. For eight years Hefendehl has been publishing the openly racist, anti-Semitic brochure DER SCHEINWERFER [THE SPOTLIGHT] in his "ODAL publishing company." The 63-year-old man is also said to have printed the first 500 copies of DER EINBLICK. Hefendehl has excellent contacts in the FRG Nazi scene. He closely cooperates with Kai Dalek, of the Kronach cadre of the militant "New Front Association of Like-Minded People" (GdNF), who boasts of having spied on leftists before the "Rudolf Hess memorial marches" and on the "KOMM" youth center in Nuremberg. Hefendehl was not only able to publish materials written by convicted right-wing terrorist Manfred Roeder and Erhard Kemper, former chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalia "Liberal German Workers Party" (FAP) in DER SCHEINWERFER, but also articles by Christian Worch from Hamburg, who is the chairman of the GdNF and one of the leaders of the "National List" (NL) in Hamburg. Via the NL brochure INDEX, Worch plays a leading role in the anti-antifa [anti-antifascist] activities. The paper of the Aid Association for National Political Prisoners (HNG), which regularly contains one anti-antifa page, was also disseminated via Hefendehl. Hefendehl is also doing business on the international level. The Austrian office of DER SCHEINWERFER is headed by Otto-Rudolf Braun. He publishes articles in BAUERNSCHAFT [PEASANTRY], which is published by neo-Nazi Thies Christophersen, who fled to Denmark. DER SCHEINWERFER is disseminated not only in Europe, but also in South Africa, Namibia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Chile. Last spring 23-year-old Stefan Cumic, from Wiesbaden, traveled through Chile, where he reportedly collected money for the publication of an anti-antifa brochure. "Over the past two and one-half months I, myself, was abroad (visiting German emigrants in Chile and Argentina) to make propaganda for the idea of DER EINBLICK at the international level," he writes on 24 May 1993. This admission is available to the BAW. Cumic, who is now being investigated by the BAW for being a member of a right-wing extremist criminal association, announced the publication of DER EINBLICK as early as in September 1992, in the GdNF brochure NEUE FRONT-WIDERSTAND [NEW FRONT-RESISTANCE]. However, nothing came of it. Instead, "National Info-Telephone" (NIT) in Mainz regularly announced the addresses of post office boxes belonging to regional anti-antifa groups and called for the collection of material. Neo-Nazis Michael Petri (21) and Sascha Chaves (21) from Mainz are behind NIT. The BAW had suspected Petri, former member of the banned German Alternative and now federal chairman of the newly founded German Nationalists, and Chaves of having participated in DER EINBLICK since the beginning of December. Both were arrested following searches of their apartments.
