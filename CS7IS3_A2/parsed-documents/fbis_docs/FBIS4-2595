This has received international attention. Under these circumstances, on 1 April the UN Security Council adopted a moderately worded statement proposed by China asking North Korea to allow international inspectors to complete their nuclear inspections and urging North and South Korea to resume dialogue with the UN Security Council members so as to implement the declaration on the Korean peninsula being a nuclear-free zone, thus temporarily easing the tension on the peninsula. How has the present situation on the Korean peninsula taken shape? An informed source in Beijing has revealed that a Beijing expert on international conflicts was of the opinion that primarily human factors were behind the military confrontation on the Korean peninsula. Over the past year, the situation on the Korean peninsula has been tense one moment and relaxed the next. On 12 March last year, North Korea suddenly announced its withdrawal from the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to oppose the U.S.-South Korean "team spirit 1993" joint military exercises. Not long afterward, South and North Korea were in a "state of quasi war." Subsequently, the United States took the initiative in holding a dialogue with North Korea, and good results were achieved. In February this year, North Korea reached agreements respectively with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the United States, expressing its willingness to allow IAEA personnel to carry out an "inspection aimed at ensuring continuity in nuclear safety." Apart from this, South and North Korea held talks in Panmunjom from 3 to 6 March to discuss mutual visits by both sides' special envoys. Logically, this should have helped improve the atmosphere on the Korean peninsula, but a six-member international nuclear inspection team complained that North Korea had prevented them from taking samples from a chemical research agency after inspecting seven nuclear facilities in North Korea. North Korea asserted that these nuclear facilities had passed IAEA inspections, had been sealed, and monitoring equipment had been installed at the sites; there was no reason for the inspection team to remove the seals and take samples again. Logically, it was possible to resolve this difference of opinion. Unfortunately, however, South and North Korea viciously abused one another during the Panmunjom talks, and the United States asserted that, if North Korea refused to yield, the UN Security Council would impose sanctions on it. China Persuaded the Three Parties To Have a Dialogue The international community, however, did not agree with the idea of the Security Council taking economic sanctions against North Korea or the United States punishing it with force. Instead, it hoped that China could influence North Korea through their friendly relations so that the crisis on the Korean peninsula could be alleviated. During their visits to China in late March, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam respectively expressed the same view. It was against this background that China submitted the above-mentioned proposal. The informed source further pointed out that, because China had always abided by the international norm of not interfering in other countries' internal affairs, it indicated that "it can only play a limited role and do little" on the North Korean nuclear issue, apart from expressing its stand of favoring dialogue and opposing the use of pressure. To ease the tense situation on the Korean peninsula and remove the war crisis there, China continued to actively persuade the United States and South and North Korea to patiently resolve their disputes through dialogue. China indicated to the United States: After the Cold War, the United States should no longer adopt a hostile attitude toward North Korea, and this is an important factor preventing North Korea from manufacturing nuclear weapons; North Korea does not constitute any threat to world peace, and the United States should cancel its military exercises with South Korea; the United States should give up its policy of politically isolating North Korea, economically containing it, and diplomatically slandering it and should restore talks with it so that their bilateral relations will develop toward normalization. China indicated to South Korea: North Korea lacks the technological and economic capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons, so South Korea should not be oversensitive about this issue; as there is no proof, South Korea should not act rashly; even though North Korea has the intention of manufacturing nuclear weapons, this problem can be resolved through negotiations; the shipment of U.S. Patriot missiles to South Korea and U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises have unquestionably added fuel to the fire; South and North Korea should hold direct summit talks to create a relaxed atmosphere. China indicated to North Korea: North Korea should be more flexible on the question of nuclear inspections; it should withdraw its troops a little from the military demarcation line to avoid clashes; and it should take the initiative in proposing talks with South Korea. The Beijing expert on international conflicts pointed out that China's active persuasion to the United States and South and North Korea suggested its sincerity for alleviating the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. The alleviation of this tension primarily relies on the patient dialogue between North Korea, South Korea, the IAEA, and the United States. The informed source said that the Beijing international conflicts expert was of the opinion that the United States should undertake a major responsibility for the tense situation on the Korean peninsula, because this superpower practices hegemonism and power politics abroad and always wants to foist its value concepts on others. For example, the United States used the method of peaceful evolution on the former Soviet Union and is applying the same method to China, and it is using military methods to bring about a change in North Korea, Iraq, and Libya. The United States deeply regretted not being able to conquer Iraq with one stroke during the Gulf war. Remembering this lesson, it will practice a strategy of destruction against North Korea--the last Stalinist regime in the world--with the aim of enabling South Korea to gobble up North Korea, like West Germany gobbling up East Germany. A South Korean radio station said that "Seoul and Washington already have a plan to overthrow the Kim Il-song regime." This is a specific example of an attempt to change North Korea through military means. The United States Is Using Two Methods Apart from this, aiming to undermine China's foreign policy of establishing good-neighborly relations with its surrounding countries, the United States is trying every possible means to set these countries against China, with a view to encircling it. When discussing the international situation recently, an authoritative person from the CPC pointed out that the Korean peninsula, India, and Pakistan might be on fire [qi huo 6386 3499], and Vietnam and Russia might see winds rising [qi feng 6386 7364]. Partially speaking, this refers to the U.S. strategy of encircling China. This international conflicts expert said that China is quite certain that the United States is aiming at China in pressuring North Korea, and therefore China is quite concerned about the situation on the Korean peninsula. Strategically speaking, China regards the Korean region as an important buffer [huan chong 4883 0394] zone between China and the United States. Should North Korea fall under U.S.-South Korean joint military occupation, China could face U.S. Naval, Army, and Air Force threats. If war breaks out again on the Korean peninsula, and the United States supports South Korea in attacking North Korea, the Chinese Army, which "resisted U.S. aggression and aided Korea to defend the motherland" in the early 1950's will not sit idly by. If it did, the people throughout the country would condemn it. This expert continued: Of course, China's stand is very explicit at present; it will do its best to prevent war on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, as the United States highly values U.S.- Chinese cooperation, China also sets great store by improving Chinese-U.S. relations. The further development of Chinese-U.S. relations will be good for easing the North Korean nuclear crisis, for preventing Japan from becoming a nuclear country, and for stopping the "Taiwan independence" movement and the Vietnamese demand for "sovereignty" over the Nansha Islands [Spratlys]. More importantly, it will provide China with a 10 to 20 year opportunity for peaceful construction. The sustained development of China's economy and the constant growth of its comprehensive national strength will prevent the United States and other Western countries from belittling China's international role. This expert stressed: The Korean peninsula issue is no longer a simple dispute between South and North Korea; the different attitudes of China and the United States on the North Korean nuclear issue is, essentially speaking, a strategic trial of strength between the two countries on the Korean peninsula.
