FBIS4-45043 "jpnea033___94007" JPRS-NEA-94-033 JPRS Near East & South Asia 26 May 1994 NEAR EAST ISRAEL Gaza Equated With South Lebanon Security Zone Gaza Equated With South Lebanon Security Zone 94AA0072E YEDI'OT AHARONOT (24-Hour Supplement) in Hebrew 26 May 94 p 5 94AA0072E YEDI'OT AHARONOT (24-Hour Supplement) Hebrew CSO [Article by Yig'al Karmon] [Text] Three weeks after signing of the agreement, there still is no autonomy council, and the local administration is nearly paralyzed. The police, who are not local, do not know the terrain and the people. The Gaza Strip is under total closure following the terrorist attacks and even Jericho has been placed under a "study closure." But how will they study the agreement while their commanders mislead them and announce that Israelis are not allowed to travel with arms? 'Arafat adds his own two cents and sends out instructions that create legal and functional chaos on the ground while blatantly violating the agreement, of course. In this situation, no wonder that people are already speaking of reconquering the Gaza Strip--would that it were not necessary. Rabin calls all this "a good start." Why? He let the cat out of the bag during his visit to Gaza, revealing the real goal and the true test of the process: not an agreement, not peace, not even a cessation in terror--but getting IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers out of Gaza. There were also ideological motives such as those of MERETZ (to put an end at any cost to occupation rule of another people) and realist motives such as those of Rabin (the IDF has failed and we cannot go on this way forever; he found no solutions that would not require involvement of much of the army in policing the territories and denied the political branch any options until it was forced to leave, come what may). Accordingly, 'Arafat can declare jihad as much as he likes, announce his intention to break the agreement as Muhammad did in his time and even violate it immediately in practice (as he is doing). We got ours. The IDF has left the alleys of Gaza. Because this is the true test and the basic goal of the entire process not only so far as the government is concerned but for a large part of the public as well, the question arises, was the agreement with the PLO the correct and best way to achieve this? Might there have been a better way to reach the goal, such as unilateral withdrawal and handing over authority to the residents (even without an agreement with them)? Comparison of the two options shows that neither assures an orderly peace and stability and that terror is very likely to continue either way. If and when it becomes necessary as a result to carry out the IDF's contingency plans because there is no other way to guard the Green Line area except by holding the Gaza Strip as a security zone (as in southern Lebanon), it will become apparent that we have chosen the worse of the options. Indeed, we shall then face not only the inhabitants of Gaza but also thousands of armed men--PLO soldiers, released prisoners and deportees who were brought back--who would not be there if we had chosen the option of unilateral withdrawal. We shall also face a population armed with the weapons, the morale, and a fighting nation's readiness for sacrifice created by the agreement with the PLO. And, of course, we shall face the PLO itself, which we have rescued by our own hands from internal and elemental collapse and reinforced with support in the most vital arena of all: the free world led by the United States. Of course, if we had chosen unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, we would not be mixed up with Jericho, nor would we ourselves be undermining Israel's security doctrine and our consensus regarding the Jordan Valley which, like the Golan Heights, is almost barren of Arab inhabitants. Even for its goals and means, Israel's government has chosen the worse of the two options.
