FBIS4-22512 "jpusr038___94041" FBIS-USR-94-038 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 7 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Report on Ostankino Economic Activity Report on Ostankino Economic Activity 944F0546A Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA in Russian 7 Apr 94 p 6 944F0546A Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by the Control Directorate of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation: "Information on the Results of the Audit of the Financial-Economic Activity of the Ostankino Russian State Television and Radio Company"] [Text] [begin boxed item] Scandals: Where Are the Remains of the Ostankino Billions? The provocation regarding the "version" of the state coup had barely died down when a new stage in the search for enemies could be heard. A quite reputable publication--NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA--on whose editorial board there do not seem to be any provocateurs but with which such respectable politicians as M. Gorbachev and G. Yavlinskiy are affiliated, published information on 30 March concerning the results of an audit of the financial-economic activity of the Ostankino television and radio company conducted by the Control Directorate of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation. It would seem that the publication of this kind of document should only be welcomed. However, this publication turned out to be very peculiar. After making a number of removals from the text of the document and accompanying its principal propositions with caustic comments directed at the auditors themselves, as well as at those "close to the president," NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA accused the Control Directorate of performing some kind of "sociopolitical order." The sense of the accusation is extremely simple. According to this logic, people are divided into strangers and friends. The first are members of the nomenklatura and partocrats (V. Bragin, Yu. Bandura)--they should be the subjects of the most thorough attention and investigation. The second, the freedom-loving democrats (Ye. Yakovlev, I. Malashenko, A. Maslyanov, and A. Razbash, VID and INTERVID members), are untouchable. Any investigation of their financial-economic activity is assessed as subversive sociopolitical activity by the enemies of reform and perestroyka. Briefly, do not touch ours! This dual morality on the part of the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA publishers becomes obvious when you familiarize yourself with the original source in its full text, which we suggest that you do today. The document we are publishing was sent by the Control Directorate of the Administration of the President to A.N. Yakovlev, chairman of the Russian State Television and Radio Company, "for examination and adoption of appropriate measures" and, judging by everything, it was not intended for the press by the auditors. In this connection, the question arises for NOVAYA YEZNEDNEVNAYA GAZETA: What place does your publication hold in the "rating of lies?" [end boxed item] * * * In accordance with instructions, a Control Directorate Commission, with the enlistment of specialists of the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the State Committee of Taxation of Russia, the State Committee for Management of State Property of Russia, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]] of Russia, and the DNP [Russian Federation Department of Tax Police], conducted an audit of the financial-economic activity of the Russian State Television and Radio Company (RGTRK) Ostankino in January-February of this year. In 1993 the Ministry of Finance of Russia financed the expenditures of the RGTRK Ostankino from the republic budget of the Russian Federation in the sum of 103.7 billion rubles [R], of which R82.8 billion, or 80 percent, constituted payment for services of the Ministry of Communications of Russia, and R20.9 billion was expended on its own needs. At the outset of 1994 the company's indebtedness to state enterprises that ensure the dissemination and broadcasting of radio and television programs was R50.3 billion, and to the Television Technical Center (TTTs), R1.8 billion. It should be noted that the present indebtedness to enterprises of the Ministry of Communications led to severe social tension of these enterprises in labor collectives and created hotbeds of strikes in many regions of the country. At the same time, despite the difficult financial situation, the leadership of the company and the general economic board of directors did not undertake the necessary measures to eliminate deficiencies in the expenditure of budgetary resources, and also to increase the efficiency of commercial activities. A number of shortcomings noted in the materials of the audit by the KRU [Control-Auditing Directorate] of the Ministry of Finance of Russia for 1992 have not been eliminated to the present time. Budgetary resources continue to be used for purposes other than those designated. Of the resources allocated in 1993 specifically designated for payment for technical means of communication, R2.4 billion was directed at financing the services of the TTTs, the production of films of the Ekran association, and also maintenance of buildings and other administrative expenditures. As a result of the lack of proper control on the part of the leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino (former chairman V.I. Bragin), individual television studios during the past year illegally allowed an increase in the volume of broadcasting established for them, which was financed from the republic budget of the Russian Federation. The Information Television Agency, the Musical and Entertainment Programs Studio, and the National Creative Arts Studio exceeded their broadcast time limit. As a whole, the company groundlessly spent budgetary allocations in the sum of R3.3 billion on an above-plan volume of broadcasting of original programs. To this day, the company has not fulfilled paragraph seven of the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 18 December 1993 No. 2206 "On Urgent Measures of Support of State Television and Radio Broadcasting" in the part on submitting proposals to the Government of the Russian Federation in a month's time on possible reductions in the volume of television and radiobroadcasting. The question of payment of costs associated with broadcasting programs of the first television channel, the first radio program, and the Mayak programs to the CIS countries and the near abroad has not been resolved, and all expenditures to this day are being paid from the Russian Federation budget. They amounted to R18.5 billion in 1993. Moreover, at the outset of this year there is an indebtedness in the sum of R10 billion. The RGTRK Ostankino is engaged in commercial activity in an extremely ineffective way, and in a number of cases it is even conducting it to the detriment of its own interests. Advertising in television and radio broadcasting, which is one of the main sources of commercial income of the company, is arranged in a practically uncontrolled way. It was only in May 1993 that the main advertising-commercial directorate was established. However, up to the present time the work associated with advertising is conducted by different structural subdivisions independently. The absence of a unified system of accounting and control does not allow the availability of reliable data on the resources the company receives from advertising activity. Cases of advertising time established by contracts being exceeded by the television company VID, the producer firm Master TV, and other studios were revealed. In 1993 cases were allowed in which budgetary allocations were allotted to subdivisions without taking into account resources that they received from commercial activity. Thus, the board of directors of television programs was allocated R38 million at a time when the expenditures of the studio were fully covered thanks to income received from advertising activity. Just as heedlessly, R21 million were allocated to Radio Podmoskovye. A selective audit conducted in five studios established cases of nonpayment for placed advertising as far back as 1992 for a total sum of R45 million. In 1993 the indebtedness amounted to R441 million. It was only in December 1993 that the leadership of the company signed orders in which an attempt was made at systematization, accounting, and regulation of advertising activity, a statute was approved on the broadcasting advertising activity of the RGTRK Ostankino and the minimum calculation for advertising, and periods were established for effective rates. In 1993 the yield from commercial activity totaled R11.2 billion, although, according to an expert estimate of the Sociological Center, just for showing advertising RGTRK Ostankino should have received a profit of no less than R60 billion. This estimate is corroborated by the results of an audit of activity associated with the purchase of licenses for the right to show television serials by way of allocation instead of advertising time. As was shown by the terms of a contract concluded on 16 February 1993 by I.E. Malashenko, acting chairman of the company, with the advertising agency (RA) Premyer SV, in cooperation for the purchase from the WORLD VISION Company of the rights to show the television serial "Twin Peaks" and the organization of its showing on the RGTRK Ostankino channel, RGTRK Ostankino would have been able to receive R1.3 billion. In the contract, without the appropriate economic calculations, this agency was granted 120 minutes of advertising time in all 30 episodes of the film, which according to the most minimal calculations amounts to about R596 million, while the total cost of renting the film is R159 million. What is more, the RA Premyer SV was given exclusive right of selection and placement of advertising in time belonging to the company (180 minutes) with estimated discounts of 30 percent, as a result of which the agency envisions additional income in the sum of R273 million. In 1993, in the course of the implementation of the contract, at the fault of the RA Premyer SV, 27 minutes of the company's advertising time was not used, in connection with which it did not receive a sum of R205 million. However, for shifting the dates of the showing of the television serial in the period of the preelection campaign, the Premyer SV advertising agency suddenly demanded an additional 69 minutes of advertising time, which could bring it income on the order of R393 million. Despite the fact that this violation was the result of "force majeure" circumstances and was associated with the necessity to implement Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 29 October 1993 No. 1792, the company unconditionally satisfied the claims of the agency. In addition, it paid for the services of the Ministry of Communications of Russia in the amount of R57 million for actually used advertising time. The contracts of 7 October 1993 were signed on these very conditions on behalf of the company by V.V. Lazutkin, the deputy chairman, with the same RA Premyer SV for showing the television serials "Don Ogast," "Streets of San Francisco," and "Wild Rose," 225 episodes all told. Only four television serials out of more than 100 films acquired by the Cinema Program Studio in 1993 were involved in the audit, and the loss to the company will total more than R12.3 billion, which basically goes into the income of the RA Premyer SV. With the connivance of the leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino, the activity of the commercial enterprises that were established by subdivisions of the company was allowed to drift. According to the status at the beginning of 1994, the founders did not have data available on the number of enterprises and the sums of payments submitted to their charter fund. Incomes from the activity of the commercial structures are not coming to the company. During the audit of the RGTRK Ostankino, an examination was made of the television company VID, the Intervid corporation, the Television Technical Center, the enterprises Vzglyad, Telechannel 2X2, TV Service, Cooperation, and a number of others that are directly associated with television and radio broadcasting and that cooperate with the company. It has been established that individual enterprises are indebted to the company for the payment of services, and cases of nonpayment of taxes were also disclosed. In accordance with legislation in force, they were charged with additional payments to the budget for a total sum of R1.1 billion. The question of the conduct of editing-publishing activity in the issuance of a television and radio press product has not been decided. A dispute of the leadership of the company and the editorial offices of the newspaper SEM DNEY, and the journals KRUGOZOR, KOLOBOK, and TELERADIOEFIR that are part of its structure, has been going on for practically all of 1993 with the joint-stock company RTV-press. Court examination of the complaint of V.I. Bragin, former chairman of RGTRK Ostankino, continued for almost a year. In addition, the Higher Court of Arbitration handed down several judicial decisions. At the present time the statement on filing a protest was recalled from the court by A.N. Yakovlev, acting chairman of the company. The dispute has remained unsettled, although the State Committee for Management of State Property of Russia illegally adopted a directive of 31 December 1992 No.1313-r on the creation of RTV-press in the form of a joint-stock company of the open type with the right of subsequent increase of the authorized capital by means of additional issuances of stock. The State Committee for the Management of State Property of Russia, not being a founder of the newspaper SEM DNEY, and the journals KOLOBOK, KRUGOZOR and TELERADIOEFIR, did not have the right to be in charge of them, and also to establish, as envisioned by Directive of the Government of the Russian Federation of 2 December 1993 No. 2171, an enterprise of a mixed form of property. The collectives of the editorial offices of the indicated publications, awaiting a final decision, were idle; however, about R110 million of budget resources were expended on their maintenance. The printing equipment of the Berthold firm, costing about DM2 million, was bought in January 1992 for resources allocated by the Ministry of Finance of Russia at the request of Ye.V. Yakovlev (former chairman of the company), allegedly to reequip the television apparatus, was transferred to the TOO [limited responsibility company] RT-press, and afterwards--to the joint-stock company RTV-press. From the moment of acquisition, this equipment has been on the balance sheet of the company, and the sum of deductions for depreciation totaled R28 million for 1993 alone. Contractual discipline is at an extremely low level. During 1992-1993 no procedure was established in the company for concluding contracts, and no record of them was maintained. In the past year the main personnel directorate of the company disclosed 115 unregistered contracts; however, it was not until August 1993 that an order was published on the introduction of a single register of legal documents. Frequently, contracts in behalf of the company are signed by managers of its structural subdivisions who do not have the appropriate authority; contracts are often drawn up without juridical study, they do not contain conditions that regulate the responsibility of the parties and the effective dates, they do not establish the procedure for their cancellation, and they frequently are of a declaratory nature. Up to the present time, the RGTRK Ostankino has not concluded a contract between the company and its main partner--the Television Technical Center. The main editorial board of the musical broadcasting studio Radio-1 frequently concluded commercial transactions without their written formulation. On 5 July of last year A.L. Razbash, former director of the creative arts association Eksperiment, now the deputy chairman of the company, concluded a contract on behalf of the RGTRK Ostankino with the television company VID for the production of the Capital-Show television program "Field of Miracles" in 1993, without having the power of attorney to do so. According to the status on 1 February of this year, the television company VID has an indebtedness to the company of R52 million, and another R70 million had to be exacted in the form of fines for delayed payments. This program continues to be shown despite the absence of a contract and unpaid debts. It has been established that some contracts not only do not protect the economic interests of the company but are simply not profitable for it. Thus, on 7 October 1993 the children and youth programs studio of the RGTRK Ostankino concluded a contract with INMAK, a joint-stock company of the closed type, and the Association of Assistance to the Development of Children's Television (limited company), for the showing of advertising subjects of the joint-stock company INMAK. At the same time, the transfer of monetary resources is supposed to be made, according to this contract, to the current account of the association, which is not part of the company's structure. A contract concluded on 12 July 1993 between the RGTRK Ostankino (former deputy chairman Yu.N. Bandura) and the firm Jeronimo LTD concerning cooperation in the purchase of rights to show film products of Western Europe and the United States, and also the organization of their showing on company channels, envisions the payment of income from advertising during the showing of films to the current accounts of foreign firms. In accordance with a "Supplement to a Gentleman's Agreement" drawn up on 24 July 1993 by Yu.N. Bandura, former deputy chairman of the RGTRK Ostankino, and Mr. I. Amors, president of the enterprise Ostankino Development, 100 minutes of advertising time will be transferred from this enterprise to the company at a price of $3,000. Thus, the enterprise sold the company a "commodity" that it did not own officially. Nevertheless, on the instructions of the former leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino (V.I. Bragin and Yu.N. Bandura), in October 1993 the company transferred $300,000 to the account of this enterprise. In 1993 the RGTRK Ostankino (former chairman V.I. Bragin) concluded a contract with the TOO Kamaka on the rerecording by the firm of television materials with the subsequent sale of the right of showing them by commercial television companies. In the period from July to December of 1993, the TOO Kamaka transferred to the company 360 cassettes with 432 programs from which 382 were taken from the State Television and Radio Fund. The firm received R25 million for this work; i.e., resources were spent on the rerecording of programs already available in the state fund. To the present time, the company is not receiving income from this contract. The RGTRK Ostankino also does not have any kind of profits from a transaction concluded back in 1992 with the American corporation U.S.S.U. Arts Group, which was granted the exclusive right to the use of recordings of productions of classical music stored in the archives of the State Television and Radio Fund. On 16 January 1994, the "Aleksandr-Show," or "30 Years Ago" program, went on the air. Of the R67 million that were spent on the creation of this program, R40 million were allocated to the enterprise AMiK by the leadership of the company at the request of A.L. Razbash, who was at that time director of the Eksperiment association. The letter reported that the program will represent a story about television's past and present, but not the traditional anniversary celebration, and, in addition, there would be no commercials. But in reality, almost eight minutes of advertising time was set into the program. Even with a minimum estimate of the cost of one minute of advertising amounting to $12,000, this firm should receive an income of $96,000. But the company incurred only the expenses, inasmuch as, according to the contract concluded with the AMiK firm in 1993 on behalf of the RGTRK Ostankino by I.M. Podzigun, who was then the deputy director of the Eksperiment creative arts association, no stipulation on advertising time for the company was made. The reorganization of the Russian television system and the emergence in this connection of several state and independent television companies entailed serious problems that required their resolution on a legislative basis. Thus, the television companies entered into a competitive battle between themselves for an expansion of the viewing audience, often not taking the interests of the viewers into account. For example, the first channel of RGTRK Ostankino traditionally shows the main part of "Novosti" at 2100, and the All-Russian State Television and Radio Company on the second channel starts to show the next of the "Santa Barbara" series, or the rubric "Detective on Mondays." But during the Olympic Games in France in 1992 these companies transmitted the opening and the closing of the games simultaneously. The fact that the election blocs were in an unequal position during the preelection campaign can also be tied to the reorganization of state television. Thus, the blocs Civic Union in Behalf of the Stabilization of Justice and Progress, the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, and the Civic Club used more than 70 minutes of air time each, paying for these services in a timely way. At the same time, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord and the Democratic Party of Russia blocs and others have not yet been able to make payment even for the 14 and 24 minutes respectively of air time granted them. Up to the present time, a founders' contract has not been concluded between the Government of the Russian Federation and the RGTRK Ostankino that should regulate the mutual relations between the founder and the company, which is envisioned by the statute on the Russian State Television and Radio Company Ostankino approved by Edict of the President of the Russian Federation 2 April 1992 No. 421 "On Guarantees of Information Stabilization in the Activity of the Russian State Television and Radio Company Ostankino." The lack of a unified concept in the sphere of state television and radiobroadcasting has led to the direction of activity of the company being basically determined by the position of its leadership, but often also by the broadcasting studios themselves. The former leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino mainly paid attention in its activity to structural changes, without taking the necessary measures to reduce losses from the republic budget. Thus, analysis of the orders adopted in 1993, when V.I. Bragin was chairman of the company, showed that about 90 percent of them constituted orders on changing the structure and personnel lists of the subdivisions. Continuous changes led mainly to superfluous numbers. Thus, in the television studios in 1993, given a reduction in the volume of broadcasting in comparison with 1991 of almost one-third, personnel were cut by only 17 percent. In addition, the company not only reduced the volume of broadcasting but also lost program quality. With the establishment of the RGTRK Ostankino, by Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 27 December 1991 No. 331 "On the Television and Radio Company Ostankino," all associations, enterprises, and organizations that were liquidated by the All-Union State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company located on the territory of the Russian Federation were included in its structure. In the last two years, with the participation of the former leaders, the company has been deprived of practically all its buildings, equipment, and other property, but the main thing is the Television Technical Center. As a result of the reorganization conducted, the balance sheet of the RGTRK Ostankino now has only half of the production area in building 25 on Pyatnitskaya Street. Because of lack of premises the company was forced to rent an area in the Television Technical Center in building 12 on Koroleva Street. For the purpose of eliminating the noted deficiencies, it is advisable to send the auditing materials to the leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino for the adoption of measures.
