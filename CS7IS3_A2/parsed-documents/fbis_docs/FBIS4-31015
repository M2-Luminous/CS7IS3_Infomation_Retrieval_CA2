After recalling the fine relations between Romania and Greece, even at the time when the two countries belonged to differing social systems, the Hellenic politician pleaded in a press statement for the necessity of establishing a climate of peace in the Balkans. "Romania, Bulgaria and Greece are spaces of stability and these countries have to take over the initiative of pacifying the Balkans," Miltiades Evert said. He mentioned he proposed to the Romanian president "the signing of an agreement on existing frontiers intangibility" by the Balkan countries, as well as the passage to concrete measures for such a document to be signed the soonest. "The signing of such an agreement would be the first great step toward peace in the Balkans, that should be ensured first of all by the Balkan peoples," he added. In the same context, Miltiades Evert said that the signing of the proposed agreement would be difficult at this moment for Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, countries that are at war now, but the other states in the zone, he said, were bound to do it "precisely in order to prevent the expansion of the conflict and to ensure welfare and economic development in the Balkans." The conclusion of treaties to guarantee the current frontiers can be a first step toward securing peace in the Balkans, assessed Miltiadis Evert, president of the New Democracy Party of Greece, during an interview with Romanian Minister of Labour and Social Protection Dan Mircea Popescu, in Bucharest, on 31 May. The interview occasioned a survey of the stage of the bilateral relations which, they assessed, had to be increased and diversified, as well as the approach of stability and cooperation in the Balkans. Minister Dan Mircea Popescu outlined to the guest the Romanian Government's current priorities, emphasizing among them the securing of an adequate social protection and an increasing living standard of the population. He considered the difficulties Romania was going through at this time could be eased only through good-quality work, an efficient management and steady international economic cooperation, which, between Romania and Greece, could be achieved on multiple planes.
