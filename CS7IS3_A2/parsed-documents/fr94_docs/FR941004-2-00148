FR941004-2-00148 FR941004-2-00086 Eligibility Standards for Index Components The Components of the Index shall meet the following criteria at the time of issuance of the Notes: (1) A minimum market capitalization of $75 million, except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a market capitalization of not less than $50 million; (2) trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than one million shares, except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of not less than 500,000 shares; (3) at least 90% of the weight of the Index and at least 80% of the total number of components will meet the then current criteria for standardized options trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; (4) all components of the Index will be listed on the Amex or the New York Stock Exchange, or will be National market securities traded through Nasdaq; and (5) all components of the Index will be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act. Index Calculation The Index will be calculated using an ``equal dollar-weighting'' methodology designed to ensure that each of the component securities is represented in an approximately equal dollar amount in the Index. To create the Index, a portfolio of equity securities will be established by the issuer representing an investment of a specified dollar amount in each component security (rounded to the nearest whole share). The value of the Index will equal the current market value of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the component securities divided by the current Index divisor. The Index divisor will initially be set to provide a benchmark value of 100.00 at the close of trading on the day preceding the establishment of the Index. The number of shares of each component stock in the Index will remain fixed except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend (other than an ordinary cash dividend), a stock distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar event with respect to the component securities. The number of shares of each component security may also be adjusted, if necessary, in the event of a merger, consolidation, dissolution, or liquidation of an issuer or in certain other events such as the distribution of property by an issuer to stockholders. Shares of a component security may be replaced (or supplemented) with other securities under certain circumstances, such as the conversion of a component stock into another class of security, the termination of a depositary receipt program, or the spin-off of a subsidiary. If the security remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the component's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. 5 In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure continuity of the value of the Index. 5 The issuer will not attempt to find a replacement stock or compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy or a similar event.
