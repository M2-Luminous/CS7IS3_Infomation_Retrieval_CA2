FBIS4-45599 "jpten015___94001" JPRS-TEN-94-015 JPRS Environmental Issues 9 June 1994 AFRICA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Roundup of Environmental Reports Roundup of Environmental Reports AB2505120094 AB2505120094 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 6 to 17 May. Ghana The Volta River Authority [VRA] "banned activities like farming, tree felling, bush burning, and charcoal production along shores bordering the shoreline of the Volta Lake in six districts." The districts are (Asujaman) Kpandu, (Jasikan), Manya Krobo, (Fanti Akwa), and Kwahu South. A statement issued in Accra yesterday by the VRA explained that these activities, which have recently become rampant, are causing serious land degradation along the lake. The statement said apart from "degrading the environment, these activities have resulted in soil erosion, earth movement, landslides, and silting at the in-take area of the Akonsombo power plant. It noted that this reduces the output of the power plant and also creates maintenance problems for the VRA." The statement further explained that bush burning in the area near the Akosomba dam and the port exposes the area to fire hazards due to the storage and loading of petroleum products at the port. The VRA appealed to "district assemblies and chiefs in the affected areas to assist in the efforcement of the ban to prevent further degradation of the environment around the lake."

The latter was accompanied by the executive secretary of the Niger River Basin Authority. After the audience, Billo Soumana spoke to Alhassan Al- Mohamed: "The Niger River Basin Authority was established in 1964 with the objective of rational, equitable, and sustainable management of the basin's water, fisheries, and forest resources. Today, we are faced with a problem, because the Niger River itself is dying. So the Niger River Basin Authority must resume its activities in order to salvage the river. We discussed the possibility of saving the river, which is everything to us." Responding to a question, the minister stated that the river was being threatened by the low level of rainfall, and though there could be no direct action concerning rainfall, the environment could be restored. He disclosed that certain sections of the river were silted, and that desilting projects must be carried out and the basin protected. He added: "There is another threat which is little known to Africans, and that is the water hyacinth. This plant is unknown to Africans because it originates from Latin America, and has just appeared in Africa, threatening all our water resources." He concluded: "Efforts by individual countries on their own stretches of the river cannot save the river, and are doomed to fail if all the other countries concerned do not take the same measures." [Bamako Radiodiffusion du Mali in French 2000 GMT 17 May 94] Nigeria The Delta State Government says "it needs about 4 billion naira to effectively combat ecological and environmental problems." The commissioner for works, housing and transport announced this in Asaba when the staff and students of the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria paid him a courtesy call. He further said that "about 15 million naira would be needed monthly to provide temporary relief from coastal erosion and flooding." He used the occasion to urgently appeal to the National Committee on Ecological Disasters to come to the aid of the state, by providing the necessary financial and technical assistance.
