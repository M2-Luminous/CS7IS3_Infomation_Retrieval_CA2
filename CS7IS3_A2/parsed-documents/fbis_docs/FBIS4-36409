The Council listened to a report by Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah on the latest political developments in Yemen and the preparations under way for receiving brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's envoy. The Council also listened to a report presented by Interior Minister brother Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil on the stable security situation throughout the governorates of the republic, especially in the southern and eastern governorates. The Council was briefed by brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Abd-al-Qadir Bafadal, minister of supply and trade, on the stable supply situation throughout the governorates of the republic. The Council noted with great appreciation and pride the stands of our people in all governorates, especially in the southern and eastern governorates, and their support for the forces of the constitutional legitimacy and their unparalleled cooperation to defeat the secessionist scheme, which sought to fragment the country and harm a great historic achievement that the Yemeni masses looked forward to throughout the ages, represented by the reunification of the homeland on 22 May 1990. The Council was briefed by the Defense Ministry on the military situation. In this regard, the Council praised the great efforts being exerted by the Armed Forces and security personnel to maintain our people's gains and national unity, consolidate security and stability, and thwart the intentions of those dreaming of harming Yemen's most sacred gain. Meanwhile, the Council noted its extreme regret for certain states' statements, which reflect unprincipled stands on what is going on in our country. The Council hoped that these states will reconsider their stands in a manner that proves that they are really interested in preserving Yemeni blood and discouraging the secessionist rebels in order to safeguard Yemen's national, legitimate right to reinforce its unity and ensure its and its neighbors' security and stability. The Council reiterated that Yemeni unity is not only a national Yemeni gain, but also an Arab gain which had been wholeheartedly aspired to by all Arab masses.
