The leaders of a number of ministries and departments were invited to it. Kairbek Suleymenov, a state adviser, gave a report. The speaker noted that a lot of criticism is being directed against the president and the government for the state of crime. But few take upon themselves the work of analyzing how consistently measures are being carried out that are directed at strengthening law and order and legality. For example, necessary changes to legislation are being made effectively. Work is coming to a conclusion on the adoption of a crime and a criminal procedure code. A state program of legal reforms is being implemented. Organizational measures set forth in the anticrisis program and the program to fight crime in 1993-1995 have been implemented in many ways through edicts and decrees of the president and decisions of the government. In a word, there is a legal basis for strengthening the fight against crime in the republic. And the references of executives of law enforcement organs to its absence only indicates their unprofessionalism and poor understanding of the situation, and their elementary legal ignorance. The speaker recalled that the February 1992 decrees of the president proposed to discharge those who were unable to cope with their duties from the positions they occupied. However, there has been no work in this direction to the present day. It is not a question of firing personnel, but it is no longer possible to condone the obvious idleness of individual workers. A good third of the officials on the job are of no use, but the departmental chiefs resigned themselves to this a long time ago. In the last two years, just in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], 636 extraordinary incidents and 380 violations of the law were committed, and 215 officials were convicted for various crimes. Four thousand and seven hundred and sixty-six persons were discharged for unfavorable reasons. The offensive against crime will not start until strict order is established in the system of law enforcement and judicial organs itself. The economic services of the MVD are not working effectively, where under the slogan of healthy competition they actually continue to duplicate each other and where various organs work on trivia. In summing up what was said, Kairbek Suleymenov declared that in individual oblasts whole subunits have not given any results for years, and a good half of the officials of the economic services of the MVD are not worth their salt, and no one is in a position to compel them to work on important matters. The solution, in the opinion of the state adviser, is to unite these services and to conduct a tough objective report on the efficiency of the personnel. The protection of public order is also organized with poor results. The meager means of the budget are frequently spent on computer equipment, which later rusts in storehouses. Acquired motor vehicles are used by thousands of chiefs of all ranks for personal purposes, but not for patrolling by mobile militia groups. It has also become the norm for the courts to examine cases with a violation of dates. The Procuracy continues to engage in writing concepts that are not read by anyone and in senseless checks on the state of lawfulness. Cases of liberalism toward dangerous criminals on the part of the courts have become general. The Ministry of Justice does not have continuous effective information about punitive practice. Kairbek Suleymenov also said, in particular, that the distinguishing feature of criminal tension is the theft of firearms and ammunition in military units. In the last two years and four months, more than 1,300 firearms items were stolen, including 160 assault rifles and more than 500 pistols. In this same period, 2,059 rifle barrels were confiscated from the population, including 91 assault rifles and 825 pistols. Firearms were employed in the commission of 2,465 crimes. The state adviser proposed to carry out an action of the voluntary surrender of firearms and ammunition, which will promote an improvement in the situation. Taking part in the discussion of the report were Minister of Internal Affairs Vladimir Shumov, Procurator General of the Republic Zharmakhan Tuyakbayev, KNB [National Security Committee] Deputy Chairman Zhenisbek Zhumanbekov, Deputy Minister of Defense Valeriy Sapsay, and Commander of Internal Troops Aleksey Filistovich. The result of the discussion of the question was the adoption of a protocol decision directed at reinforcing the fight against crime and strengthening legality in the republic.
