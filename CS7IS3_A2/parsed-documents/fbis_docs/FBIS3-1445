Lazare Aka Saye has the details: [Begin recording] [Saye] [passage omitted] The National Assembly's second extraordinary session for 1994 began this morning in Abidjan. The session was summoned by its speaker, Charles Boza Donwahi, at President Henri Konan Bedie's request. Three main items are among those on the agenda for the session: A bill amending the 1993 budget bill, the 1994 general operating budget bill, and the 1994 Special Investment and Equipment Budget Bill. These three bills will be examined by the institution's economic and financial commission on 24 March. [passage omitted] In his address, the speaker called on the government to reflect and act pragmatically, taking into account the present situation. According to him, the current situation is marked by, among other things, the CFA franc devaluation, a thorough revision of the tax system, rigorous management of state's affairs as a good head of family, and a reduction in unemployment through the reactivation of small- and medium-scale enterprises. It is also marked by the insertion of youth into the economy and the need to implement social measures to alleviate the concerns of workers, households, and the neediest in the social strata. These are the many real concerns to which the prime minister responded this morning in his statement on government economic policy for the years ahead. Let us listen to him: [Begin Duncan recording] I will not forget the support brought by the National Assembly to the major economic and financial reforms which I presented on behalf of the government as minister in charge of economy, finance, and planning. By passing the bills related to these reforms, the National Assembly demonstrated its willingness to support our country's recovery efforts. Once again, I thank it for its support. It is in my capacity as prime minister and head of government that I am making today's policy statement to the National Assembly. On this occasion, I would once again like to say how honored I feel in assuming this responsibility, which was entrusted to me by President Henri Konan Bedie. It is under his highly enlightened leadership that the government's action was initiated, and it is already marking the country's life and giving a new impetus to our national policy. The change in the CFA franc exchange rate, the backup measures that have been taken, and the signing of the treaty creating the West African Economic and Monetary Union have deeply influenced our country's economic environment. The government has adopted guidelines for the policy it is implementing, and I propose to explain the highlights of this policy to the deputies who, in fact, represent our compatriots at the National Assembly. Our policy is based on the reinforcement of national cohesion through solidarity and security, the continuation of a foreign policy whose uniqueness lies in seeking solutions through dialogue, in the implementation of a liberal economic policy which is resolutely aimed at restoring balance and sound, lasting growth. Peace, dialogue, fraternity, tolerance, solidarity, security, and balanced, lasting growth are in short the watchwords of our policy, the implementation of which I will strive to explain. I will cover four sections concerning the consolidation of our economic and financial situation. The first section deals with our economic situation -- the change in the CFA franc exchange rate and the restoration of our economy's competitiveness, the restoration of public finance, the regularization of payments for domestic and external debts, and the resumption of investments. In order to make you understand the true importance of such a substantial change, I would like to briefly recall our past economic situation. What kind of economic situation have we had in the past? After years of progress, our economy, as each of us knows, was seriously disrupted -- important reforms were initiated to correct the situation. Cote d'Ivoire has been going through a difficult economic situation since the end of the 1980's, for reasons which are well known. Those reasons are: Deteriorating terms of trade, unstable exchange and interest rates, and internal management shortcomings which came to light after the economic boom was over. The economic crisis was marked by a halt in growth, a sharp decline in state finances, dwindling revenues, a reduction in remunerated employment, a fall in public and private investments -- which accelerated the downward trend in economic activities -- and our economy's lack of competitiveness. The imbalances in our foreign accounts and in our state revenues prompted the drawing up of adjustment programs aimed at putting an end to this situation and correcting our structural shortcomings. These programs, initiated as early as 1981, involved the reorganization of the public sector, which underwent a shakeup; and the capital budget, which was drastically reduced. Unfortunately, as the world economic situation continued to deteriorate, we were obliged to pursue and expand our adjustment policy. The program implemented in 1990 as part of the renovated institutions strove to reinforce the adjustment measures already taken and to widen the scope of reform. That program was comprised of two aspects. The first one was the stabilization of state revenues, which has almost been achieved as the budget, which showed a 224-billion-CFA franc deficit in 1989, was balanced in 1992. The second aspect comprised significant structural reforms aimed at favoring the return of growth. This is a very important element, because it enables our country to benefit rapidly from the new exchange rate of the CFA franc, coupled with comprehensive reforms in our economy and institutions. Let me mention rapidly the main programs which were affected. They are the energy program, whose management was reorganized to create conditions for its development; the water system; the financial sector, which restored the solvency of our banks, put our insurance companies into order, and gave new impetus to the Abidjan Stock Exchange. Other programs initiated include human resources, which we are promoting by providing considerable support for the rehabilitation of the health and education sectors; the restoration of economic competitiveness, mainly on the basis of market rather than controlled prices; the liberalization of domestic and international trade; the easing up of labor laws, the granting of a more flexible tax package with a reduction from 50 to 35 percent in taxes on profit margins; the extension of the scope of the value- added tax with the abolition of taxes on services -- except those affecting bank interests; and a reduction from 11.5 to 2.5 percent in 1993 in the taxes on salaries paid to Ivorian workers. Under the 1994 draft budget, we are proposing that these taxes be completely abolished. Also abolished are other taxes such as the tourism development tax and a number of registration fees. Our relentless efforts to harmonize the tariff system by reducing the rates or streamlining docking duties has thus specifically benefited the importation of inputs for agriculture and textile industry, as well as for the chemical and metal industries. All these tax measures represent a revenue loss of more than 70 billion CFA francs, which demonstrates the significant support given to the manufacturing sector, and the sizable efforts required to offset the loss to state revenues.
