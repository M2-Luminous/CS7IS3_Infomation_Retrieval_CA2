FR940203-2-00136 FR940203-2-00068 Discussion: The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is not limited to non-college-bound students. Rather, it is intended for all students. The definition of the term ``All students'' refers to students from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances ``including *␣*␣* academically talented students.'' The notice states that career majors would typically include two years of secondary schools and one or two years of postsecondary education. As a result of their participation in a School-to-Work Opportunities program, students who are completing their first or second years at the postsecondary level would be encouraged to consider different options in employment and education, including enrollment in a four-year degree granting college or university. In addition, since students in School-to-Work Opportunities programs will be held to high academic standards, including, where applicable, those developed under Goals 2000, the Secretaries expect that these high standards will ensure that students who have participated in their State's School-to-Work Opportunities program are academically prepared for enrollment in four-year postsecondary institutions. However, in response to this comment as well as other related comments, the definition of ``career major'' has been revised to include admission to a degree-granting college or university as a possible outcome. Changes: The definition of ``Career major'' has been revised to include admission to a degree-granting college or university as a possible outcome for participating students. Comments: Two commenters stated that the proposed school-based learning component is inadequate with regard to the degree of participation that it requires from businesses and industries in such areas as planning, curriculum and program development, instruction, evaluation, and job placement. The commenters felt that the notice fails to take sufficient advantage of many effective ways in which business can be a partner with education throughout the entire instructional process prior to actual paid job placement. Discussion: The Secretaries strongly concur with the commenters that the active and continued involvement of business and industry is essential to the effective integration of school-based and work-based learning. Under this competition, business and industry involvement is a requirement, as provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of the priority contained in this notice. Plans will be reviewed for evidence of such involvement, as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of the selection criteria, ``Collaboration and Involvement of Key Partners_Involvement by key parties.'' Moreover, the School-to-Work Opportunities program does not limit the involvement of business and industry nor limit their roles in the collaborative partnerships. Indeed, business will necessarily play a key role in the design as well as the implementation of each State's School-to-Work Opportunities program. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter believed that, while still in school, students should be linked with the workplace for mentoring, job-shadowing, and other context-based experiences that can contribute to increased program completion and employment. Another commenter believed that businesses should provide significant input to the design of curriculum, provide mentors, pay students, develop skills standards, and employ youth. This commenter advocated the involvement of employers who currently participate in work and learning programs, rather than merely involving industry leaders. Discussion: The Secretaries strongly concur with both of these commenters but believe that the notice currently addresses their concerns. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter was of the opinion that there is virtually no capacity in schools or anywhere else to counsel students on career majors and suggested that this area of the initiative be considered further. Another commenter noted that the school-based learning component does not specify when career counseling should begin. A third commenter suggested that, since the first bullet under ``school-based learning'' suggests that career majors may be ``reconsidered,'' a second bullet should be added immediately under it, to read: ``School-based learning that includes the integration of occupational information and career development assistance into academic instruction and the availability to students of direct access to that occupational information and those career development assistance tools that relate occupational choice to educational attainment.'' The commenter believed that, without this additional requirement, the choices made by students may not be realistic or appropriate.
