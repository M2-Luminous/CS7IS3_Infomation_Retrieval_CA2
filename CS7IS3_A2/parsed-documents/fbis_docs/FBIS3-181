The Transitional Executive Council has resolved that the plan "should be suspended until the controversy is settled." Shill disclaims "ulterior motives" in unveiling the plan. "Whatever the rights and wrongs, those with the interests of the homeless at heart will want a start made. Housing has been a political football far too long." BUSINESS DAY Warning Against Jeopardizing Housing Plan -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 March in a page-8 editorial also refers to Housing Minister Shill's announcement of the 10-year housing plan, saying "such an important project should not be jeopardised by politicking or an individual's ego." In calling for Shill's resignation ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa "accused Shill of trying to hijack the project for the benefit of the National Party, in spite of an appeal by the National Housing Forum that he should wait until a few sticking points had been cleared up." The plan "clearly has the general approval of the forum, and putting it into operation will be the task of the new government." The forum will have to "smooth out remaining problems at its plenary session on March 14, and then get on with the job of building houses. It should not be distracted by the pleasure of taking parting shots at Shill." SOWETAN Call for Government To Address Election `Anxiety' -- "Too many things seem to be falling apart as we near the magical date for the first one man, one vote elections," declares a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 2 March. "There are political disruptions and violence at the macro level while things are not exactly rosy at the local level." The editorial refers to the strikes at various hospitals, and the strikes by railway employees, as well as the "uncertainties" in the taxi industry. "There is too much uncertainty and anxiety. If the Government is serious about having proper elections, they must put their house in order. They must give those they hope will vote for them the confidence that the situation will improve after the elections."
