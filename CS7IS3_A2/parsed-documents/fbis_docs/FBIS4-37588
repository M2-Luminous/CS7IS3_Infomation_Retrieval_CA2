The Central News Unit reports that along the route of the march the mourners, by chanting such crushing slogans as "Death to America," "Death to Israel," "Death to hypocrites," "Today is the day of mourning," and "The leader Khamene'i is in charge of the mourning ceremony," renewed their eternal allegiance with the leader and the guardian of the Muslims' cause. They stressed their unbreakable unity. They also demonstrated their hatred and anger against this inhuman and anti-Islamic crime. The concluding resolution of the rally, in part, while announcing readiness to obey and carry out the instructions of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the guardian of the Muslims' cause, says: We, the Muslims and border guards of the Sistan va Baluchestan Province, declare our heartfelt hatred against all enemies of Islam, particularly the hireling monafeqin, and we call upon the authorities of the Islamic Republic to punish the perpetrators of this heart-rending tragedy.
