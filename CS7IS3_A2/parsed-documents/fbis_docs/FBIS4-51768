FBIS4-51768 "dreas085_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 South Korea Dailies on DPRK Threat To Withdraw From MAC Dailies on DPRK Threat To Withdraw From MAC SK0305085794 SK0305085794 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of articles and an editorial published in Seoul vernacular dailies on 3 May on the recent North Korean attempt to replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty and its declaration to withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission, MAC, and that it will expel the Polish delegate to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 1,000-word article by Kim Chang-ki entitled: "North Korea Unilaterally Withdraws from the MAC -- Strategy Aimed at U.S.-North Korean Peace Agreement." The article writes: "North Korea's attitude is analyzed to be a scheme to turn the MAC, stipulated in the Armistice Agreement, into a mere scrap of paper and virtually destroy it, as noted by the government officials concerned." The article continues: "The North Korean side, however, said that it will abide by the existing Armistice Agreement until the replacement agreement is signed and that it will continue to maintain the hotline between military authorities, such as joint duty officers, of the two sides presently in operation in Panmunjom." The article cites remarks by a relevant government official: "The North Korean attempt to incapacitate the MAC must be its strategic move to reinforce its demand for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a U.S.-North Korean peace agreement and to discuss this issue in a full-fledged manner at the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks." The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,700-word article by Pak Tu-sik entitled: "The Scheme Behind North Korea's Declaration on Withdrawal From MAC." The article notes: "The North Korean strategy is to force the U.S. Forces out of the ROK through a peace agreement with the United States," adding: "In order to maximize its force of negotiation, North Korea is attempting to virtually scrap the MAC, the implementing organization of the Armistice Agreement, while conducting 'small provocations' near the Military Demarcation Line, MDL, annoying the ROK and the United States. This is interpreted to be the North Korean strategic move to create a situation in which the North Korean-U.S. peace agreement has to be discussed at the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a 1,200-word article by Pak Chae-pom entitled: "The Background of North Korea's Notification of Its Unilateral Withdrawal from the MAC -- Scheming To Deal Directly With the United States by Scrapping the Armistice Agreement." The article notes recent reports on North Korean moves, including provocative military actions near the MDL, and cites a Defense Ministry official's remark: "If the Armistice Agreement is suspended according to the North Korean demand, the situation on the Korean peninsula will be ambiguous -- neither peace nor armistice. North Korea has called for the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement, and is sure to call upon the United States for direct negotiations. The North Korean moves are a calculated action aimed at eliminating the ROK from the discussion of issues on the Korean peninsula." The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "Why Is North Korea Shaking Up the Armistice System?" The editorial begins: "North Korea, being cornered by the nuclear issue, is making a dangerous gamble to get out of a crisis," and notes: "North Korea is making these provocative moves to heighten the feeling of danger of military conflict and psychological anxiety on the Korean peninsula to disperse the international concern on the nuclear inspection issue and to maximize the utility of the nuclear card." The editorial continues: "Announcing its unilateral withdrawal from the MAC, North Korea stated that it will abide by the present Armistice Agreement until a new peace system, which it demands, is established and that the military hotline will continue. In view of the North Korean attempt to scrap the armistice system, we cannot believe this statement. North Korea's unilateral decision itself is a grave violation of the Armistice Agreement, and this is the first of its attempts to destroy the armistice system. If this attempt by North Korea is tolerated, it will commit other acts that violate the Armistice Agreement, creating a crisis." The editorial concludes: "North Korea is an unpredictable opponent, therefore, if the MAC, which maintains the armistice system and manages crises, is incapacitated, it could bring about the danger of an armed conflict. The government should not simply concentrate on assuring the people of the lack of signs of North Korean provocation, but see the seriousness of the problem and establish a posture of preparedness to cope with the ensuing developments."
