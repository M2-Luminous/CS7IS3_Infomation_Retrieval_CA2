FBIS4-42118 "drweu104_o_94010" FBIS-WEU-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 CYPRUS Denktas: CBM's Not Dead, Ministers Convened Denktas: CBM's Not Dead, Ministers Convened NC3005210694 Nicosia BRTK Television Network in Turkish 1630 GMT 30 May 94 NC3005210694 Nicosia BRTK Television Network Turkish BFN [Text] President Denktas concluded his contacts in Turkey and returned to north Cyprus this afternoon. In a statement to the correspondents at Ercan Airport, he said that he had found an opportunity to make useful assessments of the latest developments on the Cyprus problem with the government officials in Turkey. Denktas said: [Begin Denktas recording] We had an opportunity to assess in detail the latest developments on the Cyprus problem with President Suleyman Demirel, Speaker of the National Assembly Husamettin Cindoruk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. As far as I can see, we tend to agree on contining the talks if the rights and powers that have been gained at the Vienna talks are included in the document, dated 21 March, or if the inclusion of the gains in that document is accepted. However, the decision on the matter will be made by the Turkish Cypriot people. Turkey will support the decision we make, be it in favor or against. Considering the fact that not much time is left, I shall ask the Council of Ministers to meet and discuss the situation as it is seen from Turkey's viewpoint. If we can adopt a decision, then we may brief the political party leaders early tomorrow morning. Or, we may hold a joint meeting to try to adopt a decision. [end recording] A correspondent recalled Greek Cypriot Leader Glavkos Kliridhis' statement that the process on the package of confidence-building measures [CBM's] has ended. Denktas said: [Begin Denktas recording] The Greek Cypriots say that Christ is resurrected once every year. The package will not be dead as long as we do not both agree that it is so. Nor will the package be valid if we do not jointly say that it is. In fact, no agreement can be reached if we do not jointly reach reconciliation. It would be good if they realized that state of affairs. They have to reach an agreement with us for reconciliation and peace in Cyprus. They may unilaterally say that the package is dead. Well, it is not dead. We are holding talks on that package. Gustav Feissel, the UN Secretary General's deputy special representative, informed us at our latest meeting with him that the UN officials would look into the matters we brought to their attention and would reply to the Turkish Cypriot side. How can the package now be dead? Talks are still being held on it. We discussed the matter in detail with the officials in Ankara. It was observed that we had overlooked this or that point. I do not wish to expound on them. However, I wish to say that either an effort is made in good faith to achieve a result or the package is declared dead at a certain point. That is what Kliridhis has done. No one can accuse us of delaying the matter. The past two months have been lost; it has been described as a delay. How was that period lost? It was lost because they [UN officials] changed the CBM's package in Kliridhis' favor, regardless of the fact that Kliridhis and I had agreed to it right at the beginning. Considering the changes, we have tried to establish a balance. The process of establishing a balance caused a delay. Had they not changed the package that we agreed to at the beginning on the condition that nothing should be changed in it, we would not have lost any time in the process. I wish to reiterate that Feissel informed us at our latest meeting that we are right and that they will look into the matter. Why did we hold talks in Vienna? They were reluctant to establish a balance in the package which they themselves had violated. However, they suggested that we should hold talks in Vienna. We went to that city. Why did they suggest that we go to Vienna if the results to be achieved in that city were not to be regarded as having strength and being valid? Why did they ask us to go to Vienna and spend funds if the results were not to be included in the package? Certain agreements were reached in Vienna. We have asked that they be included in the package. However, we have been informed that the UN Secretary General is holding his pen and is about to submit his report, which will blame the Turkish Cypriot side. Well, what shall we do? You must agree. To What should we agree? You must agree to a package that has shortcomings and has not been balanced. That is an injustice to the Turkish Cypriot side. Therefore, Kliridhis has described the package as a dead document. Well, the person who has described it as a dead package is probably able to resurrect it if he wishes to do so. However, we demand that the matters agreed on in Vienna be included in the package. We shall be ready to continue the talks if these things are included in that document. If they are not included, then it is up to them to decide what to do. [end recording]
