Their wrong actions surround them and, therefore, they must be defeated and must bow to the people's will and their strike force on all axes and sectors. On the Abyan-Aden axis, fighting is continuing in several directions, and the forces of renegade and secession are trying to send innocent people to certain death to merely gain time, show empty arrogance, and entertain themselves with destruction, after the units of the Armed Forces--the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy--tightened the siege and closed all outlets, and continue to pursue their targets with patience and accuracy, taking into account the circumstances in the fields of confrontation on this axis. All the feverish air and naval attacks have failed. The forces of apostasy and secession sustained heavy losses as a result of the lack of control of the collapsing and domineering forces that can think only of their dark and ominous fate. The brave men in the air defenses confronted the aircraft of the forces of apostasy and secession, downing two aircraft. The hostile air attacks did not cause any losses. On the Shabwah axis, the heroes in the units of the Armed Forces are continuing to carry out the duties assigned to them, and they made great progress in carrying out their missions after they managed to control the Nisab District as a result of the great cooperation by the brother citizens, who rushed to shoulder their responsibility along with their forces--the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. The Armed Forces have warmly welcomed a complete battalion of the Hunayshan Brigade, as well as the members of the police force in the Nisab District, with all their weapons and military hardware. They declared they were joining the forces of unity and constitutional legitimnacy, rejected the conspiracy of secession and the plan of renegade and rebellion, and condemned the sinful secessionist elements for what they did to the people, the homeland, and the Armed Forces and security. On the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, the heroes in our Armed Forces are continuing their progress to carry out the remaining combat duties on that axis. In this sector, 22 Katyusha bases were seized. The brave heroes in the brave Air Force continued to carry out the duties assigned to them with success and effectiveness. All aircraft returned safely to their bases. With the continued progress of the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy to confront the remaining forces of apostasy and secession, out of concern about people's lives, and to avoid the continuation of the fighting, whose result is considered as decided in advance in favor of the forces of the people, unity, and democracy, we renew our call to all officers, noncommissioned officers, and the soldiers who are still under the control of the sinful secessionist forces to leave the positions of hostility to join unity, the people, and the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. This is the place for every officer, noncommissioned officer, and soldier in the Armed Forces. They will find complete understanding of their situation and the circumstances that forced them to be in secessionist rebel ranks. They will get all the attention, care, and status they deserve under the banner of the glorious Republic of Yemen. As for the forces of error and darkness, the forces of secession, fragmentation, and destruction, their fate is known because the wrath of justice will inevitably reach them. As God has said: And say: `Truth has now arrived, and falsehood perished: for falsehood is by its nature bound to perish. [Koranic verse] [Signed] The Defense Ministry, Sanaa
