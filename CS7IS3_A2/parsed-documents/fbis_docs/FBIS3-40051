At a panel discussion of the Conrad Adenauer Foundation on the "Future of Reforms in Russia," Gaydar, with leading members of his party and other groups of the democratic camp, advocated the view that the amnesty decision of the State Duma in Russia will lead to civil war. The prominent Russian reformer advised the finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the seven leading industrialized nations (G-7), who will meet at Kronberg Castle over the weekend [26-27 February], to postpone further payment of IMF loans until "the efficient use of the money can be ensured" through specific progress in the reforms. This is not the case under the current circumstances. Nowadays, further external financial aid from the West is pointless, Gaydar said. The decisive thing is that Russia continue the initiated course of reform of its own accord and ensure the stabilization of the ruble. As long as the new government continues to drive the state finances into ever higher deficits with ever new promises of expenditure, one need not be surprised if Russian companies transfer more and more dollars into Swiss accounts. Gaydar harshly criticized the Chernomyrdin government for giving the ruble additional inflation by relapsing into the monetary union, as in the case of Belarus. The monetary union with other follow-up republics of the former Soviet Union has caused costs amounting to 10 percent of the Russian GNP. It is quite clear that reformers like himself did not make themselves popular by uncoupling themselves from the other republics. Viktor I. Sheinis, another high-ranking representative from the democratic camp, namely from the "Yavlinskiy-Bodyrev-Lukin Group" (Yablonko), painted a somber picture after the latest surprise coup of the old communists and ultranationalists in the State Duma. Dangers are growing in Russia -- also for the West -- that are much greater than the Iraq threat was at its time. At that time, the West mobilized gigantic resources at very short notice for the Gulf War. The Yablonko representative referred to the parallels between today's Russia and the Germany of the Weimar Republic, which was humiliated by the Treaty of Versailles. Ultrarightists and old communists are not offering any solutions for the enormous problems, but they are using the people's misery, which has been spreading following the collapse of the communist economic system. They are sowing hatred and use foreign policy topics as a playing ground for the domestic struggle for power. In view of the fragmentation and the difficulties in establishing democratic party structures, for instance, the democrats will have a very difficult position over the next months and years, Sheinis said. More clearly than the other politicians, who had flown in from Moscow, Sheinis pointed out that democrats and market economy reformers contributed primarily with their own mistakes to giving the old communists and the ultrarightists their current majorities in the large country. How harshly Russian democrats can polemize against the role of NATO in Bosnia and in the new relations with the East European reform states was shown by Sergey N. Yushenkov, member of the Defense Committee in the State Duma and manager of Gaydar's parliamentary group. On the other hand, Boris A. Solutukhin, who is responsible for human rights issues in Gaydar's group, made it clear that Russia's citizens will not easily permit themselves to be put into the straitjacket of a dictatorship again. The Russian democrats, however, seemed to agree on one issue, namely that the amnesty decision, which is supported by an unholy alliance of ultrarightists and old communists with a surprising majority, cannot be abolished by the courts. Rather, the opponents of economic reforms and democracy hardly have any other choice "than to adjust to even worse times." [sentence as published]
