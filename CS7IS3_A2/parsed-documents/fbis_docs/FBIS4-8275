The militant Islamic organization Hamas said in its statement the Afula attack was retaliation for the massacre in Hebron in the occupied West Bank in February in which a Jewish extremist shot dead 29 Palestinians. The Afula massacre claimed the lives of seven people and of the attacker himself, and 50 people were wounded. The Ministry "is opposed on principle to the solution of problems by the use of violence and terrorist actions which only aggravate the situation in the Middle East," the statement says and expresses support for political settlement on the basis of dialogue. "The Israeli-Palestine agreement the implementation of which has been the subject of intensive negotiations indicates a suitable way of solving the situation," the statement says.
