The need to coordinate employment was, in fact, stressed by United States President Bill Clinton, in his keynote speech, and, later, by Italian Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, who represents Italy at the summit along with Labor Minister Gino Giugni. [passage omiited] This theme [cooperation] was reiterated by Italian Treasury Minister Barucci who, in his address, agreed that the coordination of employment strategies was the only path which could be followed. "One cannot just rely on the development of world trade," he said, "or only on economic recovery, on the progressive liberalization of the job market or only on the revision of the welfare state. A blend of these instruments is necessary to combat unemployment." "Aside from keeping inflation under control, exchange rates stable and fully applying free trade agreements" the treasury minister continued, "what is necessary is economic decentralization with a growing role for the economy, information and an ambitious infrastructure investment program." In full support of the European Commission's white paper on employment, Barucci underscored how the problem of coordination was not only on an international level, but also on a domestic one. "We must commit ourselves to giving coherence to policies adopted on a national level," he said. The Italian treasury minister then went on to suggest "A coordination authority, which operates with the government chief of each nation, could ensure internal coherence and greater international cooperation, even by promoting proposals and support actions for the part of the OECD," the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. "To paraphrase a military theory" Barucci observed, on an ironic note, "I would say that unemployment was much too serious a problem to be left to the ministers for the treasury and labor. It is a problem for prime ministers." "This conference" Barucci continued, "was organized at the right time and with the right mixture of experiences. It has forced finance ministers not to just focus on fiscal convergences, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. It has forced labor ministers to look beyond the pain effects of employment." Turning his attention to the effects privatization is having on employment, Barucci underlined how "privatization, at least in the short-term, will create new unemployment. But its value will be relatively modest overall. Europe's objective must be to over-turn the ratio between created in the public sector in respect to those in the private sector." The Italian treasury minister then reiterated Rome's opposition to protectionism and argued how "if world trade continues to develop despite the recession, this is because the objective of liberalizing trade has been followed up with determination both on a multi- lateral level through GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and through the creation of regional organs." The problem of employment, Barucci observed, has so far been tackled paying more attention to the creation of jobs rather than of working hours. "It is of the utmost importance that new employment fully corresponds with the expansion of the market which can only be achieved through new productive investments. Once new work hours have been created, each country can then decide how to best translate this into new jobs." Barucci also stressed the importance of investment in workers, in training and research and the need to support small- and medium-size business, as done in Northern Italy.
