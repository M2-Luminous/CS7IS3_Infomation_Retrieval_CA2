Meanwhile, senior police officials warned that bombings may become fashionable again, especially in the deep South. Police stepped up strict security measures in public areas in Hat Yai and there were also security alerts in Pattani, Songkhla and Narathiwat said Pol Lt Gen Michai Nukunkhit, assistant police chief overseeing the southern region. More than 10 department stores in Hat Yai sought police protection yesterday. Police commandos patrolled the town's airport and conducted a bomb disposal rehearsal. Most shoppers shunned the normally bustling main shopping spot where the blast injured seven people Sunday. Sawai Na Phatthalung, chairman of Songkhla's tourism business association, said the bomb "has the biggest impact" on Hat Yai's tourism. "It's worrisome that planting a bomb in a crowded public area may become fashionable again," said Pol Lt Gen Michai. A letter purportedly from the Pattani Liberation United Organization (Pulo) was found yesterday in Hat Yai, claiming responsibility for the downtown bomb attack. Hat Yai police chief Pol Lt Col Khamronwit Thupkhrachang said the group called in the letter for the immediate release of four arson suspects arrested for having allegedly set fire to southern schools in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat in August last year. The letter, written in the southern Yawi dialect, was found inserted in the door of a car parked 20 metres from the blast site. It was handed over to police by the car's owner, Khamronwit said. The letter said the Pulo was not responsible for the arson attacks on the schools. "The group said it had no cause to attack the schools because Muslim children also studied there," the Hat Yai police chief said. On Sunday, two helicopter gunships and a command helicopter made four raids on a separatist gathering on Yala's Kudong Hill. The operation will continue for five to seven days. Provincial bomb experts said ammonium nitrate and diesel oil were believed to be components of the Hat Yai bomb. [passage omitted] Army Commander in Chief Wimon Wongwanit said yesterday terrorism has become frequent in Thailand, probably because "we are too friendly to tourists". Wimon said the "friendliness", which stemmed from the need to promote tourism is resulting in security loopholes. "We undoubtedly are good hosts. But this has provided a loophole for foreigners with ill intentions to create trouble in our country."
