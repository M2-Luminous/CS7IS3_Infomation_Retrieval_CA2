A note issued by the Mexican Navy Secretariat states that despite the authorities request and all the facilities given them to continue their trip safely, 62 of the 85 Cubans on the rescued boat, sailed off toward Miami. The boat, which sailed "without authorization and in violation of all dispositions and recommendations that banned them from departing the port in Isla Mujeres," was intercepted by the Mexican authorities. During the operation the Cuban boat collided with a Mexican Navy vessel participating in the operation. According to a report by an EL DIA correspondent, as a result of the crash, three persons were injured on the Cuban boat, including a pregnant woman and a child. Meanwhile, the Navy Secretariat explains that following the incident, the Cuban boat was returned to Isla Mujeres but that the occupants chose to remain on board. "The Mexican authorities reiterated, once again, their determination to handle the situation in strict compliance with the law and protecting the human rights of the illegal Cubans," the note adds. The communique stresses that Mexico "cannot allow the boat, Ferrocemento 25, to sail from Isla Mujeres" and adds that this decision was made to avoid endangering the lives of the occupants of the boat, which is not seaworthy. Before the attempted escape the Mexican authorities had given the 85 Cubans permission to remain in Mexico legally for 180 days and to take them to a place where they would be safe and where they could complete the procedures aimed at definitely resolving their situation. However, according to the press, this official offering was rejected by the group of Cubans who are determined to reach the United States by boat.
