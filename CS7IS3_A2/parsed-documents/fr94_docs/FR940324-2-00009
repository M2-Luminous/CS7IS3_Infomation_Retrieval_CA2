FR940324-2-00009 FR940324-2-00003 Comment 6 Peninsula et al. argue that the best information available (BIA) outlying rate of 115.15 percent should have been excluded from the sample rate calculation. Rather, the fourteen firms in the sample pool should be subject to a sample rate of 3.91 percent. Bristol similarly argues that the companies in the sample pool were unfairly punished by the inclusion of Apace, the firm which received the 115.15 percent rate. Bristol contends that the fourteen companies in the sample pool indicated a willingness to cooperate with the Department by submitting sampling questionnaire responses. Bristol further argues that had Apace not responded to the sampling questionnaire, it would have been assigned the 115.15 percent BIA rate, but would not have been included in the sample pool, thereby punishing itself, but not the others in the pool. Department's Position: We disagree with Peninsula et al. and Bristol regarding the appropriateness and fairness of including Apace in the sample pool. Removal of Apace from the sample pool would have jeopardized the integrity of the sample, as the sample margin would be skewed towards firms with low margins. We note that the sample rate of the four firms includes not one, but three firms with BIA rates. It is as reasonable for us to assume that Apace's rate of 115.15 percent represents one-seventh of the volume of sampled firms as it is to assume that LaMagma's zero percent rate represents one-seventh of that volume. Bristol is correct in its assertion that had Apace not responded to the sampling questionnaire, it would have received an uncooperative BIA rate of 115.15 percent, and would have not been included in the sample pool. However, once the sample universe is defined, and the sample selected, we cannot then discard the results of the sample for any particular selected company. There is no reason to believe that Apace's failure to respond to the antidumping questionnaire was not representative of other companies that answered the sampling questionnaire.
