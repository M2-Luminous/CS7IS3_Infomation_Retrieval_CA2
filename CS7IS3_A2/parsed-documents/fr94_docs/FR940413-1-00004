FR940413-1-00004 FR940413-1-00001 What type of end-use certificate system will best accomplish the objective of helping ensure that foreign agricultural commodities are not used in U.S. Government-assisted export programs while still maintaining compatibility with the grain merchandising system of the U.S.? Should a U.S. end-use system be patterned after the Canadian end-use system and, if so, in what way? Should a U.S. end-use system simply adopt the Canadian provisions? Or, in that the Canadian system reflects the Canadian marketing system, should the U.S. adopt an end-use system that also reflects the U.S. marketing system? The key issue separating the following alternatives involves the issue of commingling vs. separate storage (i.e., identity preservation) of imported and U.S. origin grain. In brief, the proposed alternatives are as follow: (1) Allow commingling of imported and U.S. grain. Require that a certificate which collects all relevant information be issued at the U.S. border on imported grain. Continue (or modify) current ASCS rules and policies that help ensure that foreign agricultural commodities are not used in U.S. Government-assisted programs. (2) Allow commingling of imported and U.S. grain. Require that the commingled imported and U.S. grain be stored separately from U.S. origin grain until delivered to the end-user. (3) Prohibit commingling of imported and U.S. grain. Require that imported grain be stored separately from U.S. origin grain until delivered to the end-user. The following provides additional information on the proposed alternatives. Variations on these alternatives may also be considered. (1) ASCS could implement a ``border certificate'' system in which, as the agricultural commodity crosses the U.S. border, the importer would complete a form identifying the various required information elements. Under this scenario, certificates would be issued and collected at the border. ASCS could compile data, publish reports, and perform compliance checks based on the information collected. This alternative would be the simplest of the alternatives to operate and administer. It would not impose any additional burden on the U.S. grain handling sector. (2) ASCS could implement a system which tracks commingled grain. This scenario would allow foreign agricultural commodities to be blended and commingled with U.S. commodities under the requirement that all lots containing commingled U.S. and foreign agricultural commodities be tracked, with a complete paper-trail, throughout the entire U.S. commodity system. This alternative would permit the blending and commingling of U.S. and Canadian grain, but only under the condition that all lots containing even a trace amount of Canadian grain be identified and tracked through the grain system. For example, if one ton of Canadian wheat was imported and blended with 10 tons of U.S. wheat, that entire lot would have to be identified as commingled U.S.-Canadian wheat and tracked to the final user since that 11 tons of commingled U.S.-Canadian wheat would not be eligible for use in Government-assisted export programs. If the commingled lot were further blended with another 19 tons, and then split into two separate lots of 15 tons_the identifying paperwork would have to accompany both lots through the rest of the marketing chain. To make this alternative work, ASCS would have to be able to require that the identity of the commingled grain be preserved on all commercial sales documents, such as invoices and bills of lading, from the first point where the U.S. and Canadian grain is commingled through each subsequent sale, i.e., from the point of commingling through the remainder of the U.S. marketing chain to the processor, feedlot, brewer, distiller, or exporter.
