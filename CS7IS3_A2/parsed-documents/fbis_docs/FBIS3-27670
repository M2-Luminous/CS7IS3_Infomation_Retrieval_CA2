Medium-sized and small state firms "with less than desirable management and profits" were sold, transferred or merged amid the introduction of new legislation aimed at clarifying the murky issue of property rights, said Jia Hefing of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring (SCER). In China's 16 largest cities, 2,900 medium-sized and small firms were sold or merged, and property rights worth six billion yuan (700 million dollars) were effectively made productive, Jia said. Recent reforms have seen an increasing number of firms from different regions or sectors being merged, Jia said, citing enterprises in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen which have taken over others by buying their stock. According to Jia, the growing number of pilot companies going public in China has provided a major boost to property rights reform. There are currently 3,800 pilot stock companies nationwide. China recently promulgated a series of laws and regulations, such as the bankruptcy law and corporate law which provide a partial, legal framework for defining property rights. However, according to a senior lawyer with a western law firm in Beijing, a comprehensive property rights law is still a long way off. "The authorities have been considering it for some time, but it's a complex and sensitive issue," the lawyer said. "For the moment they seem content to muddle through with the existing regulations, which are still far from adequate," he added. The SCER has pledged to clarify property rights which, together with ending management interference by bureaucrats and allowing firms to go bankrupt, are considered essential to the reform of inefficient state enterprises in China, which continue to be a major drain on government coffers.
