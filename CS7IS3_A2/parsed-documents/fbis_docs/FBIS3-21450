Despite an assurance from the Minister that there would be no retrenchment, the unions stuck to their threat of a country-wide bank strike on February 17. While the Minister invited the unions to "join the Government to write a new chapter in the history of the Indian banking system," the unions presented their own plan of action for revamping it. They opposed any privatisation and protested against the Government move to offload 49 per cent of bank equity to the public. The unions alleged that the current sickness in the banking sector was the result of decision by authorities which had allowed "unconcealed political use of banks and their resources." They said three-fourths of the outstanding debts of the banking sector were directly attributable to the corporate sector. The Government, instead of taking corrective action, was now planning to hand over the banks to the same private sector. Punishment demanded: The union leaders demanded that the default in repayment of bank loans be made a criminal offence and that the names of the defaulters be published. The official response was that ten tribunals would be set up shortly to recover bad debts. On his part, Dr. Singh emphasised the need for banking reforms and sought the cooperation of the unions in making the Indian banking system vibrant and efficient. Referring to the apprehensions in the minds of workers about the closure of bank branches, he said inevitable and necessary changes had to be made, but the interest of the workers would be protected. Some changes had to be made if India wanted to be a major player in the global economy. Dr. Singh stressed that the reform process set in motion would create employment opportunities commensurate with the rising expectations of the people. He also said the Government wanted to have a standing mechanism for continuing the dialogue with the trade unions so that there could be pooling of knowledge and experience. The Minister said while India had to evolve a banking structure suited to the needs of the economy, it could not ignore development in other countries either. While conditions prevailing in Europe and the United States were very different, India could study what countries in Asia were doing to modernise their banking systems. Concessions opposed: According to trade union sources, during the discussion, the banking unions and central trade union leaders opposed to the granting of unrestricted concessions to foreign banks. The leaders made it clear that the country required an effective and depoliticised banking system, run on professional lines and not thoughtless implementation of the Narasimham Committee report. While agreeing with the Minister on the need for restructuring the commercial banking sector, the unions cautioned against any hasty move and suggested that the reforms process be spread over a six or seven-year period. They also argued for the setting up of an independent audit and vigilance commission to look into the banking irregularities. The union leaders suggested that the appointment of Chairmen and other top executives be made through a high-power banking service commission. They argued for setting up of an overseas banking corporation comprising all public sector banks abroad, besides pleading for stringent and effective inspections of banks to check irregularities and minimise corruption. The meeting was attended by representatives of the National Front of Trade Unions, Indian National Trade Union Congress, All-India Trade Union Congress, National Labour Organisation, Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, United Trade Union Centre (LS), Centre for Indian Trade Unions, etc. The bank unions included the National Organisation of Bank Officers, Indian Bank Employees Federation, the All-India Bank Officers Confederation, the All-India Bank Officers Association and the National Confederation of Bank Employees. From the official side, the Finance Minister was assisted by the Finance Secretary, the Banking Secretary, the Insurance Secretary and the Reserve Bank Governor, Dr. C. Rangarajan.
