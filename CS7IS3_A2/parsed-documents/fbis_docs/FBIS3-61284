The per capita industrial and agricultural product in the republic is more than 20 percent higher than the average in Russia. Tatarstan's economy is undoubtedly heavily dependent on the stable operation of the enterprises of many sectors, both of Russia and of other states that were formerly a part of the Union. An analysis of the republic's economy requires an examination of common problems, therefore. The word "crisis," which has become habitual in recent years, is the most common characterization of the state of the whole of the former USSR, both in the sphere of the economy and in sociopolitical life. The illusory expectations of an improvement in life introduced to the consciousness by dishonest politicians as of the 1980's have led to social fatigue and the apathy of the majority. It is naive to expect any improvement as a result of elections, referenda, and so forth. Yet the crisis is not forever. There is, as a rule, a way out of any crisis, and not just one even. A society, like any person also, has a choice of development options. The way out of the present one will be particularly difficult since the economic and political factors of development are too intricately intertwined, and the politicians' actions frequently do not fit within the framework of common sense and have been, from the viewpoint of the interests of the majority, of an irrational nature. It should be obvious to everyone today that the economy will not be stabilized in a short space of time with painless medicine. What is needed first and foremost for a way out of the crisis is a correct diagnosis and then the formulation of measures and persistent lengthy treatment signifying in practice nothing other than purposeful, dogged work based on definite priorities. Speaking of a diagnosis, it is essential to recognize that two processes are under way simultaneously on the territory of the former USSR: 1. Transition from the administrative-command state-run economy to a market economy. 2. The formation and development of a whole number of new states with their own economic and political interests, which are being manifested increasingly distinctly and which are gaining strength. Both these processes overlay one another, which is leading to an intermingling of economic and political problems, and diverse knots of various contradictions are becoming entangled here, which is frequently superficially once again, from many people's viewpoint, assuming an irrational nature. A painful transition from the domination of one interest--the supreme-power interest, which was implanted for several centuries, had little in common with democracy, and was divorced from the individual--to a polycentrism of interests is under way. An economy based on the interdependence of the regions, but with regard to economic expediency, is experiencing, following the country's disintegration, a particular sort of crisis. The economy of Tatarstan, as of other states, being a part of the economic complex of the former USSR, monopolized, isolated from the outside world, and closely interlinked, therefore, is experiencing the same difficulties and tackling the same problems as other regions of Russia and the CIS also. The slump, therefore, has been caused not only by the transition to market reforms but also the artificial severance of economic ties, which has occurred not only on the basis of market expediency but to a considerable extent on account of a clash of political interests. It has to be recognized that its own center of economic and political interests has taken shape in Tatarstan also, which is the objective basis of the formation of its statehood. The close interaction of all the republics is possible today only with regard to a balance of one another's interests. Attempting to emerge from the crisis without regard to this and seeking the stabilization of the economy to the dictation of any center whatever is a lost cause. A particular feature of the economy of Tatarstan is extensive cooperation by no means just with the economy of Russia but with all the former republics of the USSR. In addition, relations are being actively generated with many countries of the world. Whence Tatarstan's interest in dealing directly, proceeding from the interests of the citizens of its republic. It is for this that Tatarstan today needs the status of subject of international law, which is recorded in its constitution, which was adopted more than a year ago and has become an instrument of political stability and harmony in the republic. Tatarstan's cool attitude toward the draft Constitution of the Russian Federation, whose authors completely ignored the wishes of the people of Tatarstan expressed at a referendum and already recorded in the constitution of the republic, is not surprising but natural, therefore. Tatarstan cannot, understandably, forgo the interests of its citizens to the detriment of its own economy and will seek to continue negotiations to establish normal relations with the leadership of the Russian Federation based on a bilateral treaty. The program of radical economic reforms of Russia, which sets their general tone, put the main emphasis on price liberalization and assumed that prices would shape the main production structures. But prices perform this role only in a developed market economy and with the balance and conformity of the cost criteria and material structures and also the equivalent interaction of the domestic and foreign markets. As we all know, we still have a long way to go to achieve this ideal. As of 1992, therefore, the Republic of Tatarstan, proceeding from the specifics of its sectoral structure of the economy and possibilities, took a somewhat different path from Russia, and from the Commonwealth countries also. The maximum coefficients of an increase in the retail prices of basic foods were adopted, and this ensured a smoother transition to the market and supported the population of the republic since prices grew in line with the increase in personal income. But the continuing inflation is leading to an increase in the cost of living and in the cost, primarily, of basic foods in all regions of the Russian Federation. Under these conditions the relatively low retail prices in the republic engendered speculation and other malfeasance in trade. Protecting the consumer market became increasingly difficult. There came to be a situation requiring a serious adjustment of the policy regulating minimum personal income and preservation of the interests of the agricultural commodity producers. In connection with what had been set forth by the parliament of the Republic of Tatarstan, a program of targeted social protection of the populace of the Republic of Tatarstan which was of an innovative nature in the Russian Federation was adopted. It made provision together with an increase in the retail prices of basic foods for targeted compensation for children, retirees, the handicapped, and so forth. In addition, a big step in the direction of an increase in the purchasing power of the population was taken, and the minimum wage was revised and increased considerably. Thus the idea of the targeted nature of protection during transition to the market is being realized in practice. Its further development presupposes the monitoring of the dynamics of prices and incomes. Specifically, a constant adjustment of the minimum income at the level of the minimum consumer budget is contemplated as of 1 January 1994. A comparative analysis of the weekly cost of a basket of 19 most important foods in various cities of Russia and Tatarstan on 26 October of the current year shows that the city of Ulyanovsk and the Republic of Tatarstan remain the cheapest. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weekly cost of a basket of 19 foods on 26 October 1993 (rubles) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ulyanovsk |2,872 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazan |3,857 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ufa |4,383 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cheboksary |4,630 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nizhniy Novgorod |5,243 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Izhevsk |5,323 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |St. Petersburg |5,897 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moscow |6,280 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average for the Russian Federation |5,448 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The chosen particular path of market reforms, which are to a large extent of an evolutionary nature, also encompasses government regulation of the reproduction processes in the sectors of the agro-industrial complex. The redistribution of some budget funds to the benefit of the agrarian sector made it possible in 1993 to overcome the slump, and an increase in production began in the meat and dairy sectors of agriculture as of March. Thus production in nine months of 1993 constituted compared with the corresponding period of last year 102 percent for meat, 110 percent for milk, and 105 percent for eggs. Productiveness both in terms of the per-cow milk yields and the average daily weight gains in animal husbandry increased here. A relatively good cereals harvest was gathered in (approximately 1 tonne per capita, which is a good indicator by international standards), and potatoes, sugar beet, and vegetables were harvested in a sufficient quantity. The alternative economy is gaining strength in the republic simultaneously. In the course of realization of the State Privatization Program, 286 enterprises with a total statutory capital of more than R166 billion, which employ 185,000 persons, had been privatized as of 1 November 1993. In 10 months of 1993 privatized enterprises of the republic's industry had produced 27 percent of the total commodity product. In addition, there are altogether a further 1,000 large and medium-sized enterprises approximately operating in a privatization mode, among which are such important associations as Tatneft, Nizhnekamskshina, Tatsakharprom, and Tatnefteprodukt. The work performed on privatization made it possible to prepare the necessary economic base for the sale to the citizens of the republic of the 1992-issue privatization checks of the Russian Federation and the registered privatization deposits (IPV) of the Republic of Tatarstan, which our citizens began to receive as of August 1993. Auctions selling off shares of stock of the privatized enterprises and IPV have been held in the Republic of Tatarstan. These auctions have shown that the price of the shares purchased for IPV and for cash has been five-seven times higher than their face value. Shares of the Nefis Stock Company (the Vakhitov Chemical Works), the Melita Stock Company (fur-product works), and the Tatmetall Stock Company have been given a high quotation. The sale of stock at auction for IPV has enlivened the securities market. At the present time their quotation constitutes on average 1.84 of their face value, that is, an IPV valued at R30,000 has sold on average for R55,000, and in certain places, for R75,000. Reform of the military-industrial complex is a sore point. A fundamental restructuring of the entire technology is needed for enterprises of the defense sector's transition to the manufacture of civilian products. The sharp reduction--85 percent and more in a number of cases--in the volume of military orders has brought the majority of these plants and associations to the verge of financial collapse. According to an intergovernmental agreement concluded with the Russian Federation, Russia and Tatarstan are to provide for the funding of the reprofiling of the conversion enterprises. The manufacture of the TU-204M passenger aircraft is being assimilated with the support of the ministries of industry and economics of Russia and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan at the Kazan Aviation Production Association. Orders for the manufacture of machinery and components for oil and gas industry and for the agro-industrial complex are being placed at other former defense plants, and the manufacture of components for the new auto assembly works in Yelabug is contemplated also. But a substantial number of financial problems of conversion has simply not been resolved as yet. A special fund for ensuring a stable policy of the structural reorganization of the economy in the republic was formed recently. One further lever of structural reorganization and the stabilization of the economy of the republic is the attraction for a solution of its problems of foreign capital and an expansion of the network of joint ventures. The stability of the domestic political situation and the relatively normal "temperature" of the economic organism are making Tatarstan increasingly attractive for Western businessmen. The republic currently has 103 enterprises in which foreign capital participates: firms of the United States, Germany, Italy, Britain, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and others. The experience of recent years shows that Tatarstan, like everyone else, has been learning to "swim" under the new conditions of the simultaneous formation of its own statehood and market reform of the economy. This period will last for quite some time. A condition of the successful transition to a new type of economic system is politicians' capacity for securing the optimum combination of the objective interests of the citizens residing both on the territory of Tatarstan and throughout the space of the former USSR. Proceeding from its possibilities and the wishes of the people, Tatarstan is endeavoring here to become a worthy part of the world community and to develop while preserving the evolved economic, political, and cultural relationships with Russia and the other former Union republics.
