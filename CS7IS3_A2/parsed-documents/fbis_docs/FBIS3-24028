Reactions to the Greens' success varied, including "We've found someone to fight--and it's not nuclear power plants; they pose no danger." "The Greens are only hurting Ukraine's defense." To get to the bottom of things we had our correspondent interview Professor Yuriy Danylovych Dumanskyy, head of the Laboratory of Environmental Electromagnetic Factors, Ukrainian Scientific-Hygienic Center. [Correspondent] Professor, do radar stations really pose a danger to health? [Dumanskyy] Radar stations are a big source of environmental radiation, producing superhigh-frequency electromagnetic fields. An electromagnetic field is very damaging to living organisms. In human beings, for example, the central nervous system suffers (memory is impaired and reactions slow down). It is especially harmful to children, as we know from studies in Odessa. At high levels a person suffers from headaches, fatigue, and nervousness. Men's potency is reduced and women's menstrual cycle is disrupted. The effect of the exposure accumulates, but if it stops, the person recovers and the complaints stop. Especially high levels (more than 10 milliwats per square centimeter) cause clouding of the eye lens, the heat effect, and hallucinations. Plant tissues die and, at high levels, burn. [Correspondent] Is anybody watching over people's safety in that regard? [Dumanskyy] Hygienic normatives have been worked out to ensure safe conditions for people living in the vicinity of radar stations. On their basis the Health Ministry issued a number of requirements to radar station owners involving relocation, and certification of these units is underway. However, responses to the requirements have been slow. For example, the Defense Ministry pleads lack of funds. Moreover, not all units are covered yet--for example, over-the-horizon stations. [Correspondent] Who are the owners, and where are the units located? [Dumanskyy] Primarily the Defense Ministry, which has guidance stations, superpowerful space observation antennas, and PTO [technical service point] stations. The rest are divided into long-range and high-range (which are especially dangerous because their rays often "cling" to the earth). Radar stations are also used in civil aviation, maritime operations, and the weather service. Radar stations are located in population centers or (more often) not far away. As a result, worrisome situations have developed in Lvov, Mukachevo, Ivano-Frankovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Nikolayev, Odessa, Yevpatoriya, and Kiev. In Sevastopol the field is so strong that in some places it makes neon lights go on. [Correspondent] What is to be done? [Dumanskyy] Measures to prevent harmful effects of radar stations include 1) Moving stations outside of populated areas; 2) Resettling the inhabitants; 3) Changing the stations' operating modes; 4) Changing the angle of radiation; 5) Setting up restricted radiation zones; 6) Planting woods; 7) Raising the station above the locality; 8) Protective structures (banks, fences, dikes, and so on.
