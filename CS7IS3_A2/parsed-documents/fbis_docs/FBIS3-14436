FBIS3-14436 "drnes059_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 27 Mar 1994 SYRIA Press on Arab Boycott of Israel, Israeli Policy JN2703125694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 27 Mar 94 JN2703125694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Press review] [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN comments on the efforts made by some international quarters and some Arabs to effect a revocation of the economic boycott of Israel, affirming that Israel has not taken a single step in the direction of peace, and that it has not made any worth-noting effort to render the peace process a success. On the contrary, the paper adds, Israel has done its best to demolish the peace process. Moreover, it has failed to express any willingness to withdraw its troops from the occupied Arab territories. Worse still, it has not changed, even by a hairbreadth, its hostile settlement course. It has not halted, even for a single moment, the policy of repression, terrorism, displacement, and killing. Given all this, the paper wonders: What has changed to warrant an Arab revocation of the economic boycott of Israel, and the opening of Arab markets for Israeli products? Has Israel withdrawn from a single inch of occupied territory, or even pledged to do so? Has it halted its settlement policy? Has it revoked the policy of killing, displacement, and dislocation targeting Arabs? TISHRIN states that the Arab boycott of Israel was a response to the hostile and criminal Israeli policies, which are in violation of the most basic rules of international law, the Geneva conventions, and the UN Charter. Israel has not made any change in its policies. Consequently, there is nothing to warrant an Arab revocation of the boycott. Worse still, the Israeli aggressiveness and anti-peace course has been nurtured. For, in spite of Arab efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Israel has committed massacres. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is flagrant proof of Israel's aggressiveness. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN wonders: Would it be out of place if we ask those urging a revocation of the Arab boycott to put pressure on Israel to make it respect international law and human rights, and respond to the wishes for peace, particularly since the Washington talks have entered their third year, with nothing in the horizon indicating that the intransigent anti-peace Israeli position has changed? Under the headline "Rabin's Threats Are Meant to Circumvent Peace," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The bilateral talks are expected to be resumed in Washington in April after Syria, through inter-Arab coordination, has given the peace process a new lease of life by bringing it back on track. The paper adds: Although no date has thus far been set for the start of the next round of talks, the Rabin government has begun to step up its threats, and to couple these threats with aggressive acts against our kinfolk in occupied Palestine and southern Lebanon. The paper goes on to say: Rabin attempts to shuffle cards whenever he finds himself cornered, and whenever international efforts to advance the peace process reach an advanced stage. The developments we have seen over the past few months, particularly in the aftermath of the Geneva summit, have shown that Rabin's efforts to circumvent the summit outcome culminated in the Hebron massacre, as well as a spate of attacks on southern Lebanon. These developments have also proved that Rabin has remained hostage to a maneuvering mind-set opposed to peace, and that he has continued to cling to a host of impossible conditions that cannot but obstruct the peace process and kill the new opportunities created for it. Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH affirms the need to halt Israel's efforts to evade the requirements of peace, particularly since the attainment of just and comprehensive peace has become a regional and international demand that will reflect positively on the interests of the entire world community. For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the tragic situation being experienced by the city of Hebron 29 days after the perpetration of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The paper says: What is currently taking place in Hebron and the remaining parts of the occupied Arab territories must open the eyes of the world community to Israeli practices. This must also draw attention to the tragic situation experienced by the Palestinians under the hateful occupation, which has turned the lives of hundreds of thousands of people into an intolerable inferno, and deprived them of the most basic requirements of a free and decent life. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Israeli practices, which grow harsher and more ferocious day in and day out, and which have begun to take on an exceptionally bloody and heinous dimension, clearly show the Israeli rulers' determination to persist with their arrogance, stubbornness, and aggressive policy, which is diametrically opposed to the efforts to achieve just and comprehensive peace. The paper notes that these practices underscore the urgent need for extensive and effective international moves to create the proper mechanism for the implementation of the recent UN Security Council Resolution Number 904 to ensure Israeli compliance with the relevant international resolutions, and provide the Palestinians with real protection from the repression of occupation troops. The paper concludes by saying: Israel will be mistaken if it believes that it will manage to achieve its objectives through the pursuit of these policies. Israel must realize that the peace process will remain deadlocked unless it changes its conduct and concepts, particularly with regard to comprehensive solution and the recognition of the Palestinians' just and legitimate rights. No tangible accomplishment will be made unless Israel effects these changes. For, despite their strong eagerness to achieve peace, the Arabs will not bargain over their territories and rights. Nor will they accept anything short of complete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories. This is the only way to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.
