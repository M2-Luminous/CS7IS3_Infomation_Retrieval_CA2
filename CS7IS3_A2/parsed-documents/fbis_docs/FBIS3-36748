IF Note: During talks in Moscow on Monday, the Latvian and Russian delegations came to an agreement that the radar would function over the next four years and would be dismantled during the 18 months following the expiration of that term. If Latvia accepts these terms, Russia will remove its troops from Latvia by August 31, 1994. Earlier, Russia had intended to use it over the next five years. Latvia insisted on three years plus one more year for the dismantling of the radar. During a Latvian governmental delegation's visit to Washington last week, U.S. secretary of State Warren Christopher recommended that Latvia and Russia come to terms on the temporary use of the radar in the village of Skrunda. Clinton wrote in his letter that a compromise would be the best solution, as it will ensure the Russian troops' withdrawal this year. He also expressed confidence that the work done during the Latvian delegation's visit to Washington had ensured progress in the Latvian-Russian talks and helped improve relations between these two states.
