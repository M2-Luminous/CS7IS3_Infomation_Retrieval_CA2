SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing, as a direct final action, 5-year Phase I Acid Rain Permits to 57 utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). DATES: The permits will become final on September 12, 1994, except those permits on which EPA receives significant adverse comment by September 1, 1994. If EPA receives significant adverse comment on a permit, EPA will withdraw the direct final issuance of that permit and simultaneously re-propose the permit. Such re-proposal will provide an opportunity for public comment and requests for a public hearing. ADDRESSES: Administrative Records.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans (sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act). On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below, EPA approves for 1995&hyph;1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996&hyph;1999 in the draft permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated to each unit for 1995&hyph;1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft permits. The additional allowances discussed below, according to the settlement, are a one-time allocation and entail a simultaneous deduction of an equal number of allowances in a future year. Upon activation of conditionally-approved plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the remaining years the plan is in effect. EPA issues the following permits: Albany in New York. C R Huntley in New York. Dunkirk in New York. Goudey in New York. Greenidge in New York. Hickling in New York. Jennison in New York. Milliken in New York. Oswego in New York: 0 substitution allowances for each year and 86 additional allowances to unit 3 upon activation of substitution plan; 371 substitution allowances for each year and 8 additional allowances to unit 4 upon activation of substitution plan; 12,365 substitution allowances for each year and 2,533 additional allowances to unit 5 upon activation of substitution plan; 4,499 substitution allowances for each year and 79 additional allowances to unit 6 upon activation of substitution plan. Somerset in New York. Chalk Point in Maryland: No change for units 1 and 2; 9,000 substitution allowances for each year and 107 additional allowances to unit 3 upon activation of substitution plan; 1,519 substitution allowances for each year and 957 additional allowances to unit 4 upon activation of substitution plan.
