Over 89 percent of U.S. companies surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing said they backed the extension of MFN. And more than half said MFN should be permanent, rather than under annual review. The poll, conducted last month under the supervision of Gallup (China) Survey Company, covered 104 American companies in Beijing and Shanghai. About 11 percent of companies declined to comment on MFN. U.S. President Bill Clinton has until June 3 to decide whether or under what terms to extend MFN to China for 1994. The report said 85 percent of companies think their business will be affected if the preferential trade status is revoked or changed. If it fails to get renewed, 48.1 percent said they would suffer severe losses. The other half said it was hard to predict the impact on their business. But 13.5 percent believed the denial of MFN would affect them for two or three years. Negative Effect [subhead] About 17 percent said the negative effect would only last a year or two. Still, 11.5 percent of companies were optimistic, saying the shadowy period would last less than a year. Nearly half of the companies said the removal of MFN would cause Chinese and American firms to cut staff, but a third disagreed. On human rights, more than 70 percent of respondents opposed linking human rights to the MFN issue. Only one per cent of companies regard the linkage as effective. The report said most American companies are afraid the cancellation of MFN will play right into the hands of rivals from other countries competing in the China market. Over 66 percent of companies were worried about losing ground to competitors. There was also a strong feeling that competition will obtain more favourable tariff treatment in China. The Americans also fear the annual review of MFN will increase their business risks in China.
