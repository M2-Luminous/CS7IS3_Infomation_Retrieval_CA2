"We have seen a country with deeply rooted hatred and a wide gap between whites and blacks undergo significant democratic changes, especially recently, which a few days ago culminated in free multiracial elections," the president said, adding that the Slovak Republic considered it very important to participate in this event in order to confirm that we not only continue to be interested in cooperating with the RSA, but also want to start a new stage in mutual relations. The improvement of economic relations was also the aim of Michal Kovac's meeting with the governor of the South African central bank, who is expected to visit Slovakia in the very near future. Because Michal Kovac also met with Nelson Mandela, reporters inquired about the contents of their conversation. "Even though the conversation with Mr. Mandela was short, it was two or three times longer than his meetings with other delegations." Kovac conveyed to the president his thanks for his lifelong quest for the rights of blacks and for seeking a peaceful path toward solving this problem. "At the same time, I made use of the meeting to invite the president to visit the Slovak Republic. Mandela accepted the invitation; the date of the visit will be specified later. I personally believe that the visit might take place next year."
