A republican commission concluded that "the inventor proved in practice the possibility of making apartments and industrial premises impervious to radiation and providing effective collective protection to urban and rural residents at a lower cost." The invention can be used in the clear-up operations after accidents at nuclear power plants and other enterprises which deal with radioactive and toxic substances. It has been found effective by specialists of the Russian nuclear power ministry. In their opinion, it allows to localize emission of harmful radiation and substances for the duration of work aimed at preventing discharge of nuclides in the environment.
