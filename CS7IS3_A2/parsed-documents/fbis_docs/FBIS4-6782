Stunned, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party denounced his act as irresponsible. In the meantime, opposition Democratic Party leader Yi Ki-taek, who is visiting the United States, held an emergency news conference regarding the resignation of the puppet prime minister and demanded the resignation of the entire puppet cabinet in the wake of the puppet prime minister's resignation. He expressed a strong opposition to the fact that traitor Kim Yong-sam has designated Yi Yong-tok, current deputy prime minister and unification minister, as the new puppet prime minister, and revealed that he will vote in the National Assembly against Yi Yong-tok as the new puppet prime minister. The puppet prime minister's surprising resignation clearly shows that the Kim Yong-sam regime is floundering in an impasse it created itself while committing flunkeyist traitorous acts.
