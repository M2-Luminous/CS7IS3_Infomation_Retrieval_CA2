The Washington Government usually considers our country "excessively sensitive" when it reacts to comments made by U.S. diplomats on national political, social, or economic issues and denies that those statements are made with an interventionist intention. However, although the historical background of relations between Mexico and the United States offers enough reasons to be sensitive, the different representatives of the White House in Mexico seem not to be able to resist the temptation of slipping in (with more or less subtlety, according to the diplomacy of the official holding the position at the time) statements geared to pressure the national government to adapt its actions to Washington's needs, desires, or whims. The irrepressible tendency shown by successive U.S. ambassadors in our country to interfere in Mexico's internal affairs reveals, in a modified and polished manner, our northern neighbors' old belief that all the nations located south of the Rio Bravo are, in the end, nothing more than the backyard of the United States. When James Jones asserted, for example, that the recent entry of Mexico to the OECD and the signing of NAFTA "would oblige" authorities to act in a set manner (in this context, it is unimportant if the manner is correct or not), the U.S. ambassador seems to forget that the implementation of new commercial policies is a product of decisions that are the exclusive domain of the national government and have no direct relation to our country's internal political situation and that Mexicans are the ones who have to solve problems that derive from this situation. Likewise, when the U.S. representative in Mexico refrains from saying whether foreign observers are necessary, but emphatically asserts that "they will be here on 21 August," he again adopts -- although his manner is more veiled than the one used by his predecessors -- the interventionist attitude that has characterized U.S. ambassadors in the republic. Either the borderline between opinions and interventionist statements is too hazy for U.S. diplomats or our new commercial partners insist -- even if they publicly manifest their best wishes for our country -- in their belief that their position as world power gives them the authority to exert an irritating political tutelage over Mexico and its inhabitants.
