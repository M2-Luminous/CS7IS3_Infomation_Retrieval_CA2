Official Algerian sources had spoken of 900 prisoners escaping in Thursday's break-out from the Tazoult jail, located 400 kilometres (240 miles) southeast of Algiers, near Batna. The prisoners escaped when a force of Islamic guerrillas stormed the jail at dusk just as the evening meal was being served. According to the Front spokesman, all those who escaped were "political prisoners of the FIS rank-and-file". Four hundred were serving life sentences and 350 had been condemned to death by special courts, he said. Other sources had earlier indicated that the escapees included some common criminals. In Algiers, security forces said Monday they had killed 24 and recaptured 79 of the prisoners. The hunt for the others was continuing and "a large amount of arms" had been found, they said. According to the FIS spokesman, the authorities responded to the break-out by launching air-attacks using napalm in the western Aures region, to which the prisoners fled before "fanning out all over the country". In Thursday's guerrilla attack against the Tazoult jail, one warder was killed, four were wounded and seven abducted, according to official Algerian sources. Two prison employees were accomplices, the Interior Ministry said. The spokesman for the FIS abroad also said that at least 61 members of the security forces had died in clashes with armed Islamic groups between February 28 and March 5, mainly in the Algiers region. An earlier toll spoke of 187 killed in the period February 13-28. The FIS said 105 soldiers had been killed at the beginning of February in an ambush at Sidi Bel-Abes, south of Oran. Moslem fundamentalists launched an armed insurgency against the Algerian authorities two years ago, after the cancellation of general elections which the fundamentalist FIS had been poised to win. The Interior Ministry announced Monday that an overnight curfew imposed more than a year ago but eased during the Ramadan period would return to normal hours from Tuesday and run from midnight (2300 GMT) to 4:00 a.m. (0300 GMT). During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day, only taking their first meal at nightfall, which is thus a moment of relaxation. That was the moment the assailants stormed the prison, FIS sources said.
