FR940617-2-00172 FR940617-2-00096 [Release No. 34&hyph;34193; File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;08] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change Modifying NSCC's Correction Fees June 10, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 1 notice is hereby given that on June 1, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;08) as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by primarily NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. section 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change modifies NSCC's fee structure as it relates to correction fees for the processing of municipal securities transactions. The text of the rule change is set forth at Exhibit A. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the rule change is to modify NSCC's fee structure as it relates to correction fees for the processing of municipal securities transactions to reflect the fact that correction capabilities have been accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. In August of 1993, NSCC accelerated the comparison processing for municipal securities transactions to the date after trade date (``T+1''). Previously NSCC had charged participants for supplemental input on or after T+2. Because correction processing can now be initiated on T+1, the NSCC fee structure is being modified in order to charge participants for supplemental input on or after T+1. Although the acceleration of municipal bond comparison occurred in August of 1993, this fee change will be effective for supplemental comparison processing as of June 1, 1994. The proposed rule change provides for the equitable allocation of dues, fees, and charges among participants. Therefore, NSCC believes that it is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition NSCC believes that the proposed rule changes will not have any impact or impose a burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others NSCC has neither solicited nor received any written comments. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act 2 and subparagraph (e)(2) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder because it establishes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by NSCC. 3 At any time within sixty days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 2 15 U.S.C. section 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii) (1988). 3 17 CFR ยง240.19b&hyph;4(e)(4) (1993).

Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
