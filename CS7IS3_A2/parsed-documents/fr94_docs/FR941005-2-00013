FR941005-2-00013 FR941005-2-00010 [C&hyph;333&hyph;402] Certain Apparel from Peru; Notice of Proposed Amended Conversion AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce ACTION: Certain Apparel from Peru: Notice of Proposed Amendment to the Existing Conversion of the Scope of the Order from the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. SUMMARY: On January 1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the international harmonized system of tariff classification. On January 11, 1989, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the Conversion to Use of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of Classifications for Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings (54 FR 993; January 11, 1989) (1989 Conversion) for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress as of January 1, 1989. The Department now proposes to amend the 1989 Conversion governing the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Peru. Interested parties are invited to comment on this proposed amended conversion. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martina Tkadlec or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230, telephone (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In 1985, the Department issued a countervailing duty order on Certain Apparel from Peru (C&hyph;333&hyph;402) (50 FR 9871; March 12, 1985). The scope of this order was originally defined solely in terms of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 1, 1989, the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Section 1211 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directed the Department to ``take whatever actions are necessary to conform, to the fullest extent practicable, with the tariff classification system of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule [for] all *␣*␣* orders *␣*␣*'' in effect at the time of the implementation of the HTS. Accordingly, on January 11, 1989, after reviewing comments received from the public, the Department published the 1989 Conversion for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress as of January 1, 1989 (54 FR 993). The notice also included the conversion of the scope of the referenced apparel order from TSUSA to HTS item numbers. The 1989 Conversion was based on a one-to-one correspondence of the TSUSA and HTS item numbers. In the notice, the Department stated that the conversion could be amended, as warranted, at any time during the applicable proceeding as a result of the submission of comments or new factual information. As a result of comments submitted to the Department by the importing public and advice received from the U.S. Customs Service, the Department determined that the 1989 Conversion did not accurately reflect the scope of the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Peru and, therefore, that the conversion should be amended. To rectify the problems in the 1989 Conversion, the Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. International Trade Commission, has once again compared the TSUSA-defined scope and the HTS-defined scope provided by the 1989 Conversion, and identified those HTS numbers that more reasonably correspond with the TSUSA-defined scope of the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Peru. A new proposed amended conversion is found in the attached appendix. Request for Public Comments We invite interested parties to submit comments on the proposed amended conversion within 30 days of the publication of this notice. All comments must be in writing (10 copies), addressed to the attention of the Director, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, IA Central Record Unit, Room B&hyph;099, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
