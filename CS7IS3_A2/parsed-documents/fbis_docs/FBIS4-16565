Answering questions from the ITAR-TASS correspondent on the eve of the visit, the Russian deputy prime minister praised the present state of bilateral cooperation in the military field, a new impetus to which was, in his words, given by a visit to Russia in March by [Lieutenant General] Dao Dinh Luyen, chief of the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army. Yarov noted that the visit to Cam Ranh Bay was purely fact-finding. At the same time, he said that the visit could result in new proposals on joint mutually beneficial use of the installation, even though the problem had not been discussed in the course of the present visit to Vietnam. The materials and machinery supplies station at Cam Ranh peninsula is at present used by Russia on the basis of the agreement signed by the former USSR and Vietnam in 1981. It expires in 2004. The numbers of the Russian staff servicing the installation have been reduced by about three-quarters compared with 1980, while cooperation with the Vietnamese side has been transferred to a commercial basis.
