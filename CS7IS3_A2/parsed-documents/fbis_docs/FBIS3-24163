But the belated correction of the mistake was unable to improve the situation in power engineering. Moreover, in February practically all of Ukraine's AES's [nuclear electric power plant] experienced a shortage of nuclear fuel. The Zaporozhye AES had to "unload," that is to say lower, the output of two units so that they could work through this year. The same thing is happening at the Chernobyl and South Ukraine plants. Russia must be paid almost 50 billion rubles for nuclear fuel elements. And no one knows how much the scarce equipment for the units that have been brought back up at the Rivno and Khmelnitskiy AES's costs now. Generally the problems here are purely economic ones, but some deputies have not ceased their attempts to blame Yeltsin and his government for our troubles. Such a stand can only aggravate the crisis. For our main enemy is ourselves. The populism, unprofessionalism, and indifference of the parliamentarians and government bureaucrats costs taxpayers too much. It is not impossible that on the threshold of the elections, some candidates for deputy will again try to play the nuclear card. Voters should know what all this hysteria and incompetence can cost all of us if this history repeats itself. The Reverse Side of the Moratorium The antinuclear euphoria on the shores of the Dnepr reached a peak in the summer of 1990. The republic was declared a hostage of the atomic department of the former Union. The Communist Party of Ukraine and communist deputies in parliament supported the idea of a moratorium. Hotheads who were superficially familiar with the problem and did not inconvenience themselves with proof assured the people very emotionally that Ukraine would get along without AES's, that if all the plants were closed no one would notice. And the fact that 14 energy units with a total capacity of 12.8 million kilowatts are in operation at the 5 Ukrainian AES's and that in 1990 they provided about one-third of all the electricity produced in the republic was not taken into account. Today atomic power plants bear 40 percent of the load. Certain scientists and the minister of energy at that time, Vitaliy Sklyarov, threw oil on the fire by trying to convince everyone that Ukraine should build gas turbine-powered heat plants rather than nuclear energy units. But what do you burn at such plants? Ukraine satisfies 24 percent of its gas needs and 8 percent of its oil needs through its own production. And there are depressing forecasts that this situation will get worse. But we can be supplied with uranium for centuries. These and other facts were published in the press at the time and rang out from the rostrum of the Supreme Soviet, but the opinion of the specialists was not heeded. World experience was also ignored. After all, France, with which people love to compare Ukraine, produces 75 percent of its electricity at AES's and, strange as it may seem, the French do not consider themselves hostages of the nuclear monster. Ukraine passed its peak of electricity production in 1988 (297.2 billion kilowatt hours). Since that time we have only been lowering its production. There are two reasons for that: first, half of the equipment of the heat plants have depleted their service lives and need to be replaced. Secondly, the extraction of energy media dropped both in Russia and in Ukraine, but the prices for them increased. So last year the republic was short 50 billion kilowatt hours as compared with 1988. But while the TES's [thermal electric power plants] reduce production, AES's increase it every year. If not for the nuclear units, back in the winter of 1991 Ukraine would have had to introduce a scheduled energy delivery. The symptoms of the disaster which has now begun were more than obvious back at the time the decision on the moratorium was adopted. It was also obvious that Ukraine could not do without atomic energy--only uranium could really alleviate the shortage of organic fuel. But even so the construction of AES's was terminated. You Have To Pay for Everything I am certain that the decision on the moratorium was adopted without a serious economic expert study. If the deputies had known the facts and figures cited below, everything would not have happened so readily and smoothly. So, in 1990 three million-watt units with VVER-1000 [water-moderated water-cooled] reactors which were not inferior to similar Western ones in terms of safety were under construction at the Zaporozhye, Rivno, and Khmelnitskiy AES's. The cost of each one was a billion dollars. With international prices for electricity at 6-7 cents per kilowatt hour, one year of moratorium costs the country 500 million dollars. It is easy to figure the direct losses, but the republic's actual losses are much greater. By putting up a barrier in the path of AES's, the Supreme Soviet automatically terminated the development of high technologies in Ukraine. For an atomic energy unit is the result of the activity of dozens of scientific and production collectives. The latest achievements of science and technology are applied in designing and building it. In one moment they became useless. The construction workers were the first to begin to disperse. Then it was the turn of the operating personnel of the AES's themselves. Highly qualified specialists, most of them young, immediately understood that the moratorium would put an end to their careers in Ukraine. No new units, no growth. And the wages? In Russia a control operator earns 300 dollars a month converted into hard currency, but at the Zaporozhye AES it is one-tenth that. A moratorium was imposed in our country, but Russia began to launch its own nuclear energy program. Recruiters began to work at Energodar and other AES's of Ukraine. They not only offered the needed people a decent wage but even apartments. The professionals whose training takes from 3 to 5 years began to pack their suitcases. And not just one or two but by brigades and shifts. Last year alone 325 people left the Zaporozhye GRES [state regional electric power plant], and about 400 left the atomic power plant! Recently the director of the Zaporozhye AES, Vladimir Bronnikov, announced that if the exodus of specialists is not stopped, there will be simply no one to run Unit No 6. And will other units become safer if novices sit at the control panel? The overall collapse of industry has also had an effect on the safety of atomic power plants. The moratorium forced plants producing equipment for AES's to seek other orders, do simpler things. The quality control system was destroyed and specialists left. As a result many enterprises can no longer supply equipment which meets the demands of atomic power engineering. Ukraine is declining as a high technology country. So the goals declared by the advocates of the moratorium were not achieved. Just the opposite. AES safety declined and electricity production dropped. In the frozen units not only was an enormous amount of capital and past labor paralyzed, but every day they required considerable expenditures to maintain and guard them. Ukraine's sick economy had a shortfall of billions of dollars. All these streamlets of wastefulness and irresponsibility made up the river of present-day inflation and economic collapse. Courage Is the Lot of the Wise The fact that the moratorium accomplished nothing but harm was already clear in the fall of 1991. Even Zaporozhye Oblast, which has three very large power plants, Dneproges [Dnepr Hydroelectric Power Plant], a GRES, and an AES, with a total capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts, had an energy shortage at that time. Two of 18 ovens were in operation at Dneprospetsstal [Dnepr Special Steel] and the aluminum combine ceased production of silicon and thereby shut down dozens of enterprises of Ukraine's electrical and radio engineering industry. Let me remind you that this was 1991. In 1992 the situation got even more complicated. The appeals, verbal and written, of the directors of the industrial enterprises and power stations to the state's leaders did not yield results. The parliament, with stubbornness that should have been put to better use, stood its own. True, some of the deputies understood the mistake, but most did not have enough courage to acknowledge it from the rostrum. But in the lobbies people suggested to the directors of AES's that they appeal to the government. Let it by its decree (since it had the authority) rescind our decision. This shameful haggling continued for a year! And only when the economy, and she is a stern mistress in all respects, finally turned her back on us did the people's chosen ones deign to do anything. What Is Ahead! The moratorium was rescinded, but the problems it created were not. The collective of the Zaporozhye AES is preparing to launch Unit No 6. In fact this will be done in the coming months. As for the reactors at the Rivno and Khmelnitskiy power plants, there are more questions than answers. In actuality, by 1990 the basic construction work in Energodar was complete. The Zaporozhye workers provided No 6 with all the equipment, and despite the moratorium completed installation at their own risk and prevented the unit from collapsing for 3 years. People simply did not want to sink a billion dollars into the sand, and, it is true, no one even said thanks for this. Construction was not completed on the units at the Rivno and Khmelnitskiy AES's and all the equipment was not supplied. Now it will have to be collected in all the countries of the near abroad or production will have to be set up in Ukraine. It is frightening to even speak of how much this is going to cost. Specialists estimate that with strong state support, the units could provide current in 1995-1996. But there can be no talk of any support while the Ministry of Power Engineering owes the Zaporozhye AES alone more than 30 billion karbovantsy for energy already produced. Where can money be gotten when Ukraine owes everyone? So the future of these units is very hazy and uncertain. The future of Ukraine's power engineering system is just as hazy. The point is that even now the independent state does not have a scientifically substantiated program of actions reinforced with real resources for the sector as a whole or for atomic energy in particular. And meanwhile Ukraine's power engineering system continues to fall into the abyss. Because of the shortage of fuel, the output of the Zaporozhye GRES, the largest in Europe, has dropped to two-thirds its former level. The situation in the other heat plants is no better either. In turn, because of the shortage of electricity, many industrial enterprises have sharply reduced production, or even stopped it, and in some cities of the republic electricity is supplied to the population by schedule. Is this really the kind of life we want?
