Jarcevic said that the deposits were being made on Mt Papuk in an area 35 times 50 kilometers, that is now ethnically cleansed from Serbs, in four locations identified so far: Straza, Tucak, Bilo and Lom. The RSK was formed in 1991 in parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia populated by Serbs in response to the Croatian forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and has been a U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) since March 1992. The RSK Foreign Ministry has conveyed this information to the co-chairmen of the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and U.N. member countries that have their troops within the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], Jarcevic said adding that they had not shown any particular interest. Jarcevic said that the nuclear waste and the poisonous chemicals originate from Germany and are transported through Austria and Hungary. According to further information Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic has also promised his patrons and the initiators of the new world order locations for depositing their nuclear waste and toxic chemicals on Serb territory stretching from Kupres to Drvar. It is also reported in Knin that Greece fears that similar engagements were undertaken by the president of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov and information about Germany's deposit of its toxic waste in Albania near the border with the F.R. of Yugoslavia has already been partly revealed.
