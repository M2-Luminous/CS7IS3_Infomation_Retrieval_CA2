"The issue was never officially raised," said one ministry official, reacting to remarks attributed to Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of State, who said Washington wants to see democracy take firm root in South Korea and the National Security Law repealed. The remarks drew a sensitive reaction because Hubbard is the top U.S. working-level representative at nuclear talks with North Korea. South Korea's National Security Law prohibits any unauthorized contact with North Korea. "We don't believe that Hubbard's statement reflects the formal U.S. position, but we are looking into what the exact quotes were," said the ministry official.
