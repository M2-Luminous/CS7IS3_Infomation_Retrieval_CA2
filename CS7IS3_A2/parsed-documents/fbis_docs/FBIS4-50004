"It is imperative that we not let politics for one day delay the passage of this crime bill," Clinton said. "We can drive the crime rate down and make our people safe." Announcing a 74-million-dollar federal grant to help local government pay for hiring 1,001 more police officers, he said the adoption of the crime bill will redeem his campaign pledge to put 100,000 additional police officers on American streets in its entirety. The House and Senate have passed their own versions of the crime bill. The difference between the two versions will have to be reconciled by a conference committee. In 1993, there were about 24,500 were murders, 12.1 million property crimes in the United States. The federal grant and two previously announced awards, with a total of 150 million dollars, will go to 250 police departments across the country and help pay for the hiring or rehiring of 2,023 police officers.
