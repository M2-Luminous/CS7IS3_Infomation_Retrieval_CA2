It tops the list when it comes to environmental quality, and its forest coverage rate is 46 percent, also one of the highest rates in China, according to an appraisal of environmental quality made by the ecologic research institute of the Chinese academy of sciences. In recent years, with the development of township enterprises, environment pollution has increased accordingly, and the provincial government has formulated regulations to deal with the problem, according to a recent forum to mark world environment day sponsored by the provincial environment protection bureau. For example, while promoting silkworm breeding and fruit production, the provincial government decreed regulations concerning fluorine pollution. In addition, to ensure the purity of the water used in making the famous local Shaoxing rice wine the provincial legislature enacted a set of regulations to protect Jianhu Lake. The local government has also emphasized controlling the pollution caused by township enterprises engaged in printing, dyeing, tanning, chemical engineering and papermaking. The province has set up various kinds of nature reserves and scenic resort areas to protect rare animals and plants, natural scenery, water, and cultural relics.
