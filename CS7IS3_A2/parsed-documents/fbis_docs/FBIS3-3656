The region, including Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, Guangxi Zhuang and Tibet Autonomous Regions, and the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing, established an economic coordination committee 10 years ago. The seven partners aimed to build a mutual market in the area and open to the markets in Southeast and South Asia. They removed barriers from among the provinces and opened their markets to each other. In the past decade, they held more than 100 commodity fairs and trade talks, which succeeded with a total business volume of 40 billion yuan. More than 30 banks in this area have also joined hands to support the economic development. In the past six years, they poured loans of more than 60 billion yuan into local enterprises. With an 8,800-km border, the southwest China economic coordination zone has established more than ten border economic development areas and opened more than 40 border trade ports. Thus the export volume in this area has increased quickly in recent years. The total foreign trade volume last year reached five billion U.S. dollars and its border trade volume amounted to five billion yuan. These provinces and regions also organized several investment promotion fairs in southeast and south Asia and introduced billions of dollars in overseas investment. They organized economic activities in accordance with market needs. Since they established the economic coordination zone 10 years ago, they have signed more than 11,000 economic cooperation projects among which more than 6,000 have been put into operation. They jointly invested over 200 million yuan to build 49 trans-provincial roads, which have now extended to a total of more than 20,000 km. Some railways, post and telecommunications projects and satellite communication stations are now under construction. A fund of more than 1.3 billion yuan has been collected to build power plants and chemical fertilizer factories in the area. At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the total industrial and agricultural production value per capita in this area was 320 yuan lower than that in other areas although the region covers a total area of over 2.5 million sq km and is inhabited by 225 million people. By 1993, the total industrial and agricultural production value tripled that of 10 years ago. A few days ago, the seven partners held a liaison meeting in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, and inaugurated a publicity organizing committee, which will focus on promoting the image of southwest China.
