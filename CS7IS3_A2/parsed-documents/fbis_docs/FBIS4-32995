According to Commission workers, the proposal gives absolute and total power to the Panama Canal Board of Directors by giving the Board authority to determine which federal standards will remain in effect for the Canal Commission during the transition period. According to Commission workers, the proposal presented by the Panama Canal Board of Directors, based on a study and recommendations by the firm Arthur Anderson, "will create uncertainty and nervousness." The workers are afraid they will lose the rights they have attained with so much effort and sacrifice. In a communique sent to the workers, the Coalition has alerted international organizations in the United States to ensure their participation in the congressional debates.
