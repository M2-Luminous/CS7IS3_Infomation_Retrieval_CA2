A number of people were injured in the blast at the base at Crossmaglen, South Armagh, at around 12.20 am. No further details about the casualties were immediately available, the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] said. Yesterday evening a mortar bomb exploded at the base. No-one was injured in that attack, but the area around the heavily-fortified post was sealed off while Army bomb experts carried out a search. The base was not evacuated. Later an RUC spokesman said the blast came as military personnel were attempting to recover the vehicle used in the earlier mortar bomb attack. The explosion happened inside the base. It is believed two soldiers were injured in the attack, but the extent of their injuries is not yet known.
