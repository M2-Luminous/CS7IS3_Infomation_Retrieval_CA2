In his words, Russia considers nuclear arms as a means of deterrence and not combat operations. The Russian Federation was not the first to confirm the Soviet obligation of non-use of nuclear arms, but this does not mean a transition to the concept of preventive uses of nuclear arms. It shows the Russian determination to prevent a large-scale war against the Russian Federation and its allies. The minister refuted claims that russia can be the first to use nuclear arms even in a limited conflict. The minister said that the Russian Federation is striving to cut the nuclear force to minimum that would guarantee strategic stability, and fully eliminate these arms in future. "The political fundamentals of the Russian military doctrine reflect two interrelated tasks -- prevention of a war and readiness to repulse an aggressor," said the minister. In his words, Russia rejects any war, the use of military force or a threat of its use as a means to achieve political, economic or other goals. It stands for the obligation of all states not to be the first to use military force. All disputable issues must be settled only with political and diplomatic means, stressed the Russian minister. "Russia proceeds from the fact that a possibility of local and regional wars, as well as armed conflicts in specific states because of nationalistic, ethnic, territorial, religious and other contradictions remains," said the Russian minister. In his opinion, the increase of aggressive nationalism in various areas of the world is the most dangerous challenge to regional and international stability. The Russian Federation plans active interaction with the commonwealth states in collective defence and security, coordination of military policy and defence building. This area of cooperation is a priority of Russia, he said. The Russian military doctrine confirms a possibility of Russian participation in peace-making operations held on decision of the United Nations Security Council. Russian security may also require the location of troops and technical means outside the Russian Federation. Russia considers all states, whose policy does not affect its interests and does not run counter to the U.N. charter, its partners in provision of peace and consolidation of international security.
