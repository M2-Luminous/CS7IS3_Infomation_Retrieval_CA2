For this purpose, I held long, arduous conversations with the Banco Central de Venezuela Board of Directors. For respectable reasons, Banco Central had expressed at many meetings the necessity of finding other paths and formulas, none of which, unfortunately, yielded the expected results. I said in my inaugural speech on 2 February that there would be no exchange controls. I said it with absolute sincerity. That was my intention, and I have held it up until today. The truth is, however, that we have been forced to take this measure by the seriousness of the financial situation, the insistent wave of rumors, the speculative movements that have tried to topple the bolivar to the floor. We are well aware of the disadvantages, problems, and dangers, but they are unavoidable. We cannot allow international reserves to be depleted. We cannot allow the unjustified devaluation of our currency to continue. When I say it is unjustified, that is because Venezuela produces the necessary foreign exchange for its legal commercial exchange. The pressures on the exchange market are due to speculative movements or to the distrust created by a series of rumors. Such rumors have confused Venezuelans about the measures we had to adopt to intervene at eight financial institutions, which we tried to save by every means possible. In the end, however, we concluded it was virtually impossible to save them. To establish the exchange control, of course in keeping with the Banco Central Board of Directors, another series of indispensable measures had to be taken. One of them is the suspension of constitutional guarantees. We have had to resort to this extreme so my government will have the adequate means to fully achieve its objective. We have made this decision with total responsibility. We will implement it prudently as we have acted throughout the five months of my government. At the same time, however, we will implement it with the force necessary to save the country from the crisis in which it is immersed. We did not created this crisis. The crisis is the result of a long period of corruption and serious mistakes in the country's past. We have used all regular means to confront the crisis. We have reached a point now when we feel we must take the extraordinary measures afforded us by the Constitution and laws without delay. The Development Ministry will be in charge of placing price controls on basic articles by applying a consumer protection law. It is crucial that we achieve this because the wave of speculation, under the pretense of the foreign exchange hike, has been so disproportionate that it is totally unjustifiable. I say it is a pretense because, although inflation can be blamed on the decline of our currency, the price increase has been several times greater than the highest inflation rate observed. Thus the struggle against speculation is in the government's hands. We feel our people's deep pain, especially in the lower and middle classes, for the unbridled scarcity in the country. We are going to fight beside the people so we can, in some way, correct this tremendous mistake. We will adopt several complementary measures at the cabinet meeting to be held the day after tomorrow. Among the measures to be taken is the issuance of food and transportation bonuses. These actions seek to improve the true income of the sectors that have been most negatively affected by the current crisis. Furthermore, in addition to implementing foreign exchange and price controls, we will adopt measures to control the financial institutions. We are willing to stringently apply all necessary norms to see that banking institutions act correctly and that a crisis of this nature does not happen again. The government has done and is willing to do all it can to protect the small account holders who have trusted in the seriousness and responsibility of financial institutions and who are overwrought because they don't know what will become of their small savings. The small account holders can rest assured that the commitments established by law and maintained by the government will be upheld and increased by the measure necessary to grant them the justice they are owed. The measures we have adopted are not isolated acts. They are part of our social and economic policies. The social policy is based primarily on the price controls, food and transportation bonuses, which I mentioned previously, and the struggle to improve real wages. It is also based on a number of initiatives, programs, and plans that will be announced to the people very soon because they are already being implemented. We want to get the consumer as close as possible to the producer by offering better ways to obtain the necessary basic products in the marketplace. We also want to protect and defend the activities that generate jobs, such as small and intermediate industries. These sectors are going through a very difficult situation. The same goes for the agricultural producers who have experienced a very serious crisis in the past years, perhaps even more serious than the one in the urban areas. In this respect, I must say that the foreign exchange control puts us on a promising path. Now we can start thinking about implementing a plan to decrease interest rates, which have reached levels that are absolutely incompatible with the possibilities of the productive sectors, and to eliminate the zero coupon bonds. We have opposed this mechanism in the past because, although it attempts to alleviate the country's situation, it has triggered rather serious results. On the other hand, all of this is within the context of an overall economic policy. Venezuela is a good country for investment. Investors come to the country every day, and we are willing to offer them every guarantee. For some -- because some people criticize everything -- the policy could seem to present an obstacle to investors. On the contrary, investors need a stable currency. Investors need assurances that the country's foreign reserves will not be depleted. Investors need a system they can trust, and it is precisely that trust which we want to give investors and everyone in the country. We are willing to promote investment and open paths for investment in the areas of oil, petrochemicals, mining, and all other areas that are open to projects through concession. It has taken us some time to prepare the first plans for bidding, but the time is near when we will offer those who are interested the opportunity to invest in the Romulo Betancourt Eastern Freeway. I have a great deal of trust in my country and I am sincere when I speak to my people. I know that we are taking harsh measures and that there are dangers we must avoid. One danger posed by exchange controls is that they could be invaded by corruption. We will keep an eye on that. We are going to choose very honorable, patriotic persons who are determined to serve Venezuela to supervise this matter. It is essential that we work together. Today I was pleased to meet with representatives of the media. It was a cordial meeting with reporters from various media. I met with those who write the news, those who report the news on television and radio, and those who inform us with their photographs, the photographers. I told them that Venezuela is proud of its media, and we hope the media will be proud of Venezuela. We do not want the media to report only what is wrong. We do not want the media to enhance the negative aspects. We want the media to cover positive facts, to contribute to the advancement of our country, and to encourage our people to be proud of being children of this glorious country. I addressed the representatives of the media with great affection, as I address my fellow countrymen now. Dear Venezuelans, dear fellow countrymen, dear friends; let us work together to overcome this crisis. You know this crisis was not created by this government. If there is one thing you can say about this government -- and as I said during my inaugural speech -- we will do all we can to face the situation. The time has come to use our extraordinary resources, but within the framework of our Constitution and the democratic institution. In order to maintain this democratic institution, we must adopt measures that may be harsh and rigorous. These measures, however, are honestly and diligently aimed at guaranteeing the welfare of the country, Venezuela's welfare. For the good of Venezuela, I reiterate my trust and absolute assurance that we will have the understanding and support of the Venezuelan people, who are confronting these times so full of uncertainty and contradiction. We will overcome these problems to ensure a good future for our beloved country, Venezuela.
