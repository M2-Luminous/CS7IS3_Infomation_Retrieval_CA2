Clinton and Hosokawa met for three hours Friday at the White House in a formal summit for discussions focusing on economic issues, including the tax cuts for fiscal 1994 beginning April 1. The sources told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that Clinton expressed concern that the tax cuts might help boost savings by Japanese, instead of increasing consumer spending as intended. They said Clinton indicated that the one-year tax cuts were not enough. The 20 percent income and residential tax cuts, totaling 5.47 trillion yen, were included in Japan's latest pump-priming package announced Tuesday, totaling a record 15.25 billion yen.
