Laar told a press conference, on Monday, that his meeting with Perry was extremely efficient in discussion of situation of Estonian defence forces, borderguard and the Baltic peacekeeping battalion to be formed. He pointed to Perry's statement that the U.S. will not let anyone "dictate in what amount and with whom it will develop security policy cooperation". He added that U.S. concern about Estonian-Russian interstate negotiations was illustrated by the fact that Perry expressed clear support to unconditional Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by August 31, 1994. Laar said that during his meetings in the U.S., he discussed possible arms deals but no concrete plans to buy arms have been made yet. He said that we had to better define our defence forces conception to decide what kind of arms Estonia needed. He added that arms aid programmes will be discussed more closely at the forthcoming visit of a NATO delegation. As to his meeting with UN Secretary General, Laar said that Butrus Butrus- Ghali adopted a very strong position as to Russian troop withdrawal. "If it is clear in May that Russian troops do not move and no preparations to troop withdrawal take place, Ghali asked to turn to UN to apply mechanisms that are in UN disposal," Laar said.
