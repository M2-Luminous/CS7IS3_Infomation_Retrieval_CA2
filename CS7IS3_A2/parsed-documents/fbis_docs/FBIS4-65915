Even before the ministers met with Grachev in the evening, the ministers' talks mainly concentrated on further developments of the alliance's relations with Russia. Balanzino, the NATO deputy secretary general, chaired the meeting, as Secretary General [Manfred] Woerner had followed his doctor's advice not to participate. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe spoke out clearly in favor of offering Russia a "partnership without adjectives" such as "strategic," "pragmatic," "cooperative," or "privileged." As Russia cannot become a member of NATO, the alliance must offer it a comprehensive partnership within and outside the Partnership for Peace that corresponds with its importance. After the first round of talks in Brussels on Tuesday, Ruehe reported that he agrees with U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry that the alliance should enter into a general foreign and security policy dialogue with Russia. The nuclear issues and proliferation of nuclear weapons should not be discussed by the United States and Russia alone in the future, but by Russia and NATO as a whole. On relations between NATO and Russia, however, Ruehe said it is out of the question to grant Russia a de facto right to veto alliance resolutions, to allow Moscow to impede NATO's capacity to act, or to subordinate the alliance to the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). "Cooperative relations of partnership within and outside of Partnership for Peace are the key to security and stability in Europe," Ruehe said. Russia must be treated as a great power and a partner, but it must gain its neighbors' confidence by itself, whether they be "distant" or "near" neighbors. This requires acknowledging their sovereignty and the inviolability of their borders. It is NATO's task to give Russia as much help as it can in a difficult situation. But the Atlantic alliance must watch out for false partners. Ruehe recommended that it should be made clear to Russia that its participation in the Partnership for Peace is important. Moscow should sign the framework agreement without additional conditions or changes. This includes the willingness to aim at a comprehensive cooperation between NATO troops and the Russian Armed Forces. The practical part of the Partnership for Peace is to focus on promoting military cooperation. Even if it is given the same status as the other partners, Russia has the possibility to acquire a position that corresponds with its size, importance, and potential. Outside the Partnership for Peace, relations should focus on the dialogue on political and strategic issues. In this connection it is important that the dialogue between NATO and Russia is transparent. If this is safeguarded, it will be possible to convince the partners in Central and East Europe of the importance of cooperating with Russia. [passage omitted]
