Although apparently contradictory, it is necessary to go slow but as fast as circumstances permit, Rodriguez said during a government meeting in Pinar del Rio Province, according to a National News Agency [AIN] press dispatch. A fiscal deficit of 4.2 billion pesos -- the peso is on a par with the U.S. dollar -- and circulating cash in excess of 10 billion pesos are some of the most important obstacles to a revival of the local economy. Most of the budget deficit is comprised of subsidies. Agriculture, and the sugar industry alone, constituted more than 7 billion pesos in subsidies in the past three years. Rodriguez said that subsidies to cover losses in managerial activities constitute one of the country's most serious problems. In this regard, he underlined the importance of increasing revenue, revising prices, and making other decisions that might help the situation, according to AIN. The Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] last week began a process of consultations between deputies and the rank and file regarding measures to solve the financial situation. In the early meetings, the CTC members favored reducing subsidies for some products and state services and charging for services formerly given for free. In some plants, the workers even proposed creating a "bonus for the homeland" at very low or no interest. Rodriguez has not yet mentioned any specific measures. He said that a number of urgent situations must be corrected but in an orderly manner and after talking with the people. He said that such decisions are necessary, require the people's support, and entail a certain degree of sacrifice. The National Assembly of the People's Government, which debated the matter for the first time in late December, plans to hold a special session to discuss financial reorganization. Ricardo Alarcon, president of the parliament, said on Sunday that the debate will be held as soon as possible, although the date has not yet been determined.
