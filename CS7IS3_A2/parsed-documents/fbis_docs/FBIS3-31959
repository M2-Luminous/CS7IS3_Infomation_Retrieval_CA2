The demonstrators, mostly students from the Central University of Ecuador and some from certain secondary schools, were repelled with tear gas and a water cannon known as Trucutu. Security measures were tightened at the Government Palace. Nearby roads were blocked with Army armored vehicles. The students are throwing rocks and making obscene gestures at the policemen, and they are shouting slogans against the government and the IMF. We do not want more increases, and we say no to gasoline price increases were among the slogans shouted as the demonstrators threw rocks and other hard objects at the public forces. As we reported earlier, the government will announce fuel price increases to cover the large fiscal deficit, which is growing by the day given a drop in revenues due to lower petroleum prices. Petroleum is Ecuador's main revenue source. The police were forced to close the access roads near the university in downtown Quito as well as other streets in the southern part of Quito. This has created a huge traffic jam. There are long lines at gas stations. It is not yet known whether there are disturbances in Guayaquil, the second most important city in our country. Radio reports state that more public demonstrations against gasoline price increases are expected next week as secondary school students join the demonstrations.
