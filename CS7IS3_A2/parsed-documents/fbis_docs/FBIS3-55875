He also said that the information about consultations in the parliamentary factions suggests that the work of the new parliament, above all the State Duma, would not be easy. "Confrontational moods may triumph," he said. He noted, however, that the new Constitution gave the president enough powers to prevent revenging forces in the parliament from fully expressing themselves. Kostikov told Interfax that the president's attitude to both chambers was positive. "Yeltsin is the president of all Russian citizens and respects the choice of the nation, however contradictory it might be," he said.
