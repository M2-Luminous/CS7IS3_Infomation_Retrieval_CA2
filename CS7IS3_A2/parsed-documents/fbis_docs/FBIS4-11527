Gabriel Taboada, a drug trafficker sentenced to 12 years in prison in the United States, testified that drug cartels in Colombia have "infiltrated all levels of the government, from the Presidency on down." Taboada said only one of the candidates participating in the current electoral campaign is not corrupt. Ambassador Silva said: "This convict's accusations are inadmissible and an insult to the families of thousands of brave Colombians who have lost their lives in this war against drugs. The mere use of this so-called witness, a man who has been in a U.S. prison for the past five years, is a clear shift from the Congress' process of surveillance and one that will hinder our capacity to understand the truth of the war against drugs. "Apparently, the only first-hand knowledge this drug trafficker has dates back to the mid-eighties, and yet he is allowed to contest the integrity of a country that is recognized the world over as a leader in the struggle against drugs. Today, as on any other day, thousands of Colombian Government officials, judges, journalists, candidates, policemen, and soldiers are risking their lives. But this witness was encouraged to make false statements that question the integrity of our people and our political system," Ambassador Silva said. "Colombia, the oldest democracy in Latin America, will neither remain indifferent nor allow these absurd accusations to go unanswered. Senator Kerry knew very well that these hearings were being held during our presidential campaign. During previous elections, three presidential candidates were assassinated. One of them, Luis Carlos Galan, was assassinated by hired assassins of Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, precisely because Galan had the courage to publicly confront narcoterrorism. Authorizing a groundless deposition such as this during a critical election is not only irresponsible interference in the Colombian electoral process; it will also serve to erode the strong cooperation between the United States and Colombia essential to dismantling the drug cartels." "There is undoubtedly corruption in Colombia, just as there is in the United States. We are struggling against the most powerful and merciless criminal organization in history. The achievements of President Cesar Gaviria's government in the struggle against corruption have no parallel. The forces of order and the judicial system have been completely reorganized in an attempt to fight corruption. The investigations of officials charged with corruption have been firm and yielded good results." "One asks how Senator Kerry would react if the Colombian Congress were to conduct hearings on the big scandal this week in Massachusetts, where the mayor of Middlesex County has been charged with doing favors for and giving special treatment to important Mafia personalities in the area? Can you imagine the indignation of the people of Massachusetts if this scandal led to charges that the state government, from the governor on down, is corrupt? [no closing quotation mark as published] The ambassador added: "Senator Kerry can be satisfied after these hearings because his so-called witness repeated some of the groundless accusations the senator made against Colombia in his recent article in THE WASHINGTON POST. This is a small personal victory compared to the huge damage this mistaken use of surveillance will do to the real war being waged in my country." "A week ago Senator Kerry told Colombian reporters: `I believe the Colombian people have fought with extraordinary courage. There is no doubt in my mind about President Gaviria's and his government's courage and efforts. Many people are fighting without respite.' If we are to believe the senator, how could he allow Colombia's image to be so wronged through this distorted process? [no closing quotation mark as published]
