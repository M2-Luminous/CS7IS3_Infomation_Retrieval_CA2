Pangalos added that the memorandum with Greece's legal arguments will be submitted to the commission when it is completed. Referring to the possibility of legal proceedings against Greece, the European Commission press spokesman clarified that the Communal Treaty allows this procedure to be speeded up and did not rule out that the court may ask for a temporary lifting of the Greek measures. Asked by Greek correspondents, Greek European Union [EU] Commissioner Ioannis Palaiokrasas said the procedure of an appeal against Greece may be avoided. He said: It is not right to end up with such developments. Answering another question, Palaiokrasas said the commission has procedures for court appeals that are not time consuming. Van Den Broek's spokesman today told reporters that Skopje accused Greece of closing its borders even to humanitarian aid. [passage omitted]
