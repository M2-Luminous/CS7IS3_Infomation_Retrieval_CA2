The Union Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, today declined to plead guilty to the points raised by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probing the securities scandal with regard to his personal role as the Finance Minister or that of the Ministry of Finance. In his reply to the special debate in the Lok Sabha, Dr. Singh made it clear that he was addressing the House in his capacity as the Finance Minister and went ahead to accept full constitutional responsibility for the actions and the area of responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. Stating that he would not take shelter behind Constitutional niceties, he listed out the five points on which the JPC has criticised the Finance Minister or the Ministry in general -- failure to anticipate the problem; failure to respond purposefully to the problem; failure to manage the consequence of the scam; failure to apply immediate corrective measures and failure to punish the guilty. Prompt steps taken: Confessing that it was a "matter of deep personal regret that the irregularities in the misuse of funds got accentuated in the first nine months" of his Ministership, Dr. Singh responded to the first point that as early as July 24, 1991 he had referred to the grave weakness in the banking and financial system of the country during the course of his first Budget presentation. Within a month of that, the Narasimham Committee had been set up to suggest the reforms in the financial sector, "I was aware of the weakness in our system. But what I was not aware of was that some people sitting in the State Bank in Bombay were robbing the bank," he added. The Minister also pointed out that he had also said the Indian capital market was unregulated and that the four people comprising the Stock Exchange division in the Finance Ministry were neither adequate not competent to oversee the market. Consequently, he had emphasised on granting statutory powers to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) which had been set up about three years ago but had not been granted statutory powers. By early 1992, the SEBI had been granted statutory powers and its authority had the full backing of the Ministry, he added. Cell to check frauds mooted: Dr. Singh also disclosed that in August 1991 he had sent a note to the then Minister for Banking, pointing out that the system was prone to frauds and that he felt it necessary that the Reserve Bank should set up a cell to prevent frauds. Stressing further his point that he was conscious of some problem in the stock markets, the Minister said he had asked the Reserve Bank to stop bank finances for investment in shares in October 1991 and this had an effect on the market which remained more or less stable till December. By January 1992, however, the market had started rising again and RBI (Reserve Bank of India) was asked to strictly enforce the ban on bank finances for speculative purposes. At that point, the Finance Minister asked the then Finance Secretary to find out where the brokers were getting funds for their activities and for this purpose the accounts of leading brokers were scrutinised and raids conducted on Mr. Harshad Mehta's premises on February 28, 1992. "Unfortunately, the information procured was on floppy disks and it took time to decipher," he added. In early March, the RBI asked financial institution chiefs to see the accounts of the leading brokers and through that it was first found out that there was some leakage from the SBI and eventually the scam came to the notice. On the JPC point that in his meeting with Stock Exchange authorities in early 1992 the Finance Minister had failed to mention the fluctuations in the market, Dr. Singh said it would have been extremely foolish on the part of the Finance Minister to indicate what should be the share prices. "I told them that the behaviour of the stock markets could bring the whole process of liberalisation to disrepute and that the Government would relent on the powers of the SEBI," the Minister said and pointed out that any comment by him about share prices could have led to brokers making "millions on the exchange." Crisis management steps: Dr. Singh also referred to the comment about his being "in slumber" and refuted the charge by mentioning the series of crisis-management measures he had undertaken on becoming the Finance Minister on June 24, 1991. About the laxity in taking follow-up action too, he said that in May 1992 the Janakiraman committee was set up which gave its first report in one month. Within three to four days, the Government followed up the recommendations by setting up a Special Court in Bombay to try the offenders, handed over cases for investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation and sacked various bank officials from their posts. About the foreign banks and their role in the scam, the Minister reiterated that they would not be allowed to get away with any violation of rules and regulations and that special audits had been undertaken and their lapses identified. The RBI had also set in position various measures to improve supervision over the banks in the country, including the provision of stricter audits. The financial sector reforms too would ease the pressure of banks to earn higher income through "the back door," as the Finance Minister put it, because the new system would enable them to earn reasonable returns through normal operations and present acceptable balance sheets. On the other recommendations of the JPC, the Minister promised to get back to parliament in three months with reports of action taken on the suggestions.
