Ortutay; place and date not given: "I Am One of the Star Witnesses"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] Rumors spread months ago about a closed meeting in which you said that, regardless of the election results, the Foreign Ministry will essentially remain in the hands of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Do you confirm these rumors? If so, on what did you base your opinion then? [Jeszenszky] This happened about six to nine months ago, and it was hardly a secret, because NEPSZABADSAG also mentioned it after a few days. I said then that no one should think that the future election results were clear and the MDF can be discarded. I am still convinced that, six months ago, no one could responsibly predict the present results. I counted on a more balanced result at the elections, with good chances for the MDF also to retain the Foreign Ministry. Naturally, this no longer seems probable. My prediction was that, with a few percent difference, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], and the MDF would largely fare equally. If this had actually taken place, the MDF would have been justified in demanding the Foreign Ministry because foreign policy has been one of the strong points of the party, thanks to Jozsef Antall's strategic thinking and to the activity carried out here. [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] According to recent news, at the request of the Czech Government, the Institute of International Relations in Prague prepared a report on potential dangers and included here its concepts regarding Greater Hungary. [Jeszenszky] And Greater Germany too.... [NEPSZABADSAG] Was this report timed for the Balladur conference in Paris? [Jeszenszky] I cannot tell whether the timing was accidental or deliberate. I have not yet heard about this institute. As for the aforementioned formulation, it is rather propagandistic; so far, we have only been able to hear about Greater Hungary programs from Romania. This term is not even used in Hungary; in professional circles, we use mostly the term "historical." I do not think that one can find a program from recent years which includes the creation of Greater Hungary. My answer to this is that Greater Europe is the goal in Hungary's program. [NEPSZABADSAG] In your opinion, has the Hungarian Foreign Ministry done everything in its power to reduce the lack of confidence prevailing in the neighboring countries? [Jeszenszky] One can always find faults. Obviously, it is impossible to fulfill every expectation. At the same time, I have a good conscience about the last five years of the foreign policy thinking of the present Hungarian Government. I know what we said and what we did. We are talking about a consistent line. Today, I regard the same things as necessary as in 1989. I know that opinions have been voiced lately, particularly in the election campaign, according to which the Hungarian Government has contributed to this lack of confidence with its statements and other things. I think one could not have done more for building confidence. As early as at the beginning of my office, I wanted to visit these countries, and I managed to call on Belgrade, Zagreb, Prague, Bratislava, and naturally Vienna in the first ten weeks. My visit to Bucharest would also have taken place much earlier, if some events in the Romanian Parliament had not occurred. Irrespective of my meetings, the rapprochement of nations along the Danube has always been my great desire. We signed basic treaties with three states where the situation of ethnic Hungarians has been settled through parliamentary legislation, namely with Ukraine, Croatia, and Slovenia. The Slovenian-Hungarian agreement on minority rights is an example, and we are ready to sign such an agreement with any of our neighbors, and this would be a good incentive for the basic treaty. We have offered this to all our neighbors. These are the facts; the rest is only interpretation. [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] What do you regard as your major personal failure and success in your position as foreign minister? [Jeszenszky] I am sorry that we did not succeed in creating harmonious relations with all our neighbors, but I do not have to regard this as my personal failure, because this did not depend on my personal attitude or on that of the government. I am dissatisfied with our contacts with the society, and this equally refers to foreign policy and the government in general. For example, in 1992, I had the opportunity to speak in detail about Hungary's foreign policy problems and the foreign policy issues of this area on Japanese television. There are very few programs in the Hungarian Television in which one can explain in detail what is happening in foreign politics. As for our successes, I would mention the peace partnership with NATO and the fact that Hungarian diplomacy did a lot for the content of this partnership to improve compared with the original ideas. I find it extremely important that we signed treaties with Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk on the same day on 6 December 1991, and with the EC ten days later. These are mostly results of common thoughts and common action, but Hungarian diplomacy played a considerable role in making many people and many countries have a good impression about Hungary. We succeeded in bringing a lot of excellent people into the Hungarian diplomacy, and we succeeded in developing a ministry that functions well. Perhaps this is what I regard as our major achievement.
