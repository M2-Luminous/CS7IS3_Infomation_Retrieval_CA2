Tang and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Brussels, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- The European Union (EU) supports Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and hopes to see a GATT membership for Taiwan before the end of this year, an EU official said Thursday [24 February]. Hugo Paemen, a ranking EU official in charge of external economic relations, said the EU may also consider establishing a representative office in Taiwan after Taiwan becomes a GATT member. Paemen made the remarks after leading a 21-member EU delegation to two days of trade consultations with an 18-member Republic of China [ROC] delegation at EU headquarters. It was the first such meeting between European Union and ROC officials. Paemen said the consultations were generally satisfactory and progress was made on several issues including market opening. The EU official commented that even though the EU has maintained a low profile when working with Taiwan, it is willing to establish a formal communication channel. "And that's why this consultation was arranged here in the EU headquarters," he said. The ROC delegation, headed by Board of Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Yen-chao, said it was agreed that Taiwan will sign an agreement on hazardous waste transportation with the EU before May 6. During the meeting, the ROC negotiators also explained Taiwan's strenuous efforts in wildlife conservation. They asked the EU to help provide details of accusations by world conservation groups that Taiwan allows trade in endangered species products to help Taiwan authorities in future crackdowns. As to scientific and technological cooperation, the EU officials said the union has at present no plan to set up an EU sci-tech center in Taiwan. However, it welcomes bilateral sci-tech personnel exchanges and EU [as received] and looks forward to detailed discussions on this concern. The two sides also talked about Taiwan opening up its insurance, stock and securities markets and improvement in Taiwan's tariff system on imported tobacco and alcohol. The next ROC-EU trade consultation will be held in Taipei, they decided.
