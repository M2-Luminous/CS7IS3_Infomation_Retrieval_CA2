Another suspect came to the police headquarters yesterday bringing his toothbrush. The narcotics police in Copenhagen yesterday took the drastic step of adding the 41-year-old former hashish smuggler Kim Julskov Knudsen to the wanted list for being one of the main figures behind Easter's big smuggling case at Helnas Bay on South Fyn. Knudsen is charged with being one of the men who instigated, planned, and financed the smuggling of about 6 tons of hashish from Morocco. Police made the greatest hashish coup in Denmark's history when the coastal vessel Hela was boarded in the waters off the coast of South Fyn. Four and a half tons of hashish has been confiscated; some during the raid and some later after being fished out of the bay. Sixteen people are now in custody, and number 17--and one of the alleged top kingpins--is the wanted Knudsen. He was sentenced to one year in prison in a hashish case in the beginning of the 1980's and has been charged by the police with having supplied most of the circa 20 million kroner that was needed in order to finance the Hela's trip to Morocco to obtain the hashish. Knudsen has perhaps escaped to Sweden or the Netherlands, but might be driving around in Denmark in a metallic blue Volvo station wagon with licence plate OS 28.117. He was gone at 0500 Sunday [3 April] morning when the police stormed into his villa in the northwestern part of Copenhagen. Asked what his profession or possible cover profession is, police commissioner Per Leo Jepsen says: "We do not know that. We call him independent or self-employed." Knudsen is 190 cm tall, with light blond hair, and a glass eye. Brought Book as Pastime At 0800 Wednesday morning another old hashish smuggler came to police headquarters. It was a 42-year-old man who had also escaped the police Sunday. [passage omitted] This 42-year-old has been charged both with the two unsuccessful hashish trips on the vessel Mary in 1992 and 1993 and also with the 6-ton trip on Hela. Like one of the other men in custody he has also been imprisoned in 1975 in North Africa for smuggling hashish. So far he has not said a word during questioning by the police. That is also the case for the 47-year-old man who was arrested in the same case the day before yesterday and who was also taken into custody yesterday. Yesterday military divers brought up 63 packages each containing 25 kg of hashish from the ocean bottom near the coast of South Fyn. By yesterday the police had retrieved 179 packages with a total of 4,475 kg of hashish. There are still more packages on the ocean floor. "And we will find them all," the chief criminal inspector Per Larsen promised us.
