He made the remarks at the 40th session of the Trade and Development Board of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Tang pointed out that the conclusion of the Uruguay Round talks and the creation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) will undoubtedly have an impact on the world trade structure and the economic development of different countries till the early next century. The agreement in a whole, however, hasn't reached an expected overall balance and in particular hasn't given a full consideration to the interests and demands of the developing countries, said Tang. For example, tariff cuts on some largely-exported products of the developing countries didn't achieve the desired objective, he said. Besides, reduction of subsidies to agricultural products failed to give due consideration to those developing countries which are net grain importers, he added. The Chinese delegate stressed that the developing countries have played an active role in the GATT negotiations and they should be given full and equal chances to participate in the establishment of WTO and a future multilateral trade system. Representatives from other countries also called for much more attention to the interests of the developing countries during the implementation of the agreement, especially in the areas of primary products, grain subsidies and intellectual properties.
