FR941012-1-00013 FR941012-1-00004 The Agency is proposing that after a firm has determined that it is eligible to use this corporate financial test, it would be required to document its use of the test by placing three items (discussed below) in the facility operating record. These requirements would help ensure that the self-implementing aspect of the proposed test requirements have been met. In the case of closure and post-closure care, these items would have to be placed in the operating record prior to the initial receipt of waste or the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later, or in the case of corrective action, no later than 120 days following selection of a corrective action remedy. This proposed requirement, in the case of corrective action remedy, is consistent with the subtitle C provision in the subpart S proposed rulemaking (55 FR at 30855 July 27, 1990), as well as the Financial Assurance for Corrective Action (FACA) proposed rulemaking (51 FR at 37854 October 24, 1986). Please refer to these proposals for more discussion on this requirement. In addition, owners and operators would be required to update these items annually, and to notify the State Director and obtain alternative financial assurance if the firm is no longer able to pass the financial test. These proposed criteria are described below. a. Chief financial officer (CFO) letter. Under ยง258.74(e)(2)(i), the owner or operator would be required to submit a letter from the firm's CFO. The letter would demonstrate that the firm has complied with the criteria of the test. Specifically, the letter would list all cost estimates covered by a financial test and provide evidence that the firm satisfies the financial criteria of the test (i.e., the financial component, including the minimum size component and domestic assets requirement). The Agency expects that this evidence will include a worksheet or similar demonstration showing that the firm's annual financial data meet the specific measures required by the test. b. Accountant's opinion. Under ยง258.74(e)(2)(ii), the Agency is also proposing to require the owner or operator to place in the operating record the opinion from the independent certified public accountant of the firm's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year. Further requirements of the CFO's letter are described in ยง258.74(e)(2)(iii). An unqualified opinion (i.e., a ``clean opinion'') from the accountant demonstrates that the firm has prepared its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for corporations. However, an adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or any qualification in the opinion would automatically disqualify the owner or operator from using the corporate financial test. The State Director of an approved State may evaluate qualified opinions on a case by case basis, however, and accept such opinions if the matters which form the basis for the qualified opinion are insufficient to warrant disallowance of the test. c. Special report from the independent certified public accountant. The third item to be placed in the operating record would be a special report of the independent certified public accountant upon examination of the chief financial officer's letter. In this report, the accountant would confirm that the data used in the CFO letter to pass the test were appropriately derived from, the audited, year-end financial statements. The purpose of this special report is to ensure that the accountant has confirmed that the financial data used in the CFO letter is appropriately presented. This report would not be required if the CFO uses financial test figures directly from the annual financial statements provided to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). However, this report is required if the CFO letter uses data that is derived from and is not identical to the data in the annual financial statements provided to the SEC. For example, in computing financial assurance under one alternative owners and operators are required to recognize total liabilities, including those associated with ``post-retirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB).'' (Please see the discussion of FASB 106 in section VI of this preamble.) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) allows the use of two different methods when accounting for these liabilities in annual financial statements. FASB 106 allows employers the option of accounting for OPEB obligations in one year (immediate recognition) or over a consecutive number of years (delayed recognition). Since both the immediate and delayed recognition methods are allowed by FASB 106, EPA does not require owners and operators that are demonstrating they meet the requirements of the financial test to use the same accounting method for OPEB obligations that is used for annual SEC submission purposes. For example, the owner or operator may use the immediate recognition method in the financial statement prepared for the SEC, but the delayed recognition method in computing liabilities for the purpose of demonstrating RCRA financial assurance.
