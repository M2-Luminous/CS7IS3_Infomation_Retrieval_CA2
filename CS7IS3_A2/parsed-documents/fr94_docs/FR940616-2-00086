ACTION: Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement; Cyprus Bagdad Copper Mine, Bagdad, Arizona. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District Office, is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement for the construction of a tailings facility expansion and south waste rock disposal facility for the existing open pit copper mine at Cyprus Bagdad. The mine is located near the Town of Bagdad, in Yavapai County, Arizona. Cyprus Bagdad Copper Corporation has submitted a proposed Mine Plan of Operations to the Bureau of Land Management, as required under the Code of Federal Regulations and title V of the Federal Land and Policy Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976. The Bureau of Land Management has responsibility for analysis, review, and approval of the mining plan. Preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement will follow the Code of Federal Regulations, title 40, subpart 1500. The mine plan proposes the expansion of the existing Mammoth tailings impoundment, the development of the Upper Mammoth tailings impoundment, and the expansion of the south waste rock disposal facility to continue mineral and mining operations at Cyprus Bagdad. The public is invited to participate in the NEPA process beginning with scoping and the identification of issues in July 1994. DATES: Public Scoping Meetings to identify issues will be held as follows: Tuesday, July 12 (7&hyph;9 p.m.) Holiday Inn 3100 Andy Devine Meeting room C Kingman, AZ Wednesday, July 13 (7&hyph;9 p.m.) Yavapai College 1100 E. Sheldon St. Bldg. 3, room 133 Prescott, AZ Written comments relating to the identification of issues will be accepted until August 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to: Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District Office, Attn: Mary Johnson, 2015 W. Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85027. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Johnson, Project Manager, Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District Office, 2015 W. Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85027 (Phone: (602) 780&hyph;8090). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Cyprus Bagdad Copper Mine is located near the Town of Bagdad, about 60 miles northwest of Wickenburg on State Highway 96. The existing mine is an open pit copper mine with flotation mill tailings, low grade dump leaching, and a solvent extraction-electro winning plant. Two tailings facilities currently contain mill wastes. The current tailings facilities are nearing capacity and will need to be closed and expanded in two years. The expansion of the Mammoth tailings would disturb approximately 410 additional acres. The Upper Mammoth tailings impoundment would disturb approximately 1,440 acres. The south waste rock disposal area would be located in Bevering Gulch and its tributaries, and the south fork of Mineral Creek, and disturb approximately 660 acres. Planned activities would take place on a combination of lands including public and private surface and mineral lands. The proposed action involves a total of approximately 305 acres of federal surface overlying federal minerals lands, and 705 acres of state surface overlying federal minerals lands. Potential issues include surface and groundwater quality, air quality, cultural resources, biological resources, visual resources, and mine reclamation. The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be developed by a third party contractor who has been approved by the Bureau of Land Management. The contractor will use an interdisciplinary team to develop the document. The Bureau of Land Management will have the responsibility for the review of the EIS. Complete records of all phases of the environmental documentation process will be available for public review at the Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District Office, 2015 W. Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85027, and at the Bureau of Land Management, Kingman Resource Area, 2475 Beverly Ave., Kingman, Arizona 86401. Dated: June 9, 1994. David J. Miller, Acting District Manager. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14626 Filed 6&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;32&hyph;M
