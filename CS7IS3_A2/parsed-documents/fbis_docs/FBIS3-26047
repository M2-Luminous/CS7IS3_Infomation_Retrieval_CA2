Addressing a working conference which ended here recently, Lu Wenge, director of the provincial committee for restructuring the economy, mentioned that the share-holding system will also be applied to energy and infrastructural construction. He noted that the reform of the property rights system will be deepened, too. Meanwhile, such sectors as accounting, audit and law offices as well as the securities exchanges will play important roles in supervising the process of the reform of those enterprises. Zhejiang is one of a handful of provinces which piloted the introduction of the share-holding system in China in the late 1980s. Over the past few years, the province has already witnessed remarkable progress in establishing and expanding the share-holding system in its state-owned, collective and private firms. By the end of 1993, the province had approved some 126 standardized share-holding companies, involving a total registered capital of about 8.15 billion yuan, according to official sources. Of those 126 companies, 15 have issued stock publicly and eight have been listed on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. In addition to the share-holding system, the formation of limited liability companies has expanded greatly, with some 1,067 limited liability companies approved in the province by the end of 1993. Apart from the step-by-step transformation of state-owned enterprises to the share-holding system, some 700 small collective firms as well as more than 60,000 rural enterprises have also adopted the new system of cooperative share-holding. Through transforming management mechanisms, most of the share- holding companies have collected enough money to enlarge the production scale and have already made greater profits. Meanwhile, the province has also made progress by introducing the share-holding system in the development of such basic industries as energy, transportation and telecommunications, which had hindered the development of the economy as a whole because of a lack of construction funds. Yan Chunyou, an official under the provincial committee for restructuring the economy, said, "the reform of the share-holding system is the key to the modern enterprise system, and it's an effective way to enlarge the production scale of those firms who adopt this system and to improve their performance in both international and domestic markets." The introduction of the share-holding system has not only defined property rights clearly but also boosted reforms in the employment, distribution and management systems of the enterprises, Yan said. China is now making painstaking efforts to transform the management mechanism of its state-owned enterprises, in a bid to build a modern enterprise system, one of the major objectives of its economic development.
