FBIS4-57283 "drlat095_j_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-095 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Panama Comments on SPI, Offer to Arnulfists Comments on SPI, Offer to Arnulfists PA1505035294 Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 12 May 94 PA1505035294 Panama City Circuito RPC Television Spanish BFN [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] [Text] Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares will retain the Institutional Protection Service [SPI] and will promote its professionalization. As the president-elect sees it, it is important to insist on a coalition government. This is what he hinted when he learned of the Arnulfist's decision to reject two ministries he offered to them. [Begin Perez Balladares recording] My offer was not an intention to create political slots, but an intention to create agreements, affinity, and to have the best men and women in the country for national projects. [end recording] Perez Balladares said that the Legislative Assembly must approve the designation of the new comptroller general from a list of nominees he will submit when he takes over the government in September. The president-elect was also asked about the future of the SPI. [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I think that all presidential offices in all countries must have a protection service for people and institutions. I think this service must be professional, apolitical, and capable of fulfilling its functions. If I find these characteristics in the SPI, it will continue functioning exactly as it functions now. [end recording] Perez Balladares said that he has a special office to answer the grievances of public employees who have been unjustly dismissed. He flatly rejected the possibility of an Arnulfist becoming president of the Legislative Assembly in September. [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I believe that the legislative branch will have to make its own decisions, and I highly respect that. However, seeing how the Assembly is taking shape, I think that it will be presided over by the party that has obtained the most votes, and that is us. [end recording]
