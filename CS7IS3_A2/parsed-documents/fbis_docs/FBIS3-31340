"The casualty toll will be huge, whole families will perish, including infants. It will be a real genocide -- a crime which began in World War II when the Muslims and Croats, sponsored by Adolf Hitler, killed 1.5 million Serbs," the statement says. [passage omitted] For their part, the Serbs have already done a great deal for establishing peace: They surrendered Sarajevo airport to UNPROFOR, they surrendered territories to the Muslims in exchange for peace on two occasions, and they saved 80,000 Croats from being massacred by the Muslims. The Serbs have never besieged the city of Sarajevo. Sarajevo is a city divided into Serb and Muslim parts, ISKRA reports. The ministry of foreign affairs calls on all Serbs in the world to present these details to politicians, parties, members of parliaments, journalists and other respected personalities, also calling for organization of protests because Serbs currently have no other weapons, the statement says.
