The prime minister added that only a miracle will enable the completion of the negotiations next week, and that some of the issues discussed in Davos remain open. The Palestinians have not reported to the economic talks in Paris for two weeks, Rabin stated, and the negotiations on the transfer of civil powers are stuck. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz points out that the prime minister made these remarks after the signing ceremony of scientific agreements with Austria. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 2 February adds: "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated today that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's goal is to establish a Palestinian state in the first stage, and a confederation with Jordan at a later stage." In a recorded passage in English, Rabin says: "To the best of my knowledge, the goal is a Palestinian state; perhaps after that a confederation. But, this is not my problem."] [Referring to the reported criticism of security officials at the understandings reached in Davos by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and 'Arafat, Rabin said "he did not want to get into abstract and fabricated arguments."]
