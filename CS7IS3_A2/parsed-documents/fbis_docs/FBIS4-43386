According to Jacques Genton (Centrist Union sentor for le Cher), the report's author who approves the programming law's broad outlines, this ambition will nonetheless be difficult to achieve in view of the inadequacy of the budget. France's decision to form units -- on the scale of three divisions -- which can be rapidly "deployed" over a long distance is an objective which is deemed "particularly ambitious and difficult to achieve" by the senators. This assessment, shared by many other deputies, is featured in a 300-page report commissioned by the Senate's foreign affairs and defense committees, which Genton focuses on the Military Programming Law which the Senate is debatting from Tuesday 14 to Thursday 16 June. Both the defense white paper and the draft 1995-2000 Military Programming Law suggest the creation of interservice units known as "rapid deployment" forces, to deal with a series of scenarios for French military involvement overseas. [passage omitted] Between 120,000 and 130,000 Men The author of the Senate report notes that, according to current estimates, "the requirements in available rapid deployment forces have been assessed at between 120,000 and 130,000 men, which seems to be a particularly ambitious objective and one which is difficult to achieve," because the aim is to have, in all, between two and three divisions "combining heavy resources, light resources, powerful air-mobile resources, and deep and accurate fire." France has learned the lessons of the Gulf War, when it had difficulty forming a division of some 15,000 men. However, the shortfall in equipment is far from having being resolved by the new Military Program Law submitted to Parliament. Mr. Genton gives some examples of this in his report, which, however, welcomes the fact that the existing government has pledged to halt, as of 1995, the slow erosion in funds allocated to defense over the past 10 years or so. First, the Army: In future it will only have eight divisions out of the 15 which it still had in 1981; its stock of armored vehicles will fall to 650 Leclerc tanks instead of 1,000 AMX-30 tanks; its battle helicopters will ultimately consist of 215 Tigre helicopters, compared with 340 Gazelle helicopters at present, and its level of professionalization -- which is also reflected in the number of officers or junior officers compared with the conscript forces -- is much lower than that of the allied armed forces. Second, the Air Force: It will fall to 380 fighter planes, instead of the 450 of previous years, and it is not due to have its first six Rafale planes until the year 2001; its logistical transport capabilities remain modest and it lacks in-flight refueling planes; the reduction in its manpower between 1981 and 1991 has affected career staff (down 4,554) more than the draft (down 3,012). Finally, the Navy: In addition to the reduction in the number of ships, which has gone from 150 in 1985 to 115 in 1994 and probably to 103 in the year 2004, there is the gradual aging of the fleet, which should reach an average age of 18 years in the year 2005; it is short of officers (between 5 and 6 percent) considering the increase in its missions. In these conditions, Mr. Genton thinks that the prime minister and his defense minister are right to "resist the temptation to launch new programs," with the exception of a project for a missile fired with accuracy over a long range, and to "continue the existing equipment programs," for which large amounts of funds had already been spent. He nonetheless expresses his anxiety about the idea that the funding of research, which is the guarantee for the future, is suffering the "repercussions" of the financial effort devoted to operational equipment. Aside from this observation, it is a fact that the military program includes the postponment of a number of initiatives until after 1997, because of the current financial constraints. This is particularly true of the Navy, which is still the main "vector" of a long-range action policy, with the postponement of any decision on a second aircraft carrier, on the NH-90 logistical helicopter, and on the need to have three of four new landing craft transporters.
