Pu.: "Paris Seeks To Curb Trade Deficit"] [Text] In committing itself not to sell any more offensive weapons to Taiwan, France aimed to do away with the barrier which prevented French companies from gaining a share of the Chinese market comparable to that of their foreign competitors in 1993. French companies are now "welcome to compete on an equal footing (in this market," said China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during his official visit to France. By bringing its relations with Beijing back to normal, France hopes to be able to take advantage of China's economic boom (annual growth rate of 14 percent) and thus to curb its trade deficit with this country, which has been steadily increasing since the mid-eighties. While it boasted a 2.5-billion-franc [Fr] surplus in 1985, France's trade balance with China suffered a Fr11.2-billion deficit in 1992. As for the exports-imports ratio, it went down to 39.7 percent in 1992 from 157 percent in 1985. However, statistics available for last year's first nine months indicate an improvement. The 1993 deficit should be comparable to that of 1992, a year during which France was China's 12th biggest supplier and customer. Major French corporations with a foothold in the Chinese market include car makers Peugeot, Citroen and Renault, as well as CGE [General Water Company], Alcatel-Alsthom, Elf-Sanofi, Rhone-Poulenc, and Lyonnaise des eaux [Lyon Water Company]. Franco-Chinese trade is characterized by a typical industrialized nation/developing country relationship. Owing to its fast economic growth, China mainly purchases capital goods from France. In 1992, machinery and mechanical apparatus made up 23 percent of French exports to China; then came cars, car equipment and commercial vehicles (19 percent), electrical equipment (8 percent) and professional electronics (8 percent). France purchases consumer products from China, such as textile articles and clothes (21 percent of French imports in 1992), toys, sporting goods and jewelry (19 percent), shoes and leather goods (14 percent), and consumer electronics products (7 percent). While French exports to China increased by 30.2 percent over last year's first five months as compared to the same period of 1992, Germany's exports went up by 89.8 percent, Italy's by 83.3 percent, and Britain's by 52.3 percent. France's policy U-turn with respect to Beijing should therefore enable French companies to take full advantage of China's booming economy.
