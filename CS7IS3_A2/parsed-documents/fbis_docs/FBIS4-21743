The Palestinian alliance forces have issued a statement in which they stressed that their meeting with the brother leader of the revolution falls within an awareness of the historic responsibility shouldered by the pan-Arab forces that are resisting the plans of submission and Zionist dominion. Within this framework, developments on the Arab and international arenas were discussed, in particular developments related to occupied Palestine in the aftermath of the massacres that are being committed by the Zionist enemy against the Palestinian people, the latest of which is the sacred Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The statement reiterated the rejection of the Palestinian people and its revolutionary and pan-Arab forces of the unjust and unfair measures that are imposed against the Great Jamahiriyah by the so-called UN Security Council.
