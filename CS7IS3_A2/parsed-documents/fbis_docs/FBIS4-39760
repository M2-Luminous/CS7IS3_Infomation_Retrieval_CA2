This budget, in his words, can only guarantee the payment of the wages and salaries of military servicemen and civilians employed by the military establishment. He expressed hope that the Army would get some extrabudgetary funding. If we do not get additional extra budgetary funds, then there can be no talk of ordering new equipment or arms, Pavel Grachev said. He also said that problems would arise with the funding of scientific research and design work. This budget will have a negative effect on the future of Russia's armed forces, Pavel Grachev said.
