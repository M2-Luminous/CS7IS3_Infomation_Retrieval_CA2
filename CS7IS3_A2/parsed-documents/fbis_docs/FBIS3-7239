FBIS3-7239 "dreas059__a94021" FBIS-EAS-94-059-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Reportage on DPRK Nuclear Situation Government Cooperation Indicated OW2703140694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2703140694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The government plans to spell out a "tripartite cooperation" to deal with the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear arms development during talks with top defense authorities from the United States and the ROK who plan to visit Japan successively in late April. It has decided to carry out this plan in consideration of results of the Japan-ROK summit meeting, which concluded on 26 March. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Defense Agency [DA], and other relevant government ministries and agencies plan to make analyses of the current situation and future trends regarding the DPRK's nuclear development. In addition, they plan to hasten research efforts to get ready for "firm responses" which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed in talks with ROK President Kim Yong-sam in the event a resolution should be passed by the UN Security Council [UNSC] to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry plans to visit Japan on 19 April immediately after his visit to the ROK which begins on 16 April. He will hold talks with Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, and Kazuo Aichi, director general of the DA. After Perry, ROK National Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae is scheduled to visit Japan in late April. By the time these top U.S. and ROK defense officials visit Japan in late April, it is expected that tensions will have mounted over the question of whether economic sanctions should be imposed against North Korea if that country should continue to take a tough stance, such as by rejecting the International Atomic Energy Agency's reinspection of its nuclear facilities. Because talks have been scheduled in succession between top U.S. and ROK defense officials, between top Japanese and U.S. defense officials, and finally between top Japanese and ROK defense officials all around this time, it seems this is an attempt to apply "pressure" on North Korea to make it soften its attitude. The reason is that Japan has its own problems. In the event of the "worst case" when the UNSC should adopt a resolution to impose economic sanctions against North Korea and a naval blockade should be enforced, it would be nearly impossible for Japan to participate in such endeavors under its current legal restrictions. If the United Nations were to request Japanese cooperation by asking for deployment of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF], circumstances are such that the SDF could "do only as much as to collect information within Japanese territorial waters."
