He said these groups are arming themselves in preparation for war. The spokesman said the groups were the same ones which perpetrated terrorist acts and relied on foreign assistance. He said the objectives of the groups are: 1. To ensure that pacification does not take place among communities in the central regions, including the Hiiraan region, and also to ensure that the recently concluded Kismaayo agreement, which was signed by communities in the Jubbada Hoose region, is not implemented and; 2. To create insecurity, with the aim of ensuring that the proposed national conference in Mogadishu does not take place. The conference was proposed in the Nairobi agreement, was witnessed by international organizations such as the United Nations, the OAU, and leaders from friendly countries, who would like peace and harmony to return to Somalia. For these and other reasons, the SNA spokesman said, the groups are trying to bring about a situation in which peace and dialogue are not possible. In light of this, the SNA tells the world that it will not be responsible for any consequences in the country arising from war-mongering and insecurity. The SNA once again appeals to the Somali people to guard against being used to fight each other, and to strive to maintain peace and stability in Mogadishu and throughout the country, the spokesman concluded.
