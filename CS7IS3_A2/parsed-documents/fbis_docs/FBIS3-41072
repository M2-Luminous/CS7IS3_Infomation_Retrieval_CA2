The council will end 1993 with 22 million [cruzeiros] in cash that it has collected from the auctioning off of property confiscated from the drug traffic and from payments by agencies preparing educational campaigns with money obtained through budget amendments submitted by congressmen. The shortage of funds has led the council's president, Isaac Barreto, to reject practically all requests to finance video clips, since the budget has been too tight to produce even one. The advertising campaigns against drug use in the Federal District and the states of Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, and Parana were produced with funds obtained by congressmen through budget amendments. Confen has distributed social subsidies totaling 39.7 million cruzeiros (at April values) to 120 welfare agencies, most of them therapy groups. To gain access to those subsidies this year, the institutions will have to submit a new statement of assets to the National Social Welfare Council, an agency of the Ministry of Health. The reason is that the council does not want to run the risk of handing out money to agencies that are cheating the federal administration. Despite the shortage of money, something unprecedented happened this year at Confen. Four institutions linked to congressmen, including one institute belonging to Federal Deputy Raquel Candido (no party, Rondonia), returned about 11 million cruzeiros that had not been used in the prevention campaigns. Secretariat Will Support Council The National Narcotics Secretariat, which was recently approved by President Itamar Franco, is going to help the National Council on Narcotics (Confen) implement national policy in that area. Auctions of property seized from drug traffickers will be held by the secretariat, which will also administer the money collected in that way. At the beginning of December, Confen held a meeting to prepare for the one that will be held in January. Its purpose was to decide how to spend the small amount of funds available. The council's president, Isaac Barreto, said that the work of preventing drug use would continue to occupy a prominent place through the encouragement of regional campaigns like those organized in the Federal District, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, and Rondonia. The National Narcotics Secretariat will be given the funds from the Fund for Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Combat Against Drugs (Funcab) that currently belong to Confen. Funcab's funds consist of federal appropriations, gifts from domestic and international agencies, auction proceeds, and the proceeds of fines levied in connection with the control and supervision of controlled drugs and medicines and of chemicals used to manufacture and process drugs. Funcab's entire budget for 1994 will be devoted to programs to provide vocational training concerned with education, prevention, treatment, repression, control, and supervision in connection with drug use and drug trafficking. Carrying out campaigns and modernizing repression activities will also be priority activities for the new secretariat. Forty percent of Funcab's funds will go to the Federal Police. The National Narcotics Secretariat will have a slim structure, with only two departments and nine commissioned positions. Still to be named is its secretary, who will face strong resistance on the part of the Federal Police. Sectors in the Federal Police believe that the new agency is going to dilute the duties currently assigned to that police force.
