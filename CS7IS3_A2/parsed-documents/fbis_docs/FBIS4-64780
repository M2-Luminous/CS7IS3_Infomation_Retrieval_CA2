The aim is to replace a defence policy based on NATO, and relying on American support, with a more pan-European approach. The Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, is strongly behind the change of emphasis and is understood to be seeking more aggressive promotion of joint European defence projects after next month's European elections. Britain is already committed to more joint ventures under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, and an accelerating American withdrawal from Europe is now thought to be inevitable. However, Euro-sceptic Tory back-benchers are alarmed by the new approach, which was reflected strongly in the recent Defence White Paper. They believe it will jeopardise British sovereignty and could put British security under European control. Ian Duncan-Smith, Conservative MP for Chingford, claimed last night he had wide backbench support for the challenge he is planning to force ministers to come clean on what he described as a "hidden agenda." The White Paper states: "While defence and security policies are likely to retain specifically British elements with an ability for national action...the multilateral dimension will increasingly influence our judgment." Mr Duncan-Smith called this an admission that national sovereignty over defence was effectively being put up for grabs by Brussels. "It is an extraordinary statement -- a huge shift of policy, which has neither been debated in the House of Commons nor in the party," he said. The defence document concentrates heavily on British security in the European context -- while admitting that "significant reductions in the costs of the defence programme" will be announced as soon as possible. The results of a defence cost study ordered by Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, will be published in July. It will present radical proposals to privatise support services involving as many as 20,000 Government job losses. There will be heated squabbles over cuts in military bands and regimental mascots, but an underlying shift in global security policy could cause a much bigger political storm. "It's a dual track," said Mr Duncan-Smith. "The Government is dressing up real cuts in our fighting capability while claiming the front line will not be touched. At the same time we are galloping into European defence agreements. The two are clearly linked." Julian Brazier, vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench defence committee, said he was more concerned about the cuts' effect on Britain's true fighting capability. "The Army is being crushed by ever-expanding peacetime commitments and cuts in resources," he said. "Anything that might weaken the transatlantic connection would be a fatal mistake."
