However, there is not much hope for a lasting alliance between them. There are too many differences, too much distrust, and too few possible advantages--for one of the two parties at least. The president and his entourage are encouraging the trade union to cooperate; Solidarity may fear that the main beneficiary of the possible alliance would be Walesa. In the last conflict with the parliament, the president resorted to anticommunist rhetoric. He started seeking allies that he could count on in this dispute, and in the long run--in the presidential elections: "My dear Solidarity," he said at the last press conference. "I will never cut my links with 'Solidarity,'" he added. Andrzej Drzycimski has been recently persuading Marian Krzaklewski to meet with the president. A Good Partner Solidarity is a good, possible partner for Walesa. It is beginning to regain strength and overcome the postelection crisis. It proved this during the 40,000-people demonstration which marched through the streets of Warsaw. The main slogan was "Down with Communists" and it was clear that the politically-diversified "Solidarity people" felt good in the old role, when they could jointly protest the return of the forces of the old configuration to power. The president is protesting against the same today; he even said that the people who protest are right, because "it was not supposed to be this way, but it is worse," even though he encouraged a fight on other platforms. During the demonstration, Solidarity authorities saw to it that it did not reach the Belvedere; at the lead of the demonstration was the Gdansk Region, with a strong representation of the Gdansk Shipyard, which did not really feel like demonstrating against the president--there are more persons with similar views in the union. In an interview for RZECZPOSPOLITA, Solidarity Senate Speaker Stefan Jurczak did not rule out the possibility that the union may for the second time back up Walesa in the presidential elections. Not Even A Step Further Solidarity and the president may soon start cooperation with each other. It seems, however, that this will not be a lasting cooperation. Members of the Solidarity authorities have several reasons why they should not go even a step further than it is necessary in an alliance with the president. "It is Walesa who wants cooperation with Solidarity. Our question is what will we get out of that," says one member of the National Committee. The president may contribute to this marriage the authority of his office, the right to veto laws, the possibility of holding a referendum (the trade union wants, for example, a referendum on giving property to citizens), and the right to launch a legislative initiative. The problem is that the authority of the president is slightly eroded, which is shown by opinion polls, and the other rights may be difficult to take advantage of in a war with the parliament: The veto may be overridden, the Senate must approve the referendum, and the fate of the last legislative initiative of the president, which was rejected in the first reading, will discourage Lech Walesa from any new actions in this area. What the partners can do, then, is to take joint action in the opposition. This motivation may turn out to be sufficient only for a short time. All the more so because the relations between the president and Solidarity will become increasingly complex as The Presidential Elections draw closer. Walesa will certainly want to lean on the trade union, where he still has numerous supporters. The present Solidarity leadership is rather skeptical about this idea. A similar situation developed last year, when the president wanted to come to the Solidarity congress and persuade the trade union to run in the parliamentary elections jointly with the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms. The union leaders, who were determined to run separately, were indignant at the president and invited him only to the last day of the congress, when all the decisions had already been made. The president was offended because he was not given a chance to give it a try. "I would not like to be in such a Solidarity, he said at that time. Now Walesa wants to give it a try once again. However, past animosities linger on--all the more so because after the congress conflict the influence of supporters and personal friends of the president within Solidarity considerably waned. We should also not forget about numerous Solidarity members who are firm opponents of Walesa, supporters of file-checking and cooperation with the right wing. Exceedingly close cooperation with Walesa would, then, have to cause greater or lesser quarrels within Solidarity. Adding to all that are also personal ambitions of Marian Krzaklewski; some of his aides do not rule out the possibility that he is thinking about the presidency. He would be a candidate acceptable to the right wing--he is the chairman of the Constitutional Commission of the extra-parliamentary rightist groupings.
