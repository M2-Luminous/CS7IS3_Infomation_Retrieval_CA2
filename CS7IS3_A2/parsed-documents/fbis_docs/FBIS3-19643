The strategy paper lays down the critical stance of the CSU on European integration, which in their view is proceeding too fast. There will be no federal Europe with the CSU. Rather, the party sees its task as being to restrict the "presumptuous centralism and rampant bureaucracy" of Brussels. The CSU agreed to European integration in principle. The European Union is seen as being in the interest of Bavaria and Germany. However, efforts will have to be made in the future to ensure that burdens are shared more fairly and Germany is freed from the role of Euro-financier. The introduction of a European currency is also viewed with skepticism. The CSU puts stability before speed, the position paper says. There will only be a European currency if it is as stable as the German mark. The CSU wants to see the subsidiary principle realized in a "Europe of regions." Brussels must only be given responsibility for areas that cannot be settled at the national level. This applies to foreign and security policy, the fight against organized crime, approaches to the influx of asylum-seekers and refugees, and transport and environmental issues.
