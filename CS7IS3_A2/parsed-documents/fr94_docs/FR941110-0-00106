FR941110-0-00106 FR941110-0-00016 Response: We are adopting a modified version of the above suggestions and are requiring that the physician of each resident in the facility who was found to have suffered substandard quality of care, regardless of payment source, be notified of findings of substandard quality of care. Findings of substandard quality of care are indicative of the facility's inability or unwillingness to meet specific participation requirements relative to the entire resident population. While we have the statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of program beneficiaries and recipients in nursing homes that participate in one or both programs, noncompliance frequently affects residents in a facility, other than just Medicare and Medicaid residents. Moreover, the Act plainly applies to all residents receiving substandard quality of care regardless of payment source. Therefore, findings of substandard quality of care must be communicated to the physician of each resident who was the subject of such care. Comment: A few commenters suggested that notification to the State board responsible for the licensing of the facility administrator be limited to those situations where the administrator is found culpable for the violations identified. They describe situations in which a reputable administrator is recruited to a problem facility in an effort to turn the facility around. Shortly thereafter, a survey is performed which identifies substandard quality of care, and as a result, the newly hired administrator is reported to the licensing board. They point out that this situation provides a disincentive for quality administrators to assume control of problem facilities due to the risk to their reputation. A few commenters wondered why licensing boards need to be notified, while others believed that notification should be expanded to include State licensure boards for nursing and medicine as well as the State and local medical societies. Response: We are not accepting these suggestions. First, the requirements to notify the licensing board, as well as physicians of Medicare and Medicaid residents, when substandard quality of care is identified, are statutory and do not provide for exceptions. Second, a facility administrator, regardless of recency of appointment, is ultimately accountable for the care and services provided in his or her facility at the time of the survey. We would expect that this consideration as well as others would be evaluated by a prospective facility administrator. Regarding the comment that notification should be expanded, sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the Act are clear as to the individuals and organizations that would have the greatest need for the specified survey-related information. We believe that all interests have been adequately represented and that such information is easily accessible to any other interested parties either through their respective professional affiliations, or through the public disclosure mechanism. Therefore, we see no need to expand the list of parties the State must notify about substandard quality of care. Comment: Several commenters asked whether the State notification requirements at sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the Act apply to surveys performed by HCFA. Response: States will provide the notification regardless of who performed the survey that identified the substandard quality of care. For all State-operated facilities, as well as non-State-operated facilities which are subject to a Federal survey, HCFA will notify the State of the finding of substandard quality of care so that the State can fulfill the notification requirements. This requirement is based on the rationale that the State ``finds'' noncompliance when it is notified of it by HCFA. This approach permits use of existing State systems and centralizes notification efforts.
