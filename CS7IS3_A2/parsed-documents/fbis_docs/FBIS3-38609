No, a divided shield. At 1930 on a cold January Sunday the defunct DC is distributing bread and fishes. At the same table are seated Rosa Russo Jervolino, Italian Popular Party [PPI] chairman, and Francesco D'Onofrio, chairman of the Democratic Christian Center [CCD] parliamentary group. The DC has left not only regrets among its orphaned "sons," but also debts, assets, and property. How should these be divided up between the PPI and CCD heirs? For days it looked as if the two newly born factions were one step away from a squalid bar brawl, and involvement in a drawnout legal processs. When everything seemed in jeopardy, peace came, sealed precisely yesterday evening. The neocentrist minority will be receiving 200 million lire as an immediate contribution to put into motion the preelectoral machine, with headquarters probably opposite those of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] enemy, and 15 percent of the assets controlled by the Piazza del Gesu [former DC headquarters]. Debts are included. "There has been talk of tensions, dissension, and conflicts," D'Onofrio told IL GIORNALE, "but these negotiations could not have been confronted and managed better." [D'Alessandro] Let us begin with the headquarters. Where will the CCD have its offices? [D'Onofrio] I believe that we will be going to the top floor of a palazzo in the Via delle Botteghe Oscure. Yes, just across the road from the PDS. We will only know finally tomorrow. As an alternative we also have the third floor of the Piazza Nicosia, the seat of the DC's regional committee. It is important to have offices immediately available, hence we will go for the solution which can be achieved as soon as possible. [D'Alessandro] And how will the DC assets be divided? [D'Onofrio] We had asked for 20 percent, based on the number of our representatives who called for the convening of the National Council to decree the death of the Christian Democratic Party. The PPI objected, arguing that one should instead use a formula based on the number of parliamentarians and that we thus represent only 10 percent. We arrived at a compromise of 15 percent. [D'Alessandro] Were there no other less-complex solutions? [D'Onofrio] Pierferdinando Casini [neocentrist leader] had suggested making the liquidation dependent on the outcome of the elections. This could have been an exalting challenge, but the new electoral system makes any calculation more complicated. [D'Alessandro] When will the rest of the DC dinosaur be divided up? [D'Onofrio] There will be an arbitration procedure to ascertain the debts and to carry out an inventory of the assets. Then the assets will be distributed. [D'Alessandro] IL POPOLO will also be split in two? [D'Onofrio] Yes, if it ends up under the tutelage of the present responsible party manager. Otherwise it does not concern us. [D'Alessandro] And the crossed shield? Who can this be used by? [D'Onofrio] The question of the symbol represented the political precondition of the agreement. It has been decided that it belongs to both, and this recognizes the fact that we have the same historical roots. The PPI is however the DC's major heir and can use it prominently. The CCD is however a younger brother and as such will be allowed to include the crossed shield within a different symbol. [D'Alessandro] If the agreement on the symbol had failed.... [D'Onofrio] We would have gone to court.
