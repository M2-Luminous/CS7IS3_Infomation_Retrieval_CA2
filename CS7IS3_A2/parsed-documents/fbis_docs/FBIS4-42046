It brought no peace to the country. The conflict is still going on. However, experts believe that negotiations will also continue. The Tajik opposition was represented by one of its leaders, Co-Chairman of the Movement for Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan, 40-year old Akbar Turajonzoda. He graduated from the Bukhar Religious Institute (Medrese), the Islamic Institute in Tashkent and the Shariah faculty of the Jordan University. During 1989-1992 he was Kazikalon (head of all Muslims) of Tajikistan. An INTERFAX correspondent Andrey Zharov is speaking to him. INTERFAX: First of all, it is interesting to know how would you assess the talks and their results? TURAJONZODA: The beginning of the talks itself proves that the international community recognized the opposition as a reality. It has realized that not only the Dushanbe regime represented the Tajik people. In fact, this means that the authorities in Dushanbe regard us as a real political and military force defending interests of a significant part of Tajik citizens. A half a year ago Dushanbe was calling us criminals with "hands in blood." Now Dushanbe understood that the situation in Tajikistan could not be settled without participation of the opposition. It encourages that we have found certain understanding on the part of Russia. The Russian leadership also realized that the situation in the republic and in the region could not be stabilized without a dialogue with the opposition. INTERFAX: With who of high-ranking Russian officials did you meet? TURAJONZODA: I met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert Chernyshov. We also met a deputy commander-in-chief of the border defense troops and a deputy defense minister. INTERFAX: How would you assess the role which Uzbekistan is playing in the Tajik conflict? TURAJONZODA: There are many facts proving that the Uzbek leadership helped the present Tajik authorities come to power by military means. When we took prisoners some militants of the People's Front, they often said that they had been armed and supplied with money by Uzbek representatives. Some units were formed in the Surkhan-Daryin Region (Uzbekistan). Before militants were brought to Tajikistan they had a meeting with the Uzbek interior minister and the deputy defense minister. We know these facts rather well. These formations brought the current regime in Dushanbe to power. INTERFAX: You are blamed for attempts to set up a pro-Iranian Islamic regime in the republic. Is this right? TURAJONZODA: I never spoke about this either in my statement or in my articles. On the contrary, I have been repeatedly stressing that we will be building a secular democratic state. The opposition already abolished the Party of Islamic Rebirth. The Movement for Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan was created instead of it. Most leaders of the movement are democrats and not the so-called Islamists. As a believer and a religious activist I would like to live in conformity with my principles and Islamic traditions. However, I am a realist. Our people have gone thorough the long-lasting communist rule. Islam cannot be imposed. The religion of Muslims does not make anybody leave in conformity with its ideology and customs. The communist rule showed that people cannot be forced to adhere to certain ideology. Communists had used radio, television and other media, were bringing up people as Marxists starting from nursery schools. Still they failed to kill the faith. How can we repeat this mistake by imposing our ideology? However, if the people itself wants to bring some of the country's laws in conformity with Islamic traditions through elections or a referendum, this is quite possible. However, it must be realized that nothing new could be invented in the economy. Natural difference exists between the culture, traditions and vision in various countries. That is why I believe that such issues as marriage, divorce, division of property, etc. Can be brought to conformity with Islamic traditions but only by a civilized way and when the people itself wants this. This could also be done through the parliament. However, I am categorically against religious rule in the country. We are moving towards the 21st century and we cannot go back to a theocratic state. We will not force women to cover their face. INTERFAX: How does the opposition see the future of Tajikistan? TURAJONZODA: The opposition proposes to create an interim government in which neither the present leadership nor we would take part. Those who are not guilty of stirring up the fratricidal war must come to power. During two years refugees will return. Political parties, including Communists and those participating in the current regime will be acting freely. The media must also be free. Under the mediation of the UN and monitors from other countries a new constitution will be created which will say that Tajikistan is a secular democratic country where religion is separated from the state and which recognizes the right for private property. The Fundamental Law will also include provisions on democratic liberties. The constitution must say that no political regime will have the right to change it during the next 30 or 50 years, neither we nor any other party which may come to power. Nobody will have the right to build the state basing on other principles, I told Chernyshov. We regret that Russians are frightening themselves with a scare-crow of Islamic fundamentalism. INTERFAX: How do you think the talks between the Tajik leadership and the opposition can be sped up? TURAJONZODA: The delegations must be of a high level so that the talks be not delayed. Now, to tell the truth, the Dushanbe delegation includes no representatives of the regions from which the people in power have come. The leaders of the present regime have all come from one region - Kulyab. This includes E.Rakhmonov (the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet), A.Dostiyev (his deputy), the interior minister, the security minister, the minister for foreign economic relations, the health minister, the deputies defense minister and all regional heads. Even in Khojent (former Leninabad - the Motherland of Turajonzoda) the prosecutor general is from Kulyab. People from Kulyab have all political, power and, as they say, beneficial, posts. However, none of them is in the official delegation. There is a way to make Dushanbe be more active during the talks - military pressure, I told Chernyshov. However, most politicians do not want to see the obvious until there is a bloodshed. In particular, the Russian Foreign Ministry's Envoy A.Orlov affirmed that the situation is calm in Dushanbe and that the government is controlling the situation. Probably, we have to display our military force to change this deceitful image. Many people do not believe us thinking that the government is really controlling the situation. However, it is quite clear that Dushanbe agreed to negotiate ceding to Moscow's pressure. The present regime needs no talks. Russian troops are defending the borders. Russia supplies Tajikistan with cash money and food products. Why will the current leaders resign? The problem is a heavy burden for Russia and Russian citizens are killed in Tajikistan as a result. INTERFAX: What is the attitude of your movement towards Russia given presence of Russian forces in your country? TURAJONZODA: The Movement of Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan does not oppose good relations between Russia and our country. We propose an honest variant - appointment of a temporary government - and are ready to consider candidacy of every member of the Cabinet together with Moscow and other interested states. I think that the security bodies have dossiers for every of the possible candidates and Moscow can easily learn everything about anyone of them. We are not Russia's adversaries and recognize its geopolitical interests in Tajikistan. Our Movement is well aware of the fact that none of the states of the world can substitute Russia in the republic. We have no such close relations with any other state, our economy and infrastructures are "interrelated" with the Russian Federation. There are forces in the world which are interested in the development of this conflict. Unfortunately Russia is being more and more involved into the war, and this results in the appearance of national enmity. In addition, the Russian Federation is forced to spend great funds and forces in Tajikistan thus distracting from other important problems. Several countries will assist us in waging this war not because of their love with respect to us but in order to weaken Russia. It became especially obvious after the victory of Zhirinovsky's party at the elections to the State Duma. He openly declared about his intention to restore the Russian empire and about his plans to seize territories from Constantinople to Tehran. Many people in this regions are greatly concerned over these statements and they are ready to support us. We spoke about this with Mr A.Chernyshev. I believe that our task is to bring this information to Russia's people and Russian politicians are to adopt their decision. INTERFAX: Several terroristic acts against Russian servicemen both in the capital and other cities have been registered over the last period in Tajikistan. Has the Movement something to do with these acts? TURAJONZODA: I assert that the Movement for Islamic Rebirth has not planned any acts with respect to Russian citizens and Russian servicemen, especially in populated centers. We still believe that Russia is the major guarantor of security and integrity of our state and our ally. I think that these terroristic acts have been accomplished by those forces which want to deeper involve Russia into the mire of the Tajik war, to force it to increase its military presence, and to encounter great expenditures. In fact, this reminds the events which happened with the Russian army in Afghanistan when it was bogged down in the armed struggle with the opposition. We do not want this. Those circles which do not want to completely settle the Tajik conflict by political means strive for this variant. I hope that Russian politicians have enough sound sense to understand who stands behind these terroristic acts. In addition, as far as the recent shelling of the bus with Russian frontier guards is concerned I can say that if our people had shot from mortars they would not have missed this target. I assure you. The attackers probably wanted to frighten Russians and to aggravate the tension. INTERFAX: I'd like to return to the subject on negotiations and I'd like to know what was discussed at the second round of the negotiations in Tehran? TURAJONZODA: We were talking only about temporary cease-fire for the period of negotiations and have not started consideration of the agenda yet. We have determined that ceasefire should be kept at least till October 1 but we have failed to adopt any final decision and have not signed any document. INTERFAX: Do you hope that this agreement will be reached? TURAJONZODA: If we did not hope we did not spend time for negotiations and deceived our people. We have hope but we have no conviction. The delegation from Dushanbe asserts that it strives for a cease- fire agreement but it does not want to include the word "temporary" into the document. We believe that such agreements on cease-fire are senseless if they do not lead to a final political settlement of the problem. During the first round of the negotiations in Moscow our delegation proposed to sign an agreement on a temporary mutual cease-fire under observance of certain confidence measures in order to make the negotiations process normal. However, the other side set forth quite unacceptable conditions. Rejecting temporary nature of the agreement, the Dushanbe delegation believes that cease-fire should be observed only by the opposition and only on the state border. As for us, we want to develop a serious document which will be in force throughout the whole territory of the republic but not only within the border zone. In addition, our party persists in creation of a control mechanism to observe this agreement with the involvement of the UN supervisors and introduction of checking posts in hot-spots within the republic as well. We believe that re-deployment of Dushanbe's armed forces and Russian forces should be banned for this period. The main thing is to mutually observe the cease-fire regime. INTERFAX: There are many refugees from Tajikistan in Russia and other CIS countries. What is your assessment of this situation?. TURAJONZODA: The Tajik refugees in the Russian Federation receive practically no aid. And they do not need it. It's quite enough for those Tajiks who live in Moscow and other regions of Russia that nobody makes them return to Tajikistan by force. For example, over the last time the Moscow militia captured refugees and forwarded them to their homeland by train. Can we solve this problem in such a way? These people will not be able to live in Tajikistan, a civil war is being waged there, there are no working places for them and there are many economic difficulties. A forced expulsion of refugees from Russia arouses a negative attitude towards Russians as well as among Afghans especially after the USSR army was waging a war against them for ten years. Sometimes refugees just have no money in order to buy food products and clothes. Their houses have been damaged or seized by other people. Men are forced to go to Afghanistan and to export contraband, drugs and weapons, in order to sell them. They are forced to join various combat formations in order to earn some money.
