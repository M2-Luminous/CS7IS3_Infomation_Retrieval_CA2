The sources said that in its first year of operation, the scholarship program will pay 100,000 yen a month to 100 South Korean students each for up to one year of study at universities in Japan. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will officially announce the program in talks with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam who is scheduled to arrive in Japan for an official visit on March 24. Japan's public and private universities have some 2,700 exchange agreements with foreign universities. One source at the Education Ministry's student exchange division said that of these, 142 are with universities in South Korea, but because of the high cost of living in Japan, only 20 or 30 South Korean students a year study in Japan under existing scholarship programs. As a result, many universities have appealed to the ministry to introduce some form of support for overseas students. During a visit to South Korea in November, Hosokawa promised Kim to expand the Japanese Government's intake of students. The sources said the number of students covered by the scholarships and the countries they come from will be increased from fiscal 1995. Applicants for the scholarships should apply through the university of their choice from July.
