Mamedov, who arrived in Panama on Monday for an official three-day visit, told the press the Cuban Government's decision to invite the opposition to a political dialogue was "very correct." Mamedov, who, today, signed an agreement of understanding and political consultation with Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Mulino, said: "Russia can be very helpful in solving Cuba's problems." Mulino told reporters that Panama "looks favorably on" the position of the Cuban Government, which recently invited approximately 80 groups of exiled Cubans to a meeting to be held in Havana by late April. "We hope all involved parties can attend and the Cubans can attain a Cuban-style solution," he said.
