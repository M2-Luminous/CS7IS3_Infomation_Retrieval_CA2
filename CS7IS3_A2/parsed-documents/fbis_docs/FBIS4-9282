Now that the end of your visit is drawing closer, we can also discuss other more humane issues of interest to all of us. Could you just define tolerance? What is tolerance, in your opinion? [Peres] I defined it in my speech to the forum when I said that, although democracy means the right to be equal, tolerance means the equal right to be different. Tolerance is a relationship with a different person, opinion, and religion. You do not necessarily have to agree with them, but you should always observe them. That is the meaning of tolerance. [Cotruta] What do you think makes people intolerant? What are the roots of this kind of attitude? [Peres] Fear, prejudice, jealousy. Usually, the source of intolerance is fear and uncertainty. People apparently have an element of aggressiveness in themselves. For many good years, aggressiveness manifested itself through wars. In a way, it is now being expressed to a certain extent in sports, on the soccer fields, where confrontations slightly resemble wars. Aggressiveness is also manifest in road traffic; many people will not allow other cars to overtake them. Intolerance is an accumulation of fears and uncertainties. [Cotruta] Do you think that intolerance, this kind of disease -- since it is a disease, although you may not see it burst out on your skin or accompanied by high fever -- do you think this kind of sickness is more present in some regions of the world as compared to others? [Peres] Yes. I think there is a direct relationship between poverty and intolerance. When you are becoming richer, you are also getting richer in tolerance. When you are turning poor, you are becoming more intolerant. Then, it depends very much on cultural development, which has many effects in its own turn. For example, the number of children. We all have smaller families because we want to invest in our children. However, if we are talking about the society of a backward nation, then you note that it relies on many children; you have a high death rate of children, too, with many of them not enjoying the benefits of education. The same applies to the issue of tolerance. The freer, richer, and more secure one is, the more one can afford to be tolerant. The reverse of the coin is intolerance. Then you must realize that there are several forces that give legitimacy to intolerance -- I am basically referring to religions, since once something becomes holy, it ceases to be reasonable. Holiness is above all reason. This also applies to the problem of sacredness, as in the case of Khomeinism or the Inquisition. Then come the various strategies, the fact that people have had to fight wars in order to earn a living. This is also on the point of disappearing. The strategies are outdated, as well as the wars. I do not think the like of this will still happen in the future. But strategies and secret services have always been with us, the same as suspicion, disquietude, and intolerance. Then comes the economic and personal confrontation. The people want to excel each other and, in their endeavors to this end, they sometimes try to minimize or ridicule the others. The causes of all this are as diverse as the human beings themselves. [Cotruta] I would like to return to the Middle East, not politically but spiritually, so to speak. What do you think is the meaning of the Middle East for the rest of the world and for the people living there? What is your viewpoint in this respect? [Peres] We represent a very strange mixture -- the cradle of three religions and the wells of oil. You have the great memories and traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which are represented by huge communities throughout the world. There are 1 billion Catholics in the world, 1 billion Muslims, I do not know exactly how many Protestants, and there is also a small Jewish people. All of them are linked to the area in one way or another. Maybe half of humanity is linked to the Middle East emotionally or religiously. On the other hand, 60 percent of the world's oil resources are in the Middle East. Therefore, if you are religious, you come to the Middle East. If you are a layman, you still must come to the Middle East. The Middle East has filled the pages of history. The Middle East has experienced 30 changes of empires throughout its history. Some 30 different empires have passed through the region and left their impact on the pace and remembered history of mankind. I do not know whether the nature of the Middle East has made that religions should be so exclusivist or that the exclusivism of religion has made the Middle East to be so strained. Nevertheless, it has surely had its effect. There is a very interesting theory belonging to French historian (?Maspereau). He said that there are two kinds of countries -- the mountainous and the flat ones. He said that in a flat country, there are never prophets or revolutionaries, since they do not know where to hide themselves. The people there live together, can see each other, and take their water from the same springs. In mountainous countries, where you can hide well, there are prophets and rebels, revolts and revolutions, as well as ideas. So, from Mount Sinai to the mountains of Judea, the stories were written that gave birth to the wars, revolts, religions, and the prophets. [Cotruta] Your words sound so serene. Nevertheless, I imagine that you have gone through quite a few difficult moments in your career as diplomat. Can you name one? [Peres] I have had so many difficult moments that a single example would not suffice. You know, one experiences crises and disappointments in almost everything. Even in these negotiations, there were at least three moments when I thought we would not pull it off. Then again, we had to overcome those moments and resume the negotiations from the start. [Cotruta] Which was the toughest moment? [Peres] I think the night before we signed the accord in Oslo. My friends told me: You are finished. Everything is over, there is no chance. I talked all night with the people in Tunis. I have been to Sweden with the late Minister Holst, and we were sharing the same room. He was shouting to 'Arafat [on the phone]. During the night, between Sweden and Norway, many people thought that the peace process had failed. [Cotruta] Yesterday you sounded quite optimistic and Mr. 'Arafat, on leaving Bucharest, made a pretty optimistic statement. Can one talk about a moderate optimism? [Peres] For me, it is a permanent optimism. Personally, I do not know how one can go through life with pessimism. Does it help any to be pessimistic? Even here, in Bucharest, when we met the first night, Mr. 'Arafat was not in very good form. We sat until 0230 in the morning trying to examine all matters and find solutions to them. I am glad to say that Chairman 'Arafat left Bucharest with an optimistic feeling about what has been achieved. [Cotruta] You know that in his inaugural speech to the forum, Mr. Carteron [president of the Crans Montana Forum Foundation] said that this meeting in Bucharest is not a haphazard product -- he said that in French. Therefore, it is not accidental that the meeting took place in Bucharest. I mean, many speculations have been made in this respect. [Peres] Obviously, I cannot guess what the organization's president meant by that. [Cotruta] He said the meeting was not accidental. [Peres] I know you are talking about Mr. Carteron, but I do not know what he was alluding to. I know that the organization has made this huge effort to bring me and Mr. 'Arafat together here. It was a difficult task. Romanian diplomacy also had a part in it. I think we wanted to pay our respects to Bucharest and the Romanian diplomacy -- this being another inducement for our coming here. [Cotruta] Are there any other bridges being built between Israel and Romania? [Peres] There are quite a few bridges. The connection between us is natural, so why should we look for new bridges? [Cotruta] Well, that is what I was referring to -- namely the Israelis originating from Romania. [Peres] Yes. [Cotruta] So, they are a bridge. [Peres] Yes, 10 percent of Israel's population originated from Romania and they nurture very warm feelings for Romania -- something that makes Israeli-Romanian relations so special. [Cotruta] Is there anything you dislike in the present stage of Romanian-Israeli relations. [Peres] No, I do not think so. Occasionally, there are some sporadic anti-Semitic outbursts, which is strange because there is practically no important Jewish community left in Romania. What remains of the large Jewish community of Romania is only approximately 16,000 people, the great majority of whom are old people. However, I do not think we have any real problems. [Cotruta] Do you think this problem of anti-Semitism is real nowadays or is it artificially sponsored and maintained? [Peres] Well, it is like a devil and an evil spirit, but it exists in the people's minds and memory. I was never confronted with it personally, but I have met many people who are afraid of this evil spirit. This evil spirit does not exist in reality, but in the composition of human psychology. As far as I am concerned, anti-Semitism is not a Jewish malady but a Gentile one. That is why we find it spread among the non-Jews. I think it is an ugly spot on their own societies. I do not believe that if a strong anti-Semitic trend existed in Romania, it would jeopardize the life of the Jews, because the whole thing is pointless. However, I believe that for a Romania that wants to be free, liberal, respected, and clear, it should prevent the emergence of these ugly phenomena, which are so much linked to the past and have so little to do with the future. [Cotruta] Is this phenomenon more acute in other countries? [Peres] Well, it has different expressions. In Germany, for instance, there is a certain xenophobia. Actually, the German potential of anti-Semitism is directed against the Turks and other foreign workers. It is something crude, ugly, and brutal. We know the Germans are trying to fight this phenomenon. There are certain anti-Semitic manifestations in Russia and many other places. But as I have said, this is not a Jewish malady. [Cotruta] Let us leave the devils aside and turn back to what we might expect and what I believe we should do. What do you think would be the main danger -- or better said, what might jeopardize the peace, which has now become a reality? [Peres] Usually it is the crazy people you should watch. You know, there are crazy people in three countries: Iran, Iraq, and Libya. They are endangering peace and their own nations. However, I believe that less and less people are going to support them, even among the crazies. What can you achieve by war? What is important, you cannot achieve through war, and whatever war can achieve is no longer important. Then comes the cost of war, which is prohibiting, as well as the cost of arms and the damage caused by the war. No one can really engage in a war today. I see war as a cholera, a disappearing disease. It no longer really functions in the modern world. It is no longer a real problem. There are countries that still maintain huge armies but have no enemies. It is so strange to see a country whose army should be poised to fight against an enemy, but the enemy that might justify the size of that army simply does not exist. [Cotruta] I have two more questions. The first one is concerning what we usually call the great powers. You said that many weapons were sold to the Middle East, something that costs a lot of money. All this traffic in arms and money -- does it have anything to do with the great powers or with some people up there wanting to preserve a climate of tension? [Peres] Well, when there was a conflict between the two superpowers, they searched for clients in the Middle East. Many countries in the Middle East thrived on this world conflict. Anyhow, I think this is a good question. Why should a country like Russia or the Soviet Union spend an estimated $180 billion to finance and support various parties in the Middle East in the way of arms, credits, and so forth? The answer is that this confrontation between the two superpowers was not only a strategic and economic one but an ideological one, too. Each ideology -- the democratic one, on the one hand, and the communist ideology, on the other -- wanted to prove that they were able to obtain more support from as many people as possible. It was more an attempt by these great ideologies to conquer the people's hearts rather than their territories. I once read a very interesting article about an American foreign policy expert who made a speech before a group of U.S. businessmen and explained the need for the U.S. program of aid for abroad. He had a very good idea. He told them: Let us assume that I do not work for the State Department but for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Let us also assume that you are not U.S. businessmen but Russian ones. If you are to ask me how we spent the Russian assistance for foreign countries, I would say that we spend it in Egypt. If you asked me how much are we spending there, I would say $6-7 seven billion. In which way? Well, we are supplying arms. What did Egypt do with the weapons? It entered a war. Did it win the war? No. Is there a communist party in Egypt? No, it is in prison. Well, then I would say that we further spent some foreign aid in Indonesia. If they asked me how much, I would say about $2 billion. If they asked me on what, I would say on a stadium. If they asked me why, I would say because [former Indonesian President] Sukarno liked stadiums. If they asked me whether this has made Russia more popular in Indonesia, I would have to give a negative answer. Is there a communist party in Indonesia? No, it is in prison. Then the American dignitary closed his speech by saying the following: Do you know the difference between the United States and Russia? In Russia they do not ask questions. [Cotruta] The last question. You travel a lot. Are you ever homesick? [Peres] The minute I leave my home I am homesick.
