The statement, which was issued by the parties today during a news conference held at the headquarters of the Liberal Party, asked that the world conscience be addressed by sending cables of protest to the member countries of the Security Council to impose economic sanctions on Israel and force it to respect the Palestinians. The statement asked the Islamic Conference Organization to convene an urgent conference in holy Mecca to discuss what the Muslims are being subjected to in Palestine and all other places, especially Bosnia-Herzegovina, and make practical decisions to protect the holy Muslim shrines, especially inside the al-Aqsa Mosque.
