As previously reported, Elatma sank early Monday [4 April] some 80 kilometers off the Dutch coast. All 11 crew were rescued by a Belgian navy helicopter. The freighter was transporting more than 1,300 tons of ammonium nitrate to France. Miniotas quoted the ship's captain as saying that Elatma couldn't have started to take on water because of weather conditions or through technical reasons. The captain said the ship's hull looked as if an explosion took place inside it. Miniotas said the ship's hull was in good shape and was supposed to keep the freighter on float even if water penetrated one of its sections. Elatma also had very modern navigation equipment, he said. The company set up a special commission to investigate the accident and to assess the damage. Elatma, 103 meters long and 12.2 meters wide, now lies around 30 meters deep in a zone where international navigation is very intensive. The ship may have to be raised together with the freight.
