He was referring to numerous victims of the 900-day blockade of the city which was called Leningrad at the time. Some historians say that over a million of city residents died of hunger and cold during the siege. "On this day I could not but stay together with Leningraders. 50 years have passed from the day when heroic efforts of soldiers and Leningraders rebuffed fascists from the city and thus ended the long blockade of Leningrad", the president said. "No other city has lived through the same tragic events in its history which befell on the residents of the city on the Neva River. The Leningrad battle can be compared to the battle for Moscow and under Stalingrad, with the Kursk battle. However, the ordeal which Leningraders had survived cannot be compared to anything", Yeltsin said. "Glory to war veterans who won this victory and eternal memory to those who were killed", the Russian president said and added that he, the government and the whole of Russia will always honour those who had given their lives to secure the great victory.
