C.: The Generals' Offensive] [Text] The reform of the Polish command structures of the armed forces was completed in the middle of last year. It turned out that, in the close-knit command structure, there is room for four civilians (the minister and deputy ministers responsible for education, foreign affairs, and what is called logistics) and only one general, i.e., the chief of the General Staff. Almost all of the institutions that had an influence on the Army, including the military intelligence services, were located in the civilian structures of MON [Ministry of National Defense]. The General Staff became virtually just an executive agency. The generals feel that, at that time, the Army was without leadership during peacetime because it was difficult to regard a civilian as the head, the minister of defense. After the elections in 1993, the new minister of defense, Piotr Kolodziejczyk, suspended the organizational rules drafted by his predecessor, Janusz Onyszkiewicz. A considerable portion of the responsibility for the Army was transferred to the General Staff. At present, it [the General Staff] consists of four main members: the Inspectorate of Training, to which are subordinate, among others, the facilities for combat training, education, and schooling, physical training, as well as the military police forces, and the commanders of the branches of forces; the Logistics Inspectorate; the Department of Strategic Planning; and the Department of Organization-Mobilization. The General Staff also includes the special services, i.e., intelligence and military counterintelligence. At the same time, the jurisdiction of the previously existing civilian department has been curtailed considerably. A portion of the special services has been placed here, however. Those who support Onyszkiewicz's reform think that the chief of the General Staff has been made independent of the minister of defense inasmuch as (under the new disciplinary regulations) he is in charge of all of the servicemen also assigned to the MON structures. For the present, however, there is no legal document that would eliminate the supreme authority of the Minister of National Defense. This may happen in the future when a general (the commander of the Armed Forces) is subordinate to the president alone. Several plans exist for a new supreme command, i.e., the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces. Along with each of them, the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces (before the war, an institution by the same name existed, whose head answered only to the president) will be composed of three inspectorates (ground forces, air forces and air defense, and the navy), as well as the General Staff, with considerably smaller jurisdiction than it has currently.
