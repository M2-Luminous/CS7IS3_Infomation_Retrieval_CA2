Chevalier, spokesman for Panama's Arnulfist Party, PA, by an unidentified reporter at PA campaign headquarters in Panama City on 8 May--recorded] [Text] [Chevalier] I believe Balladares' recent announcement proclaiming victory is a bit premature, because to announce victory with merely half the votes counted is somewhat hasty. I believe there are still half of the votes left to be counted. A runner can still get tired halfway through the race. [Reporter] What can you say about the vote count, which is taking place at the Atlapa Convention Center? [Chevalier] I believe the election has been a demonstration of true democracy. The people have voted freely and elected the winner, but we still do not know who the winner is. [Reporter] What is your opinion on the election process? [Chevalier] It is an irreproachable process. Panama has given the world an example of how an election process should be carried out. The people have voted with a civic spirit, and their decision has been respected so far. [Reporter] Do you believe the PA will triumph in these elections? [Chevalier] What's that? [Reporter] Do you believe the PA will emerge the winner in these elections? [Chevalier] Of course. I have always said the elections were between this country's two largest parties. I have always maintained that the struggle was between the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] and the PA. Certain sectors went around talking about other candidates who I personally believe should not have participated in the elections. The results so far have proven me right.... [Reporter, interrupting] Such as which candidates? [Chevalier] You know perfectly well to whom I am referring. Please do not ask me foolish questions. [laughs] [Reporter] [Words indistinct] ...a reconciliation? [Chevalier] I do not believe.... [pauses] I have always said we can be adversaries but not enemies; these are two different concepts. [Reporter] Don't you believe that with the two parties claiming victory this could lead to violence and intolerance? [Chevalier] I do not believe this could be the case, because we are all willing to accept the final verdict, but the votes must first be counted. I believe it is a bit hasty to proclaim victory in the middle of the race. That is all I wanted to say, and I reiterate it. I believe it is a bit hasty; moreover, the Electoral Tribunal has been stating that candidates should not make victory statements and that they should wait until the National Vote- Counting Board announces who won; therefore, to claim victory halfway through the vote count is comparable to making excuses beforehand.
