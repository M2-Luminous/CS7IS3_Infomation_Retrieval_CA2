The five-day raid was launched on a hideout in the province where lawless activities took place to destroy trees and export logs. Four foreign barges loaded with some 5,000 cubic meters of wood were seized pending a decision by the government in accordance with the law. Chea Peng-chheang, deputy state secretary for economy and finance, told REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA upon his return to Phnom Penh on the afternoon of 25 May that the operation had been successful. There were no clashes or casualties even though the stronghold the operational team raided -- where destructively felled trees were stored for unlawful export -- had previously been inaccessible. The deputy state secretary added: We seized a crane, four barges, and 500 cubic meters of logs suspected of being illegal. A Singapore company called Maxtron, the owner of one of the four seized barges, is angry about the crackdown, arguing that it forgot to bring its authorization along on the barge, and that it had permission and paid taxes for the export of 1,000 cubic meters of wood, including the seized logs. Who would have dared to issue such authorization? Commenting on this issue, Chea Peng-chheang said: We have not yet made any decision on the seizure. It is up to the government to solve this problem. May Sam-oeun, the deputy state secretary for agriculture who also participated in leading the operation, said: The seizure of those barges was correct. The Agriculture Ministry is perfectly entitled to make arrests and seize the means of transportation and logs if the owners do not have authorization. The ban on log exports became effective 1 April 1994. It should be pointed out that the crackdown on illegal logging was launched following a report that the illegal export of logs from Koh Kong Province was continuing, and after a terrifying clash between a combined team that sealed the Sre Ambel pass and a gang protecting the log export merchants. May Sam-oeun added: We achieved complete success this time, unlike the unsuccessful operations we carried out with forestry officials in recent months. Some of those officials, he added, continue to issue log export authorizations to a number of foreign companies in violation of the government's ban on log exports. He did not elaborate on the cause of the first operation's failure. Commenting on the capture of two members of the combined team by the gang protecting the log exporters following a clash on 18 May, Chea Peng-chheang said: These two officials have already been released unharmed by the gang without any preconditions. The primary goal of the 130-member operational team was to crack down on the armed gang that fired at a combined team in Sre Ambel. They all fled before the reinforcement group arrived, however. It is not yet known who the ringleader of the gang is, but there is already a hint about his identity.
