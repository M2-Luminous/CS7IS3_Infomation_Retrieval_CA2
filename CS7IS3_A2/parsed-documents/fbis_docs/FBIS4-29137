Speaking after opening the first ASEAN Insurance Congress at the Shangri-la Hotel in Bangkok yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak stressed the need to draw up a plan aimed at expanding the insurance business in the future. Mr. Suphachai says the plan will call for the issuance of more licenses for operating the business here and for the expansion of equities held by foreigners. At present foreigners are allowed to hold an equity of 25 percent in a local insurance firm. The new plan is likely to allow foreigners to hold 49 percent of the total shares. Mr. Suphachai said ASEAN countries should formulate a joint plan to open their insurance markets. This is to provide a maximum benefit for those who use the service and to minimize effects on the business following the liberalization. He said ASEAN should also open a joint market in some areas to help strengthen the insurance business.
