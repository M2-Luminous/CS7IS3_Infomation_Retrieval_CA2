This was stated by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in a telephone interview with Thursday's edition of the THUERINGER ALLGEMEINE, which is based in Erfurt. Silajdzic thus rejected UN statements that the Serb troops had largely withdrawn from the town. Silajdzic called upon NATO to "take its own ultimatum seriously." The UN should make use of its possibilities for calling air strikes. The Serbs had withdrawn heavy artillery from the 20 km radius around Gorazde, as asked. However, now the same situation was developing as after the ultimatum in Sarajevo, Silajdzic said. "If the movement of these weapons is not stopped, in five to ten days time we will have the same situation in northern Bosnia as we have in Gorazde," the Bosnian prime minister warned. The places around the Posavina area in Bosnia or the towns of Brcko, Maglaj and Konjic were in particular jeopardy.
