According to diplomatic circles, it was acting chairman of the standing committee -- the main CSCE body for holding political consultations -- who proposed to consider the issue at the session. Representatives of 17 countries took part in the discussion on the Crimean issue. According to a Russian delegate, the Russian position in respect of the sovereign republic of Crimea, a constituent part of Ukraine, has not changed. Such legal principles of CSCE, as territorial integrity and inviolability of existing borders, should be observed when trying to settle the problem. It is necessary to exclude resorting to force or threats to resort to forceful methods in attempt to solve emerging political problems. The participants also discussed a draft resolution of the CSCE standing committee and decided to postpone its adoption on Thursday. The draft resolution focusses attention on the role CSCE may play in preventing further aggravation of the conflict in view of the current situation in Crimea and available opportunities for a peaceful settlement of disputable issues.
