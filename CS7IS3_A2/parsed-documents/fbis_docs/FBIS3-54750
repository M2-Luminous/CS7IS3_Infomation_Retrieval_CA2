Speranskiy, independent expert, under the "Parliament" rubric: "A Structure That Will Not Work. A Few Bureaucratic Puzzles"] [Text] "I feel sorry for this parliament" is what one is tempted to exclaim, rephrasing Vereshchagin from "The White Sun of the Desert" [a Russian customs officer from a movie about the civil war set in Central Asia, who keeps saying "I feel sorry for this State"], as one looks at the provisional structure of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly's staff. Under the current Russian Federation Constitution, the parliament's chambers are completely independent of each other in their activity. For unknown reasons, however, the chambers' staffs turned out to be directly subordinated to the chief of staff of the Federal Assembly, and also to his deputies. Also effectively subordinated to the chief of staff are the reception rooms of the Federation Council's and the State Duma's chiefs, along with all staff structures of the Federal Assembly in general. To whom the chief of staff is subordinated and by whom he is appointed, the above structure does not clarify. But this is only half of the trouble. The parliament is completely devoid of analytical services. The staff's entire activity for the most part boils down to purely technical processing of documents. This is what will be the main scope of the Information-Technological Support Administration's activity, which accounts for over half of the staff's personnel -- 272 people. What do the administration's services include? A Department of Document Turnover Support. What is hidden behind this sophisticated name is the old general department, well known from ministers' staffs and other organizations, with those same old functions. A Protocol Department, in charge of the purely technical procedure of registering parliamentary documents. An Information-Technical Department, primarily servicing electronic voting systems. What is the reason for bringing the above departments together, given that both chambers plan to have their own registers of clerical work and their own voting systems? It is not clear. However, there will be yet more unclear matters. The Information-Technological Support Administration is an eclectic mixture of services diverse in their objectives and functions. They include libraries, the editorial- printing department, the department of control and verification, and so forth. Why should they have been brought together under one administration chief? It would be logical to presume that someone needed yet another high-ranking office, and badly so. A faint hint of a semblance of an information-expert service -- the Information-Legal Department, which is part of the same administration -- has only 19 staffers. This is for a Federal Assembly with over 600 deputies. Apparently, the department's work will be as "effective" as that of another division, the International Cooperation Department, designed to provide support for the deputy corps' international contacts, with a staff of 20 people. It is obviously planned that it will be made up only of geniuses. This is unlikely because geniuses have already been absorbed by commercial businesses, but given that the International Cooperation Department is an integral part of the secretariat of the Federal Assembly's chief of staff, it will be able to forge international ties for its chief even at this strength. What will be more difficult, however, is to do so for the deputies. Let us proceed further along the wiring diagram. A Development Administration is to be set up. I wonder what or whom it is going to develop? And so forth. Most important, the total number of the staff's personnel is set at 537 people. There is no need to argue that this is clearly not enough. Apparently, the architects of this structure proceeded from the desire to save as much Russian taxpayers' money as possible by cutting down on the staff. One can recommend yet another method of saving to them -- not to create a staff at all. All the more so because given its numbers and its structure, the staff will be simply unable to give deputies any substantive support in performing their duties provided for in the new Constitution. A deputy has the right to retain three aides, who, according to the concept, must work at a committee on which the deputy is sitting, and, accordingly, in his faction and his district. It is they who will have to conduct the bulk of analytical and other studies. Isn't it too much of a good thing? It is clear that deputies cannot do with this number of aides, especially when they deal with narrowly professional subjects. In our view, it is essential to set up faction staffs and to create secretariats of sorts in committees and commissions with organizational and technical functions, while leaving analytical studies to the factions. It is also necessary to set up specialized research divisions of the entire parliament capable of conducting politically neutral and objective analyses of subjects under discussion. It would also be important to set up deputy commissions supervising the activity of both the chambers' joint staff and the staff of the entire parliament. The above structure is provisional in its very name. I wish its time would pass faster, for, as the ancients used to say, there is nothing more permanent than the temporary.
