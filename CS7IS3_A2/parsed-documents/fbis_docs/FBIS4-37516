Chavan, has said that the Bodoland accord should be implemented in letter and spirit without adversely affecting the interest of any other section. Talking to newspersons last night at Guwahati, Mr. Chavan hoped that the state government will be able to sort out the differences relating to the demarcation of the boundary of the Bodoland Autonomous Council. The home minister said there has been distinct improvement in the law and order situation in Assam. The three-member team of union ministers headed by Mr. Chavan met a number of delegations representing various ethnic groups of Assam and heard their problems. Mr. Chavan earlier said that Pakistan's Inter Service Intelligence, the ISI, had increased its activities in the northeast by operating through various militant organizations. He said much of it is controlled from ISI's Bangladesh bases. He hoped that with the agreement being reached with Bangladesh coordinated actions would be taken soon to end ISI activities. As reported, Bangladesh had agreed to cooperate in halting ISI activities in India. The home minister has since arrived in Arunachal Pradesh's capital Itanagar on a two day visit to the state. He is accompanied by the minister of state for labor, Mr. P.A. Sangma, and the minister of state for personnel, Mrs. Margaret Alwa. The three-member team currently on a four-day visit to some of the northeastern states will meet the state governor, Mr. Prasad; the chief minister, Gegong Apong; and his cabinet colleagues and discuss various issues concerning the state.
