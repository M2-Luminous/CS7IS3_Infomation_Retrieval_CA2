Radio Australia reported that Indonesia pledged to continue aid for Cambodia's national reconstruction. This commitment was made by President Suharto during an official reception hosted in honor of Cambodia's high-ranking delegation headed by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen. At 2020 on the night of 22 June when the two Cambodian prime ministers returned home and landed at Pochentong Airport, they did not answer any questions from the press. Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh merely shouted the word "Success!" many times and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, with broad smiles gave KAOH SANTEPHEAP a thumbs-up in the dark of the night. This word "Success!" clearly showed that Indonesia, a former cochair of the Paris conference seeking peace for Cambodia, certainly has not disavowed its pledge to meet Cambodia's needs. The big boil has broken. In the past, fired by its desire to bring peace to the motherland, the Royal Government consented to lower itself to the same level of the genocidal Khmer Rouge butchers by agreeing to sit at roundtables with them at the behest of his majesty the king. This already was too much of a concession by the Royal Government when it accepted to sit with those who had murdered their own people. Also in the past the people had hoped that the king, the only one who could bring peace to the kingdom, would deliver. However, this hope just fizzled out like salt in water following the two failed "roundtables." On whom would the hope be placed now? Besides the king, no one else can get peace through talks. Now that the king has said he would not propose a third roundtable, nothing remains for us to do. Political analysts stress that there is only one way: to outlaw the Khmer Rouge and turn them into rebels. The symptom has gradually appeared, starting with the official expulsion of the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh before 19 June. The Khmer Rouge office in the walled compound near the royal palace has been pulled out right on time. When they were leaving Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge declared that the only way left for them was to resume fighting. The Khmer Rouge declaration of fighting did not take place only when they were sent packing from Phnom Penh. It has taken place since 1979. The Khmer Rouge have been fighting for 15 years now. It is not true at all that fighting just started after the "roundtable" got "smashed." Nevertheless, while the Royal Government was kicking the Khmer Rouge out of Phnom Penh and was taking a step closer to declaring the Khmer Rouge outlaws, two members of the Royal Government who had never tasted the Khmer Rouge bitter rule before -- namely, Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi -- threatened to resign from their posts. Hey! Hey! This is the big boil that is erupting! The supporters of the Khmer Rouge who massacred over 3 million people have bared themselves as starkly as daylight. This piece of news was broadcast by Radio Australia on 21 June to be picked up by the Voice of America. Political analysts in Cambodia maintained that we should not allow the outlawing of the genocidal Khmer Rouge to become "hostage" of a threat. The Royal Government also should not hesitate in the face of resignation should there really be an offer to resign. This is because in an organic system, when there is "ingestion" there should also be "excretion" for the sake of good health. "Ingestion" without "excretion" can only "harm" your health. The common people do not have greencards. Only Cambodians who experienced the misery of three years eight months and 20 days in the prison without walls know the Khmer Rouge better than the Khmer Rouge, the pro-Khmer Rouge, or certainly the Khmer Rouge partisans. There was not a single family that did not suffer from the killings, the inhuman treatment at the hands of Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan. It is true that over the past 10 years most vestiges of the killing-fields regime have been erased by the common people working in coordination with the former State of Cambodia. Yet, no one can forget it. Some people have claimed that they are clean, love the country, are loyal to the nation, and so on. However, their patriotism, their loyalty always has a price in return. Nevertheless, if anyone wants to thoroughly screen them out, go ahead, do it! Just do not screw things up. According to a KAOH SANTEPHEAP poll, the common people are happy to see the Khmer Rouge declared outlaw rebels because the Khmer Rouge have been rebels since 1979. There should not be any difficulty declaring them as such one more time. It would be better for those who are not happy with the move to outlaw the Khmer Rouge and go live with them in the jungle. But if they love Cambodians, they should have pity for Cambodians by not trying to resurrect the defunct genocidal rule, because the common people are not greencard holders.
