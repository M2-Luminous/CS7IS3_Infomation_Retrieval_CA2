The sides discussed European security, cooperation between Russia and the west, including NATO's "partnership for peace" programme. The president stressed that cooperation between Russia and NATO is of mutual interest and should be carried on with the understanding of Russia's specific features as a great power. Yeltsin expressed hope for the earliest completion of talks and the signing of agreements between Russia and the European Union on Russia's entry into GATT. He also pointed to the need for Russia's full-fledged participation in setting up a new organisation on export controls after COCOM ended its functions. In connection with the question on the situation in the Crimea, which was raised by Hurd, Yeltsin confirmed Russia's known position on this issue: The Crimea's problems should be settled between Kiev and Simferopol through negotiations, in line with the principles of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, without the use of force. The sides also examined in detail the state of Russian-British relations, noting that contacts between the two countries are being exercised at an unprecedentedly high level. Hurd conveyed a message to Yeltsin from Queen Elizabeth II where her majesty accepts an earlier invitation to make history's first official visit to Russia in autumn 1994.
