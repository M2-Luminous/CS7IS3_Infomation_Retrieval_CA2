The program's announcer, Nikolay Svanidze, addresses two main issues relating to the government reshuffle: Will an additional first deputy prime minister be appointed alongside Oleg Soskovets? Who will be appointed to the key post of finance minister? In the studio with Svanidze is one of the main candidates for the post of finance minister, Vladimir Ivanovich Shcherbakov, chairman of the Council of Directors and president of the Interprivatizatsiya Foundation. When asked by Svanidze about a possible nomination as finance minister, Shcherbakov says, "I hope I am not appearing here as a candidate for the ministerial post. That is of little interest to me. Speaking seriously about the finance minister post, it is no accident that the name Valentin Pavlov is mentioned. What is needed today is a man who can say yes or no pretty firmly, and who can stick with it. I had a fairly lengthy talk today with Boris Fedorov. My point of view is this: He should stay in his post, that was what we were talking about." Svanidze then asks Shcherbakov if he has persuaded Fedorov to stay on. "Well, yes, that was chiefly what we were talking about," says Shcherbakov. On the unification of Belarus and Russian currencies, Shcherbakov says that the accord signed was more of a strategic pointer than a practical document to be implemented urgently. The accord was drawn up by the Central Bank, which is legally responsible for regulating currency circulation, though it was previously not the case, Shcherbakov says, for one government department to draw up such accords. Asked whether the finance ministry was bypassed on the decision, Shcherbakov says he cannot comment on the situation, which he regards as "the internal affair of the government". Regarding inflation, Shcherbakov makes the proviso that "I would not wish my words to be taken as being any claim to becoming the finance minister," and says that he agrees with Chernomyrdin. "Chernomyrdin was right when he said that monetarist methods must be augmented by an arsenal of other methods. I believe that is the right way to put it. First and foremost, legislative measures: We must curb inflation using legislative methods, and by further improving the laws governing economic activity. Second, organizational measures: namely, for instance, the transport infrastructure does not work; the payment infrastructure does not work. We have simply stopped payments, but not for economic reasons, rather for political and organizational reasons." Shcherbakov concludes that he is profoundly convinced that "inflation is engendered by the non-market structure of our economy."
