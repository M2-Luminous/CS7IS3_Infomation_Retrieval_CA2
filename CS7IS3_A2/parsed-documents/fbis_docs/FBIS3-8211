Michael Rose, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, had talks in Sarajevo today. The two commanders discussed the dynamism of the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, signed between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] transition from a war to a peace situation in the city of Sarajevo, as well as possibilities of UN representatives entering Maglaj. Gen. Rose was optimistic in assessing the activity so far in the realization of the HVO-Bosnia-Herzegovina Army agreement, which he could see for himself during his visits to Old Vitez, Gornji Vakuf, and other parts of central Bosnia in the past few days. He pointed out the problems of implementing the agreement in the city of Sarajevo, where he expects a great deal of work in the near future. The Army and civil authorities are expected to make their contribution to this in cooperation with the UNPROFOR. Army Gen. Delic said that Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units and commands were ready to carry out all the tasks laid down by the peace agreement with the HVO. The agreement is being implemented with success on the ground and there is room for optimism, said Army Gen. Delic. As for the opening of Dubrave airport near Tuzla, the stands of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the state leadership are quite clear. We insist that the airport be opened, but I do not accept any Serb conditions regarding its opening. This is our free territory and there can be no discussion about the territory, which our army has liberated, stressed Army Gen. Delic at the end of the talks today.
