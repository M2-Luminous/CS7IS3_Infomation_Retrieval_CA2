A municipal situation characterized by a developed economy, political stability, social progress, stability, and unity has further been consolidated and developed. Gao Dezhan and Zhang Lichang pointed out: The second season is an important key period as well as a golden season. Therefore, we must accelerate the progress of the work in all aspects, ensure that the semi-annual goals are exceeded by the end of the second quarter, also strive to fulfill the tasks in a faster and better way, and lay a solid foundation for comprehensively fulfilling the annual tasks. Gao Dezhan stressed in his speech that we should profoundly understand the work situation of the whole party, upgrade the awareness of going into action under the overall situation, and positively and comprehensively promote the work in all aspects under this overall situation. To this end, he set forth four requirements: First, we must ceaselessly deepen our understanding to clearly understand and be submitted to the overall situation. We should firmly foster the idea about the overall situation, further enhance the awareness of grasping the favorable opportunities, and persist in the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. Second, there must be new ideas and methods for development. We should actually shift the focus of economic construction onto the orbit of relying on scientific and technological progress, upgrading the quality of laborers, and increasing economic results as well as the orbit of relying on science and technology to make development so as to maintain sustained, fast, and sound development of the national economy. Third, we should accurately handle the relations among reform, development, and stability. We should further foster the ideology of relying on reform to promote development and concentrate greater energy on deepening reform. Simultaneously, we should regard the maintenance of stability as a great matter relating to the overall situation and realistically attend to it. Fourth, we should persist in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough" and ensure faster economic development and comprehensive social progress. Gao Dezhan pointed out: To develop the work in all aspects in a faster and better manner in the new situation, the leading cadres at various levels must further grasp the major tasks as follows: First, closely in line with the overall party work situation, we should unswervingly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should conscientiously study original works and systematically conduct the study on special topics on the basis of thoroughly reading the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." Persistently according to the principle of linking theory with practice, we should ensure that we apply and arm our heads with what we have studied and use what we have studied to guide and promote our work. Meanwhile, we should organize the broad masses of cadres to deeply study the theory on and the basic knowledge of the socialist market economy. Second, we should conscientiously carry out the system of responsibility for the fulfillment of the fixed tasks to ensure the fulfillment of all tasks. According to the requirements for reality, firmness, and perfectness, we should divide tasks and assign them to individuals. We should strive to make the targets more advanced and to integrate contents of the targets further, embody the overall work situation and general work levels, strictly make assessment, and ensure both reward and penalization. We should improve, as soon as possible, where we lagged behind in the first quarter of the year. We should strengthen mid-term promotion and pay firm attention to supervision, examination, and implementation. Third, we should realistically improve our work style and exert efforts to firmly grasp the fulfillment of the tasks. Recently, the central leading comrades made a series of important instructions on improving the work style which hit the mark and are to the point. We must implement the instructions one by one. By summing up the work done in the first quarter, the leading bodies at various levels should conscientiously examine the existing problems in work style. Some of them should especially convene democratic meetings to solve the problems in this aspect. We should emphasize "working solidly," telling the truth, think out real methods, do concrete deeds, and seek real efficiency. Fourth, we should further change the government functions and try every possible means to do solid deeds for enterprises. On the basis of persistently doing concrete deeds for the people, this year, in changing the government functions, we should focus our efforts on trying every possible means to do concrete deeds for enterprises. To do solid deeds for enterprises, we should have initiative, be concerned with and cherish enterprises, and regard the things of enterprises as our own. All departments should regard the difficulties and problems reflected by the enterprises as a key task that should first be handled for enterprises. Gao Dezhan urged that the leading cadres at various levels should have a good mental state and a solid work style, guide the broad masses of cadres and people in the municipality, work with one heart and soul in an arduous manner, and strive to comprehensively fulfill all targets and tasks of this year and make key breakthroughs and development in all work.
