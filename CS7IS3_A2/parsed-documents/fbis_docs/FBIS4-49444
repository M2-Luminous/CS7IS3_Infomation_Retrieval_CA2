This is an important content of the anticorruption struggle and is also a means of removing obstacles to reform and opening to the outside world. The circular said: Yao Guitao, former secretary of the party committee of Xinjing Township in Changning District (member of the district party committee) and chairman of the board of directors of the Shanghai Meilian Real Estate Development and Enterprising Company, and Ju Peijin, former vice president of the Shanghai Municipal Gas Company and deputy chairman of the broad of directors of the Shanghai Meilian Real Estate Development and Enterprising Company, unscrupulously accepted bribes in the first half of 1993 when they participated in a joint real estate development project with foreign businessmen. It has been verified by a preliminary investigation that Yao Guitao accepted a bribe of over 300,000 yuan, and Ju Peijin accepted over 400,000 yuan. Their acts have caused serious losses to state and collective interests. With the approval of the municipal party committee, the Changning District Party Committee, the district government, and the municipal public utilities bureau decided to expell Yao Guitao and Ju Peijin from the party and remove them from their posts. The circular pointed out: Our cadres wield some power because they bear the responsibility for reform, opening to the outside world, and economic development. This being so, some lawbreakers have often made use of the party's cadres in achieving their objectives. All cadres should maintain a high degree of vigilance against this. In the new historical condition, every communist party member is faced with the serious challenge of fighting against being corroded. This challenge is in no way second to the life-and- death test during the war years. Promoting the healthy development of the socialist market economy by proceeding from the interests of the people and observing honesty and self-discipline -- this constitutes one of the codes of conduct all party member cadres must follow in the new period. If they go against this norm, they will harm the fundamental interests of the state and people. If they don't promptly check this trend but allow it to develop, it is possible that they will violate law and discipline and even commit crime. Party member cadres must guard against money temptation, discipline themselves, remain honest, and be able to withstand the test of reform, opening to the outside world, and of being part of the ruling party.
