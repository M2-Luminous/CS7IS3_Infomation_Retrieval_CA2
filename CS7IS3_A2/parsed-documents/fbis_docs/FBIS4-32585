Economic-policy experts of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] and SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] have said repeatedly that the KRP ought to be suspended. The AVU [State Property Agency] has not adopted any new decision for the time being, but preparations for the stock issues of Global T.H. and Pannonia Hotels, respectively, have slowed down. However, there have been also technical problems at the latter firm. Officials at the AVU nevertheless believe that, sooner or later, there will be stock issues by both Global and Pannonia Hotels, even if the new government suspends the KRP. At worst in that case, the issues will not take place within the framework of the KRP. The officials deem it important that privatization through the stock exchange be retained in the armory of privatization tools. As one official put it, that strengthens the stock market, and the stock market in its turn strengthens privatization. Many foreign investors, particularly financial investors, are willing to invest only in firms that are listed on the stock exchange.
