After this, Boris Yeltsin noted, "I will not meet with Nixon, and neither the government nor Filatov will receive him." [passage omitted] Let us try to examine what is happening through the eyes of Moscow officials. Were the amendments which Viktor Chernomyrdin and the Russian Federation president himself caused to be made to Nixon's program evidence of nascent "Great Russian pride"? Maybe, we have become more discriminating and will not now simply rush off and welcome with open arms both overt and covert emissaries from the across the ocean? There is no disputing that not all politicians like sharing the stage with Zhirinovskiy and his crew. But in that case we are still showing the same political clumsiness through which we are constantly causing blunders in our relations with the United States. We have clearly chosen the wrong time and place to show our dissatisfaction. The opposition is something sacred in a democracy, and it would be bad form to snub some well-known person on a well-known mission -- unorthodox though it may be to us -- for the sole reason that Washington has woken up to the fact that it had gotten a fixation with its favorite political figures and has decided to broaden its official appointments book.
