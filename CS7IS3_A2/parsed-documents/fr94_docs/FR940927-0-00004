FR940927-0-00004 FR940927-0-00001 Although the sales closing dates normally will be the same as the cancellation and termination dates this is not always the case. Therefore, the sales closing dates will not be included in the crop provisions. Federal regulations authorize the Manager of FCIC to extend the sales closing date in any county upon the Manager's determination that no adverse selection will result during the extended period. The extended date is placed on file in the applicable service offices and a notice is placed in the Federal Register. If the sales closing dates were contained in the crop provisions, the crop provisions would need to be amended each time a sales closing date is extended. Comment: One comment stated that unit division language contained in subsection 2.(b) should allow for situations in which the insured creates a discernible break via some tillage operation. The proposed provision states that the insured must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each optional unit. There is no required method of creating a boundary as long as a discernible break is provided. Response: The intent of the policy language is to allow separate optional units if acreage is farmed separately. Farming separately includes planting separately and keeping separate records of inputs, production, etc. Creating a boundary after the crop is planted by means of a tillage operation along a section line may or may not meet the policy requirement of planting the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break at the units boundary. FCIC believes the present language clearly sets out the requirements for unit division. Comment: Two comments were received regarding the changes in the cancellation and termination dates. (1) One comment stated the assumption that since cancellation and termination dates were changed, that the sales closing dates will be changed to align with the new cancellation and termination dates. (2) One comment expressed the concern that an earlier cancellation date would decrease the amount of time available for producers to make decisions regarding their insurance coverage. Response: The sales closing dates, as contained in the Special Provisions, will be changed generally to be the same as, but no later than, the new cancellation and termination dates. Earlier cancellation and sales closing dates are intended to reduce the possibility that a producer's decision to cancel or purchase insurance is based on favorable or unfavorable growing conditions. FCIC expects this change to have favorable impact on insurance experience. Favorable results will be considered when calculating future premium rates. Comment: One comment stated that section 6 (Insured Crop) indicates that colored cotton will be insurable under the cotton crop provisions. However, the introductory information in the Federal Register indicates the FCIC Regional Service Offices will issue production guarantees for colored cotton via written agreement until adequate actual production history is available for individual policyholders. The comment recommended that language to this effect be added to the policy, either in section 3 of the crop provisions or in the special provisions. The comment asked if the Crop Insurance Handbook will be revised to state that insureds must keep production history separate for colored cotton, what constitutes ``adequate production history,'' and what information must be sent in with the request for a written agreement. Response: FCIC's research indicates that the production potential for some colored cottons is significantly less than white upland cotton and that the value may be significantly higher. Insufficient data are currently available to establish production guarantees, prices, quality adjustment methods, etc. for colored cottons. Because data are insufficient, FCIC believes that colored cotton should be insurable only with a written agreement. Therefore, the provisions in section 6 (Insured Crop) have been changed accordingly. When requesting a written agreement, the insured should submit any available production history, the number of acres intended for planting in the current crop year, and other information normally required when requesting insurance for an uninsurable crop type. The Crop Insurance Handbook will be revised to indicate specific requirements as soon as it is practical to do so.
