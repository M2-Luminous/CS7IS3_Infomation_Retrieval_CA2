At one end of the spectrum, we have the Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, who under the benediction of Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, would like India to dispose of its economic assets to go global, because the present government has nothing to show on the credit side of its achievements. Then, there are "Swadeshiwalas" who have time and again expressed their reservations on the Congress Government's present economic policy in many spheres. The third force in operation is what is called the "Bombay enclave" of industrialists, who through the FICCI [Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry] have demanding for a "level playing ground," and express fears about opening up the economy without due safeguards for indigenous sector. On the political plane, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has let its support to this demand by stressing the need to strengthen Indian business before exposing it to external competition. The party has also called for restricting the entry of foreign multinationals to core sectors of the economy. A rather crude formulation against multinationalism has come from the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (organization of service to the nation)] in the form of the slogan of swadeshi and the call to boycott consumer products of foreign-dominated companies. The attack on the office of the British agri-business giant, Cargill in Karnataka by an incensed gang some time ago and the company's recent withdrawal from the export-oriented industrial salt project in Kandla in the face of a vociferous campaign are the other unsavoury manifestations of anti-multinationalism. No wonder, former Industry Minister George Fernades finds the setting right for his crusade against some of the multinationals. This built-up against multinationalism and external liberalisation needs to be taken serious note of in order to stem the misgivings that seem to be gaining ground. In particular, what is needed is a clear understanding of what needs to be done at the policy level in dispel genuine fears of industry. While build-up against multinationalism and external liberalisation needs to be taken serious note of in order to stem the misgivings that seem to be gaining ground. In particular, what is needed is a clear understanding of what needs to be done at the policy level to dispel genuine fears of industry. While industry leaders continue to support external liberalisation, they have put forth certain specific demands. These include a correction in the existing "inverted" duty structure under which the import duty on finished products is higher than that on capital goods, raw materials and intermediates; further lowering of interest rates to bring them down to international levels; removal of restrictions on inter-corporate investments; permission to borrow against shares; and permission to issue non-voting shares. The basic idea is to enable Indian industry to grow in size, to be able to compete against foreign multinationals and to protect Indian promoters against possible takeover bids by foreign moneybags. The government would do well to look into these demands and take necessary steps, not only to reassure Indian industry but also to blunt the edge of much of the criticism at the political level. So far as imports are concerned, there is definitely a case for adjusting the tariffs in such a way that finished products attract a higher duty than the related capital goods and intermediates. The inverted tariff structure is against all tenets of good taxation. But short-term revenue considerations have held the Finance Ministry back from correcting this aberration. The perceived strength of the Indian capital goods industry provided the Finance Ministry the argument for reducing the import duty on such goods. But there is no justification for subjecting the industry to unfair competition. If despite the inverted tariff structure, capital goods imports have not risen so far, it is partly because of the high cost of imports after the devaluation of the rupee. In this sense, the Indian capital goods industry still enjoys a certain measure of protection. But the lower imports of capital goods are also attributable to lower government investments and the slow pace of foreign investment. The crunch will come when foreign investors bring in their own capital goods in the form of equity to compete against indigenous suppliers. It is, therefore, hoped that the necessary correction in the present tariff structure will be made in the forthcoming budget. As regards interest rates, again, industry's demand is unexceptionable. Although the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has brought down the lending rates by 4 percentage points since October last year through piecemeal reductions, the present rates are still almost double the average international level. Industry needs bank credit to meet its working capital requirements and to enhance its capacity utilisation. The RBI Governor recently stated that there would be no further reduction in the lending rates for some time. This is far from what industry had expected. The RBI and the Finance Ministry are unduly paranoid about a sharp cut in lending rates. Their fears about inflation getting worse on this account do not reckon with the deflationary impact of increased capacity utilisation. Nor are their apprehensions about bank deposits coming down as a result of the concomitant cut in lending rates well-founded. Even if bank despite come down for a while and the money flows into other channels, it will eventually come back to the banks. As it is, the spread between deposit and lending rates in India is too large. If despite this, some of the banks are not making enough profits or are in the red, it is because of their inefficiency. Therefore, what is needed is expeditious action to carry out the overdue financial sector reforms. Putting off further cuts in lending rates sends out wrong signals about the government's commitment to these reforms. Provisions for inter-corporate investments as well as amalgamations have to be liberalised to enable Indian companies acquire the requisite muscle to face the competition from foreign multinational majors. In fact, it is time to promote some of our own multinationals. There are several companies in both private and public sectors which have the capacity to assume this role but are hamstrung because of government restrictions. For instance, the public sector BHEL [Bharat Heavy Electricals, Limited] can go truly global, provided it is allowed to raise money abroad or float its own finance company. We have to go a long way in revitalising the public sector which accounts for a major chunk of industrial investment. Lowering of tariff and non-tariff import barriers and free inflow of foreign direct investment and technology form an essential part of the globalisation exercise. But in order that globalisation works to the country's advantage, a series of steps are necessary to enhance the competitive edge of the Indian economy. Foremost, we have to strengthen our production base. And this is saying a lot. For, all impediments in the way of efficient production have to be removed. But the real test of the globalisation strategy will lie in the country's export capability. Apart from a strong production base, cost competitiveness and quality, what is imperative is a complete reorientation of production and marketing operations. The old concept of market coinciding with national boundaries has to give way to a new one. In today's context, market is where demand is -- whether at home or abroad. Hundred per cent export units or EPZs [Export Processing Zones] have lost much of their relevance. Export capability has to permeate the entire economy.
