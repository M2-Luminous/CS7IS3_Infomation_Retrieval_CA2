One of the most important problems arising in chemical precipitation from the vapor phase is the selection of volatile compounds which may be converted into the vapor phase and recondensed without change in composition. Low polarity compounds having a covalent bond between the metal atom and the ligand are the most volatile. The molecules of the complex must not interact with each other or with other compounds. Metal complexes with _b_-diketones are frequently used as starting materials having acceptable volatility to form fine superconducting films from the vapor phase. In the present work a study was made of the effect the structure of the ligand and the nature of the metal have on the volatility of the complexes used to prepare superconductor films having the composition Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O by using the CVD method. Values are presented on the thermodynamic characteristics of vaporization of the above compounds, their heat and temperature of sublimation, and conditions for thermal decomposition and storage.
