Mr. Wang said that the serious shortage of investment in geological prospecting had resulted in known mineral deposits not being able to meet the country's needs. Of 45 proven main mineral resources, 12 will be in short supply within this century and half of the 45 mineral deposits will not keep pace with the demands of economic development in the 21st century. Meanwhile, investment in mineral production was falling, taking inflation into account, by 10.3 percent annually, resulting in a half-closure of one-third of geological prospecting teams, with their salaries and living standard falling to below the average level in the country. Four such teams in Guangdong which had made a great contribution to geological work were living in poverty, and similar workers in Qinghai Province working on the plateau area for dozens of years where oxygen is thin continued to live in bad housing conditions, with their children unable to find work and 175 households, of whom had a per capita income for their daily expenses of less than RMB 35 [renminbi] monthly. [sentence as received] Such situations had caused many talented people to move out of the sector. The mismanagement of mineral deposits was serious resulting in environmental pollution, and the safety of workers and public order had also been affected. Mr. Wang called for more attention to be given to geological work to meet the needs of China's economic development. The caring for the country's natural resources should, like the control of population and protection of the ecology, be seen as a fundamental national policy.
