Kim Chin-sok has this report: [Begin Kim Chin-sok recording] A draft of the UN Security Council resolution for imposing sanctions, which the U.S. Government has worked out, was obtained today by our government. One high-ranking government official disclosed: We obtained a draft of the resolution for imposing sanctions against the North-- which has been approved by U.S. President Clinton--through the ROK Embassy in the United States this afternoon and have begun examining it. According to the official, the content of the draft follows: First, there will be a one-month grace period before the imposition of sanctions. This means sanctions will be imposed unless there is a report that relations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] have been completely restored within a month. Next, sanctions will be imposed in such a way to ban exports of all kinds of weapons to North Korea, in addition to halting UN economic, technological, and cultural aid. This draft is more intense than has been reported by foreign news reports. In addition, Russia's proposal to hold an international conference will be followed if the IAEA reports to the UN Security Council that North Korea has agreed to completely cooperate with the IAEA. This means that the proposal is not a precondition to the imposition of sanctions. Copies of this draft were also distributed today to China, Russia, Britain, and France--permanent members of the UN Security Council--as well as to our government. The government official explained that since the draft was worked out, the United States has already had close consultations with our government, and sent a copy of this draft to us on a top priority basis. Of course, there is the possibility that the content of this draft will be revised to a considerable extent, depending upon consultations between the United States and the countries concerned, particularly China and Russia. The government's policy is to make all diplomatic efforts to ensure our position is fully reflected in this process. [end recording]
