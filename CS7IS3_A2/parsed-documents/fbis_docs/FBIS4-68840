This alarming and threatening word burst into our lives during the summer of 1989. It was at this time that the Kuznets Basin miners, driven to despair, revealed to the dissatisfied authorities the true meaning of the term worker solidarity. Over the past five years, millions of workers in dozens of branches participated in strikes as an extreme measure of protest in the struggle for their rights. They gradually became a common social phenomenon throughout the expanses of Russia and the CIS, a phenomenon which, unfortunately, is increasing in scale. An unprecedented "strike flare-up" was recorded by the Russian Federation Goskomstat [State Statistical Committee] during the first quarter of this year: these strikes involved 288 enterprises, or 24 more than during all of 1993. The statistical table included herein enables a reader to determine for himself the degree to which strike activity has increased (data for the first quarter of 1993 and 1994). Number of Number of Losses in enterprises that participants, working time, participated in thousands of people, thousands of strikes, 1993, 1994 1993, 1994 man-days, 1993, 1994 Overall 29 288 18.2 114.5 34.2 283.1 Industry 28 137 17.9 87.4 33.2 168.6 Including: Fuel 27 135 17.5 87.0 30.3 167.1 Education - 137 - 24.7 - 107.2 Construction - 7 - 1.3 - 4.7 Transport and 1 4 0.3 0.7 1.0 2.0 Communications Other branches - 3 - 0.4 - 0.6 There is no need for commenting upon these figures, since they speak for themselves. Compared to the first quarter of last year, the number of strikes increased by a factor of 10.3! According to data provided by Mintrud [Ministry of Labor], the indicators for labor conflicts and disputes are even more striking. Since the beginning of the year, they have been recorded at 1,356 enterprises, organizations and institutions throughout Russia. As for losses, so far this year, as a result of strikes (not counting enterprise idle time caused by other factors), the output of the fuel-energy complex declined by 8.8 billion rubles' worth of product. As a result of deliberate cessation of operations, 88 enterprises failed to deliver more than 3.5 billion rubles' worth of contracted goods. The greatest losses from strikes occurred in the Komi Republic, western Siberia and in Kemerovo, Tula and Tostov oblasts. The principal causes of these strikes and labor conflicts are well known: decline in production volumes, financial crisis, non-payments in mutual accounts, and particularly -- considerable indebtedness of the federal budget and numerous delays in wage payments for workers in the "basic" branches. According to data furnished by the General Trade Union Conference, the overall wage indebtedness for the CIS on the whole, for the month of March, amounted to approximately three trillion rubles. In Russia alone, the workers at 35,000 enterprises failed to receive the money for their labor in a timely manner. It must be assumed that, following numerous meetings between Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and representatives of striking organizations, the government is striving if not to eliminate entirely then at least slow down those processes which promote strikes. It was by no means an accident that, on 11 February, Viktor Stepanovich, during a meeting with miners, stated directly: wage indebtedness will be eliminated gradually (and this is being accomplished -- V.L.). And he added: "The question of whether or not to strike does not disturb me. The problem lies in the fact that we are unable to handle correctly that which is at our disposal." It is hoped that this time the government will keep its word and strive to suppress the wave of strikes using economic measures. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that the severity of the strike movement (with varying degrees of activity depending upon the branch involved) will continue in the immediate future. This is so, owing to the fact that the problems being resolved will be replaced by other equally alarming problems. For example, one such problem among miners is the threat of unemployment: the closing down of exhausted and unprofitable mines, with no new jobs being created. Moreover, work is simply dangerous at a number of mines: the equipment is worn out to an extreme and the prices for new items of equipment are ruinous. Funds are simply not available for maintaining the mines in safe operating condition. Hence we are encountering one tragedy after another involving human victims. Yes, miners are perishing owing to intolerable working conditions and neglect of the basic safety requirements. In Moscow Oblast alone, 48 individuals perished at their working positions over a period of three months -- considerably more than the figure for last year. Not only the government, but also all authoritative structures in Russia should recall one basic truth: a strike is not waged against the good life. The main question is how life can be changed for the better in a more rapid, effective and realistic manner.
