Political sources in Russia believe the message President Boris Yeltsin sent last month to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad prior to his summit with the U.S. President in Geneva contributed to the moderation displayed by the Syrian president. Officials in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told an Israeli Foreign Ministry delegation, which was in Moscow last week to hold political talks, that they share the assessment that the progress made in the Middle East peace process was irreversible but hard to accelerate. The Russians believe there has been a positive change in al-Asad's positions, which was reflected in his statements in Geneva, but would not say whether they thought al-Asad would agree to a full normalization in relations with Israel in the context of a peace settlement. Neither would they reveal the contents of Yeltsin's message to al-Asad. [passage omitted] The Israelis were impressed that the Middle East is important to Russia because of its proximity to its borders and the threat of instability there. The Russians stressed their role as cosponsors of the peace process alongside the Americans, and came out in favor of upholding the format of the Madrid process. The Russians are worried by Muslim fundamentalism and fear it might spread to the Central Asian republics and Muslim regions in Russia. They agreed with the Israeli assessment that this fundamentalism can hardly be curbed if the economic and social situation in the Muslim countries does not improve. The Israelis voiced their concern about the sale of Russian arms to the Middle East. The Russians said the Arab countries still owe them large sums of money for weapons supplied in the past. The bilateral agreements on cultural and economic cooperation whose signing has been held up for about a year were discussed in the talks. The Russians are opposed to the Israeli demand to note in the agreement that the joint committees will meet alternately in Moscow and in Jerusalem, and argue that in their capacity as cosponsors of the peace process they cannot sign an agreement that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Israeli officials believe a formula will soon be found to settle the argument and proceed to sign the agreements. In a meeting with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last weekend, Aleksandr Bovin, Russia's ambassador in Israel, noted the need to accelerate the signing of the bilateral agreements. The Foreign Ministry delegation went to Russia to exchange views and assessments about the situation in the Middle East and the CIS, in keeping with the cooperation agreement the two ministries signed about a year ago. The Israeli delegation consisted of Yo'el Sher, assistant director general in charge of the Eastern Europe Department; Yo'av Biran, assistant director general in charge of peace affairs; Uri Bar-Ner, assistant director general in charge of the Cultural and Scientific Department; Meron Gordon, director of the Eastern Europe 1 Division; and representatives of the Center for Political Research and the Political Planning Department. The political meetings were also attended by Hayim Bar-Lev, Israel's ambassador in Moscow, Councillor Alex Ben-Tzvi, and other embassy staffers. The Israelis conferred with two deputies of the Russian foreign minister, officials in the Middle East Department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; with Yegor Gaydar, a former deputy prime minister and the current leader of the Reformist Party; and with Yegor Lukin, chairman of the Russian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. The delegation also toured academic research institutes dealing with the Middle East. The Israeli Foreign Ministry gave a positive grade to the visit, which reflected the openness and normalizations in relations with Russia.
