But Then It May Not"] [Text] The Supreme Council of Ukraine has obligated the Crimean parliament to bring the Constitution of the peninsula into compliance with the Ukrainian Constitution currently in effect. At first sight, this was quite a logical step, especially if we recall that the federal authorities of Russia have also repeatedly taken care of compliance by the constitutions of republics belonging to the Russian Federation with the Main Law of the country. However, to this day there are many nonconforming constitutions in Russia. As a rule, in Moscow they pay particular attention to articles in the constitutions of the republics that are openly disloyal to the center and try to ignore the still more nonconforming articles in the constitutions of Federation components that are friendly to Moscow. Just one republic belongs to Ukraine, and for as long as it was led by Nikolay Bagrov, the Supreme Council in Kiev did not strive to work on the constitutional problems of the Crimea, probably proceeding from the same Russian rule--loyalty in exchange for legality. The situation has changed following the victory of Yuriy Meshkov in presidential elections in the Crimea, and the gun Bagrov has loaded may now very well be fired in the hands of the new Crimean president. Nonetheless, the Constitution of Crimea does not contradict the current Ukrainian Constitution so seriously as for strict compliance with its norms to be really able to bring about some kind of explosive consequences in relations between Ukraine and the Crimea. In passing their decree, the members of parliament probably proceeded from a certain outlook, just as they did when they offered President Leonid Kravchuk new powers in keeping with which he now has the right to cancel by his decisions all unconstitutional decrees of the Crimean authorities. First, the already adopted Constitution of the Crimea could fail to conform to the new Constitution of Ukraine, which is being worked on. In this case, the Crimean parliamentarians will have to turn to their Main Law yet again, of course, if they follow recommendations from Kiev right now. Second, the Supreme Council of Crimea, like the Supreme Council of Ukraine, is living out its last days, and not even months. The members of parliament from Kiev counted on boosting their preelection ratings by this decree (many of them are running for the new Supreme Council, too), whereas following the commandments from Kiev will hardly be helpful to the Crimean parliamentarians. However, Kiev has given the deputies of the Supreme Council of the Crimea a good opportunity to restrict the powers of the Crimean president, whom the Supreme Council intensely dislikes, while it is still possible. The defeated "party of power" in the Crimea may very well take advantage of the legal base proposed by Kiev in order to make presidential powers not so wide by far--after all, they were written up for Nikolay Bagrov, and not at all for Yuriy Meshkov. However, the Crimean parliamentarians will hardly go for this open confrontation with the new president precisely because the Supreme Council of Crimea does not have much time to work. The opportunity to comply with the decision of Kiev may come to the fore only in the event that the "party of power," which was defeated in the presidential elections, wins a rematch during the parliamentary elections and looks for a pretext to consolidate its power and restrict the power of the president. In that case, the decree of Kiev might come in very handy. It may be that the Constitution will be amended without any regard for the decree, simply in keeping with the wishes of the new parliamentarians. However, it becomes clear from the results of the presidential elections in the Republic of Crimea and a public opinion poll that forces supporting Yuriy Meshkov and a number of figures subscribing to political views that are similar to his have a chance to win the elections to the Supreme Council of Crimea, too. This kind of new parliament will hardly pay any attention at all to the decrees of the parliament in Kiev.
