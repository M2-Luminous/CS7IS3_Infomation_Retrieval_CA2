FBIS4-53240 "dreas096_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 North Korea ROK Repression of Students' Struggle Denounced ROK Repression of Students' Struggle Denounced SK1705045894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0440 GMT 17 May 94 SK1705045894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- Yi Yong-tok, puppet prime minister of South Korea, cried for a strict "security measure" against the struggle of students, branding it as "illegal violence", according to a radio report from Seoul. This is a repressive order to strangulate the struggle of students by frantically wielding the fascist club. The struggle of the South Korean people and students for independence, democracy and reunification, an inevitable result caused by the colonial fascist rule, cannot be "illegal violence" in any case but it is a just struggle worthy to be praised. Yi Yong-tok's cry for ruthless crackdown on this struggle is an unpardonable criminal act becoming only to the fascist murderer. It is all the more ludicrous that Yi blared "violent demonstration is unjustifiable after the establishment of the civilian `government'." It is a complete distortion of the reality. The fascist repressive order of the puppet clique proceeds from a desperate attempt to bolster up at any cost the "civilian government" driven into an extreme crisis by the vigorous struggle of the South Korean people against the Kim Yong-sam group.
