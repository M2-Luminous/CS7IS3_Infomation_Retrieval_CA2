Rabbi Ibrahim Hamra told AFP the authorities began issuing visas to Jews about three weeks ago, at the rate of 30 a day. "Only 225 Syrian Jews still have not received their exit visas," he said. "We hope they will get them in the next few days." Some 1,250 of Syria's 4,000-strong Jewish community opted to stay in Syria after Damascus agreed in 1992 to allow applicants for exit visas to leave with their families. About 1,000 remained in Damascus, and 250 in Aleppo and al-Qamishli in the north. Hamra said none of those who emigrated went to Israel. Almost all of them went to New York. On Monday, Hamra said that around 110 Jews had returned after spending more than a year in the United States. For years the United States has urged Syria to allow its Jews to leave. Damascus previously barred families from travelling together and required individuals who did leave to put up large sums as guarantees against their return. However, in December Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad assured US Secretary of State Warren Christopher that Damascus would speed up the issuing of exit visas for Jews.
