In his opinion, the main shortcoming in the state system is the dichotomy between executive and legislative authorities. One should either grant the necessary powers to the prime minister, or the president should head the Cabinet of Ministers, Ivan Plyushch said. He is inclined to the second option. Regarding the current composition of the Supreme Council, the former Speaker observed that he does not find it significantly different from the previous one. True, he said, new tendencies have appeared in the parliament's work, and if they are allowed to develop, the Supreme Council could turn into an administrative body. "Something like the central committee, but a worse version," Ivan Plyushch explained, and added that "the shift to the left" in society and parliament is not a terrible thing. He believes that one should not fear communists, but Bolsheviks, whose aim is first to destroy, and only then to build. With regard to Ukraine's economy, the former Speaker noted, it now needs liberalization and evolutionary reforms.
