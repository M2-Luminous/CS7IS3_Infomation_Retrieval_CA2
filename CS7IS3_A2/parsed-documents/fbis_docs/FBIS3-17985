He said as many as 526 aerial, surface and underground nuclear blasts had been carried out in eastern Kazakhstan in the past 40 years. An estimated 500,000 people fell victim to the tests and serious environmental damage was caused. "Kazakhstan has so far been left alone to face those problems. The Russian president and I discussed this at length and I can now say with confidence that Russia will help us in utilizing that large scientific complex for peaceful purposes. For example, the Semipalatinsk site can be used for testing safety systems of the nuclear power plants or as a space training center in concert with Baikonur," Nazarbayev said. At the same time, he called for an international commission to be set up, Russia included, to assess the volume and nature of damage caused to the people and environment. "This can at least help set priorities in eliminating the harmful effects from testing," Nazarbayev said.
