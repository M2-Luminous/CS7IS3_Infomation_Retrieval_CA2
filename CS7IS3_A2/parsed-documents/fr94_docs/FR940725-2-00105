FR940725-2-00105 FR940725-2-00064 Order service firms that accept orders to buy or sell commodity interests may be required to comply with certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1974, as amended (``CEA''). For example, Section 4(a)(1) of the CEA generally provides that transactions in commodity futures contracts may be executed only on a board of trade which has been designated as a ``contract market'' in the underlying commodity by the CFTC. In addition, Sections 4d and 4k of the CEA generally provide that any person that is engaged in soliciting or accepting orders for the purchase or sale of commodity interests must be registered as an introducing broker or as an associated person. The proposed rule change adds section (d) to CBOE Rule 6.77 to state expressly that to the extent an order service firm accepts and forwards orders for the purchase or sale of commodity interests, such firms must comply with the CEA and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Additionally, the proposal requires such firms to keep the CBOE's Department of Financial Compliance (``Department'') apprised of its registration status under the CEA on an ongoing basis, including any financial reporting or capital requirements. In addition to revising CBOE Rule 6.77, the proposed rule change adds CBOE Rule 6.78 to the Exchange's rules. Under proposed Rule 6.78, any member organization that intends to act as an order service firm must file with the Exchange a letter of guarantee issued by a member of the OCC. Pursuant to this letter of guarantee, the clearing member must accept financial responsibility for all orders handled by the order service firm on behalf of Exchange market makers and all financial obligations of the order service firm to the Exchange. In order to limit the potential risk to any single clearing member, no clearing member shall be permitted to guarantee more than three order service firms without the prior written approval of the Department. In considering a request to guarantee more than three such firms, the Department shall consider the clearing member's level of excess net capital, additional financial resources, and such other facts as the Department deems appropriate. The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it would facilitate the ability of options market makers for which there are related commodity interests to reduce their exposure to market risk by providing them with a more efficient means of effecting hedging transactions in such commodity interests. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days after the publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) by order approve such proposed rule change, or (b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.
