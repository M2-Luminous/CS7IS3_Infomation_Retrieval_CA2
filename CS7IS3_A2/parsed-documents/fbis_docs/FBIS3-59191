Russia could not move closer to full membership as long as its foreign policy conflicted with international law, Santer told the winter session of the Council's parliamentary assembly. "The stationing of troops in bordering countries, against their wishes, flies in the face of these principles," Santer added. Russia did however have a "vocation" for full membership of the 32-nation organisation, Santer said. Russia has since May 1992 sought to exchange its special "guest" status, which it has had for the past four years, for full council membership. The head of the Russian delegation last Tuesday accused the Council of erecting "new, artificial obstacles" to full membership. Russia fulfilled all the requirements for full membership after holding democratic elections and drawing up a new constitution in December, he added.
