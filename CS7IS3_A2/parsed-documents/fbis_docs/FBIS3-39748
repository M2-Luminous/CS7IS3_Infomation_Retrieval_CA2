This is the amount of short-term loans (duration of up to 12 months) that the Federal Government had covered via the Hermes credit insurance and which are now having problems or will endure problems by the end of this year. Since no precautions have been taken in the federal budget's guarantee account for damage caused by Iranian loans, the Federal Government wants to avoid a rescheduling of the debts, which would force it to pay approximately 90 percent immediately. Ten percent would have to be covered by the exporters themselves. Otherwise, an addendum to the budget of DM3-4 billion would certainly become necessary, Bonn fears -- and right in the hot stage of the election campaign in autumn. The responsible ministries (Finance Ministry and Economics Ministry) and Hermes are, therefore, currently negotiating with the Iranian Central Bank Markazi about an almost unique refinancing: A consortium of German banks is to grant a loan for the entire amount, including the exporters' retention, until 1995 and is to receive a guarantee for that by the Federal Government. Already approved compensations of approximately DM420 million are to be included in the transaction so as to spare the budget. Since the debts involve around 1,000 indivdiaul demands by up to 700 exporters, refinancing could not be coordinated differently at short notice anyway. Hermes has written to the exporters that conduct business with Iran and has requested details on their guaranteed demands. The costs of the unusual transaction are to be paid by Iran. This was negotiated until yesterday; the result is still open. [passage omitted]
