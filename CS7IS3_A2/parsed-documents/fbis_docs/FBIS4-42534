This is at least the main conclusion that comes to mind when reading the report just released by a fact-finding delegation established by the National Assembly's Production and Trade Committee headed by Andre Santini (French Democratic Union -- UDF). The delegation looked into NAFTA's "economic impact both for participating countries and third-party countries." According to delegation members, who visited Mexico, the United States, and Canada from 18 February to 1 March 1994 and met with numerous political and business officials, "since there are no geographical requirements, one cannot rule out potential integration of Asian countries...." Indeed, NAFTA is not geographically limited to the American continent. The report points out that "during preliminary talks, President Bush mentioned South Korea, Singapore, and even Australia as potential members." NAFTA Courting South Korea Having completed their study, French MP's seem convinced that the next stage for NAFTA development will take place in South Korea, even though "the most obvious candidates are countries of the American continent." True, the U.S. Government could launch negotiations with Chile "and possibly Argentina in the not-too-distant future." However, "the impact of a potential extension of NAFTA to the south of the continent would be marginal since the volume of North American exports to this region is four times lower than to Europe and Asia." On the other hand, "integration of Asian countries would definitely be harmful for Europe." Accordingly, even before it began writing its report, the delegation reportedly told the Foreign Ministry about this "American attempt at extending NAFTA to Asia." "We must bear in mind the fact that NAFTA is nothing more than a free-trade agreement," a delegation member explained LA TRIBUNE. "The Americans are not faced with a `deepening vs. enlargement' dilemma. NAFTA membership criteria are quite flexible. There is no economic convergence requirement. The outlook is therefore relatively flexible." This is why delegation members ask French and EU [European Union] authorities to "read between the lines," as NAFTA is a double-barreled trade weapon: "Mexico will be the gateway to South America, and South Korea the gateway to South East Asia."
