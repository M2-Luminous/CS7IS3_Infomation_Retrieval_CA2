FR940216-0-00125 FR940216-0-00010 One commenter observed that a downstream party receiving noncomplying product would be obliged to store the product until the owner of the product determines a solution. The commenter recommended that a party storing nonconforming product that has been properly re-documented stating its actual characteristics should not be penalized. EPA generally agrees with this comment. The final rule prohibits, inter alia, the distribution, transportation, storage or sale (or offer to sell) of noncomplying product represented as reformulated gasoline and intended for sale or use in any covered area. EPA will assume, absent countervailing evidence, that all gasoline found in the United States is intended for domestic sale or use and thus subject to the reformulated gasoline or anti-dumping rules. Countervailing evidence to overcome this assumption with regard to a specific tank of gasoline would include a showing of the following: demonstrate that the gasoline is clearly identified as noncomplying product; that the noncomplying gasoline is segregated from other gasoline; that the storage tank containing the gasoline has been clearly designated as product unavailable for sale or distribution; that the noncomplying gasoline in fact has not re-entered the distribution system; and that the gasoline is redirected toward a process of bringing the gasoline into compliance. A party storing noncomplying gasoline meeting this burden would not be in violation of the prohibitions contained in today's rule. b. Carriers. EPA received a variety of comments objecting to the imposition of presumptive liability on carriers. Several commenters argued that the prohibitions contained in section 211(k)(5) of the Act identify refiners, blenders and marketers as the regulated parties under the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs, but does not specifically name carriers. Section 211(k)(1) authorizes EPA to ``promulgate regulations *␣*␣* establishing requirements for reformulated gasoline *␣*␣*.'' This broad grant of authority is the principal source of authority for the regulatory structure adopted for the reformulated gasoline program, along with the various specific requirements and authorizations found in other paragraphs in section 211(k). EPA has determined, in exercising this authority, that the most appropriate structure for this program is one which provides for the regulation of reformulated gasoline from its point of production or importation to its eventual transfer to the ultimate consumer. First, EPA's experience with various other motor vehicle fuel regulations, promulgated under section 211(c) of the Act, indicate that this is critical to the success of the program. This is based on the fungible nature of the gasoline distribution system, the complex interrelationships between the various parties involved in producing and marketing gasoline, and the large number of different parties that will be involved in bringing reformulated gasoline to the market. Second, the reformulated gasoline program includes a complex mixture of requirements, involving the regulation of several different gasoline components as well as the emissions performance of the gasoline. A cradle-to-grave approach is necessary to ensure that the air quality benefits from this program are actually achieved in use, given the large number of parties who will have custody or control of a batch of reformulated gasoline, and the potential that their actions could adversely affect the emissions reductions expected from the reformulated gasoline program. This could occur, for example, because the quality of gasoline has been changed, or because it has been dispensed or used at an improper time or place. For these reasons, EPA believes that it is proper to regulate all parties involved with the production, distribution and sale of reformulated gasoline. At the same time, EPA has assigned different responsibilities to different parties in the production and distribution system. EPA proposed and has decided to adopt final rules including carriers as a regulated party, and assigning them responsibilities commensurate with their unique role in the gasoline distribution system. EPA believes this is a reasonable exercise of its broad grant of authority under section 211(k)(1). EPA has determined that the regulation of carriers_pipelines, barge operators or truck carriers_is necessary to accomplish the goal of cradle-to-grave oversight monitoring and enforcement. This determination is based on the potential for carriers to cause violations of the reformulated gasoline regulation, the need to impose a duty on carriers to exercise care in transporting or storing reformulated gasoline, and the need for EPA to be able to determine the source of violations within the program. For example, carriers possess the potential to cause violations of this program by commingling inappropriate grades of gasoline, delivering conventional gasoline into a covered area, or by carrying non-VOC controlled gasoline in a storage facility over from a non-VOC control period into a VOC control period and selling or distributing that product. In each of these examples, the carrier would be directly responsible for causing the violation. EPA believes that the presumption of liability proposed in the final rule effectively imposes a duty of care on carriers to avoid these violations. Further, as discussed in the economic analysis accompanying this final rule, the costs associated with carrier compliance are reasonable and have been designed to provide carriers with the minimum oversight costs necessary to accomplish the goals of this program. Certain carriers argue that Congress did not authorize the regulation of carriers in this program as the prohibition found in section 211(k)(5) of the Act only applies to refiners, importers, distributors and marketers, but not carriers. Therefore, it is argued, EPA may not regulate carriers. EPA disagrees with this argument. First, it misinterprets the prohibitions adopted by Congress in section 211(k)(5). The statutory prohibitions found in that paragraph are self-effectuating once EPA promulgates regulations establishing the requirements for certification of reformulated gasoline. Section 211(k)(5) does not limit EPA's authority to establish various additional regulatory prohibitions, as necessary, in the exercise of EPA's rulemaking discretion under section 211(k)(1). It also does not limit EPA's authority under section 211(k)(1) to regulate, as appropriate, the activities of various persons in the gasoline distribution system, including carriers.
