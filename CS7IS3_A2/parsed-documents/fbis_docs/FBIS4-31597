[Jaskiernia] Indeed, the question of the president's rights is a key issue and is certain to generate many arguments. Different functions are attached to the office of president in different systems. In a presidential system of the kind obtaining in the United States, the president discharges the function of head of the executive power--that is, he actually directs the government. On the other hand, in the parliamentary-cabinet system, the president is more a symbolic head of state. His function is to carry out certain ceremonial duties and grant top academic and other titles and highest military ranks; he is also the supreme commander of the armed forces. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] opts for the latter model. [Sroczynski] What motivates the Left to make this choice? [Jaskiernia] We postulate a weaker position for the president because we see the government and the prime minister as the principal carriers of the executive power. In our opinion, the public should know precisely who governs the country: the president or the prime minister. [Sroczynski] Have we not known that hitherto? [Jaskiernia] For the past few years, we have had a situation in Poland whereby the president could say that he was not able to realize his election campaign promises because he does not have sufficient powers as a result of the government's intervention. The government, in turn, claims that it cannot discharge its obligation to administer the country because the president interferes in various areas of its competence. [Sroczynski] As a result, you are proposing to introduce a classical system of a combined parliament-cabinet rule, in which the president's function will be more symbolic than real. [Jaskiernia] We adopt the classical configuration in which the president's function is weaker, but we also allow for a certain reinforcement of that function. First, we assume that the president will be elected by the whole of society in a general ballot. We have chosen that option, even though it is not strictly necessary with the president's current range of competence. Second, we allow for a more active role to be played by the president in a conflict situation--that is, at a time when we are unable to form a government. This should give him a chance to become a mediator. [Sroczynski] Only in that kind of situation? [Jaskiernia] I believe that, as soon as conflicts of that sort cease occurring, the president ought to withdraw into the wings and leave the stage to the government, giving it full freedom to act. Why should the president be an obstacle to the government's discharging its administrative duties? [Sroczynski] Does Lech Walesa's personality not influence the left's decisions on which powers to give to the president? [Jaskiernia] We are trying to draft a new constitution that is free from "personality conditioning." In other words, as we formulate the constitution, we leave out the question of Lech Walesa's personality. Furthermore, we have never discussed the president's range of competence with the aim of weakening his position. Anyone who watches the results of public-opinion polls will know that the ranking list is headed by SLD candidate Aleksander Kwasniewski. So it is not altogether certain who will be elected the next president. We believe that the public should have a clear-cut picture of who is responsible for the state administration. Personally, I am a firm opponent of a twofold, or diarchic, power structure. To apply soccer-derived vocabulary to such a structure, you can say that it is easiest to place the ball between the goalposts when there are two defense players. This situation of "splitting the defense" is most characteristic of a system where the president has a considerable range of competence, parallel, as it were, to the government's competences. In the FRG, there is no doubt that the chancellor is responsible for the state administration. In Britain, everyone knows that the prime minister runs the country's affairs, and no one expects the queen to do so. Why should we opt for a system that causes constant confusion about who is in charge? [Sroczynski] Because the question of the range of competence of our top political figures and institutions generates such controversies and conflicts, is there not a danger that it will also delay the work on drafting the new constitution? [Jaskiernia] If both sides show goodwill, the constitution could be promulgated in May or June of next year. The procedure approved by the Sejm for adopting a constitution is of a very democratic nature. Unfortunately, this creates the opportunity for delaying the work at every stage--and, if someone wished to do so for some malicious reason, he could well succeed. Such a boycott, based on exploiting various procedural loopholes, gaps, and opportunities, could cause a considerable delay in the work on the constitution and even lead to a situation whereby its promulgation by the present parliament is in question. [Sroczynski] Is your vision not unduly pessimistic? [Jaskiernia] Perhaps it is, but the possibility of such a situation cannot be precluded. [Sroczynski] What other surprises do you think there could be? [Jaskiernia] I also allow for the possibility of a certain paradoxical situation, which some people are already predicting. It is obvious that the president's representative on the Constitutional Commission will opt for a strong position for the president. In turn, the Center Accord [PC] will attempt to minimize the president's role in its own preferred version of the constitution. It is already clear that the division line will be quite complex. It is not only the left-wing orientation that opts for a weaker position for the president. Consequently, there is some speculation that, having realized that he has no reasonable chance of being elected within the framework of a strong presidential power system, Lech Walesa could still change his mind and pronounce himself in favor of the weaker presidential power option. [Sroczynski] Do you mean that this could be the lesson we might yet learn from the outcome of the settlements reached during the roundtable talks? [Jaskiernia] It may be that it will be necessary to abandon certain positions in order to avoid falling again into the trap into which Lech Walesa fell precisely during the roundtable negotiations. At that time, he was in favor of weak powers for the president because that office was then set aside for General Wojciech Jaruzelski. Later, after a short period of General Jaruzelski's presidency, he assumed that position himself, with its restricted powers, and immediately began to complain that his range of competence was too restricted. If he had taken a long-term view during the roundtable talks, he would have had no reason for complaint. On the other hand, we distance ourselves from making tactical, person-oriented moves, and, while we do not attempt to adjust the proposed presidential powers to the personality of any particular candidate, we nevertheless intend to build the state system according to logical and reasonable principles.
