These are just some thoughts and concepts that were articulated during a debate within the Armed Forces on economic issues that took place in Warsaw on 31 March. The meeting was organized by the Logistics Inspectorate of the Armed Forces' General Staff and included participants from the General Staff's leadership cadre, commanders of military districts, and commanders of the various branches of the Armed Forces, chief of the Finance Ministry [acting Finance Minister] Henryk Chmielak, chief of the Central Planning Administration [CUP], Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, Deputy Defense Minister Jan Kuriata, as well as representatives of the Supreme Chamber of Control, the Public Prosecutors Office, the Supreme Court's Military Chamber, and representatives of financial institutions and military educational units. Interdependencies between the shape of the national economy and the possibility of meeting the tasks the Armed Forces have been charged with were strongly emphasized during the meeting. Despite announcements and declarations by various politicians, there has been no breakthrough in defense expenditures. In 1994, 48.3 trillion zlotys will be appropriated for the Army, which, taking into account after-inflation figures, constitutes a drop of 1.8 percent from last year. The amount appropriated for the Army is bound to have an impact on its shape, on the rate of restructuring done within it, and on the introduction of modern combat technologies. Despite the popular expectations of participants at the meeting, speeches by the chiefs of the Finance Ministry and CUP failed to include prospects for financial assistance to serve the fulfillment of defense needs. Lack of a model of action, at least with the next two to three years in mind, to a large extent makes it impossible for the Armed Forces' leadership to plan administrative and structural changes or training activities. One could hear statements by Armed Forces' representatives in unofficial talk: This is not the kind of position we expected to see. The existing problems and interdependencies cannot impede the changes that are being implemented--or that are being planned--in the area of managing the military economy. These issues were very strongly emphasized during a speech by General Zbigniew Zalewski, chief of the Logistics Inspectorate. Army and Market Mechanisms Because of our defense needs, we should be devoting 30 to 40 percent of the Defense Ministry's [MON] budget to structural transformations, new technologies, and technical infrastructure. In reality, only one-tenth of the above-mentioned budget will actually be spent on satisfying these goals. This situation is further exacerbated by a faulty tax system, which is responsible for so-called empty money flowing between and among state institutions (state budget institutions). Banks are the only party benefiting from the phenomenon. According to General Z. Zalewski, when it comes to parliamentary debate on defense issues that will take place in the near future, one should consider introducing a different type of tax system vis-a-vis the Armed Forces. It is also necessary to carry through amendments to the entire batch of so-called military-related statutes. There are also possibilities of introducing such changes that would make it possible to implement modern mechanisms of managing and supervising the Army's assets. On that theme, a proposal was presented, among other things, to establish an analytical center within the Armed Forces, which should deal with creating economic and financial fundamentals of the MON budget. Measures that have been undertaken so far--for instance, a decrease of logistical units by 30 percent--made it possible to direct additional means to the Army's most important areas of activity. The need to search for sources of additional economic measures was reflected in a speech by General Marian Robelek. Among other things, a rationalization of organizational structures and further decreases in the number of additional and protective units should constitute a source for such economic measures. It will also be necessary to... ...Give Up Unneeded Military Premises ...the maintenance of which is a burden to the MON budget. Unless principles of transfer of assets are changed, and unless the resistance by the administration is overcome (the administration procrastinates with regard to taking control over unneeded sites), radical steps will have to be taken. Given the limited resources that can be devoted to the Army's technical advancement, the following will receive priority treatment: purchases of reconnaissance and radio-electronic combat equipment, and also of command systems and antitank and antiaircraft systems. The efficiency of implementing logistical concepts and eliminating irregularities in the military economy are an important problem. Among others, General Jan Wojtala, chief of MON's Supervision Department, spoke about this. [passage omitted] The meeting did not resolve--it could not have--all of the problems faced by commanders and the Army's logistics branch. However, assessments and conclusions presented during the debate will make it possible to take the realities of military service into account in the decisionmaking process.
