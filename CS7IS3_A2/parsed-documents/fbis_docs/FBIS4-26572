Noyola, who has been here twice before, urged local enterprises to use Mexico as the gateway to the North American market. At seminars in Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Taipei, Noyola will brief local investors wanting to tap the North American Free Trade area about Mexico's investment climate. NAFTA, which also groups the United States and Canada, is the world's largest free-trade market. Ten firms from Taiwan have investments worth US$10 million in Mexico, notably in areas bordering the United States.
