Also included in the CPPCC Constitution will be guidelines resulting from the recognition that China is at present in the primary stage of socialism as well as China's reform goal of establishing a socialist market economy, according to Hu Sheng, a vice-chairman of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and one of the vice-chairmen of a panel entrusted with revising the constitution. New developments in China cry out for a revision of the CPPCC Constitution, Hu said. In the wake of Deng Xiaoping's 1992 south China tour and the 14th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, he said, a new tide of reforms has swept the country and the national economy has been surging at an unprecedented speed. Furthermore, to conform better to the Constitution of China, which was amended last year, a revision of the CPPCC Constitution has become more urgent, Hu said. "When all is said, the 1982 CPPCC Constitution is a good one," he said. "What we'll do is only a partial revision."
