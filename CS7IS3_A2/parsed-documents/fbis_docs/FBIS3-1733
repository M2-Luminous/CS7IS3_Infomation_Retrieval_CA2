The 35-year-old man, who works for a Japanese company, made this announcement last week on a special program aired by Beijing television aimed at helping Chinese bachelors studying or working abroad and returned students who are still single to find mates. The hostess, Yang Guang, said that she found out that many young people studying or working abroad are looking for partners from within China. However, their dreams often cannot become true because they live abroad. "I am waiting for my luck, but it's really not easy," said 29- year-old Lu Qing, who studied law in New Zealand and has opened a law office in Beijing. "Life abroad is dull. We missed China and our hometowns every day. After returning to China, I find my life is colorful and happy." The 80-minute program presented nine such bachelors, some of whom were introduced by their family members or friends in China. Most of them, with master's or doctor's degrees in hand, have passed their 30th birthday. In recent years, China has made a series of preferential policies including the freedom to return and leave again to encourage students studying abroad to return to China. More and more students have begun to come back.
