The two sides met face to face yesterday morning, in the presence of the mediators, to discuss the conclusion of the electoral process. It was agreed at that meeting that the two sides would enjoy an equitable distribution and control of state finance during the electoral campaign. Meanwhile, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continues to believe that the existing Electoral Law must undergo some changes so that the grave errors of September 1992 do not occur again. The media will not have the right to broadcast election results before the National Electoral Council has done so. Nevertheless, the Luanda team to the Lusaka talks continues to defend its position that everything must stay as it was in 1992. In view of that, no one knows whether the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] intends to perpetrate electoral fraud yet again against the people of Angola. The mediators headed by UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye have been tireless. Blondin Beye has already delivered yet another general document to the two sides in a bid to narrow differences between UNITA and the MPLA-PT in those areas. The two sides are expected to have met again yesterday to start analyzing the new proposal advanced by the mediators.
