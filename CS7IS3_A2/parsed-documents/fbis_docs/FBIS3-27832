Hata told a news conference "such criteria run counter to Japanese Government efforts to promote deregulation." Trade negotiators from Japan and the United States who met in Washington last week made little progress on the critical issue of how to measure the progress of foreign access to Japanese markets. Speaking at a news conference after the day's cabinet session, the foreign minister suggested that U.S. and Japanese automakers hold negotiations to break the impasse in bilateral auto trade talks over the share of U.S. cars in the Japanese market. Hata said talks among those directly involved would be more effective than government-level meetings in solving problems and suggested that the private sectors of both sides hold discussions. Noting that Japanese automakers in the United States have tie-ups with local repair shops, Hata said that through such private-level talks, the U.S. firms wanting to sell cars in Japan might be able to seek alliances with Japanese makers. He cited as an example foreign beer companies selling their products through Japanese brewers. The Japanese auto market, which Washington maintains is biased against imports, is the main focus of current U.S. efforts to cut down its trade deficit with Japan by increasing the sales of U.S. goods and services in key Japanese market sectors. Japanese and U.S. negotiators on auto trade are deeply divided on how to quantify "tangible progress" in foreign access to the Japanese market, which the U.S. views as the core of the framework trade talks.
