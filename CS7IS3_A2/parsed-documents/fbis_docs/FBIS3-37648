According to the president, a draft agreement received from Russia last week is a new matter and the working group for the negotiations with CIS countries has to analyze it. Speaking about the Russian military transit from Latvia and Estonia to Kaliningrad, President Brazauskas pointed out that it was necessary to help the Baltic states to have the Russian troops withdrawn, and for that reason the above transit should be kept open. This would only assist our common objectives, said the president.
