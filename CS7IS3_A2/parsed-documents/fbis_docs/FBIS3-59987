One of the accused tried to escape arrest by jumping from the 120 foot high Attock bridge and was killed. The other suspected smuggler was arrested. According to reported details, Inspector Shahzad was on duty with his Customs Special Squad at midnight on Sunday and was checking cars near Kand when a military truck drove up. The Customs officials signalled to the truck to stop, but, instead of stopping, the driver accelerated and tried to escape. Inspector Shahzad and his men pursued the truck and stopped it near Attock bridge. While Customs agents were searching the Air Force truck number 11037, the man sitting next to the driver ran out of the truck and jumped into the river from Attock bridge, but, instead of hitting water, he landed on some rocks and was killed. Customs agents arrested the driver and searched the truck. They found a large quantity of marijuana in plastic sacks. The truck and driver were taken to Customs House in Peshawar where the accused smuggler is being interrogated. The [next] morning employees stationed at the bridge informed the Akora Khattuck police that a body was found under the bridge. The police delivered the body to Naushahra hospital. Government identity cards and papers found on the dead man showed that the man was an Air Force technician named Ghulam Rasoul, son of Mohammad Hussain; he was from Faisal Abad and worked at the Kamara Aeronautical Complex. Some 1,665 kilograms of marijuana were recovered from the truck; the truck driver, whose name is Mohammad Nawaz Mohammad, son of Mohammad Moqim, and who lives at Chak Jalaluddin, Rawalpindi, is a senior technician at Kamara Complex. The accused has been charged under the Customs Act. In an interview with the MASHRIQ correspondent, the accused, Mohammad Nawaz, said that earlier he had smuggled textiles; that his task was to take the marijuana as far as Kamara; his companion Ghulam Rasul was to take over from there but he did not know what Rasul was going to do. The accused denied any knowledge of the marijuana and said that the truck was loaded at Chamkani and he was to take the load to Kamara. Air Force personnel arrived to take the accused into custody. Certain documents were recovered from the two suspects which contain important revelations.
