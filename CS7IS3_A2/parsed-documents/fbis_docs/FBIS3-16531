Simonenko; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Staff at Kursk nuclear power station are threatening to go on hunger strike, boycott the oblast Duma elections, and cut off the current to the power lines and so cause problems in the unified power grid unless debts are paid off. The nuclear power industry workers are demanding that around 86 billion rubles owed for electricity already supplied and three-month wage arrears are paid. These demands have been sent to the Russian Government by a joint decision of the station's management board and labor collective councils. The deadline set for meeting these demands is 10 March. But even right now the total capacity of the station's four power units is down by 50 percent. Nuclear fuel reserves at the Kursk nuclear power station are running out. Suppliers are unwilling to deliver without payment. For the time being Kursk power station workers are working without pay. The station's safe and reliable operation is nonetheless guaranteed. Nuclear energy, even when used for peaceful purposes, must not be tinkered with. But staff are ready to shut down the station.
