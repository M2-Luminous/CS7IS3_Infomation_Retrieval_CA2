"I came here yesterday (Saturday) to see former Senate president Ameh Ebute who has been in detention here since last Thursday. On getting here, I introduced myself to the security agents who immediately detained me," Polycarp Nwite said speaking on his cellular phone. Former senator Okoroafor was also arrested Saturday in Abeokuta, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of here, while the police are looking for Bola Tinubu, another outspoken member of the senate who last week declared the rule of junta leader General Sani Abacha "illegal,", their colleagues told AFP. The arrests came after members of the dissolved house of representatives called on Abacha to step down "not later than" June 11, the eve of the first anniversary of the annulled presidential election. Tinubu is a founding member of the opposition National Democratic Coalition which has called on Nigerians to take the initiative in restoring democracy. On Wednesday he attended a meeting of the dissolved senate following which Ebute issued a statement calling for the formation of a government of national unity and reconciliation headed by the presumed winner of last year's annulled elections, Chief Moshood Abiola.
