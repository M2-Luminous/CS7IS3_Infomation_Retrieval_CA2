A total of 14 individuals have been arrested since February thanks to the cooperation between the Swiss and foreign police forces. The investigators disclosed on Wednesday [8 June] that 2.4 kg of cocaine had been seized. However, the real "heads" of the network have not been unmasked. One of them lived in Lucerne. He received supplies of cocaine from Brazil through different channels. The drug was meant mainly for the "markets" of Lucerne and Zurich, the police said. Since February, 12 individuals have been apprehended in Switzerland and two others abroad. During the investigation, the police seized several Brazilian passports that had been stolen or bought on the black market. Moreover, cars have been confiscated as well as 180,000 francs. Unfortunately, it has proved impossible to locate the headquarters of the network. According to the chief of the criminal police of Lucerne, the traffickers were partly "financed by a Middle Eastern country."
