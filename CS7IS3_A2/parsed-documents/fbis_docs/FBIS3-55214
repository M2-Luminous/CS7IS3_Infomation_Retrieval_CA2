Trade union leaders and editors in chief of central newspapers have advised the prime minister with coal miners-style bluntness and solidarity of their plans to cease issuing their publications unless Viktor Chernomyrdin changes his Decree No. 1233 concerning printers, paper industry workers, and mailmen. If the professional rebellion is in any way different from others that have already swept the country a number of times, it is that the newsmen have not said a single word about their own well-being. The only thing they request is: Do not give ill-conceived orders the most immediate consequences of which will tighten the noose around the entire press and thus the possibilities of tens and tens of millions of people to get printed information. The letter signed by 25 editors in chief is unique also because newspapers of nearly the entire political spectrum have seen their interests converge at the point of death. Faced with the threat of a sixfold or higher rise in tariffs, even the most well-to-do ones have sensed the chill of nonexistence. As co-authors of a letter challenging the government, all of them have displayed a certain courage, but what I see as a desperate step was taken precisely by those who issue their publications using that same government's money. While rebuking or ignoring the rest, the government can simply cut off oxygen from its own newspapers. The restive ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI may be a case in point -- according to rumors, the plans are to close the newspaper and to set up a new, obedient publication in its stead. Many people suspect that by driving tariffs through the roof with one hand and handing out subsidies with the other, the authorities are conducting a selection on the current newspaper market. All the more so because journalists have already swallowed without a wince the trial pill of the House of the Russian Press being taken away from them. On the whole, nothing extraordinary has been under way: the redistribution taking place on the markets of authority and ownership cannot but trigger yet new battles on the information market. When it has finally dawned that to come to power in this country one needs simply to stick around in the television box as long as possible, the main battles broke out behind television programs' scenes. Given that the biggest bucks in the information business are made precisely behind those same scenes, neither strange edicts on the fourth channel, nor regular reshuffles of television chiefs, nor the fact that upon hearing cries "Thief!" no one rushed to fire or arrest anyone come as a surprise. It is television that has drawn a line without any help from the press at an entire stage of the mass media's evolution. The celebration of the new political year was a propaganda fiasco of such scope that people usually do not get back to their former jobs in Federal Information Centers, ministries, or press services. However this matter might be resolved technically, there is nothing to be done with the public opinion any longer. I do not rule out a situation, however, where someone in the president's or the prime minister's entourage would start whispering: Former ministers are gone, and see what happened -- the press staged a mutiny. If this is a mutiny, it is a mutiny of despair. It evolves against the backdrop of determining the results of subscription. By and large, the readers' audience is beginning to melt, if it is not already melting. There is only a total of three newspapers with 1 million or more subscribers, whereas as early as one year ago there were nearly 10 of them. In fact, leaving the letter of the editors in chief unanswered, the authorities are simply drawing practical conclusions from their assessment of the press' performance on the eve of the party vote. For those who themselves are to bear most of the blame, the journalists' fault is both convenient and evident. A politician reproached MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI for having failed, along with other newspapers, to warn society about the threat of Zhirinovskiy. When the critic was shown a November issue, in which even the cover spoke about the threat, he at once "turned his coat:" Zhirinovskiy allegedly won because you advertised him, among other things. Having published their letter in 25 publications, the leaders of journalists unions and editors in chief have to a certain extent become hostages to the government. After all, people subscribed to IZVESTIYA, TRUD, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and so forth, not to Chernomyrdin. It is the publications that should be held responsible. But to an even greater extent we are still hostages to the printers, mailmen, and paper industry workers. Publishers have already attributed the current fourfold (!) increase in prices to the government decree, against which the newsmen's letter is aimed. In the first half of last year, however, the publishers did not need any decree at all to effect an almost similar price rise. What if our letter will serve the interests of yet another state monopoly? Will the signature by the president of the publishers' association be a sufficient guarantee? Indeed, government decree No. 1233 elicits both bewilderment and protest. But who can guarantee that subsidies instead will not raise even more questions? Will we be able to find common ground then? The statement is only a preamble, albeit an important one, to further solidarity actions.
