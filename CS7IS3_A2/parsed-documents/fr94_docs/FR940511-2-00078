FR940511-2-00078 FR940511-2-00054 [Docket No. 93&hyph;25] Cancellation of Tariffs for Failure To Comply With Automated Tariff Filing and Information System (``ATFI'') Filing Requirements (European Trade) By Order published in the Federal Register (58 FR 69,365) on December 30, 1993 (``December Order''), the Commission directed 35 carriers with tariffs on file in the European trade areas to show cause why their paper tariffs should not be cancelled for failure to register and file a tariff in ATFI by the required data ( i.e., August 27, 1993). This action was taken pursuant to section 8 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. app. 1707), the Commission's regulations implementing ATFI at 46 CFR Part 514 and Supplemental Report Nos. 2, 3 and 4 issued in Docket No. 90&hyph;23, Notice of Inquiry on Ocean Freight Tariffs in Foreign and Domestic Offshore Commerce (Automated Tariff Filing and Information System). 1 1 Supplemental Report No. 2, served August 4, 1992, Supplemental Report No. 3 issued on December 17, 1992 (57 FR 59,999) and Supplemental Report No. 4 issued on June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31,522) advised the public that failure to convert tariffs to ATFI format by scheduled filing dates would subject the carrier's tariff to possible cancellation through a show cause proceeding. Sec. 502(b)(1) of Public Law 102&hyph;582 (``Pub. L. 102&hyph;582'') requires all tariffs and essential terms of service contracts filed with the Commission to be in electronic format. Formal responses were filed on behalf of CarAmerica S.R.L. (``CarAmerica''), Hermann Ludwig GMBH & Co. (``Hermann Ludwig''), and Compania Trasatlantica Espanola, S.A. (``CTE''). CarAmerica requested that the Commission refrain from cancelling its paper tariff until its ATFI tariff becomes effective. Hermann Ludwig stated it was not serving the United States trade and was reorganizing the company. It requested the Commission to refrain from cancelling its paper tariff since it intended to register and file a tariff in ATFI under its new name. CTE requested that the Commission cancel its tariffs since it no longer serves the United States. CarAmerica's ATFI Tariff No. 001 was filed and became effective on March 12, 1994, so this firm will be dismissed from the proceeding. The Commission believes that Hermann Ludwig was given adequate notice of the AFTI filing time frames and therefore should not be granted any further extension. Moreover, as noted above, it is no longer serving the United States trades nor has it evidenced its intent to do so by registering to file an ATFI tariff under its new corporate name. Accordingly, its tariff will be cancelled. CTE has not filed an ATFI tariff and moreover has asked that its tariff be cancelled. The Commission will grant CTE's request. The Commission did not receive responses from 17 of the respondents. None of these respondents have registered in ATFI or filed an ATFI tariff. They will have their tariffs or portions of tariffs applicable to the European trade cancelled. The 15 remaining carriers have filed their tariffs in ATFI or cancelled their paper tariffs, and will be dismissed from the proceeding, along with CarAmerica. Therefore, It is Ordered that the tariffs or portions of tariffs currently on file with the Commission with European scope of the carriers identified in Appendix A to this Order be cancelled effective five days from publication of this Order in the Federal Register . It is Further Ordered, That the parties listed in Appendix B to this order are dismissed from this proceeding. By the Commission. Joseph C. Polking, Secretary.
