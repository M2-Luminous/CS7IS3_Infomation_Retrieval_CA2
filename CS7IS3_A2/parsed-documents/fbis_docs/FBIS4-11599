Contrary to the government's assessment, peasants have indicated that the road blockade was a true success on its first day. [Begin Villca recording, in progress] ...we have information on hand about 50 roadblocks. This means that over 150,000 fellow peasants are taking part in this nationwide mobilization. Moreover, the military have been mobilized all over. The main road blocks that have been set up are: in Santa Cruz Department: Angostura, Sevaruyo, Yapayapa, Ivirganzama, Bulu Bulu; (Chifarsama), near Tropico Cochabamba; in Cochabamba Department: (Parautani), the entire highway; in Oruro Deparment: Caracollo. From (?Cruce Machamarca) we have reports that despite the presence of tanks, one of which turned over while transporting soldiers, fellow peasants have established roadblocks along the entire highway. Peasants have also established roadblocks in Potosi Department, near (Ipalla), near Tarija. Moreover, fellow peasants from Chuquisaca have been established on all local roads. This is why we are saying that the rejection of the government's intention to commercialize land has been truly successful.
