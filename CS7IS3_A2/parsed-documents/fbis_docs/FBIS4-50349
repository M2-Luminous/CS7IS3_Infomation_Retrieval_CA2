Clinton has vigorously advocated applying trade sanctions against China, saying China must make "comprehensive and substantial improvement" in seven respects before its MFN trading status can be renewed in 1994, but people in various circles, both in and out of government, are more and more aware that suspending China's MFN trading status is not in the interests of both China and the United States. How will Clinton weigh the pros and cons? Changeable Policy Toward China In fact, the disadvantages of suspending China's MFN trading status are quite clear. It can be seen from the debate and practice of various sectors of society that the U.S. and China have a common interest in the economic, political, security fields, and many others, despite their different ideologies. For these reasons, the U.S. has modified its policies toward China since last fall to increase high-level contacts between the two countries. Clinton held talks with PRC President Jiang Zemin when they both attended the APEC forum held in Seattle. However, in the months following the summit, U.S. policies toward China and Asia were changeable, indicating that the Clinton administration lacked foresight and sagacity in formulating its foreign policy and that there were differences of opinion within the administration. In a recent leaked memorandum to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Winston Lord, assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, expressed his opinions over policy toward China. Later, it was rumored that Christopher may resign to take responsibility for the much-criticized U.S. foreign policy. Clinton Must Save Face Developments over the last few weeks show that there has been a marked change in Congress, which has adopted an uncompromising attitude toward China in the past. THE WASHINGTON POST said in an editorial a few days ago that "Congress this year hardly intends to urge" Clinton to apply trade sanctions against China. Another development which warrants attention is that quite a number of people are trying to design means by which Clinton can back down with good grace. A U.S. newspaper quoted a senior researcher from the International Institute for Strategy Studies saying that "the urgent task is how to save face for the president." Another newspaper report said that Clinton's senior advisers are working hard to design "a decent withdrawal." A few days ago Banit [ba ni te 1572 1441 3676], former U.S. deputy assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, and Geolick [zuo li ke 0146 0448 0344], a former deputy secretary of state and White House chief of staff, published newspaper articles devising retreating tactics for Clinton. These included: 1) Using the term "people's livelihood," which includes human rights, instead of "human rights" when addressing China problems to enable the two countries to find more common ground; 2) issuing a public statement that China is beginning its journey to prosperity, that allowing China to join regional and global economic and security systems is in the U.S. interest, and that U.S. policy toward China is far above its economic interests; and 3) publicly expressing that the best way to raise the Chinese people's living standards is to allow China to continue opening to the outside world rather than isolating it. Controversy Between Ideal and Reality THE WASHINGTON POST was more straightforward. It believes that Clinton can keep calling on China to improve its human rights situation if only he changes tactics. In his 900-page book "Diplomacy," which has attracted attention world wide, former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who is famous for breaking diplomatic stalemates, said that U.S. foreign policy has always exhibited a conflict between moral concerns and state interests. The idealists believe the state's driving force comes from disseminating U.S. values, while realists place state interests above everything else. He maintains that it is more undesirable to export U.S. values as the Cold War is over. It is more advisable for Clinton to be more realistic. American people are more and more interested in taking good care of things at home. In fact, Clinton won the presidential election campaign by advocating "taking greater care of domestic affairs."
