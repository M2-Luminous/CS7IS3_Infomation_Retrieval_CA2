In his view, the signing of the agreement would signify a conservation of the status quo, whereas "putting today's situation, with all its negative sides considered, on ice is a renunciation of the democratic process of development." He appreciated the stance of the president who seeks accord in society; however, in his words, the EFP "cannot give up supporting citizens' interests," that is, waging struggle.
