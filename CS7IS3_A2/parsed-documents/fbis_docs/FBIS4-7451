Most of these were civilians, and unfortunately again several were children between the ages of three and 10. The (shelling) from the aggressor's strongholds has not stopped for long enough to let the guns cool. The area of (Gradina) has been pounded with howitzers from the right side of Gavran Stijena. They have attempted an infantry attack along the Ustipraca-(Mesici) line, and the intensive attacks have not let up since last night. It is equally dramatic on the southern part of the front, in the region of (Zibovi), (Potrkusa), and (?Oblenceva). At noon, the aggressor intensified attacks on the area of Orahovice, on the border between the Gorazde and Pale communes. Behind the enemy front lines, the new forces of the regular army of the so-called Yugoslavia have been grouping. There is no doubt that the rest of the day will be even more dramatic. It is hard to believe that high-altitude flights of what are probably NATO planes will change anything. When they flew away, heavy artillery shells came flying in from the aggressor's positions. We do not yet have precise information about the consequences. It is particularly hard to obtain information from the remote parts of the front.
