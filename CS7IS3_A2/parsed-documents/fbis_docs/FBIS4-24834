FBIS4-24834 "drchi106_v_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 TAIWAN Drug Abusers, Traffickers Estimated at 200,000 Drug Abusers, Traffickers Estimated at 200,000 OW0106160694 Taipei CNA in English 1344 GMT 1 Jun 94 OW0106160694 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Lilian Wu] [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday [1 Jun] that there are 200,000 drug abusers and traffickers in Taiwan, and that the drug problem on the island has reached an alarming state. Ma, speaking to the press two days before a national anti-drug conference is set to start, said, that although the supply and use of amphetamines had dropped 20 percent in the first four months this year, the first such decrease since 1990, the supply and use of heroin has increased 66 percent. Despite the jump in heroin use, though, he claimed that illicit drugs are reportedly in short supply -- a sign that the war on drugs declared by Premier Lien Chan last year has begun to show results. Ma reported that the supply of drugs was at its highest level last year, when law enforcement authorities seized 1,110 kilograms of heroin and 3,375 kilograms of amphetamines. He said 47,000 inmates in Taiwan prisons last year, or 31 percent of the prison population, were in for drug-related crimes. The figure was several times that of the past few years, he said, adding that drug-related crimes have taken precedence over theft and robbery. Speaking on the strategy to combat the drug problem, Ma said the Justice Ministry would draft a law to prevent drug kingpins from laundering drug money, and will target specific age groups in its anti-drug drive. Statistics show that 30 percent of drug-related crimes in the first four months this year were committed by people aged between 12 and 24 years old.
