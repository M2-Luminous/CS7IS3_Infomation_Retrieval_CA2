FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 16, May 7, September 17, 1993 and January 28, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (58 FR 19805, 27272, 48637 and 59 FR 4043) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46_48c) in connection with the services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Janitorial/Custodial, U.S. Courthouse, 3rd and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Janitorial/Custodial, Bldgs. 243, 255, 277, 322, 323, 325, 336, 382, 400&hyph;402, 405, 410, 412&hyph;419, 422&hyph;424, 430, 485, 497, 591&hyph;593, 887, 891, 902, 909, 911, 912, 914, R10 and R20, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.
