In the course of establishing and developing market economy operating forces, the tax system will need constant improvement, to turn it into a policy means for helping to bring the impact of market forces into full play, and to act with market forces in achieving the optimum disposition of resources. I. The Principles for Improving Our Tax System Under a Socialist Market Economy 1. The Revenue Principle Organizing revenues is the basic function of taxation. Economic operations based on a market economy require taxation, premised on not obstructing economic operations in the private sector, to raise the maximum revenues, which is the financial guarantee for a socialist country to realize its social and economic functions. But China's reality is that a decade-plus of economic reform has been accompanied by a similar period of fiscal deficits, which totalled 259.876 billion yuan for the 12 years from 1979 through 1990, or 2.91 percent of national income for the period. Even excluding treasury bond income, the shortfall from revenues raised mainly through taxation was still about 88 billion yuan, to average 7.33 billion yuan a year. Such a severe revenue shortage had to be a key factor hampering economic reform. 2. The Fairness Principle As to tax burdens, the fairness principle means that when taxpayer payment capability is the same, the same amount of taxes are collected; and when payment capability differs, taxes are collected based on taxpayer capability. Legally, the tax fairness principle means that tax collectors and taxpayers have an equal standing as to tax law, with various taxpayers also all being equal in the face of the tax laws. As to enterprise taxpayers, it is only when taxes are collected fairly that enterprises will have relatively rational tax burdens to allow for free competition; and as to individual taxpayers, collecting taxes based on payment capability helps to redistribute social wealth, shrink the polarization between the rich and poor, and create the greatest public welfare. 3. The Regulation Principle As the government's means of economic regulation, taxation has both a microeconomic and a macroeconomic regulation function. In the process of distributing and redistributing national income, taxation employs steps such as collecting or not collecting taxes on certain economic activities, collecting more or less taxes, and limiting tax bonuses, to affect and regulate (balance) the supply and demand of certain products, to realize the optimum disposition of resources and industrial structure goals. While this is the microeconomic-regulation function of taxation, taxation is also a means of regulating macroeconomic operations. The basic state of China's current market economy is an out-of-equilibrium economy, the conspicuous manifestation of which is the imbalance between overall supply and demand. The government can raise or lower taxes to curb or increase overall demand, to bring it into line with overall supply. We can go on to say that the regulation principle means that taxation needs the function of promoting production operation efficiency in microeconomic activities, as well as that of stabilizing macroeconomic operations. II. Tax-Reform Mistakes China's economic reforms have a gap in revenue-taxation reform. While a decade-plus of tax reform has added many tax categories, to improve our tax structure, the guiding ideology of "streamlining administration and devolving authority" and "tax reduction and profit concession" has led all along to the taking of various tax-reduction steps for the key tax-revenue source--enterprise income taxes, even to the point of "tax reduction" remaining the major tax-reform-offensive direction today when the new economic operating forces of a market economy are being established. Data show that from 1981 to 1990, state support for enterprises through the tax-reduction and profit-concession policy amounted to net financial resources worth 310 billion yuan, including 244.8 billion yuan during the Seventh Five-Year Plan, or 19.13 percent of revenues for the period. While the grounds for tax reduction are that it invigorates enterprises, I hold that under today's conditions, when our socialist market economy is just developing, and we have no sound economic and legal institutions suited to the operating laws of a market economy, continuing with the same old tax-reform guiding ideology of "tax reduction" would be bound to lead China's tax reform astray. Enterprises have not truely been invigorated because they are retaining more profits, while inadequate revenues leave the government powerless to control the overall economic situation. First take a look from the enterprise perspective. 1) When market forces are not very strong and enterprise actions are irrational, tax reduction cannot genuinely help enterprises become more efficient through competition. As our socialist market economy is just taking off, with China's society and economy still lacking a complete and mutually-restraining market system, being particularly short of market forces centered on a rational pricing structure, enterprises are actually in an unfair market-opportunity state. In addition, enterprises have not yet completely established internal mechanisms for self restraint and self development, or been subjected to full competitive pressures. In this state, tax reduction to increase the real budgetable income of enterprises allows them to acquire more liberal external terms not through their own efforts. They need only to strive for advantageous policies (an example being 1993's wave of phoney joint ventures) to achieve their own profit objectives, without having to spend more energy on raising efficiency. The pertinent data on the ratio of material consumption to gross output value in China's industrial sector show it to have been 68.1 percent in 1986, but up to 72.4 percent by 1990. So the tax-reduction policy had to have been a contributing factor to enterprise inertia. 2) When the state economy's property rights have not been genuinely put in order, so that enterprises lack long-range investment motivation, tax reduction does not fully play the role of stimulating investment. In our decade-plus of economic reform, the state economy's property rights relations have remained unclear all along, keeping commodity-producer behavior out of line with market rules. Meanwhile, as enterprises have no inherent drive for long-range development plus steadily increasing budgetable income, their real assets have not clearly accumulated and grown, with income being slanted more toward consumption. The data for 1985 to 1990 show that China's GVIO grew at an average rate of 13.1 percent a year, while employee payrolls in the industrial sector rose an average of 17.8 percent a year. In this state of affairs, the income realized through tax reduction moved limited resources from the investment arena to the consumption stage, turning production capital into consumer funds, stimulating an excessive increase in public consumption funds, and sharpening the overall imbalance between supply and demand. Then take a look from the government's side. 1) When the government's status and functions in economic activities have not yet been clearly delimited, and spending demand is rigid and strong, tax reduction can only add to the fiscal burden, by increasing fiscal deficits, and threatening the stable growth of the national economy. While the tax-reduction campaign in the U.S. in the 1980s had theoretical grounds, holding that the government must cut spending while reducing taxes, our reality is that our government's economic functions have certainly not been clearly cut back, with it still being responsible for priority-construction investment necessary to economic growth but long neglected, and no lightening of the fiscal-subsidy burden in sight. So increased government spending puts enormous pressure on revenue sources. When spending is increasing steadily and tax revenues are in a relative decline, funds to finance reform can come only through overdrawing, which then leaves the door open for inflation. 2) When economic growth and living standards are rising steadily, the demand for public facilities grows, meaning that the government has to come up with the funding for infrastructure improvements. And the tax-reduction reform thinking certainly ignores the revenue demand in this area. 3) A socialist market economy requires the free flow of production essentials, with the workforce-mobility essential in particular requiring the government to provide social guarantees in areas, such as unemployment and pensions, which is a new fund demand. 4) In our current government bond system, government bonds are unattractive financial assets, leaving the government with very limited revenues from the fundraising means of government bonds. Under such conditions, most government funds needed for either economic or social functions must be raised through taxes. It is thus obvious that in the initial stage of the establishment of a socialist market economy, when many economic relations cannot be completely rationalized and market forces cannot be made sound all at once, lowering taxes cannot solve problems, such as the strong demands on government revenues and the irrationality of enterprise actions. So I hold that in coming tax reforms, we can no longer reform our tax system with the tax-reduction thinking, but that our tax reform should be based on stabilizing tax burdens and revenues, by improving our tax structure, to build a tax system that is fair and can provide ample revenues and regulate the economy. III. Tax-Reform Ideas Under a Market-Economy System 1. Enterprise Income-Tax Reform In light of market-economy demands and in consideration of China's objective conditions for some time to come, I hold that accelerated enterprise income-tax reform should be our tax-reform priority for the next few years. A. Enterprise Income-Tax Laws Need To Be Consolidated. In the interests of fair tax burdens, we first need to break up the income-tax system that is set up on the basis of economic nature, with all types of domestic-invested enterprises, such as state, collective, private, jointly operated, and shareholding enterprises, being made subject to a uniform enterprise income-tax law and, when the time is right, merging of the income tax laws for domestic- and foreign-invested enterprises, and implementation of a completely consolidated enterprise income-tax law for industrial and commercial enterprises. As this is a prerequisite for fair taxation, as well as the consensus at all levels throughout China, there is no need to go into unnecessary details. B. Income Taxes Need To Be Different for Large and Small Enterprises. As our socialist market economy develops, the goal model for the conversion of enterprise operating forces is the shareholding system. Once we go to a full shareholding system, enterprise income taxes for small, midsize, and large enterprises will need somewhat varying tax treatment. From the experience of overseas practice, due to various reasons, such as 1) small enterprises having little profitmaking capability and prestige that is not yet established or not high, 2) the shareholding system requiring large financing and transaction costs on primary and secondary markets, and 3) the shareholding system requiring high costs for enterprise-manager supervision and control and information linkup between managers and shareholders, only 2 percent of small enterprises with less than 500 employees sell shares at the time of their initial financing decisions, with still less than 20 percent doing so by the time of their second financing decisions. In other words, about 90 percent of small enterprises take loans from financial institutions as their primary financing policy. So in support of vital small-enterprise growth, we should adopt preferential tax policies for small enterprises, such as making the legal tax rate applicable to small enterprises lower than that for large- and medium-sized ones, and offering broader investment-tax preferences. C. Interest Needs To Be Included in Tax Bases. Interest having long been tax free has created the bad phenomenon of the enterprise sector overrelying on bank loans for investment, while using most of its own funds for welfare facilities. If interest expenditures were included in tax bases, the enterprise income-tax system would actually be neutral toward all capital sources, while playing the following roles: 1) it would spur enterprises to raise the use efficiency of their borrowed capital; 2) on the capital demand side, it would help to control credit scope; 3) it would also have a certain restrictive impact on investment scale. D. Tax Rates Need To Be Flexible. The current focus of discussion in enterprise income-tax reform is tax-rate design. Many favor a 33-percent single-ratio tax rate. I hold that such a tax rate is a particular reflection of the tax-reduction guiding ideology, being too low, adverse to the organization of revenues, and detrimental to government use of tax leverage to regulate national economic operations. I favor the enterprise income-tax collection method of first adopting the soft-degree progressive tax-rate system, and then making a transition to the proportional (flat) tax-rate system. As our market economy is just being established: 1) Government revenue demands are strong, while enterprise income taxes are the major source of revenue, so that employing the progressive tax rate system can bring rich revenue flexibility; 2) in contrast to the individual income tax, it is only the enterprise income tax that plays a key role in regulating macroeconomic operations. So as the revenues so raised make up a very large percentage of overall tax revenue, if we continued to use the progressive tax rate, making it flexible, its regulatory impact would grow; 3) using the progressive tax-rate system would not affect enterprise investment initiative. In the current state of bank credit-mechanism restraints being soft, enterprise property-rights limits being unclear, and enterprise actions being severely short term, even more enterprise retained profits would be hard to use for long-term investment, as was explained above. In light of these factors, we should set enterprise income taxes for the short-term at a three-level progressive tax rate for excess income of 35-40 percent. Then, based on China's market-economy development and progress in converting enterprise operating forces, enterprise income taxes could make a gradual transition to the flat tax-rate system. In fact, before the 1980s, corporate income taxes in developed countries, such as the United States and Japan, all employed a three- to four-grade progressive tax-rate system for excess income. In addition, enterprise income-tax flexibility should also be expressed in the following two areas: 1) In order to encourage competition and raise production efficiency, I recommend that once the enterprise profit rate passes 20 percent, each one-point rise should lower the tax rate 1 point. The profit rate is calculated as profits plus all loan interest excluding utilized gross capital (including all loans). My reason for delimiting the profit rate at 20 percent is that according to economic-theory assumptions, in order for each industry to keep its output at a growth rate of 8-10 percent, its profit rate must be above 20 percent. This step would be a great encouragement to enterprises with profit rates above 20 percent, as well as playing a promotional role for all enterprises in achieving this profit rate and improving their economic efficiency. 2. In order to stimulate exports and import substitutes, I recommend that each one-point rise in the enterprise net-export rate should lower the tax rate 1 point. The net-export rate is present export value minus the present value of raw material and parts imports excluding the present replacement value of imported machinery and equipment. This could stimulate the growth of import industries and export-subsitute industries, while raising the use efficiency of imported machinery and equipment. 2. Individual Income-Tax Reform The individual income-tax system functions to bring fairness to individual income levels and regulate overall demand, being a key component part of a flexible tax system. Individual income-tax system-reform includes three parts: 1) The individual income-tax system needs consolidated. In other words, the current individual income tax, individual income adjustment tax, and individual industrial and commercial household operations income tax need to be merged into a consolidated individual income tax. Meanwhile, both Chinese and foreigners should be made subject to a uniform individual income tax law, with nonresident taxpayers being provided with certain special deductions to solve the problem of high tax burdens created by income differences. 2) We need to abolish our individual income adjustment tax's excess-multiple progressive tax-rate system, and replace it with the progressive tax-rate system for excess income, which would be in line with international practice, as well as increasing our taxation flexibility. 3) Individual business income should be made a part of the individual income-tax tax-base in order to prevent tax-revenue losses. 3. Flow-Tax System Reform China's flow taxes have always used the tax-inclusive-price model, with tax rates designed on the principle of high taxes for high profits, and vice versa. It is obvious that under the planned pricing system, flow taxes regulated profits, not the consumption that they should have. But in market-economy conditions, market-formed prices dominate, so that tax rates should no longer be designed on a planned-pricing basis. In addition, as to tax categories, everything from production to circulation and wholesale to retail should be subject to the value-added tax, with product taxes collected on some products, for a two-tax overlap. That is, the neutral value-added tax would be used for general regulation, with product taxes for special regulation. 4. Expanded Tax-Base, Additional Tax Categories In order to adapt to market-economy needs, China should as quickly as possible begin to collect social insurance, inheritance and gift, capital gains, and securities transaction taxes. 1) The collection of social insurance taxes will help to lighten enterprise burdens and promote rational labor mobility. The pertinent data show that in many of China's older enterprises, retirees and pensioners make up one-third of all employees, with this ratio even as high as 1:1 in a few enterprises. Paying wages to retired employees has always been a heavy burden on enterprises, as well as obstructing rational labor mobility. Collecting social insurance taxes will shift pension and unemployment insurance payments from enterprises to the government, to equalize the burdens of old and new enterprises, while opening the way for labor mobility. 2) Collecting inheritance and gift taxes will help to equalize public wealth and tax revenue. As China's living standards rise steadily, personal assets accumulate and grow constantly, and dealings with the outside world continue to expand, the transfer and inheritance of personal assets occurs often. According to international practice, China should also collect taxes on the inheritance or transfer of personal assets above a set amount. 3) The collection of capital-gains taxes, for separate taxation of corporate enterprise capital gains and operating income, is aimed at practicing a light-tax policy for the sale of capital assets, to encourage capital flow, invigorate capital markets, and encourage venture investments. 5. Stronger Tax-Control Legislation As a market economy is one that is ruled by laws, this means that tax-collection control must have tax laws as a yardstick. 1) Tax laws need consolidated, taxing authority must be concentrated, and the legal liability for the illegal actions of deciding without authorization to impose taxes, stop collections, or make exemptions has to be investigated and affixed; 2) illegal actions, such as tax evasion or resistance, need to be cracked down on severely; 3) we need to strengthen our tax-collection oversight, by investigating and affixing the legal liability of tax collectors who abuse their authority for private purposes and are derelict in their duties; 4) and we need to use all means to disseminate tax-law knowledge, by raising taxpayer awareness among all, in order to push legal tax-control to new heights. 6. A Tax-Separation System as Quickly as Possible In our traditional tax-management system, the departmental selfishness and policy of "storing wealth among the people" of local governments brought a sharp erosion of central-government tax revenue. 1) China's Central Government controls very few tax categories, with most taxes being collected on local-government responsibility, which shifts much tax revenue to extrabudgetary control, making our tax system severely regressive. 2) While the authority to draw up tax laws and tax rates is nominally the center's, it is actually all under local control. As this gives local governments the opportunity to loudly exploit tax reductions and exemptions, our tax-reform remedy will be to thoroughly practice a tax-separation system.
