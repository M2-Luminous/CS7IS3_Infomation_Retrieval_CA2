In an editorial today, the paper says: The Arab nation's enemies want to intimidate the Arab masses with the bloody fighting in Yemen in a desperate attempt to bury the dreams of unity and the Arabs' aspiration to achieve their comprehensive unity. BABIL concludes by saying: The unity which the Yemenis have built with their blood and sweat is invulnerable to fragmentation. That unity will remain the cure for the wounds of sabotage and treachery. The paper stresses that unity and unionists will always triumph.
