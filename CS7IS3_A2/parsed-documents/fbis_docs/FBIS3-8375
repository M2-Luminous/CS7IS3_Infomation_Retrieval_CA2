"If the war continues, the danger of its spilling is very real, and this means a war in the Balkans and Europe, not to go anywhere further," Lilic said in an interview published by the Banja Luka paper GLAS SRPSKI on Tuesday. He said last week's U.S.-brokered agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia simply could not work, adding it was wrong to exclude the Serbs from the talks. Unless it is aimed against the Serb side, it should not bother anyone in the Bosnian Serb republic or Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav president said. Bosnian Croats and Moslems started the 23-month-old war as allies against local Serbs, but have later turned against each other in an attempt to win more territory. Acting under the U.S. pressure, they met in Washington last week to sign a preliminary deal on forming a federation in Bosnia, which would subsequently form a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. Political analysts say Washington has opted for this initiative in an attempt to isolate the Serbs before pressurizing them at the conference table to make more territorial concessions. Arguing that the war had been imposed on Bosnian Serbs, Lilic said: "Were it for the Serbs, the war would never have started ... anyway, they have not been fighting for months." [as received] "Bosnian Serbs had no other choice but to defend their homes and their very existence, and Yugoslavs had no other choice but to support Bosnian Serbs in their just struggle for survival," Lilic said. "International media had been demonizing Bosnian Serbs and fabricating lies about them although all relevant international factors are very well aware that Bosnian Serbs have been trying very hard from the very outset of the war to help find a peaceful settlement as soon as possible." To show their readiness to conclude peace, the Serbs have so far offered considerable territorial concessions to the Moslems, withdrawn their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo and agreed, on certain conditions, that the city be administered by the United Nations, but this has not satisfied the Moslems, Lilic said.
