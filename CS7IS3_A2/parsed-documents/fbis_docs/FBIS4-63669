Victory by the Socialist Leader Has Been Forecast"] [Text] Observers in Kiev increasingly tend to compare Aleksandr Moroz, newly elected Supreme Soviet chairman, to Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin: evolution, they imply, is inevitable, and the political transformation that has occurred with the State Duma chairman will also happen to the Ukraine parliament speaker. Especially since their political backgrounds are so similar: neither Moroz nor Rybkin succeeded in the upper echelons of the old party nomenklatura, and both became leaders of left forces when their former leaders, who had top-level approval, grew disillusioned with these forces. The Moroz case is especially indicative: he entered big-time politics when it began to seem to party leaders that a "grassroots" deputy was needed to play the role of a party faction organizer while the real orchestrators were to stay in the shadows, but after the Ukraine Communist Party was banned, the former majority leader not only did not sit in the shadows but launched vigorous efforts to rescue the left forces which at the time appeared marginal: this was how the Ukraine Socialist Party emerged which appeared to be communist until a real Ukraine Communist Party came along. Both during the years of his leadership in the notorious "Group of 239" and after the emergence of the Socialist Party Aleksandr Moroz really showed himself as a fairly flexible, open-minded and often pragmatic politician: as is known, when a person is elected to a high post, such qualities only grow. Moroz, however, is a representative of a small faction, owing his success primarily to support from communists. Still the lineup of forces in the Ukraine Supreme Soviet is unlike in Russia's, and Ivan Rybkin has considerably more room for maneuver than Aleksandr Moroz. Especially since an argument in favor of Rybkin's flexibility is a strong president. And what is the argument in favor of Moroz' flexibility? Presidential elections? The very first days of the new parliament showed that Aleksandr Moroz will have to repay the debts to the strongest faction in the Supreme Soviet. When he was already enjoying the position of a virtual head of parliament, presiding over its session which discussed the fate of deputies elected in uncontested constituencies, Moroz behaved rather tactlessly, in a partisan manner, with respect to a leader in the Interregional Reforms Bloc, Vladimir Grinev, and yet another deputy from the non-left camp, Pavel Kudyukin. A new scandal emerged after Moroz was elected Supreme Council chairman: the opposition wrecked the session, apparently fearing that Communist Party representatives would be elected deputy speakers. The realignment of forces in the new Supreme Council is strikingly reminiscent of the situation that existed in the first days of the old, still very Soviet, parliament: the left can do everything but the opposition can thwart a session. Therefore agreement will have to be reached with it. However the aggravated situation around Crimea and the need to resolve the fate of the upcoming 26 presidential elections, whose cancellation is so actively sought by Leonid Kravchuk, could prevent the opposition from boycotting parliament indefinitely. Agreement may have to reached immediately, in haste, and only temporarily: that is, of course, unless Aleksandr Moroz transforms into an Ivan Rybkin faster that the parliamentary balance of forces allows him to.
