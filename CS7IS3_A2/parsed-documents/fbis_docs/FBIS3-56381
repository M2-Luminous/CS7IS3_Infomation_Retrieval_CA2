Kravchuk says: "I would like to express my satisfaction that people have shown understanding of Ukraine's situation and have not simply tried to force it to agree -- I really did not want to use this expression, but it is being used in some political circles -- I mean the idea of exerting pressure, of forcing Ukraine to agree. We insisted all the way through that people should understand our situation, our position, and we achieved this without damaging other states' interests; on the contrary, in a way beneficial to other states." Grishin summarizes the agreements signed today, and adds: "Leonid Kravchuk denied outright information that Ukraine is to receive $1 billion in compensation for the uranium deal. As for the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, the leader of Ukraine said that Moscow and Kiev can settle the issue in a way that takes account of both sides' interests, and that Ukraine is ready for dialogue."
