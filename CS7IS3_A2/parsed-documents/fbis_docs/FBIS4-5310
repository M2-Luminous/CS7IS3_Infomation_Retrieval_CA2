The delegation paid a call on Do Muoi, Communist Party of Vietnam general secretary, in Hanoi on 5 April. During the meeting with members of the delegation, the Vietnamese leader stated: "Japan is Vietnam's biggest trading partner and a top aid donor of Vietnam. I am grateful to Japan. The amount of investment in Vietnam from the Japanese private sector remains small, however." In this way, he asked for Japan's increased investment in Vietnam. Specifically, he asked Japan to invest in Vietnam's machinery industry, which can generate employment, transfer high technology to Vietnam, and provide Vietnam with business management know-how. In response, Chairman Nishio said, "Japan's investment in Vietnam lags behind that of other nations, but Japan will be a top investor in Vietnam sometime in the future." Thus, the Japanese business leader indicated that in taking advantage of the lifting of the U.S. embargo against Vietnam, Japan would make aggressive investments in Vietnam in the future.
