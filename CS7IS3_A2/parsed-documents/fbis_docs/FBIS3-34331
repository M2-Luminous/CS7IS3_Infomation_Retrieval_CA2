In a statement it describes the attack as a sign of the continuing inhumane and terrorist crime of the Serbs against the people of Sarajevo. The statement refers to the non-use of force by the United Nations in attempting to establish peace and security in Bosnia-Herzegovina as giving the Serbs a free hand in the genocide of Muslims. The Iranian Foreign Ministry statement reaffirms the need for the United Nations to rapidly intervene in order to stop the merciless massacre of the people in Bosnia, and calls for an end to the arms embargo imposed on the defenseless people of Bosnia. The Foreign Ministry statement describes the negligence by the Security Council and the UN secretary general as a violation of the principles and objectives of the United Nations, and an insult to world public opinion. Our country's Foreign Ministry statement continues: The Islamic Republic of Iran once again announces its readiness to send peacekeeping forces, under the supervision of the United Nations, to Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a step that would help to end the genocide in Bosnia. The Islamic Republic of Iran regards the failure of the Security Council to make an urgent decision on Bosnia as dangerous for the honor and standing of the United Nations, the spirituality of the human race [as heard], and peaceful coexistence in international relations. Our country's foreign minister spoke to our correspondent today. He called for the swift action of international circles in order to put an end to the massacre of civilians in Bosnia.
