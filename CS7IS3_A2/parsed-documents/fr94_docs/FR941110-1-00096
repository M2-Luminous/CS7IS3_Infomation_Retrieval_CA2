FR941110-1-00096 FR941110-1-00011 Unexpended production allowances means production allowances that have not been used. At any time in any control period a person's unexpended production allowances are the total of the level of production allowances he has authorization under this subpart to hold at that time for that control period, minus the level of controlled substances that the person has produced in that control period until that time. Used controlled substances means controlled substances that have been recovered from their intended use systems. §82.4 Prohibitions. (a) Prior to January 1, 1996, for all Groups of class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and prior to January 1, 2001 for Group VI, no person may produce, at any time in any control period, any controlled substance (except that are transformed or destroyed) in excess of the amount of unexpended production allowances or unexpended Article 5 allowances for that substance held by that person under the authority of this subpart at that time for that control period. Every kilogram of excess production constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. (b) Effective January 1, 1996, no person may produce, at any time in any control period, any class I, Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, Group V, or Group VII controlled substance (except for controlled substances that are transformed or destroyed) in excess of the amount of unexpended essential-use allowances under §82.4, amount of unexpended Article 5 allowances as allocated under §82.9 or the amount of unexpended destruction or transformation credits as obtained under §82.9 for that substance held by that person under the authority of this subpart at that time for that control period. Every kilogram of excess production constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. (c) Effective January 1, 1996, no person's total production of a class I controlled substance (except Group VI) as allocated under §82.4 for essential-use allowances, and as obtained under §82.9 for destruction or transformation credits, may, at any time, in any control period until January 1, 2000, exceed the percent limitation of baseline production in appendix H of this subpart, as set forth in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. (d) In addition to total production permitted under §82.4(c), effective January 1, 1996, for class I, Group I, Group III, Group IV and Group V controlled substances, and effective January 1, 1995, for class I, Group II, a person may, at any time, in any control period until January 1, 2000, produce 10 percent of baseline production as apportioned under §82.5 for export to Article 5 countries. No person may, at any time, in any control period until January 1, 2000, produce class I, Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, and Group V controlled substances for export to Article 5 countries in excess of the Article 5 allowances allocated under §82.9(a). (e) Prior to January 1, 1996, for all Groups of class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and prior to January 1, 2001, for Group VI, no person may produce or (except for transhipments, heels, or for used controlled substances) import, at any time in any control period, any class I controlled substance (except for controlled substances that are transformed, or destroyed) in excess of the amount of unexpended consumption allowances held by that person under the authority of this subpart at that time for that control period. Every kilogram of excess production or importation (other than transhipments or used and recycled controlled substances) constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. (f) Effective January 1, 1995, no person may import, at any time in any control period, a heel of any class I controlled substance that is greater than 10 percent of the volume of the container in excess of the amount of unexpended consumption allowances, unexpended destruction credits or unexpended transformation credits held by that person under the authority of this subpart at that time for that control period. Every kilogram of excess importation constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. (g) Prior to January 1, 1996, for all Groups of class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and prior to January 1, 2001, for Group VI, a person may not use production allowances to produce a quantity of a class I controlled substance unless that person holds under the authority of this subpart at the same time consumption allowances sufficient to cover that quantity of class I controlled substances nor may a person use consumption allowances to produce a quantity of class I controlled substances unless the person holds under authority of this subpart at the same time production allowances sufficient to cover that quantity of class I controlled substances. However, only consumption allowances are required to import class I controlled substances with the exception of transhipments, heels and used controlled substances. (h) Every kilogram of a controlled substance, and every controlled product, imported or exported in contravention of this subpart constitutes a separate violation of this subpart, thus no person may: (1) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance listed in Class I, Group I or Group II, in appendix A to this subpart from or to any foreign state not listed as a Party to the 1987 Montreal Protocol unless that foreign state is complying with the 1987 Montreal Protocol (See appendix C, Annex 2 of this subpart); (2) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance listed in Class I, Group III, Group IV or Group V, in appendix A to this subpart, from or to any foreign state not Party to the London Amendments (as noted in appendix C, Annex 1, to this subpart), unless that foreign state is complying with the London Amendments (as noted in appendix C, Annex 2, to this subpart); or (3) Import a controlled product from any foreign state not Party to the 1987 Montreal Protocol (as noted in appendix C, Annex 1, to this subpart), unless that foreign state is complying with the Protocol (as noted in appendix C, Annex 2, to this subpart).
