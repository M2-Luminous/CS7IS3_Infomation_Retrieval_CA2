In their statements to the judge in Elche the three accused denied belonging to the Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS, as one of them had told journalists. Tomorrow the judge will decide if the case is to be referred to the National High Court. [Correspondent Angeles Bandres] This was the moment this afternoon when the three Algerian policemen were taken to Fontcalent prison in Alicante. They were taken there after making statements to the judge in which they denied any link with the fundamentalist group FIS. [Judge Juan Francisco Vives] No, no, no. They completely deny belonging to the FIS. There is nothing to indicate that they are, and they consistently deny it. [Bandres] However, this morning one of them told a number of journalists that they belonged to the Islamic Salvation Front. [Unidentified journalist] Do you belong to any political group? [Unidentified man] To the FIS, the FIS, but we are also Muslims. [Bandres] According to the judge, the detainees could be accused of seizing an aircraft, but not terrorism, because they were not acting as an armed group.
