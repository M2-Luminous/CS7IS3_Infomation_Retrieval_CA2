Yesterday morning, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president of the state, visited the Science Town market in Haidian district, the Haizhong farm trade market, and the Wangfujing department store to acquaint himself with the state of market supplies and commodity prices prior to the Spring Festival. Jiang Zemin said: Fuel, rice, cooking oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea are the seven daily necessities for people. A small "shopping basket" affects thousands of households, as well as social stability. Neither reform nor development can be separated from stability. All matters that affect people's basic lives and vital interests are of prime importance. Party committees and governments at all levels, as well as all work departments, must place these matters at the top of their agendas and devote great efforts and close attention to solving them with a deep sense of responsibility. No oversight or negligence of duty is permitted in handling such matters. Comrade Jiang Zemin; Chen Xitong, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee; and Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan arrived in the Science Town non-staple food market in a minibus before 0900 [0100 GMT]. Located in Zhongguan village, the market primarily supplies and serves district residents from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and institutions of higher learning. Walking alongside shoppers, Jiang Zemin made inquiries to find out about commodity supplies, prices, varieties, and sales. He solicitously inquired about meat prices at the meat products counter. After finding out the prices of various meat products, he still showed some concern and asked: Were the prices lowered because of our visit today? The shop assistant told Jiang Zemin: We have used the same sales prices in recent days. At the general merchandise counter, Jiang Zemin made detailed inquiries about the shop assistant's working and living conditions, and the shop's business hours. He said: Workers and staff members at institutions of higher learning are busy in the daytime; we must ensure that they can buy food after work. At the entrance to a shop, Jiang Zemin shook hands with the shop's responsible individual and advised the latter: You must provide a good service to intellectuals and customers. After leaving the Science Town market, Jiang Zemin went to the nearby Haizhong farm trade market. The owners of more than 400 individual stalls in the building came from Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, and other provinces. These self-employed business operators from the countryside were pleasantly surprised by the general secretary's arrival at their counters. At a vegetable stall, Jiang Zemin asked about the prices of ginger, eggplant, French beans, chilis, and other vegetables and was advised of the stall's daily income. The owner, Zhao Xingfan, is a peasant from Baoding, Hebei Province. After finding out, to her surprise, that the customer who was making inquiries was the general secretary, the sincere and honest village woman said excitedly: General Secretary, it was very nice of you to have taken the trouble to come here. As he walked from one counter to another and proceeded from the first floor to the second, Jiang Zemin was greatly delighted by the brisk business and the wide selection of agricultural and sideline products at the market. At a meat counter Jiang Zemin specifically asked the owner whether the meats had been quarantined. He said emphatically: We must implement a strict quarantine system for all foods because consumers' health and safety are at stake. At another counter, Jiang Zemin struck up a conversation with a customer who was buying goods there. The customer was a female teacher from the No. 3 Zhongguan village primary school. Jiang Zemin asked: Is it convenient to buy goods here? After receiving a positive reply, he nodded in contentment and told the leading Beijing municipal comrades around him: Brisk business at country markets has enriched urban and rural markets; this is very important. Meanwhile, we must run state-owned shops efficiently and let them truly play their role in bringing prices under control, stabilizing the market, and ensuring supplies. At approximately 1000 [0200 GMT], Jiang Zemin arrived at the Wangfujing department store in downtown Beijing. Offering a wide array of goods, the department store was crowded with customers prior to the holidays. When he saw some high-class and brand-name garments in the clothing section, Jiang Zemin asked a shop assistant: Do the garments sell well? The shop assistant replied: More and more people are buying high-class commodities because their living standards have improved. In the footwear and headgear section, Jiang Zemin struck up a cordial conversation with a young couple from the Huabei oilfield and asked them if they could afford the prices. Upon learning they were newlyweds, Jiang Zemin joyously congratulated them. Shortly afterward, Jiang Zemin held informal discussions on market prices and supplies with responsible individuals and shop assistants from the Department Store (Group) Limited Company, shop assistants from the Xidan market and Chongwenmen vegetable market, comrades from the Andeli Neighborhood Committee in Dongcheng district and the Fengsheng Neighborhood Committee in Xicheng district, and price supervisors from Beijing Municipality, in order to directly hear their opinions. Participants in the discussions said: Fifteen years of reform and opening up have brought about very brisk commodity markets; people no longer have to worry about rationed supplies. On the other hand, commodity prices have undergone some changes during the process of socialist market economic development. The broad masses of people understand this situation. Recent substantial increases in grain and cooking oil prices, however, have indeed affected people's lives, especially the lives of retired workers and staff members. After hearing their remarks, Jiang Zemin said: An ancient Chinese saying goes: "Food is the people's primary concern." We should never underestimate the importance of residents' "shopping baskets" because they have a direct bearing on overall economic and social stability. The goal of our party and government is to serve the people. Therefore, our leading organs at all levels and the broad masses of cadres must always show concern for the people's livelihood, serve the people's interests in real earnest, conscientiously eliminate inconveniences and difficulties for the people, and provide them with adequate supplies. Jiang Zemin pointed out: Properly handling price-related work is of paramount importance. This is the general principle: We should always maintain commodity prices at levels that are affordable to urban and rural residents, as well as to people throughout society. This will help improve people's lives and benefit economic development and social stability. He said: Consumers in some areas scrambled to buy grain, cooking oil, and home electrical appliances for a time after late November in 1993. This was not caused by inadequate supplies or an imbalance between supply and demand; rather, it mainly resulted from a lack of experience in effectively regulating and controlling prices after grain and cooking oil prices were freed, and from price rises introduced by people who were seeking their own individual interests. Moreover, we did not sufficiently understand some reform measures that had been put into effect. The party Central Committee and the State Council placed great importance on this problem and promptly introduced many measures to stabilize the market, bring prices under control, and tighten regulation and control. The market is now moving toward a stable state and has essentially resumed normal operations. In his remarks, Jiang Zemin fully affirmed the work carried out by neighborhood committees and stated: Neighborhood committees are important bridges that bring the government and people closer together. They can help the party and government solve many problems and difficulties encountered by residents, defuse many contradictions among the people, and play a tremendous role in enhancing people's unity and promoting social stability. These vividly epitomize the superiority of the socialist system. In keeping with the new situation, we must greatly strengthen the work carried out by neighborhood committees; we should by no means weaken it. To ensure market supplies, Jiang Zemin urged leading cadres at all levels to go down to the grass roots and continue to devote great efforts to the "shopping basket" project. Departments in charge of industry and commerce, commodity prices, technical supervision, and market administration at all levels should strengthen management; sternly deal with and punish people who commit such illegal acts as seizing the opportunity to drive up prices, disrupting market order, selling fake and inferior products, seeking huge profits illegally, and entrapping people; and achieve better results in stabilizing the market. He said: The Spring Festival is approaching. All localities and departments must take practical and effective measures to take care of people, especially those in poverty-stricken areas, and make proper arrangements for supplies during the holidays so that people across the country will joyously celebrate the traditional festival. In closing, Jiang Zemin expressed his thanks for and conveyed his greetings on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council to workers and staff members who were working hard on the commercial and trade front. Accompanying Comrade Jiang Zemin during his investigations and studies were Zeng Peiyan, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, and Hu Guangbao, deputy director of the CPC Central Committee General Office.
