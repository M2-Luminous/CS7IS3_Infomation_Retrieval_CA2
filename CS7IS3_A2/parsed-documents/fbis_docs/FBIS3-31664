Zych recalled that the president's representative Lech Falandysz, was not a member of the committee but only took part in its proceedings. Zych thought that Walesa's descision would cause some damage. The chairman of the Constitutional Committee and leader of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) Aleksander Kwasniewski said that Walesa's decision was "a prelude" to the presidential elections which have to be held within the next two years. He stressed that the committee was working in accordance with the law concerning the preparatory work for the constitution, passed in 1991. Kwasniewski thought that there would eventually be a referendum on the constitution and that Walesa would oppose parliament's proposals. Kwasniewski reacted to Walesa's comment that "the postcommunists are feeling strong". He said that he did not know what "strength" the president was referring to. He thought Walesa was clearly trying to gain the support of the right wing. He added that there had been no "plan" to reject Walesa's proposals on the constitution. In the voting even Walesa's "favourites" in the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) had voted against Walesa's proposals, explained Kwasniewski. The chairman of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee, Bronislaw Geremek, said on "Radio 3" on Tuesday that in politics one should not feel insulted. Geremek also thought that Walesa was manoeuvring before the presidential elections. He said that his party the Democratic Union (UD) had voted to accept that Walesa's proposals would be worked on simply because it had wanted to show resepect towards the president of the Republic of Poland. He did not think that Walesa's proposals were good because the president wanted parliament to be dissolved if it rejected the constitution.
