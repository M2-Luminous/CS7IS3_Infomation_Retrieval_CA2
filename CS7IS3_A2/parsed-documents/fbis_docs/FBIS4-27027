Speaking at the Moscow State University, Qian said establishing and developing good-neighborly and friendly relations with neighboring countries has occupied a significant position in China's foreign policy. Furthering good relations with Russia, China's largest neighbor, has a special significance for the Chinese foreign activities, he said. China and Russia, two of the powers in the world, may contribute to world peace, stability and development if they strengthen their bilateral cooperation, said the Chinese vice premier.

Trade volumes between the two countries have hit the highest level in history, he added. However, Qian admitted there have emerged some problems in bilateral expanded contacts, mainly in the trade sphere involving individual businessmen, because of a lack of timely laws and regulations. The Chinese Government is against illegal trade activities and illegal immigration, Qian stated, stressing the need for both governments to strengthen cooperation in protecting organized and normal trade between citizens of the two countries. China and Russia, with huge economic potentials respectively, may complement each other in economy, and have big prospects for developing friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefits, the Chinese vice premier said. He underlined the need for both nations to make big efforts to expand bilateral cooperation in the fields of economic-trade, science and technology, raise level and quality of cooperation and and create conditions to bring bilateral trade step by step into internationally-normal way. While visiting China, Russian leaders including President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and parliament's lower house chairman Ivan Rybkin have reaffirmed that Russia sees its relations with China as one of priorities in its foreign policy, Qian said. During his upcoming visit to Russia in autumn, Chinese leader Jiang Zemin is expected to discuss the future of bilateral relations between China and Russia with Yeltsin, procced from the view of the next century, the Chinese vice premier noted. Faced with the complicated international situation, he said, China will firmly continue to pursue an independent peaceful foreign policy and develop friendly and cooperative relations with foreign countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co- existence. China, which is concentrating its efforts on economic development, will not join any arms race, will not join any military bloc, will never seek hegemony and will always stand firm as a strong safeguard of world peace, Qian stated.
