FBIS4-48864 "drafr104_e_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Taylor Reiterates Charge Against Nigerian Troops Taylor Reiterates Charge Against Nigerian Troops AB3005194094 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 30 May 94 AB3005194094 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] Charles Taylor, the leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], says he also has a problem with the Nigerians who have the biggest contingent in ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. His NPFL is currently fighting the Liberian Peace Council, LPC, in the southeast. Tonight, Mr. Taylor called us up from Gbarnga to complain about ECOMOG and he said the Nigerians were being less than helpful. On the line, Robin White asked him what the problem was. [Begin recording] [Taylor] Well, Robin, the problem is that the LPC is organized and put together by the Nigerian part of ECOMOG here. There has been an intensification of the war in the Rivercess and Sinoe areas and it is traced directly to the Nigerians. We do not understand why the Nigerians, instead of making peace in Liberia, are just trying to exacerbate the situation. We just don't understand this, whether we should have to fight them now and the LPC or just continue with the LPC. [White] Are you threatening to fight the Nigerians? [Taylor] Well, I am saying that I don't know who the enemy is, and we have to fight the enemy and they appear to be the enemy. [White] Well, how can you possibly say that? Surely, the Nigerians are there to try and bring peace. [Taylor] Robin, everywhere in the world right now, the information is clear. We have POW's that testify that arms and ammunition are being given by the Nigerians. As you very well know, under the Security Council resolution there is an arms embargo on Liberia. Where else can a brand new group, external to the Cotonou [Accord], get sophisticated arms and ammunitions unless these rascals are selling them arms and ammunition? And, it is very aggravating. Liberians are dying here daily and the problem is no longer Liberians themselves. It is those that are here to keep the peace, and especifically the Nigerian contingent. [White] Some people might say that the problem is that you are losing the war and you are looking for a scapegoat. [Taylor] Robin, even if we were losing the war, we want to lose it in a very clear way. We are not losing the war, but the problem here is if you have people that say that they are peacekeepers and are just trying to make money by selling arms and ammunition and shedding the blood of Liberians, the question is: Will this crisis stop now or is it doomed to expand? And we are fed up with this particular situation and we may have to go after LPC wherever we have to go. [White] How bad are things looking for you, militarily? [Taylor] Not very bad, but the problem is the peacekeeprs should not be (?giving) arms and ammunition. Our officials are being harassed. They are being disrespected. They have no regard for this government here. I am not sure that these guys can do the job here, or if they should just pack up, and if I had a choice I think the Nigerians should think about leaving us alone because they have gone too far.
