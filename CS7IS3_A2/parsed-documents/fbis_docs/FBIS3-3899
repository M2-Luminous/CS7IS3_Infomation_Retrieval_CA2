The sub-heading to the remaining part of the article is "The Two Pillars of a Theoretical Edifice." [end editor's note]) The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics represents a great theoretical achievement for our party in the new historical period. This theory has integrated the universal principles of Marxism with the concrete realities of China and has taken shape on the basis of summarizing our previous practical experience, especially the new experience gained in building socialism since the commencement of reforms and the open policy. This theory represents the crystallization of our party's and people's wisdom. The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiates a whole range of breakthroughs in traditional Marxism. It represents new and important developments in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. It is Marxism of contemporary China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the founder of contemporary Marxism. His related works, especially the recently published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, reveal the most important and highly original thinking during the process of forming and developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, is rich in content and profound in ideology. Let me now talk about some of the things I have learned from this important breakthrough made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in the concept of socialism. A New Concept of Socialism The most conspicuous aspect of this theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the creative development of Marxism is that it expounds a new concept of socialism, one which is different from that espoused by traditional Marxism. In order to explain that this is a new concept of socialism one needs to recall history. Traditional Marxism vigorously stresses class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is because during the lifetimes of Marx, Engels and even Lenin class struggle was, in reality, widespread and manifested itself quite sharply. The doctrines of Marx and Engels, taken in their literal sense, sought the emancipation of both the proletariat and the whole of mankind and the eventual realization of communism. However, because the times in which they lived reflected the harsh rule exercised by the bourgeoisie, and because of the fact that the bourgeoisie would neither relinquish its rule nor automatically retreat from the stage of history, the proletariat therefore had to use revolutionary means to overthrow bourgeois rule and, moreover, by means of the dictatorship of the proletariat, protect the newly established socialist system. Only then could it liberate itself from capitalist oppression. Under such circumstances scientific socialism could not but change its emphasis from general inquiries into the question of the emancipation of the proletariat and mankind to that of probing questions related to the conditions required for emancipating the proletariat. Engels, in his work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, defined scientific socialism as "the doctrine of conditions required for the emancipation of the proletariat." At that time the so-called conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat referred to the elimination of capitalist exploitation and oppression and thereby the establishment of the socialist system through the proletarian revolution and dictatorship of the proletariat. However, as Marx and Engels saw it, this was merely the first step in the emancipation of the proletariat and there were still questions to be resolved in relation to its further emancipation. In the Communist Manifesto and in many other works they repeatedly observed that the proletariat had to achieve its own complete emancipation only by emancipating the whole of mankind. This so-called emancipation of the whole of mankind is none other than the implementation of communism, which in turn is the final goal in emancipating the proletariat. Thus the conditions required for emancipation are far more complex than just revolution or the dictatorship of the proletariat. Since the whole of mankind must be emancipated, the productive forces in society should be highly developed, material goods should be abundant and peoples's spiritual horizons should be greatly enhanced. Only in this way can mankind become the master of nature, society and itself; only in this way can one traverse the narrow-mindedness of the bourgeois right and genuinely implement "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need." This mission is different from that of a revolution or a dictatorship which, through radical means, brings about a sudden change in society. It is, from start to finish, a gradual process of change from a quantitative to a partially qualitative nature; it is a gradual cumulative progression of a new nature. For a country which, in any case, is economically and culturally backward it is necessary to undergo even greater hardship. These ideas of Marx and Engels are an important element of scientific socialism; however, they have gradually faded from people's minds. Because Marx and Engels were never able to see with their own eyes the emancipation of the proletariat from the capitalist system and, moreover, since no such emancipation took place for a period even after their deaths, but indeed, on the contrary, the bourgeoisie continued its exploitation and oppression of the proletariat, the urgent and practical task of the Marxist political parties in each country became the realization of the first stage of emancipation of the proletariat. Thence, the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat became the central theme of Marxism. In this way, an incomplete understanding of Marxism affected Marxists for several decades. Lenin led the emancipation of the Russian proletariat from Czarist rule and thereby transformed a militaristic, feudal imperialist state into a socialist country. Although the Russian proletariat overthrew the rule of the exploiting classes, the exploiting classes nevertheless could not reconcile themselves to their defeat and they collaborated with external imperialist forces to crazily attack the newly established Soviet power. This created a situation whereby, although Russia had already overthrown the exploitative ruling classes, it nevertheless found itself still embroiled in class struggle. Thereupon, the goal of achieving communism and the emancipation of the whole of mankind became a distant ambition. This is why Lenin still frequently pondered upon the questions of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Later the internal situation of the Soviet Union and the international environment both improved, and the main emphasis in Lenin's deliberations began to change. Questions of economics and the development of productive forces clearly gained more importance in Lenin's works. For example, he states: "After the proletariat achieves political power in the state its most fundamental interest is in increasing the quantity of products and in vastly expanding social productive forces. This task has already been clearly stated in the program of the Russian Communist Party. In today's post-war situation, with a bankrupt economy, starvation and destruction, this task is even more important." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 586) He also states: "If we cannot rebuild our country's economy, then we shall lag behind and continue to lag behind the big capitalist powers, and as a result we shall be vulnerable to attack." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 384) Lenin even makes the following assertion: "In the final analysis labor productivity is the most important thing in guaranteeing the success of the new social system." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 4, p 16) In talking about the party's work, Lenin states that the party must improve all aspects of its work so that it can lead the Soviet economic construction. In 1921, Lenin addressed the realities facing Russia by decisively advocating the New Economic Policy which, in essence, was a policy to improve Russia's economic circumstances by developing a commodity economy and increasing the level of production. Unfortunately, the untimely death of Lenin brought about an immediate end to these very valuable explorations. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong the CPC consistently emphasized that the universal truths of Marxism and Leninism must be integrated with the actual realities of China. During his long revolutionary practice Comrade Mao Zedong consistently upheld a creative Marxist attitude of rejecting bookishness and dogmatism and choosing to use China's national conditions as a starting point. He led the whole party to a glorious victory along a democratic revolutionary path which had its own Chinese characteristics. However, as China found itself in a prolonged revolutionary war, the Chinese democratic revolution was astonishingly complex, and this could not but be reflected in the works of Mao Zedong at that time. During this period Comrade Mao Zedong's most important theoretical achievement was that of the theory on new democracy. In the important work On New Democracy, Comrade Mao Zedong theoretically expounds a whole host of questions, including the relationship between the democratic and socialist revolutions, the composition of the future state and the politics, economics, culture, and so on of new democracy. However, when all is said and done, it is nevertheless a theoretical summary of the practical experience of a democratic revolution, and in no way can it involve questions on how to undertake construction work after the victory of the democratic revolution. After the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong led the whole party in completing the remaining tasks of the democratic revolution, rebuilding the economy, implementating socialist reforms and the commencement of industrialization. This clearly shows the importance our party gave to the development of productive forces and the building of the economy for a particular period. The Eighth CPC National Congress, which was convened in September 1956, testifies to this fact, the congress clearly highlighting the central task of the party as being the development of productive forces. However, shortly afterward, because of the drastic changes in the international situation, our party made the "leftist" mistake of over-enlarging the scope of class struggle. Consequently, the strategic plan drawn up by the eighth party congress, with the development of productive forces as its centerpiece, was never really put into effect and came to a premature end. Thereafter, we became enmeshed in the "struggle philosophy" and constant, never- ending class struggle. That is to say, having completed the task of socialist transformation and having established a socialist system, just when we ought to have changed the emphasis of the whole party's work to that of building the economy, we never really undertook the change; alternatively it could be said that while class struggle was already diminishing and the need to strengthen the economy was growing, we were still continuing to practice and preach the importance of class struggle. This meant not only that we lost a very good opportunity to develop the economy, but also that we lost an excellent chance to break the fetters of tradition and create a new theoretical pattern. The above is a historical perspective on the traditional concept of socialism. This concept of socialism has its rationality, i.e. when class struggle becomes an important reality and when the only means open to the proletariat for emancipating itself from exploitation is through revolution and dictatorship, then this interpretation is correct. However, when the proletariat has already been emancipated from exploitation and it needs to greatly enhance productive capacity in order to significantly increase material and spiritual civilization and thereby create conditions for its own continued emancipation, then this concept is not completely correct, or is incorrect. In such circumstances one needs to take as the centerpiece of this theory the conditions required for the continued emancipation of the proletariat as espoused, but never developed, by Marx and Engels at the time. Moreover, they should be creatively developed by incorporating the special features of this new age and the circumstances of each particular country. The concept of socialism as conveyed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is such a concept of socialism. This concept of socialism takes the liberation and development of productive forces as the turning point, the establishment of a high degree of material culture and spiritual enlightenment as the condition and the elimination of polarization and the creation of common prosperity as the goal in establishing its basic theoretical framework. Through reading the related works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, especially Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we can understand that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's constant pondering of questions relating to Marxism, communism and socialism all concern that of developing productive forces. In June 1984, in a discussion with Japanese friends, he said: "What is socialism? What is Marxism? In the past our understanding of these questions was not entirely clear. Marxism attaches the greatest importance to developing productive forces. We state that socialism is the initial stage of communism and that when a higher stage of communism is achieved then we must implement the practice of from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. To do this society needs highly developed productive forces and an abundance of material goods and wealth. Therefore, the most fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces. The superiority of socialism is, in the final analysis, embodied in its ability to develop productive forces faster and better than the capitalist system and, moreover, on the basis of developing productive capacity, to constantly improve the material well-being of the people." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Vol 3, p 63. Hereinafter, quotations from this work will be designated by the page number only) In August 1985, Comrade Deng, at a meeting with Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe, said: "We have summarized the experiences of several decades of practicing socialism. In the past we were not absolutely clear what socialism and Marxism were. Another word for Marxism is communism. Our struggle over many years has been for communism, our ideal is to achieve communism. During our most difficult periods the ideal of communism was our spiritual pillar. Countless people sacrificed themselves for this ideal. Communism is a society without exploitation, a society abundant in goods which practices the principle of from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. Unless conditions exist for material abundance then one cannot put into effect the principle of to each according to his need. In order to implement communism it is absolutely necessary to complete all the tasks in the socialist stage. The tasks involved in building socialism are many; however, the most basic is to develop productive forces. On the basis of developing productive forces socialism will prove superior to capitalism and will create the material basis for the implementation of communism." (p 137) In October 1987, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, during a meeting with Janos Kader, general secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, reiterated his viewpoint: "Marxism is also called communism. The basic principle of Marxism is to implement `from each according to his ability, to each according to his work' in the socialist stage, and during the communist period to implement `from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.' To practice to each according to his need requires an abundance of goods. Can this be achieved in a poor society? Can communism be poverty-stricken? On the basis of synthesizing these experiences we have concluded that for the whole historical stage of socialism the central task is to develop productive forces. This is real Marxism." (pp 254-255) Similar assertions are numerous. From these expositions we can see that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has all along considered the question of productive forces to be a key point in his theoretical explorations on what is Marxism, what is communism and socialism, and how to effectively build socialism in China, thereby creating a new concept of socialism which is different from the traditional concept. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories concerning the nature of socialism, the motivation for the development of a socialist society and the guarantee for the development of a socialist society form the cornerstone of a new concept of socialism. The Cornerstone of a Theoretical Edifice In an important talk given during an inspection in south China in early 1992 Comrade Deng expounded a new view on the nature of socialism. He said: "The intrinsic nature of socialism is the liberation of productive forces, the development of productive forces, the abolition of exploitation and the eradication of polarization in order to reach the final objective of common prosperity." (p 373) What is new about this view? We can make a comparison with the traditional concept of socialism. Although the traditional concept of socialism gives no definition of the intrinsic nature of socialism, nevertheless, over the years, the traditional viewpoint has formed that the factors determining a socialist system are: 1) The socialist system of public ownership; 2) to each according to his work; 3) the dictatorship of the proletariat. These three elements are generally considered to be the special features highlighting the intrinsic nature of socialism. Although these three elements are very important, nevertheless this concept has a major weakness because it overlooks the significance of productive forces and common prosperity. That is to say, it overlooks the goal of socialism and overlooks the material basis for achieving that goal. What really is the goal of socialism? Over the years countless high-minded people have made great sacrifices for the cause of socialism, but why have they done so? Comrade Deng has categorically answered this question by saying: "The goal of socialism is to achieve common prosperity for the people of the whole country without the polarization of society." (pp 110-111) In September 1986, in response to a question from the American reporter Mike Wallace, Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed that the principle of socialism was common prosperity, and that the prerequisite condition for achieving this was the development of productive forces. He said: "During the socialist period the most important task is to develop productive forces so that society's material goods will continue to expand and the people's livelihood will improve day by day in such a way that the material conditions are created for implementing communism. In the same way that one cannot have a poor communist society, one cannot have a poor socialist society. Getting rich is not a crime. However, what we call getting rich differs from what you talk about. Socialist wealth belongs to the people; the creation of wealth in a socialist society is for the common good. The principles of socialism are: 1) The development of production; 2) common prosperity." (pp 171-172) From these pronouncements one can see that in his theory on the intrinsic nature of socialism, Comrade Deng places common prosperity and the development of productive forces as its centerpiece, that the former is the goal and the latter is the material basis required for achieving this goal. If there is no development of productive forces to create a material base, then common prosperity is merely empty words. Therefore, of these two points, developing productive forces is more fundamental. This is why Comrade Deng sees development of productive forces as the "most fundamental task" (p 63), the "primary task" (p 116), and the "central task" (p 131) of socialism, as well as the criterion for assessing right and wrong, gains and losses. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has not only linked the development of productive forces to the intrinsic nature of socialism, but also linked it to the future and destiny of socialism. He emphasized: "Our country's overriding task at the present time is to wholeheartedly carry out the four modernizations. We have given full rein to the intrinsic features of socialism and even employed certain capitalist methods (employing them as methods only) to speed up the development of productive forces." He added: "China has no choice but to take this path. Only this path can lead to prosperity and boom." (pp 149-150) It can be clearly seen from the above that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's viewpoint on the intrinsic nature of socialism is different from that of the traditionalists. The traditional view of socialism omitted the two principles concerning the goal of socialism--common prosperity and the material base, i.e. the development of productive forces, needed to achieve that goal. Consequently, the traditional concept of socialism was inaccurate and incomplete. The establishment of the ideas outlined above means that on this most important question of what socialism is, Comrade Deng has shown the difference between his concept of socialism and that of the traditional socialist and that of traditional Marxism. This has laid a firm foundation for the concept of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
