Complaints against the tax service frequently are mutually exclusive and range from accusations of incompetent tax collection, which hurts the revenue part of the federal budget, to accusations of thoughtlessly excessive tax burden on trade and producer organizations, which hampers the development of entrepreneurship in Russia. A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent asked Vladimir Gusev, the head of the State Tax Service of the Russian Federation, to respond to these complaints. [Ulyanov] Vladimir Vasilyevich, the tax reform in Russia has been under way for two years. Over this time, a principally new tax system has been created. What are its general features, and how similar is it to tax systems of other countries? [Gusev] Briefly, it is a total of more than 40 types of taxes, duties, and dues that represent a variety of forms of taxation; the tax service carries out control over their receipt into the consolidated federal budget. Largely, the same principles of tax system design and structure are typical in the West and in the world practice in general. The forms of taxation depend on the source and form of income (profit, earned income, interest, dividends, etc.); on whether property itself is taxed (land, real estate, or other property, etc.) or the act of its transfer (inheritance or gift); income formed in production or the process of consumption, import and export of goods in and out of the territory of the country; and so on. On the basis of the experience of developed countries, the following main types of taxes have been introduced in Russia: tax on profit (income), property tax, and value-added tax, as well as other taxes on goods and services. Both the level of revenue from the same kind of taxes and the tax rates of taxes of the same name differ considerably in different countries and also depend on the economic situation. For instance, income tax collected from physical persons in Russia last year amounted to 12 percent of the total volume of tax receipts, while in the United States it accounts for more than 45 percent of budget revenue. In Japan, one-fourth of the tax burden is composed of the corporate tax (tax on income of legal entities), which is approximately twice as high as the share of similar revenue in Great Britain and considerably higher than in Germany and the United States. The value-added tax is the highest in Germany and Great Britain. In Russia, 75 percent of the budget revenue currently is formed by tax on profit and indirect taxes. [Ulyanov] On the basis of the experience of two years of work, what changes need to be done to the Russian tax system? [Gusev] In any case, nothing drastic. In order for the tax reform to be completely implemented, a certain time is required for the new tax relations to get established. Nevertheless, further improvement and fine-tuning of the system are needed, of course. For instance, currently the State Tax Service together with the Ministry of Finance is completing the preparation of the Law on Amendments to the Russian Federation Law on the Foundations of the Tax System in the Russian Federation. We propose to considerably expand the right of local bodies of authority in setting regional and local taxes, to reduce the multitude of existing types of taxes, and make some other changes as well. Also submitted to the State Duma for consideration are the Law on Amendments to Some Russian Federation Laws With the Aim of Implementing Additional Measures on Timely and Complete Transfer of Taxes and Other Compulsory Payments Into the Budget, and draft amendments to seven tax laws, as well as the draft of the new version of the Law on Road Funds and a draft Law on Transportation Tax. Under conditions of acute budget deficit and limited financial resources, it is important to establish procedures for forming and controlling the use of state nonbudget funds. In the estimate of the Russian State Committee on Statistics, the total volume of means in these funds amounted to 19.9 percent of the GDP, while the share of all tax revenue comprised 23.4 percent of the GDP. Hence the necessity to ensure rational use of these enormous means. [Ulyanov] Do you feel some resistance to your work on the part of higher state bodies and regional leadership? [Gusev] We have established very constructive relations in the government. All of our proposals--developed jointly with the Ministry of Finance on amendments and additions to tax laws--the government, after making certain changes, promptly submits for the consideration of the State Duma. How the work on the proposed draft laws will proceed in the State Duma we do not know yet, since we have no experience of working with it, but, in my opinion, there are currently no reasons for concern in this respect. Relations with Russian Federation components and regions are another matter. Last year, and actually this one, too, we frequently had various problems and misunderstandings, and, in a number of cases, even conflict situations. For instance, last year 38 regions did not transfer the full amount of VAT into the federal budget, and 14 regions did not transfer a full amount of taxes on profit. With some republics (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Karelia, and Yakutia), agreements have been signed on the transfer of part of the tax collected on their territory into the federal budget. Overall in 1993, the budget received more than R38 trillion and $340 million [as published] in tax revenue. The bulk of the income was received through tax on profit and indirect taxes (more than 74 percent of all revenue). Of other types of taxes, income tax from physical persons provided a steady flow of revenue. Last year resource fees and property taxes began to play a more serious role in forming the income part of the budget. [Ulyanov] What kind of tax violations did you encounter most often last year? [Gusev] The most typical violations were concealing or understating income, falsifying accounting data, incorrect application of tax rates and preferences, and depositing foreign currency earnings in foreign banks for the purpose of tax evasion. In these conditions, we considered it very important to monitor the activities of commercial banks, which by their actions often create conditions that help to conceal profit from taxation by illegally using the payments due to the budget as their credit resources. That is, dishonest businessmen deposit their receipts into accounts not registered with the tax organs. In addition, tax laws are frequently violated in the part of tax revenue. For instance, an audit conducted by specialists of the State Tax Service's central staff in the Ingosstrakh joint-stock insurance society found understatement of income by more than R9 billion. [Ulyanov] To what extent does the tax service personnel meet the tasks set for the service? [Gusev] Overall, as of 1 May of this year, the tax system had a staff of more than 149,000. Of them, 96.8 percent have higher or vocational high school education (in the beginning of last year, this figure was lower--91.8 percent), including 50.9 percent with higher education. The leading educational centers for training tax service specialists are the Financial Continuing Education Institute of the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance, the Financial Academy under the Russian Federation Government, and professional training centers in St. Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod, as well as continuing education courses in Kaluga. Currently similar retraining centers are being opened in other cities as well. Successful interaction with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the EU Commission, and Denmark's Ministry of Taxation led to establishing in Moscow in September of last year an International Training Tax Center for training specialists for tax organizations. By the way, 300 specialists already have taken a training course there, and another 900 are currently studying there. Within the framework of this project and simply on the basis of bilateral relations, training and methodology seminars are held for the State Tax Service personnel in Russia and abroad, with the participation of the tax services of the United States, Denmark, Sweden, FRG, and France. [Ulyanov] Taxpayers quite often complain that they cannot always find the new tax laws. What does your service do in this very important sphere of relations with the population? [Gusev] Such complaints have indeed been received in the past, and frankly, they still come. The information service does not yet exist in the scope we have envisaged it. This does not mean, however, that we do not see the problem and do nothing about it. No, we have set up our press center, beefed it up with personnel and technical equipment. But we also have unused reserves. For instance, this year we plan to begin publishing VESTNIK NALOGOVOY SLUZHBY, in which we will publish, along with official documents, comments of our staff on various aspects of tax practice.
