FBIS4-5582 "dreas070_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 South Korea U.S. Ambassador Laney Cited on UR Accord U.S. Ambassador Laney Cited on UR Accord SK1204023794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0221 GMT 12 Apr 94 SK1204023794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney complained Tuesday that South Korea is only playing up the negative side of the Uruguay Round [UR] trade accord, ignoring its positive effects. Laney also said the United States has no intention of using Section 301 of the Omnibus Trade Bill against South Korea. The recent resurrection of the "Super 301" provision was aimed at Japan, he said. Washington will not apply Super 301 against Seoul since the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea is not as large as that with Japan, Laney added. "The Uruguay Round means that world markets are open to Korea, not just that Korean markets are open to the world," Laney said in a speech to a breakfast meeting of leading industrial managers sponsored by the International Management Institute, an affiliate of the Federation of Korean Industries. The most important open door for Korea, in fact, is the Uruguay Round, Laney said. "Yet I read in the papers... that the round is a loss for Korea -- that countermeasures' have to be devised to limit the damage imposed from abroad," notably the United States, he said. Under the Uruguay Round, however, Korea does not have to climb high tariff walls in other countries, he said. Korean products, which are excellent, will compete even more effectively in the world market. The Uruguay Round hasn't sounded the death knell for farming in Korea, Laney insisted. The farming population has already declined 50 percent in one generation. "That's not something the United States has forced upon Korea. It's already been happening for 30 years." Open markets mean more investment and more technology for Korea, Laney went on. Korea is already one of the world's largest beneficiaries of free trade, and will continue to reap gains in the future. The ambassador said, "trade and openness mean that Korea has come of age. Korea is no longer weak and poor. It is one of the 15 largest economies in the world -- larger than most of the countries in Europe." The United States is proud of its relationship with Korea, proud of its military and commercial alliance, Laney said. "But we are not in alliance to exploit each other, to take unfair advantage, but to find ways that we can grow together in more prosperous freedom."
