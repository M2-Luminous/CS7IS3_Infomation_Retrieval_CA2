It is so far the only point under discussion and it seems as if it will continue to be discussed for some time. UNITA is presently examining the organic composition of the national police so that it can then present its views. Reporter Joao Ligio reports. The Lusaka II peace talks resumed today with only a meeting of an ad hoc commission established to carry out plenary sessions without disruption. The face-to-face meeting which took place today did not last long. The meeting began at 1000 and two hours later it had already ended with another request for a break. The session began with the government giving detailed information on the national police law, as requested by UNITA. UNITA then immediately asked for another break to study the law. Since there was no time limit for studying the law, the next session will depend on the speed with which UNITA studies the law, which it says was approved by a parliament in which it did not take part. This is another step backward by the Black Cockerel's men, who are trying to gain time, since so far, they have not reached a common negotiating stand within their ranks. It has also been learned that UNITA negotiators received serious warnings, because of UNITA's intransigence, during a meeting they held with U.S. Congressmen yesterday at Victoria Falls, 473 km from Lusaka, along the border with Zimbabwe.
