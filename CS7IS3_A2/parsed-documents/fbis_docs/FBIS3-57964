Silvio, But We had Already Advanced Those Proposals Years Ago" -- first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] [Text] Ponte di Legno -- "[Fininvest President] Berlusconi's proposals? Very interesting, but he is saying things we have already been saying for ages." The Senator [Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi] is in a good mood. To begin 1994 -- the year which he has always forecast as "the year of the Samurai" -- on the right track, Umberto Bossi even ventured to ski down one of Mount Adamello's slopes. He is not [skiing champion] Alberto Tomba, but he was recognized, approached, stopped, and acclaimed by other fellow skiers. "I could hardly stand on my skis any longer," he said happily, back in his Ponte di Legno home. He then resumed the subject of Silvio Berlusconi and the center alliance -- the so-called liberal-democratic common house. [Da Rold] The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] is very active in this period, is he not? [Bossi] Clearly, he wants to take the initiative. However, sooner or later he must make a few things clear. I believe Berlusconi will not take any votes away from us. Of course, we can talk...about anything. The only thing that must be clear is that it would not be a good idea for anyone to attempt to construct some sort of device to steal votes from the League. In that case, the only thing that would perhaps be achieved would be to allow the Left to win. [Da Rold] If I may just say so, Bossi, we have been hearing talk about a center alliance for almost a month now, but so far all we have witnessed is a sort of senseless charade, and the fact is you are all running out of time. [Bossi] Of course, we must work things out in a rather short timescale, a couple of weeks, once the government has resigned. However, let me add immediately that, for the time being, there is still no "liberal-democratic common house." But this does not mean that an agreement has to be reached before the elections. It could be reached afterwards. Let us first see what each one of us can achieve. [Da Rold] But there was talk of having common candidates.... [Bossi] We can offer a few constituencies in the ricefields or in some suburb or other.... But let us not joke too much, if you please! [Da Rold] Do you mean, then, that the League is not prepared to give anything away? [Bossi] We have built a major electoral force over the past few years, we are the shock troops. We have done this to fight for the North's freedom. What do you think? That anticommunism -- a coalition based on opposition to the communists -- is enough to build a common identity? Of course not! There is the problem of profound constitutional reform, of a thorough reform of the state. We cannot elude this problem. Tax reform and fighting for deregulation are not enough. [Da Rold] In short, you do not want any awkward allies in the North. [Bossi] In the North, to begin with, there is the League. The League was born from the people and is fighting for the people. Others have televison networks and newspapers, we have the votes. We will always join forces against the Left's centralism, we have nothing to share with Stalin's offspring. This is not the key issue. What is at stake here is the North's liberty, which is being curtailed by a more complex, more complicated form of centralism. This is what we have to be clear about. If there are any representative forces in the South, which manage to win votes down there, we are interested in them. That way we would succeed in carrying out the federal revolution. [Da Rold] Otherwise? [Bossi] We fight politically. I always try to compromise -- to use this term. But beware of playing games with the North's freedom, of intefering with its liberation, because swift retribution may follow. [Da Rold] In the meantime, it looks as if you are having problems with the election date. When do you think the elections will take place? [Bossi] I have noticed that nobody is talking of a precise date anymore. Exactly what we predicted is happening. I have always been convinced of this. There is somebody out there, belonging to a gang of rogues and crooks, who is trying to delay the inevitable. [Da Rold] So you have no hesitation regarding the no-confidence vote on Ciampi? [Bossi] What hesitation? He should resign and disband the whole works. We must hold elections. Every postponement of the elections is aimed against us. [Da Rold] Are you not concerned, however, in terms of your image, about one fact? Tomorrow you will have to testify in the Cusani trial in relation to the well-known Patelli "mishap." [reference to former League functionary charged with receiving illegal funding] [Bossi] If these guys think they have weakened us by framing us, they are mistaken. People have understood very well what is going on. They have understood the hypocrisy of a law which puts bribes and voluntary contributions on a par. And they have understood many other things too.... [Da Rold] Are you not annoyed, however, at being among the guests invited to the opening of the judicial year in Milan? [Bossi] I cannot afford to get angry. I have more important things to do.... The tires on my car are worn out, and here it is still snowing. I have had to wait years to finally be in the company of my three children. I would like to do some skiing, and I also have to think about the wedding with Manuela. If they are happy, so be it. I would like to recall only one thing: It was the League's strength that enabled the clean hands inquiry to be undertaken. Perhaps they would like to close it now. [Da Rold] Tomorrow you will be in court, before [Operation Clean Hands Judge] Di Pietro. [Bossi] I hope [former Montedison manager] Sama will also be there to explain a few things. Besides, there is something I would like to say about this Cusani: Was he or was he not one of Craxi's men? It would be interesting to find out. Also, I would like to speak with Cusani's lawyer, who managed to bring the League into the picture through a question which, I believe, did not exactly help the defense.
