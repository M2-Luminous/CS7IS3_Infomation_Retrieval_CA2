Most of the clashes are between the Bosnian army and Serb secessionist forces, and northeastern Bosnia has seen the biggest increase in military activity over the past three days, UN spokesman Eric Chaperon said. However, on Saturday [18 June] night Bosnian army forces opened fire on a British UN observation post in the eastern enclave of Gorazde, Chaperon said. The British force fired back, he added without saying if there were casualties. At dawn Sunday Bosnian Moslem and Serb forces also clashed in Gorazde, he added. [passage omitted] Chaperon said the head of UN forces in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose of Britain, sent a letter Saturday to the commanders of the Bosnian army and Serb forces asking for strict observance of the ceasefire. Rose cited incidents in which one or the other side had broken the truce. [passage omitted] Chaperon also reported that a Danish UN medical team, due to travel from Sarajevo to Gorazde, has been stuck in between for five days at the Serb-held town of Rogatica after refusing to submit to Serb searches of their equipment.
