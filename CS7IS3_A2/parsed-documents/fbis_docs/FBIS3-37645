"The responsibility will rest with those who try to resolve controversial issues in the region by violence", head of the main headquarters of Russian border troops general Aleksandr Tymko told Interfax. Amid renewed tension on the Tajik-Afghan border, two Russian posts came under cross border mortar and rocket fire on Monday, Tymko said. In a separate incident, the rebels mounted rocket fire on one other post on Saturday. One Russian soldier was injured. There have been more than 50 such attacks on Russian troops since early this year. Agreements on an end to the attacks on Russian posts have failed to work on parts of the border, Tymko said.
