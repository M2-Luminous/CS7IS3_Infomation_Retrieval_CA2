The Iranian ambassador in Bern, Mohammad Reza Alborzi, said his Swiss counterpart in Tehran was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday [19 January] to explain Switzerland's position. The ambassador was speaking after the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation suspended a cooperation agreement with Iranian Television. The move follows reports that Iranian Television was used as a front by people involved in the assassination three years ago of a former Iranian prime minister, Shahpur Bakhtiyar.
