The Hosokawa cabinet has gained a support rate of 70-odd percent, the highest of any cabinet, and has the people's hopes centered on it. But reform is difficult in any country. For example, the reform that Gorbachev carried out in the former Soviet Union also only destroyed the old system. It was, so to speak, merely the first act of the restoration. Gorbachev tried to bring a market economy into the Soviet Union's centralized-type controlled economy by promoting perestroyka. That is, he caused change. But, although he destroyed, after that, he did not know how to build. When the moves of various forces, such as the military, began to be threatening, he attempted a unipolar concentration of authority. This time, Yeltsin is about to trod the same path. In short, up to the destroying part, up to the part of causing change, it can be done with comparative ease in the information society of today. But putting the result in order and causing a safe landing is very difficult. Even with the Berlin wall, destroying was easy. But causing East Germany to have as soft a landing as West Germany was too difficult, so even Chancellor Kohl fell from the zenith of his popularity to its nadir in a mere two years. In the United States, with the word "change," Clinton defeated the Republican Party administration that had continued for 12 years. But, now, Americans are reacting by rejecting such things as the increased taxes and decreased government spending that accompany the change that Clinton is trying to carry out. The American people were fascinated by the word "change," but they are saying "no" to its content. Then, what about the case of Japan? When it comes to whether the coalition government can cause the public to make a soft landing in a good direction, it is very doubtful. Because this government is not something that the public chose, something that received the mandate of the people; politically, too, it is the product of a common-law marriage. Before the election, the Japanese people did not even know how the three new parties differed. They faced the election without even having been told such things as how Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger] differ from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and whether or not the Japan New Party and Shinseito would join together after the election. The result, as might be expected, was that the number-one party chosen by the people was the LDP, but after the election, a certain politician, who was the strongest, organized the present government with Hosokawa as a figurehead. The Japanese people went along with Hosokawa because, first of all, this too, was certainly change. The slogan, From National Sovereignty to Consumer Sovereignty, that Hosokawa is setting forth (which the Heisei Restoration Group has advocated from the outset) is nothing other than the direction which 70 percent of the Japanese people are now demanding. However, when it comes to the question of whether the current government can move politics in accordance with this slogan, it is probably impossible. The only one making a slogan of local autonomy and consumer sovereignty is Hosokawa; it is not a condition that binds the coalition government parties. The only tie is political reform, and that, too, only in connection with a single-seat constituency system. There are persons in the cabinet who still trumpet the doctrine of Japan, the superpower, there are also ones who advocate deficit-covering bonds, and ones who, even now, are still doing nothing but protecting industry circles. The true state of coalition government party politics is that, just as up till now, it is consorting with bureaucrats, or, having been skillfully won over by bureaucrats, is doing things that have no relation to consumer sovereignty. Should one ask why this kind of situation has come about, it is because the "test of loyalty" of the eight coalition factions has been established on maintenance of governing power, not debate on policy. Moreover, persons who were members of perennial opposition parties have now begun to imbibe the sweet taste of being a governing party, and are spellbound by the fluent explanations of bureaucrats. A certain minister said with deep emotion: So this is what it was like to be in the governing party. LDP Executives Appalled at Own Lack of Ability On the other hand, the LDP cannot even attack the excessively early deterioration of the coalition governing parties. It cannot set forth a single new plan. It lacks the ability. Because, in reality, LDP politicians had fallen into the malady of salaried workers of just going along, for the 38 years since 1955, with a system called "LDP Inc." Gathering money, creating ministers of state, and campaigning for election: everything is the LDP system. Individual politicians had only to go along with that system; up till now the ability of each individual had nothing to do with it. Even the LDP executives themselves are realizing for the first time, with disgust, the low level of their individual ability and skill. Therefore, moves to waver and switch to other parties such as Shinseito have begun to appear because they think that they will not be able to do well in the next election if they have gone along with the current LDP. The fact that speculation that Michio Watanabe and Ichiro Ozawa will probably get together has been going around recently is also one of the phenomena which this meltdown has caused. But even if they left the LDP, they are the kind of bunch who could not even become "manager of a business department;" so, even if one hoped that they could change Japan or so on, it is impossible. I think there will be two options that Japan should take after this. The first is an Ichiro Ozawa type of centralized nationalism; the second is decentralized "consumer-oriented policy" [seikatsusha shugi], which we advocate, and which Hosokawa, too, stands on and is making his slogan. There are already all sorts of moves around Ozawa. Meanwhile, there is also the movement of Diet members who say let us operate with consumer-oriented policy as the common ideology; on 5 October [1993] those Diet members started the "Heisei Club." Therefore, if one takes it that what transpired up to formation of the Hosokawa cabinet is the first act of a great reform, what happens after this will assuredly be the curtain-opening for the second act. Japan is now entering the eve of a restoration. Regardless of whether they belong to the LDP or to another party, if they have the same policy, they will rebel with swords when the time comes. It matters not whether they become one party or two... The important thing is that those with the same view of Japan's future image win the power to govern. It seems likely that politics will become more and more interesting from now on, but what can be said clearly is that the genuine great upheaval of the Heisei restoration will come after this.
