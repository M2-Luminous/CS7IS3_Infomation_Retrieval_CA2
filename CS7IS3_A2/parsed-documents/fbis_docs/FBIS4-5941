The article says it is the greatest feat of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il that he put forward the great idea and policy of establishing the monolithic ideological system in the whole party and the whole society and has successfully applied it and made the revolutionary ranks one socio-political organism in which the leader, the party and the masses are united closely. It stresses that the party has raised it as a fundamental question decisive to the future and destiny of the cause of the party and socialism to ensure uniformity of ideology and leadership and brilliantly carried it into practice. Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: "Our party raised anew the principles of establishing its monolithic ideological system to meet the requirements of the development of the revolution in the 1970s when the modelling of the whole society on the chuche idea was put to the fore and has further deepened this work." The article goes on: He published a famous work "Let Us More Firmly Establish the Monolithic Ideologikal System in the Whole Party and the Whole Society" on the basis of a scientific analysis of the practical requirements of the development of our revolution, and set forth the outstanding idea and theory of more firmly establishing the monolithic ideological system in the whole party and the whole society. This idea and theory of our party comprehensively consummates the principled requirements for further deepening this work in keeping with the demand of a new higher stage of modelling the whole of society on the chuche idea, and revolutionary policies for its realisation. This idea and theory is an original one which was the first in history to systematize and perfectly standardize all the theoretical and practical matters arising in the establishment of the monolithic ideological system in an integral way on the basis of the revolutionary outlook on the leader, and a great one indicating the road of accomplishing the revolutionary cause of chuche. The exposition of this great idea and theory which has brought about a revolutionary change in the building and activities of the Workers' Party of Korea and in the struggle for accomplishing the socialist cause is a noble expression of the unshakable will of Comrade Kim Chong-il to purely inherit and accomplish the revolutionary cause started by the respected leader President Kim Il-song. The immortal exploits performed by the WPK in the work for establishing the monolithic ideological system in the whole party and the whole society lie in that it has built up a great army of revolutionaries of chuche type unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader and made the revolutionary ranks an integral whole in ideology and purpose in which the leader, the party and the people shaje the same destiny. Another exploit of the WPK in the work for establishing its monolithic ideological system finds expression in that it has wrought great miracles in socialist construction by intensifying its leadership over the revolution and construction. The article further says: The imperialists and reactionaries are trying to stifle Korean- style socialism more frantically than before. But, we are resolutely fighting against the enemy without any vacillation because we have the firm singlehearted unity around the party and the leader, a powerful independent national economy and self-reliant national defence. This clearly proves the wise leadership and great exploits of the WPK which has successfully led the work for establishing the monolithic ideological system in the whole party and society.
