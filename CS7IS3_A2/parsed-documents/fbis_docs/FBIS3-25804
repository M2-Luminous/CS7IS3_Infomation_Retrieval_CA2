The faster the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world is conducted, the more effective auditing supervision should be. Li Guixian continued: Auditing supervision is of great importance in the socialist modernization drive. Whether or not the central authorities' macroeconomic regulation and control measures are conscientiously implemented depends on the supervision of supervision departments, and particularly auditing departments, at all levels, although auditing departments themselves do not formulate such measures. Auditing departments should supervise economic administrations, local governments, and state-owned enterprises and institutions in their implementation of state policies by auditing their financial management and affairs. Auditing departments should also reflect in a timely manner problems existing during the course of implementation to facilitate the implementation of the macroeconomic regulation and control measures adopted by the central authorities. Li Guixian said: The focus of auditing work this year should be shifted to providing services to macroeconomic regulation and control. Therefore, in carrying out auditing supervision, attention should be paid to the following three aspects: First, auditing supervision over the state's financial revenue and expenditure should be strengthened. At present, our country's financial situation is relatively difficult but there is great potential to increase revenue and cut down expenditures. Auditing departments should deal with such problems as seeking departmental and regional interests regardless of financial and economic laws and disciplines. They should help financial, taxation, and other departments do a good job in managing and utilizing the state's funds. Second, auditing supervision over the departments in charge of state-owned assets should be strengthened. Some state-owned enterprises have serious problems including poor economic performance, incorrect statement of losses and benefits, and losses of state-owned assets. By auditing state-owned enterprises and departments in charge of state-owned assets, auditing departments should help them strengthen management, enhance economic returns, and ensure the maintaining and increasing of the value of state-owned assets. Third, auditing supervision over governmental departments in their financial revenue and expenditures should be strengthened. It is necessary to treat this task as an important matter in the anticorruption campaign and in building a clean government. Particular efforts should be made to strengthen financial audits of governmental organizations and law enforcement, judicial, and economic administrations. If squandering, wasting, and seeking private gains through power as well as arbitrary requisition of donations, exaction of fees from enterprises, and other unhealthy trends of trade and profession are found, serious measures should be taken.
