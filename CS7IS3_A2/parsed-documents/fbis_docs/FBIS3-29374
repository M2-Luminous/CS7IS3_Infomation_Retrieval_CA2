The United States has not responded yet. Earlier negotiations failed to reach agreement because the U.S. side wanted to include punitive action against countries it found to have exceeded quotas by using quotas of third countries by immediate reduction of the offending countries' quotas. If the quota violation is large, the reduction would be threefold. The Thai side felt the punishment to be unfair. It also sought quota enlargement and thus refused to sign an accord. The Thai side has been trying to organize other ASEAN countries to enhance its bargaining power. Oranut said the fact that the Philippines accepted the U.S. conditions and signed an accord early last month could make it more difficult for Thailand to negotiate quota enlargement and punitive clauses. In any event, the accord reached between the United States and the Philippines will be studied to aid Thailand's negotiation position. Oranut said an alternative is to not sign a quota accord, the course which Thailand chose three years ago.
