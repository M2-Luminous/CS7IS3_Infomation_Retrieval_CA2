FR940324-0-00005 FR940324-0-00002 Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 955 [Docket No. FV93&hyph;955&hyph;2FIR] Vidalia Onions Grown in Georgia; Revision of Handler Reporting Requirements AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule that revised the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing order for Vidalia onions grown in Georgia. The interim final rule relaxed the reporting requirements on handlers by expanding the period of coverage of the report for receipts and shipments of onions from one week to one month. This is the only form handlers are required to file with the Vidalia Onion Committee (Committee). The reduction in the reporting burden on handlers will not adversely impact program operations. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee, which is responsible for local administration of the order. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 955 [7 CFR Part 955] regulating the handling of Vidalia onions grown in Georgia. The marketing agreement and order are authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 145 handlers of Vidalia onions that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately 250 producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the Vidalia onion handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. This rule finalizes an interim final rule which revised ยง955.101 of Subpart _ Administrative Rules and Regulations and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information. Previously under ยง955.101, Report of Shipments, handlers were required to provide the Committee with information regarding the volume of Vidalia onions received and shipped during each week of the shipping season. The normal shipping season for cured Vidalia onions runs from April through June, approximately 12 weeks. In addition, green Vidalia onions usually are shipped beginning in January of each year. Handlers were required to provide this information to the Committee each week. The Committee provided a form to assist handlers in providing this information. The information required included the name and address of handler, the period covered for the report, the total weekly receipts of Vidalia onions and the total fresh market shipments of Vidalia onions.
