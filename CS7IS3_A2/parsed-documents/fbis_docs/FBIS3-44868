The 20 investigation groups were dispatched to 20 ministries and commissions and 20 provinces and municipalities to supervise and inspect the situation of the current anticorruption struggle. Generally speaking, since the party Central Committee set the three major tasks for anticorruption struggle in the latter part of August this year, various localities and departments have taken prompt action and adopted effective measures for the work and achieved certain achievements in the anticorruption struggle. Recently, the central authorities held several report meetings to hear the results of checking by those investigation groups. Wei Jianxing, Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, Li Guixian and Zhang Siqing, as well as several responsible comrades of concerned departments, heard reports by those investigation groups. In line with the requirements of the party Central Committee, various investigation groups integrated the work of supervision and inspection with investigation and study to promote the in-depth struggle against corruption. Members of those investigation groups carefully listened to reports by leading members of concerned ministries, commissions, provinces and municipalities and exchanged opinions with them. Meanwhile, they also spent quite some time hearing opinions and comments from cadres and masses on the anticorruption work. Judging from the reports made by those investigation groups, in the past four months, the whole party has taken part in tackling the problem of corruption under the leadership of the party Central Committee with the active support of the masses, and thus the stuggule has had a good beginning. The tendencies of corruption have basically been checked and the three anticorruption tasks have achieved good results to various extents in different localities and departments. Leading cadres at various levels have paid good attention to their behavior through self- inspection and self-correction, and have improved the party's workstyle and enhanced the consciousness of building an honest government. Leading cadres have strengthened their efforts to investigate various cases and completed the handling of a number of major and serious cases. They have announced and straightened out some fees which should not be levied in a wanton manner. The unhealthy tendency of using public funds for pleasure trips abroad has, in the main, been stopped. In light of the dissatisfaction reflected by the masses, some departments and trades paid attention to correcting serious unhealthy practices. Through anticorruption struggles launched over the past several months, the broad masses of cadres and people have enhanced their confidence in the anticorruption struggle and are convinced that, as long as the struggle can be waged in a solid manner in accordance with the demands set by the party Central Committee, the tendencies of corruption can certainly be gradually curbed, and better and more apparent results can be achieved in improving party's workstyle and building an honest government. In this way, reform, opening up, and economic construction can also be promoted smoothly in a better way. Judging from the situation learned from the investigations, there is still a lot of work to do to reach the target of the anticorruption struggle. In some localities and departments, leadership over the struggle is not strong enough, and so progress has been slow and results are not apparent. The progress is also uneven in various localities. In some localities and departments, leading cadres are not serious enough in self-discipline and they have not corrected problems found in their self-examination. The task of investigating and handling major and serious cases is still very heavy and the unhealthy practices reflected by the masses still have not been corrected by some trades. In short, we must make great efforts to understand the situation, improve our work, and adopt and implement correct policies to solve problems. Through investigation, we can understand that to achieve signifcant results in the current anticorruption struggle, we must do solid work and make greater efforts in the more than one month period before the Spring Festival. Meanwhile, it is necessary to integrate the anticorruption struggle with the work of promoting clean and honest practices during the New Year and Spring Festival periods so as to further consolidate and develop the achievements gained in the earlier period. The participants in the report meeting held that inspection, supervision, and investigation by the investigation group in various localities and departments are important measures to promote in- depth development of the struggle. The participation in investigation groups by people of various circles is also a successful experience.
