A Mach 1.5 hot air flow was supplied to the chamber (consisting of a short cylindrical section followed by a divergent), and a small amount of hydrogen gas was injected into a mixed supersonic speed zone located at the chamber inlet (this to help maintain combustion). Typical speeds at the chamber outlet ranged from Mach 1.1 to Mach 1.4, and combustion efficiencies observed were as high as 87 percent, with equivalence ratios ranging from 0.49 to 0.66. In the present setup, however, losses due to the calorific intake and to friction against the walls resulted in a 50-70 percent impact pressure drop throughout the chamber.
