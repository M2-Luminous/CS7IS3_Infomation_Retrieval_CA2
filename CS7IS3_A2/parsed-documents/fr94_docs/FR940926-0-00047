FR940926-0-00047 FR940926-0-00010 S5.3.1␣Composite containers with metallic liners. The CNG fuel container shall be manufactured from a metal liner overwrapped with resin impregnated continuous filament windings, applied under controlled tension to develop the design composite thickness. After winding is complete, composites using thermoset resins shall be cured by a controlled temperature process. S5.3.1.1␣ Type 2 containers. Type 2 containers shall have a hoop wrapped winding pattern. S5.3.1.2␣ Type 3 containers. Type 3 containers shall have a full wrapped ``helical or in plane'' and a ``hoop'' wrap winding pattern. S5.3.2␣Type 4 containers. Composite containers with nonmetallic liners shall be fabricated from a nonmetallic liner overwrapped with resin impregnated continuous filament windings. The winding pattern shall be ``helical or in plane'' and ``hoop'' wrap applied pattern under controlled tension to develop the design composite thickness. After winding is complete, the composite shall be cured by a controlled temperature process. S5.3.3␣ Brazing. Brazing is prohibited. S5.3.4␣Welding. Welding shall be done in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code , Section IX, Article II, QW&hyph;304 and QW&hyph;305 (1992). Weld efficiencies shall be in accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code , Section VIII, UW&hyph;12 (1989). Any weld shall be subject to full radiographic requirements in accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code , Section VIII, UW&hyph;51 thru UW&hyph;53 (1989). For Type 2 and Type 3 liners, longitudinal welds and nonconsumable backing strips or rings shall be prohibited. S5.4␣ Wall thickness. S5.4.1␣Type 1 containers. (a) The wall thickness of a Type 1 container shall be at least an amount such that the wall stress at the minimum prescribed hydrostatic test pressure does not exceed 67 percent of the minimum tensile strength of the metal as determined by the mechanical properties specified in S5.7 and S5.7.1. (b) For minimum wall thickness calculations, the following formula is used: ER26SE94.000 Where: S = Wall stress in MPa (psi). P = Minimum hydrostatic test pressure in Bar (psig). D = Outside diameter in mm (inches). d = Inside diameter in mm (inches). S5.4.2␣Type 2 containers. S5.4.2.1␣The wall thickness of a liner to a Type 2 container shall be at least an amount such that the longitudinal tensile stress at the minimum design burst pressure does not exceed the ultimate tensile strength of the liner material as determined in S5.7 and S5.7.1.
