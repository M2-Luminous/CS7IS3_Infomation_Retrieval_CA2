National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has revealed that Turkey will buy long-range missiles from the Russian Federation. He also said that he agreed with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to help Turkey to acquire Russia's technology in ballistic missiles. Golhan stressed that he held talks with Pavel Grachev, who is one of Russia's most influential officials, when he visited the Russian Federation some time ago. He asserted: ``Defense Ministry officials in Russia informed me that they are prepared to sell various types of arms.'' Golhan said that Turkey has moved to acquire missiles because Iran and Syria already have them in their military inventories. He asserted: ``Russia has very advanced missiles. We will cooperate with it to help Turkey acquire its missile technology. We have particular problems with our neighbors from the point of view of missiles and nuclear weapons. Iran and Syria have long-range missiles. So Turkey must equip itself accordingly. Turkey has never been an aggressor country. It does not intend to become one. We covet no country's territory. But we must maintain a deterrent force. Turkey is committed to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. We are not competing with our neighbors to acquire arms. But we do not want Turkey to be regarded as a weak country. A significant opportunity exists for cooperation with the Russian Federation to modernize the Turkish Armed Forces in every area.'' Golhan stressed that Turkey has concluded a framework agreement with the Russian Federation for technical cooperation in defense. He said: ``Everything has been included in that framework agreement. They agree to cooperate on issues relating to their missile technology. Experts from the two countries will work to realize their cooperation.'' Iran, Iraq, and Syria have many Scud missiles. Iran has reportedly cooperated with the DPRK to increase the range of its missiles and improve its missile technology. According to U.S. intelligence reports, Iran has acquired technology on guided missiles. It is working to produce a missile with its own resources. Iraq used Scud-B missiles during the Gulf war. But the technology that was used in the production of those missiles was old. Consequently they were not effective. The Scud-B missiles are 90 cm in diameter, weigh 6,300 kg, and have a range of 300 km. They may miss their targets by 600-800 meters. They may operate with solid or liquid fuel and deliver chemical or nuclear warheads. The Russian Federation has long-range missiles, which have been produced with modern technology. Turkey signed the agreement known as the Missile Technology Control Regime in 1993. The United States, the Russian Federation, and many Western countries also signed that agreement, which bans the sale of missiles with a range of over 300 km and that can deliver warheads heavier than 500 kg. The agreement also limits the transfer of the technology required for the production of such missiles. Iran and Syria, which possess long-range missiles, have not signed that agreement. The Russian Federation's SS-21 missiles are not included in that agreement. The SS-21 missiles, which were developed in 1976 to deliver conventional warheads, have a range of 120-200 km. They are launched from mobile launchers. Reportedly, the technology used in the production of the Scud missiles is 20 years older than the technology used in the production of the SS-21 missiles. The arming of the SS-21 missiles with warheads capable of causing mass destruction has been banned. Turkey has acquired military equipment and arms from Russia in the past.
