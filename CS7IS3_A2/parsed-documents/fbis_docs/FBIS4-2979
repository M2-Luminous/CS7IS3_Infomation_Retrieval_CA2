The Beijing-funded Hong Kong China News Service reported yesterday that Hong Kong last year passed to Shenzhen authorities 49 cases of "official document" smuggling. Mainland customs officials said Chinese tourists wanted to sell economic and trade secrets. Last night a legislator, Emily Lau, accused Beijing of "muddying the waters" by releasing the report soon after journalist Xi Yang was jailed for stealing economic secrets. Don Watson, the Customs and Excise commissioner, said no documents were given to Chinese authorities. "We have co-operation with the Chinese on a number of issues but not official documents," he said. Mainland customs officials reported 20 cases of tourists trying to smuggle classified documents out of China in the first three months of this year.
