FBIS4-35376 "drnes105dd_94020" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 30 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Russian Envoy Views Talks With Syrian Leaders Russian Envoy Views Talks With Syrian Leaders TA3005172194 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 30 May 94 p A5 TA3005172194 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Aluf Ben and Yosi Torpstein] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] During his meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, Russian envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk recounted that he had met in Damascus with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and with the representatives of the 10 rejectionist Palestinian organizations. In Jordan he met with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. The Russian envoy said that the representatives of the rejectionist groups had clarified that they would continue to oppose the agreement between the PLO and Israel and not participate in the autonomy council. In his talks in Damascus, Posuvalyuk received the impression that the Syrians were attempting to portray themselves as being in no rush to make progress in the peace process. Syria's large debts to Russia were also discussed in the envoy's meetings with the Syrian foreign minister; however, no agreement was reached on the rescheduling of these debts. Posuvalyuk said that although his government, as well as himself personally, would like to deepen their involvement in the peace process, Russia was currently preoccupied with its own domestic problems and its relations with its close neighbors. The Russian envoy noted that Prime Minister Rabin's visit to Russia had been "very successful" and that his current tour of Israel would help imbue the framework established during the previous visit with additional content. After his meeting with Beilin, Posuvalyuk explained: "I have not come to intervene in the negotiations but rather to discuss their details with my interlocutors." Beilin noted that Russia's involvement in the negotiations between Israel and the Arab countries was very important. After the meeting, Posuvalyuk toured Jericho. At al-Aqsa camp, formerly known as the Hanan camp and headquarters for the Palestinian police in the Jericho area, Posuvalyuk met with Brigadier General 'Isma'il al-Hajj Jabr, the police commander and with Jibril al-Rujub, head of Palestinian preemptive security (a parallel body to the Israeli Shin Bet). The meeting was arranged and coordinated by officials at Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters in East Jerusalem. At their meeting, which was conducted in Arabic due to the fact that the Russian envoy has a doctorate in Arabic studies, the Palestinians expressed their hope that Russia, as in the past, would continue to support them. The Palestinians also reviewed the situation in Jerusalem and the difficulties in implementing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, especially the issue of the Israeli settlements and the Shalom 'Al Yisra'el Synagogue affair. The Palestinians noted that they had to rebuild the infrastructure and institutions in the autonomous areas and train a professional work force. Russia agreed to train Palestinian security personnel, including members of the preemptive security forces. These issues will be discussed in detail in the meeting that will take place today at the Orient House between Posuvalyuk and Palestinian politicians, including Faysal al-Husayni, who returned from Tunis yesterday after being appointed minister without portfolio in the Palestinian authority. Posuvalyuk said that after meeting representatives of all the regional parties, he had come to "feel we have all managed to overcome the results of the Hebron massacre and must now move forward. I am convinced that both the Arab states and Israel aspire to promote the process. The Russian envoy expressed the hope that the Palestinians "will continue the negotiations and not get bogged down in internal disputes. This is the first chance the Palestinians have ever had to manage their own affairs and they should exploit this opportunity and pursue the peace process." Posuvalyuk expressed the assessment that the peace process would not slow down following the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He said he was optimistic about the process, especially after visiting Jericho. The Russian envoy opined that the process had reached a stage from which there was no turning back. [passage omitted]
