Niles said: "If the Greek Government shows an interest in working with us to fight terrorism, certainly, we will help." The U.S. ambassador has obviously considered it expedient to repeat his reservations over the Greek intention to cooperate. In his next sentence, he said: "It will be just enough if the Greek Government shows real interest in such cooperation." Regarding his statement following the murder of Mikhail Vranopoulos, when he said: "We will catch those guys," Niles made the following correction: "I believe murderers such as those in `17 November' will be arrested. My remarks came during an emotional moment; it was Vranopoulos' funeral. I did not mean the United States would do it, but that these people would be arrested. Unfortunately, I do not know exactly when they will be arrested and I cannot forecast it." [passage omitted]
