In conjunction with the shift to a no-examination system, the Center will investigate technology preceding the technology scheduled for patent application, will judge its appropriateness for registration, and will try to prevent futile applications. This service is aimed at small-medium sized companies and individual inventors. As it begins the service it has published guidelines for research method and application procedures. Since under the new utility model law there will be registration without ``substantial examination'', registerable ideas won't be limited as under the old law to ideas with novelty or improvements. Under the new law when a utility model right is exercised there is a duty to inform the other party with a ``technology rating document'' created by the Patent Office. In order to investigate issues such as whether the same items have appeared in an earlier patent application or if the application includes an unregisterable portion and in order to participate in the application process, the Center provides accurate rating materials through research on preceding technology for the items on which the small-medium sized companies or individual inventors plan to apply. Specifically, it uses the PATOLIS on-line patent information database system to focus its search for five items of related preceding technology in patents or utility models. In conjunction with this, it presents to the requester a report describing the scope of technology from the previous fifty years which was listed in the on-line database and which seems to belong to the category being investigated. Items for which research can be requested include those which can be implemented immediately after application and those which are not at the idea level but for which effectiveness and structure for implementation are clear. As a rule, applications are made through the JIII's regional branches or through the region's chamber of commerce or commerce and industry association.
