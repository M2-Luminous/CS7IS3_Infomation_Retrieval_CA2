ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule sets forth an amendment to the regulation at 25 CFR 248.6 consistent with the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the final Judgment in Sohappy v.

The court declared invalid that portion of the regulation prohibiting permanent occupancy of the five Columbia River in-lieu fishing sites. This final rule will delete the prohibition against construction of permanent dwellings and structures on the five in-lieu sites. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective May 9, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ron Eggers, Branch of Fisheries, Portland Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 911 NE 11th Ave., Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4169; Telephone No. (503) 231&hyph;6749. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Several Pacific Northwest Indian tribes hold treaty rights to fish on the Columbia River. In the 1930's the construction of Bonneville Dam flooded some of the Indians' usual and accustomed fishing sites along the river. In 1945 Congress authorized acquisition of replacement sites to be held by the Secretary of the Interior for the use and benefit of the Indians. The five sites acquired under that authorization are managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs pursuant to regulations in 25 CFR part 248. Section 248.6 provides that ``no dwellings or structures shall be erected, placed, or maintained upon the sites, except that camping facilities may be placed thereon only as herein described and fish drying facilities and fishing platforms may be erected by Indians for use during the fishing season.'' The intent of the regulation was to prohibit permanent occupancy of the sites in order to provide a rational and reasonable means for ensuring health and safety on the sites and for providing a fair opportunity to all eligible Indians to use the sites for fishing purposes. Sohappy v. Hodel, Civil No. 86&hyph;715&hyph;FR (D. Or.), was filed by individual Indians and a group called ``Chiefs and Council of the Columbia River Indians'' in order to challenge the Bureau of Indian Affairs' eviction of several Indians living in permanent dwellings on the sites. The Federal District Court held that the regulation prohibiting permanent occupancy is consistent with rights reserved by treaty and with the 1945 statute authorizing acquisition of the five sites. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the 1945 act and the tribes' treaties do not preclude construction of permanent dwellings at the sites. Sohappy v. Hodel, 911 F.2d 1312 (9th Cir. 1990). The case was remanded to the District Court where final Judgment was entered on August 30, 1991. The Judgment declares 25 CFR 248.6 invalid insofar as it prohibits permanent occupancy of the five sites and provides that the Bureau of Indian Affairs ``shall take good faith steps'' to amend the regulation consistent with the Ninth Circuit's decision and the final Judgment. The Judgment does not preclude the Bureau from taking reasonable actions necessary to enforce applicable health and safety laws. Therefore, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published the proposed amendment (57 FR 45258) to revise section 248.6 to delete the prohibition against construction of permanent dwellings and structures on the sites and to retain the requirement that the sites be used in a manner that conforms to applicable health, sanitation and safety laws. The Judgment in Sohappy v. Hodel does not affect the Indian tribes' right, title or interest in the sites or the nature and extent of the tribes' sovereign authority to use or manage the sites for fishing purposes under their treaties, Settler v. Lameer, 507 F.2d 231 (9th Cir. 1974). It is also important to note that the regulations in 25 CFR part 248 do not apply to the fishing access sites designated in Section 401 of the Act of November 1, 1988. The Indian tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are working together on plans for development, management and regulation of the new fishing access sites.
