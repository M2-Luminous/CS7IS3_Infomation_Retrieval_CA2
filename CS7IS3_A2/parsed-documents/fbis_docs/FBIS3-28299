FBIS3-28299 "dreas025__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-025-A Document Type:Daily Report 7 February 1994 ANNEX Japan `Setback', U.S. Support Viewed OW0702083794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0702083794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] With the Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February close at hand, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's setback on the issue of the tax cut and the accompanying tax hike at the last minute has brought about a crisis of confidence in his "management ability" of the Japan-U.S. relations. This may dampen considerably the Clinton administration's expectations on the prime minister's leadership to reduce the trade surplus and open the Japanese market, which are significantly higher than its expectations on the previous Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] administration. If Hosokawa visits the United States without bringing about a substantial breakthrough in the new economic consultations, the U.S. Government may reconsider its support of the prime minister's reform line. The United States is expected to stand firm on its position that "if there would not be any substantial agreement, it will be better not to have any agreement at all," (according to Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen) If conflicts in Japan-U.S. relations flare up, the prime minister's political responsibility may be questioned. The U.S. Government, which is irritated with the impasse in the new economic consultations, is plagued by a sense of distrust of the Japanese bureaucrats who stubbornly refuse to accede to the U.S. demand on "numerical targets," while it also harbors over- expectations on the ability of the prime minister, who upholds the slogan of "changing status quo politics." Since late 1993, U.S. Government officials have been trying to set the stage for bilateral negotiations by criticizing the bureaucrats, while expressing support for the prime minister. This is part of the strategy to set aside the prime minister as a so-called "good guy" to draw a favorable final "decision" from him. However, the attitude taken by the prime minister in the process of formulating and eventually rescinding the "national welfare tax" scheme completely runs counter to U.S. expectations. At first, the prime minister had sided with the Ministry of Finance, which attaches more importance to a sound fiscal policy than to economic stimulation to please the United States, by proposing to implement a tax cut "two years" ahead of a tax hike. However, dissenting views came from the ruling parties, saying "With that, you cannot negotiate with President Clinton." Thus, the prime minister ultimately settled on "a tax hike three years later." However, this was sufficient to illustrate the prime minister's subservience to the bureaucracy. On top of this, he had to rescind his own proposal. This seems to have also shocked the United States. After his second round of talks with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on the morning of 4 February, when U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was asked to comment on the volatile Japanese political situation during a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Minato Ward, Tokyo, he replied, "We do not interfere in internal affairs. The situation is still volatile." However, he did not also pass over the chance to remind his audience that "the United States hopes for the implementation of strong, consistent economic stimulation measures." Some government officials are even concerned now that the "nostalgia for the past LDP regimes' ability for internal coordination," which so far remains half-forgotten, may revive in the United States.
