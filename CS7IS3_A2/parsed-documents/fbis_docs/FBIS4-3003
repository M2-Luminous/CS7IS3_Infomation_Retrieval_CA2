"There are 105 contracting parties in GATT and the United States is only one. While we notice the importance of the United States, it is also clear that the United States cannot be equated with GATT," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said during a weekly news briefing. Shen was reacting to remarks by US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who said Tuesday that China must open its market more if it wants to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A founding member of GATT, China left the organization after the founding of the communist regime in 1949 and requested readmission in 1986. Beijing wants to rejoin GATT this year in order to take part in the future trade organization that will be created in January 1995. China's reintegration is one of the main topics at the Marrakesh, Morocco, summit where the final GATT accord concluding the Uruguay round is to be signed. While implicitly rejecting Kantor's criticism, the spokesman said, China wanted the United States to support China's candidacy. "We have also noted that the US government has repeatedly promised to staunchly support China's re-entry to GATT. We hope that that United States will make good on this promise," Shen said.
