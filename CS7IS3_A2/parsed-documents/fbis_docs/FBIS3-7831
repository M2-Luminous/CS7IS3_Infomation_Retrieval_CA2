This is an unprecedented escalation in the history of present civilization and in the fight against science, culture, and truth. With this the Serbian regime testifies once more to its determination to fanatically implement the criminal memorandum of the Academy of Sciences which, drafted on principles of anticivilization and barbarism, sets forth the notions of ethnic cleansing and the erasure of thinking in other nations. The Serbian circles can close a building, but they can by no means suffocate the thinking and scientific truth of the Albanian world. The act is as antiscientific and illegitimate as it is barbarous.
