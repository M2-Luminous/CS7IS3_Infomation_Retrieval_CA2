Brazauskas is scheduled to make a speech at a session of the CE Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg April 14. Traditionally, one or two state leaders are invited to the assembly's session. This time, Brazauskas will keep company with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. Heinrich Klebes, deputy secretary general of the CE, said although Lithuania is a small country, the assembly will listen "very attentively" to Brazauskas' report. At a press conference in Vilnius Wednesday [30 March], the CE official said Brazauskas is expected to assess the situation in the Baltic states and in Russia. The CE would like to know the president's opinion about the prospects of Russia's membership in the organization and about the future of the Kaliningrad region, Klebes said. Brazauskas is also expected to discuss some domestic policy issues, including Lithuania's preparation to join the European convention on human rights and freedoms. The protocol of the assembly does not oblige state leaders to answer questions of assembly members, but in Klebes' words, the Lithuanian president is prepared to answer even spontaneous questions. "The Parliamentary Assembly appreciates this," the CE official said. Commenting on prospects for the Baltic states to become associate members of the European Union, Klebes expressed certitude that this will happen soon, but reminded reporters that the matter is not within his competence. On Wednesday, Klebes completed his four-day visit in Lithuania, during which he met with Lithuanian Parliament Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas, members of the several parliamentary committees and Lithuania's delegation to the CE Parliamentary Assembly. The CE official also visited the second biggest Lithuanian town of Kaunas. Klebes said he is satisfied with the results of his stay in Lithuania. In his words, it is very important to maintain close ties with new members of the CE. [passage omitted]
