At a meeting of the Human Rights Committee of the Council of Europe in Paris last week, Bobelis, together with many representatives of other countries, voted against the initiative of Great Britain to admit Russia without some essential preliminary conditions. According to the Lithuanian representative, Russia's admission to the Council of Europe is so far being hindered for several reasons, the most important of them being the deployment of the Army in foreign countries. At the meeting of the committee, Bobelis, together with the Romanian, Polish, and Turkish representatives, did not support the Swedish initiative to abolish the death sentence in all states of the European Council. Although, according to him, Lithuania does not have an official policy on this issue, in his opinion, it is too early for the Lithuanians to assume such responsibility. Bobelis, who is chairman of the Seimas Foreign Affairs Committee, complained at a news conference on Friday [25 March] of poor relations with the foreign policy planners at the presidential office. He stated that the Foreign Affairs Committee was not supporting the policy of Justas Paleckis, the presidential adviser on foreign policy. He called this policy isolationist.
