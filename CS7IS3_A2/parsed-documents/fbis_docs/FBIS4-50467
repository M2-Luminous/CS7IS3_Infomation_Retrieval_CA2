It has also signed contracts to export a 300,000-kilowatt nuclear power plant to Pakistan. Shanghai is becoming China's major nuclear power equipment manufacturing base. In developing its nuclear power industry, Shanghai has invested nearly 200 million yuan and has built a number of fairly large nuclear power infrastructure projects. It has built factory buildings with a total floor space of 93,000 square meters, including seven 100-400-tonne-class factory buildings. Since 1988, Shanghai has allocated over 3 million yuan in financial credits for tackling scientific and technological projects in nuclear power development. By the end of last year, it had defined 88 projects, of which 62 had passed appraisal tests. Meanwhile, the relevant ministries, commissions, and offices of the State Council have assigned to Shanghai 11 problems for the development of a 600,000-kilowatt nuclear power plant -- a key project to be tackled in the state's Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995). They have also allocated over 12 million yuan to improve Shanghai's ability to manufacture nuclear power equipment. Shanghai has earmarked another 200 million-odd yuan in the Eighth Five-Year Plan for gradually developing Shanghai's production capability so that it can turn out between one and one and a half sets of nuclear power plant equipment annually during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
