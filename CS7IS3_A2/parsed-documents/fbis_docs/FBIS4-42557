This statement was made by Foreign Minister at Larnaca Airport shortly before his departure this afternoon on an official visit to Moscow. He said that the Cyprus Government believes that convening an international conference is a very serious proposal, since the initiatives taken in the Cyprus issue thus far have failed. He added: For this reason, we must address the substance of the problem, which is nothing less than the presence of occupation troops and settlers in Cyprus. Mr. Mikhailidhis noted: If some countries agree or disagree, we will see this in the course of things. The foreign minister further said: In any case, we will work toward this. The Cyprus issue will be the basic topic of Mr. Mikhailidhis' talks in Moscow and, as he noted, there will also be discussion of the Russian suggestions included in the options cited in the UN secretary general's report. He stressed that the Cyprus Government attaches great importance to his visit to Moscow for two important reasons: First, because of Russia's noteworthy active role on the international political scene and, second, because of its strong interest in Cyprus. He added: Russia's role will be very decisive in view of the consultations at the Security Council on the options to be adopted for the continuation of the peace process in Cyprus.
