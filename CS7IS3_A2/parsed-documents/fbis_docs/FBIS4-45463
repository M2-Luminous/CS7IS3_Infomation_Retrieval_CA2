General Salim Salim, head of the criminal investigation department, told reporters the drugs had been mainly destined for Holland and were seized in cooperation with Syrian authorities last month. "It's a sizeable seizure. The Lebanese authorities should be very pleased indeed today," Denis Gray, a police attache at the Australian High Commission in Cyprus, told AFP. Gray, who was representing foreign police based in Cyprus, witnessed the operation along with officers from the British and French embassies in Beirut at the al-'Amrusiyah incinerator 10 kilometers (six miles) south of Beirut. In addition to the hashish, six kilograms of opium, three kilograms of heroin and two kilograms of cocaine also went up in smoke. Around 20 people were arrested when the Lebanese Army in collaboration with the Syrian intelligence services ventured into remote mountainous areas of the al-Hirmil region of the Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley. "We ventured into very dangerous territory where we had not gone to since the 1920s," said Salim, who personally conducted the operations. Huge fortunes from the drug trade were made in the al-Biqa', but the government in cooperation with Syrian authorities has set fire to poppy and cannabis fields in a ban imposed since the civil war ended in 1991.
