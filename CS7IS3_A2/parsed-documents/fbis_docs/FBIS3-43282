The two main moderate opposition movements: The Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) of Yao Agboyibo and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD) of Edem Kodjo and five smaller parties spelled out their complaints in a joint statement given to AFP. The seven parties said the government had set the opening of the election campaign for January 7 inspite of the fact that "the updating of electoral rolls is not yet complete" and "distribution of voter cards is nowhere near starting". The opposition parties said they would "not bow to unilateral decisions taken with no consensus" and added that the elections had to be "free, open, fair and acceptable for everybody". More than 300 candidates representing 15 parties have registered in the race for the 81 seats in the national assembly. Two other opposition parties: The Union for Democracy and Solidarity (UDS) of Antoine Folly and the Democrats' Party for Unity (PDU) of Lucien Sanvi de Tove, have already said they will boycott the poll. The opposition in exile led by Gilchrist Olympio has also urged a boycott. The entire opposition abstained in the August presidential poll won by President Gnassingbe Eyadema with 96 percent of the vote.
