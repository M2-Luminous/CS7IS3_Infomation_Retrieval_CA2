Because sampling prevents calculation of duties on an entry-by-entry basis, we will calculate an importer-specific ad valorem duty assessment rate for each class or kind of merchandise based on the ratio of the total value of antidumping duties calculated for the examined sales made during the POR to the total customs value of the sales used to calculate those duties. This rate will be assessed uniformly on all entries of that particular importer made during the POR. (This is equivalent to dividing the total value of antidumping duties, which are calculated by taking the difference between statutory FMV and statutory USP, by the total statutory USP value of the sales compared, and adjusting the result by the average difference between USP and customs value for all merchandise examined during the POR.) Where we do not have entered customs value to calculate an ad valorem rate, we will calculate an average per-unit dollar amount of antidumping duty based on all sales examined during the POR. We will instruct the Customs Service to assess this average amount on all units included in each entry made by the particular importer during the POR. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion of these reviews.
