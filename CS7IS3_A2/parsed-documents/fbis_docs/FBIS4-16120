Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent about the likelihood of such a step, the minister said at a news conference today that "Azerbaijan attaches great importance to the development of all-round contacts with the CIS states, regarding it as a priority in the republic's foreign-policy activities." Hasan Hasanov told journalists that, at the Moscow summit, "Azerbaijani President Gaydar Aliyev may make a special statement." According to the minister, in the statement "relevant assessments of the current situation in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict area will be given." A sharp deterioration in it ensued, according to Hasanov, four days ago, "following the latest offensive undertaken by the Armenian armed formations outside Nagorno-Karabakh in the western and southwestern regions of Azerbaijan." The head of the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry commended Russia's new efforts to resolve the Karabakh problem. Without going into details, the minister merely declared that "Azerbaijan has, in principle, approved the draft agreement on a cessation of hostilities submitted by the Russian side, but has borne in mind its comments and proposals." It was also stressed yet again that the leadership of Azerbaijan holds firm to the view that the conflict can only be resolved by political means.
