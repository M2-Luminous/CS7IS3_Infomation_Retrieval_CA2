(2) The Secretary's recognition of an accrediting agency is based on the Secretary's determination that the agency satisfies the requirements of this part. (b) The Secretary only grants recognition to those accrediting agencies that_ (1) Accredit_ (i) Institutions of higher education, provided that accreditation by the agency is a required element in enabling those institutions to establish eligibility to participate in HEA programs; or (ii) Institutions of higher education or higher education programs, provided that accreditation by the agency is a required element in enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in other programs administered by the Department or by other Federal agencies; (2) Meet the organization and membership requirements specified in §602.3; (3) For agencies already recognized by the Secretary, comply with the information sharing requirements specified in §602.4; and (4) Satisfy the criteria for Secretarial recognition specified in Subpart C of this part. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1099b) §602.2 Definitions. The following definitions apply to terms used in this part: Accreditation means the status of public recognition that an accrediting agency grants to an educational institution or program that meets the agency's established standards and requirements.
