It has established economic and technological cooperation with more than 70 countries and regions and enjoys a good reputation for its top-quality service. As reported, the corporation has satisfactorily completed contracts for launching Asian, Australian, Pakistani, and Swedish satellites. Now it has started carrying out a number of contracts for launching international commercial satellites. Now the corporation is manufacturing the Dongfanghong [East Is Red] No. 3, a high-capacity telecommunications and broadcast satellite; the Fengyun [Storm] No. 2, a geostationary meteorological satellite; and the Ziyuan [Resource] No. 1, a multipurpose earth resources satellite. A large number of telecommunications satellites and meteorological satellites will go into operation soon. The Chengzheng [Long March] No. 3, a carrier rocket with low-temperarure, high-energy fuel, has emerged. The Changzheng carrier rocket series is taking on a development pattern of systematization, generalization, and standardization. It can meet domestic needs better and provide a wider field of service for the international market. In recent years the corporation has stepped up use of spaceflight technological achievements to serve the national economy. The output value of its civilian products has increased at an annual rate of 34 percent. Through developing its three main products -- satellites, cars and their components, as well as computers--the corporation is making efforts to improve the quality of its civilian products, expand their scale, and improve their economic results. In the near future, the corporation will turn a number of projects with prominent spaceflight characteristics and major influence on social progress into civilian products, such as developing a satellite information system, a mobile telecommunications subscriber's station system, and a global television transmission system for civilian purposes.
