The Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers, Mr Eduardo Faleiro, told a meeting of his Ministry's parliamentary consultative committee today that the Government would encourage Indian companies to set up joint ventures in countries which had huge gas reserves to fill the gap between demand and production of nitrogen, equivalent to 41.4 lakh tonnes of urea, at the end of the Eighth Plan. Efforts were already on to have tie-ups in Oman, Qatar and Iran, he added. Mr. Faleiro said if proper balance in the use of plant nutrients was not ensured it would have long-term adverse effects on soil fertility unless efforts were made to arrest the trend. This trend, he said, was primarily because of imbalance in the relative prices of urea and DAP, MoP [muriate of potash] and complexes. Mr. Faleiro said the ratio in the use of nitrogen, phosphate and potash had been adversely affected during the last two cropping seasons. This trend, he said, could not be arrested despite the Government's concessions in the form of enhanced support prices of foodgrains to compensate for the extra expenditure incurred on phosphatic and potassic fertilisers, special concession of 1,000 per tonne on the sale of indigenous DAP and proportionate concession on complex fertilisers and SSP [single super phosphate]. The Minister said the Indian fertiliser industry was extremely efficient and comparable to international standards. It could produce additional quantities of urea at prices lower than those of imported ones provided additional quantities of gas were available. KRIBHCO alone could add two lakh tonnes to the annual production if it was provided with 0.5 mms cmd of gas. At present, 70 per cent of the Indian production in urea was internationally competitive. Mr Faleiro stressed the need to activate extension services and educate farmers about the benefits of balanced use of fertilisers so that they would desist from injudicious use of any one nutrient. The farmers would also be educated on the cost-effectiveness of manures and other organic fertilisers which could successfully supplement the chemical fertilisers.
