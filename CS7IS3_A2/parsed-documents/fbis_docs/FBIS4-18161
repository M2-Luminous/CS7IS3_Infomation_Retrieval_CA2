This is the opinion of Hans J. Rosjorde (Progress Party), chairman of the Storting Defense Committee. He is strongly supported by Ingvald Godal and Are Naess, the defense policy spokesmen for the Conservative Party and the Christian People's Party, respectively. "We are reaching a point where we have to be willing to reevaluate our whole defense strategy. At such a time it will also be necessary to reevaluate both the base policy and the self-imposed restrictions," Rosjorde said. A considerable gap between defense appropriations and the recommendations of the Defense Committee is making a reevaluation necessary, according to Rosjorde. The shortage in appropriations has made it even less likely that the goals of the Defense Committee can be realized. As a result the Armed Forces' combat structure must be reexamined. 2 Billion Short According to the government, the gap is a good 1 billion kroner, but Conservative Ingvald Godal thinks it is more than 2 billion. The difference is explainable in terms of which year is taken as the base for the calculation, and in terms of whether it is the government's proposed or passed budget that is considered. "We cannot continue this way. If the appropriations are not increased, we will have to reevaluate our whole defense strategy," Rosjorde said. He pointed out that the missing appropriations are making it very difficult for the Defense Forces to maintain a defense against invasion in North Norway. "If, for instance, the Army is not able to maintain division structure in the north, there will be doubts in the future as to the professional qualifications of Norwegian officers to lead large Army units," Rosjorde said. Until now Norway has required that all allied reinforcement forces be put under Norwegian command while in Norway, but it is not certain that the requirement can be maintained in the future. Rosjorde thinks that allies who send reinforcements to Norway will not be willing to put their troops under Norwegian command because of the Norwegians' lack of professional competence. "If we do not want to make the appropriations needed to maintain the kind of defense that the Defense Committee decided on, we will have to take the consequences and assess all the restrictions we have imposed upon ourselves in our security policy. This will apply both to bases for foreign troops in peacetime as well as restrictions on exercises and the curtailment of flights east of a certain longitude," Rosjorde said. The only thing he would exclude from such a reevaluation is the ban on deployment of nuclear weapons in Norway. Next Budget Decisive "I have been thinking the same as Rosjorde," Are Naess (Christian People's Party) said. He does not want to take responsibility for whatever political signals there are in Rosjorde's statements, but agrees on what the consequences would be if the defense budgets are not made to meet the stated goals. "The next budget will be decisive," Naess said. "If they continue the trend of accumulated deficits they will either have to demonstrate a rationalization effect that has not been demonstrated earlier, or else we will have to look at out entire defense concept." Ingvald Godal (Conservative) said that the Conservative Party will have a major defense policy conference in early April to discuss all aspects of the problems related to the shrinking defense budgets. "I think it likely that the opinions expressed by Rosjorde will be echoed. The Conservative Party wants to carry out the Defense Committee's recommendation. We take a serious view of the situation we now find ourselves in because of the Defense Forces not being in step with the world we live in," Godal said.
