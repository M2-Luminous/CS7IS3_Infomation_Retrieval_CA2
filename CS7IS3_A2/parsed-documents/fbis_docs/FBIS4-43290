The ANATOLIAN Agency learned that the workers began their action in front of the Petrol-Is trade union office and stated that they were categorically against the closure of their plant. `We are against the closure of the only national company which manufactures aircraft tires and the only strategic national company,' the workers said. The government decision is in line with its April 5 economic measures package. Of the striking workers, eight will hold their strike in capital Ankara as a symbolic gesture. Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions (Turk-Is) treasurer Enver Tocoglu said that it was possible to increase the capacity of Petlas by 30 percent, by a 30,000-dollar investment. He also recalled that the economic package led to the laying off of 4,959 workers in the northwestern city of Bursa. Petrol-Is trade union's leader Adnan Ozcan said that their action will last three days in Ankara and two days in this central Anatolian city of Kirsehir and no production will take place in their plant during the strike. `We are warning. You cannot close Petlas. If it is closed, the hunger strike will become a death strike,' he said. Ozcan said that they opposed the closure of their plant for political reasons.
