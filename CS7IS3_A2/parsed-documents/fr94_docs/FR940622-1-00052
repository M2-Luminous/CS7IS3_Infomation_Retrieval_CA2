FR940622-1-00052 FR940622-1-00017 40 CFR Parts 180 and 185 [OPP&hyph;300336; FRL&hyph;4776&hyph;9] RIN No. 2070&hyph;AC18 Proposed Revocation of Tolerances and Food Additive Regulations for Sulfur Dioxide and Tetradifon AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes to revoke tolerances, exemptions from tolerance, and food additive regulations established for residues of sulfur dioxide and tetradifon in or on certain raw agricultural commodities (RACs) and processed foods. EPA is initiating this action because there are no current registrations associated with these food uses. The applicable registrations for these pesticide uses have been canceled by company request or because of nonpayment of maintenance fees. DATES: Written comments, identified by the document control number [OPP-300336], must be received on or before August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit comments to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA. Information submitted as a comment concerning this document may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132 at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Owen F. Beeder, Registration Division (7505W), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA, (703)-308-8351. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document proposes the revocation of certain tolerances, exemptions from tolerances, and food additive regulations (``tolerances'') established under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a and 348) for residues of the insecticide/miticide tetradifon and the fungicide sulfur dioxide in or on raw agricultural commodities (RACs) and processed foods. EPA is initiating this action because all registered food uses associated with these tolerances, exemptions from tolerances, and food additive regulations have been canceled. The registrations for sulfur dioxide and tetradifon were canceled because the registrant failed to pay the required maintenance fee and/or the registrant voluntarily canceled all registered uses of the pesticide. Based on the fact that there are no current food use registrations associated with these tolerances, exemptions from tolerance, and food additive regulations, EPA proposes to revoke them. A tolerance, an exemption from tolerance, or a food additive regulation is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical that is not registered for a particular food use. The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerance regulations. Since there are no food use registrations associated with these tolerances, exemptions from tolerance, and food additive regulations, and hence no legal use in the United States, and since these pesticides are either not persistent or sufficient time has elapsed since their prior use for residues to dissipate, residues should not appear in any domestically produced commodities. EPA proposes to revoke the tolerances for residues of the insecticide/miticide tetradifon (2,4,5,4'-tetrachlorodiphenyl sulfone) as listed in 40 CFR 180.174 in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: peppermint and spearmint (100 ppm); fresh hops (30 ppm); figs (6 ppm); apples, apricots, cherries, crabapples, grapes, nectarines, peaches, pears, plums (fresh prunes), quinces, and strawberries (5 ppm); citrus citron, grapefruit, lemons, limes, oranges, and tangerines (2 ppm); cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, tomatoes, and winter squash (1 ppm); meat and milk (0 ppm). EPA proposes to revoke the exemption from tolerance for residues of the fungicide sulfur dioxide as listed in 40 CFR 180.1013: (1) liquid grain-fumigant formulations for marker or fire-retardant purposes at levels not exceeding 5 percent by weight of such formulations are exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on barley, buckwheat, corn, oats, popcorn, rice, rye, grain sorghum (milo), and wheat; (2) residues of sulfur dioxide resulting from postharvest fungicidal use are exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on corn for feed use only. EPA also proposes to revoke the food additive regulations for residues of the pesticide tetradifon (2,4,5,4'-tetrachlorodiphenyl sulfone) as listed in 40 CFR 185.5475 in or on the following commodities: dried hops (120 ppm); dried figs (10 ppm); dried tea (8 ppm). Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains sulfur dioxide or tetradifon may request, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , that the proposal to revoke the RAC tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation, revoking the tolerances and exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for raw agricultural commodities, and food additive regulations for processed foods. Further, EPA is soliciting comments from any person adversely affected by revocation of the tolerances, exemptions from tolerance, and food additive regulations. EPA requests that anyone adversely affected by these revocations submit information providing the following specific information: (1) Are there any existing stocks of the chemical?; (2) If so, how much?; (3) When will the stocks be depleted?; (4) How long would the commodities treated with these chemicals be in the channels of trade? Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300336]. All written comments filed in response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response Section, at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Agency has conducted an analysis in order to satisfy requirements as specified by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This analysis is available for public inspection in Rm. 1132 at the Virginia address given above. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4. 1993), the Agency must determine whether a proposed regulatory action being proposed is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant'') ; (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have an economic impact on small businesses, small organizations, or small governmental jurisdictions. This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner. Since all domestic registrations for these uses of tetradifon and sulfur dioxide have been canceled, it is anticipated that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances, exemptions from tolerance, and food additive regulations are revoked. Accordingly, I certify that this regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
