Both of them, however, explicitly rejected these warnings. MING PAO tried to contact Wei Jingsheng, but people in his family said that he would not be at home these few days. Wei Jingsheng was arrested and jailed in 1979 for publishing articles criticizing the authorities' antidemocracy policy. He was released last September. According to yesterday's report by THE NEW YORK TIMES, Wei Jingsheng received a string of warnings from the authorities this month. He was warned against further discussing democracy with foreign reporters and against publishing in an overseas arena a book about his 14 years of prison life. According to Wei Jingsheng, between 1 and 10 February he had received three warnings, and since he left prison last September he had received seven warnings. Each time, however, he rejected the warning and declared that he "would not yield to excessive and unreasonable warnings." According to the report, Wei Jingsheng took concrete action against the warnings. THE NEW YORK TIMES said that he sent a letter to the International Olympic Committee last week, demanding that it impose sanctions against Beijing because of the authorities' jailing of dissident Qian Yongmin, who opposed China's hosting of the 2000 Olympic Games. Qian Yongmin is one of the drafters of the "Peace Charter." He was sentenced, without an official trial, to two years' detention in a labor camp. Wei Jingsheng said in his letter to the International Olympic Committee: "The detention of a person for his opinion regarding the Olympics showed that the Olympic spirit has gone rotten in China." Yesterday, MING PAO tried to place a long-distance call to Wei Jingsheng, but he was not at home. According to people in his family, Wei Jingsheng was often out, and this time, he had been out for several consecutive days. "We do not know where he is now and do not know when he will return." When this MING PAO reporter mentioned that Wei Jingsheng had been warned several times by the public security authorities, people in his family said that they did not know about this. Yu Haocheng, another firm dissident, is a law expert. In the 1980's, he was a responsible person of the Qunchong Publishing House under the Ministry of Public Security. He was detained between 1989 and 1990, and was then prohibited from going abroad. Last October, he received an invitation to a symposium on human rights in Hong Kong, but he still could not attend it. His speech was published there, anyway. His recent application for overseas travel again was turned down by the authorities, and he was warned that if he continued to publish human rights articles in overseas arenas, he would be punished. Last week, he firmly claimed that the Chinese Constitution gives him the right to publish writings. It is expected that China's human rights conditions once again will become the focus of the mass media's attention. In two days, Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights affairs, will visit Beijing and discuss the human rights issue with Chinese officials. In March, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher also will visit China in order to assess the improvement of human rights there as a prelude to President Clinton's final decision on whether to extend China's most-favored-nation trade status.
