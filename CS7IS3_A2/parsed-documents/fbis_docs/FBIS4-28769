This was disclosed by several senior members of the ruling parties and the SDPJ on 10 June. The ruling parties intend to make the SDPJ come back to the ruling coalition by moving closer to a voluntary general resignation by the Hata cabinet, which has been sought by the SDPJ. Rightists in the SDPJ, who have a close relationship with Secretary General Wataru Kubo, and trade unions are speaking highly of moves by the ruling parties to bring the SDPJ back to the ruling coalition. They are calling on the SDPJ to return to the coalition government after seeking an agreement on policies. However, Chairman Murayama, centrists, and leftists of the SDPJ are poised to press the Hata cabinet to resign en masse. Whether or not the SDPJ will decide to return to the ruling coalition remains unknown. During a recent Central Committee meeting, the SDPJ called for a voluntary general resignation by the Hata cabinet and the formation of a new coalition government. During the meeting, the SDPJ also announced that it would not hesitate to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet and call for dissolving the House of Representatives and holding general elections. On 10 June, the ruling parties told a senior rightist member of the SDPJ that it would be difficult for the Hata cabinet to voluntarily resign en masse because Prime Minister Hata has had no political flaws. But they informally asked the SDPJ to accept a sweeping reshuffle of the Hata cabinet as a general resignation and to then return to the ruling coalition. This request has been endorsed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, and Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. Commenting on the request by the ruling parties in a 10 June YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Takashi Yonezawa, ruling Democratic Socialist Party chairman, said: "A sweeping reshuffle of the Hata cabinet is one of our options." An influential senior member in a ruling party said: "There will be a sweeping reshuffle of the Hata cabinet or it will resign en masse if the Diet approves a no- confidence motion. If the Diet votes down the no-confidence motion, the Hata cabinet will talk with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the SDPJ about how to replace the current coalition partners." However, he indicated that for the time being, the ruling parties would aim to bring the SDPJ back into the ruling coalition through a sweeping reshuffle of the Hata cabinet. In response, a senior rightist member of the SDPJ has insisted the: "SDPJ hold talks with the ruling parties to look for areas of compromise in a bid to return to the ruling coalition rather than merely asking the Hata cabinet to voluntarily resign en masse." Expressing his intention to respond positively to the ruling parties request, he indicated the possibility of Kubo and Ozawa holding talks. On 10 June, in a separate YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Kubo, while indicating his eagerness for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition, stated: "At the present stage, if our party accepts the request from the ruling parties, it would become a hurdle to new developments." However, Chairman Murayama stated: "If the Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse, we can do nothing with the ruling parties. We cannot accept the idea that the SDPJ will return to the ruling coalition after the Hata cabinet undergoes a sweeping reshuffle." If the idea is surfacing within the SDPJ that the party will rejoin the ruling coalition after the Hata cabinet undergoes a sweeping reshuffle, this will inevitably spark an intra-party confrontation. Consultations between the SDPJ and the ruling parties on forming a new coalition government are expected to face rough sailing because of the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development. There is a strong view that it will be difficult for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. The ruling parties intend to look for a way to forge an alliance with the LDP, while urging the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. In the 10 June YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Kubo proposed that if a new coalition government is formed, a "general council" be created as the ruling parties' supreme decision-making body to replace the current meeting of representatives, and that the body be composed of plural representatives sent by ruling parties and parliamentary groups in proportion to their parliamentary seats. Kubo's proposal is one of the conditions for the SDPJ to participate in a new coalition government, and the proposal is aimed at getting rid of the traditional back-door negotiations by running the new coalition government democratically and making its decision-making process more transparent.
