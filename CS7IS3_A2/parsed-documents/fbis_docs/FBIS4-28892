They are filled with the firm determination to actively contribute to implementing the party's light-industry-first policy by effecting a new innovation in people's consumer goods production at a time when thirty years have passed since the dear comrade leader began to exercise his leadership in our party's work, and they are now further exerting themselves on the occasion of Local Industry Day [7 June]. On 7 June 1958, 36 years ago, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song published the historic work, "On Increasing People's Consumer Goods and Improving Commodity Circulation Work," and, thus, elucidated a brilliant future for the development of local industry. Since then, he has strengthened and developed our local industry, along with our large-scale central industry, into a mighty and powerful consumer goods production base which has greatly contributed to implementing the party's policy of carrying out the revolution in light industry. Shining on the path of the rapid development of local industry is the immortal leadership achievement of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Developing local industry is an important way of increasing production rapidly and improving the people's living. The dear comrade leader, with his deep insight into the important position of local industry, has been deeply interested in its development. When he personally conducted on-the-spot guidance to local industry plants, the dear comrade leader not only gave detailed teachings to the matters on increasing quantities and kinds of consumer goods by mobilizing and using local reserves and potential to the maximum and on improving their quality, but also led functionaries and working people in this sector to the single road of victory. In the summer of 1962, the dear comrade leader conducted an on-the-spot guidance to various local industry plants in Sakchu county. This became an occasion for a new turn in the development of our local industry. Visiting Sakchu textile plant that day, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il expressed satisfaction upon witnessing the appearance of the plant, where workers were working vigorously with modern equipment, and the cloth they produced, said with joy at a meeting with functionaries of the plant: In four years, the plant which started with a loom set in a room of another person's house has changed beyond recognition today. He then stressed the need to produce more good-quality cloth by improving the level of technical provisions at local plants and fully mobilizing and utilizing locally available sources of raw materials. The dear comrade leader also visited the Sakchu corn processing plant and there said that only when we build local industry plants with our own strength and develop technology rapidly will we make the country richer and the people better off. Based on this deep understanding of the real situation in the Sakchu county and on his analysis of data, the dear comrade leader published the historic document, "The Position and Role of a Socialist Country's County," which is another brilliant milestone in developing local industry. In August 1963, the dear comrade leader visited Pungsan, called the first village under the sky, and personally looked around a nameless food store in the town of Pungsan. On that day, he even personally tasted the soy sauce that is supplied to residents. He even provided detailed instructions on the method for producing more delicious soy sauce and bean paste. In June 1990, four years ago, the dear comrade leader, in his historic letter to participants of the national meeting of light industry, set forth concrete tasks and methods to further develop local industry and to vigorously wage people's consumer goods production as a mass movement. Thus, he vigorously inspired functionaries and working people in the local industry sector into the revolution in light industry. Recently the dear comrade leader has been providing us with constant love and care in order to provide our people with a happier and richer lives by more rapidly improving the standard of the people's living. In an effort to repay the dear comrade leader's great love and care with loyalty, functionaries and working people in this sector have waged a vigorous struggle to produce various kinds of good-quality people's consumer goods by effectively utilizing the existing production capabilities and mobilizing locally available reserves and potential to the maximum. As a result of this, our local industry has made rapid development and is, accordingly, contributing greatly to smoothly meeting the ever-increasing people's demands for consumer goods. Comrade Yi Kyong-yong from the General Department of Local Industry of North Pyongan Province says: [Begin recording] Thanks to our party's chuche-oriented policy of simultaneouly developing central and local industry, our North Pyongan Province has made rapid progress in local industry. Local industry plants with modern production facilities have been built everywhere in our province today, including Changsong and Paetong, which were treated as remote and secluded areas in the past. These local industry plants in our province have produced great quantities of various kinds of consumer goods with good quality in order to make our people's living more civilized and affluent. Indeed, our industry which started from scratch, is today demonstrating its appearance as a chuche-oriented industry which can manufacture everything. This is indeed a great change. This great change and great success on this land, is the brilliant result of the great leader's wise leadership and the dear comrade leader's energetic guidance. [end recording] Functionaries and working people who work and live in Sakchu, the glorious land, where the dear comrade leader's immortal achievements dwell, are effecting constant innovation in building a raw material base and in modernizing local industry with the burning determination to effect greater success in developing local industry. All counties in North Pyongan Province, including Changsong county, Chongju county, and Kwaksan county, have each built a 200-chongbo base for raw material cultivation as demanded by the party and are producing various kinds of people's consumer goods based on the base. Counties in South Pyongan Province, including Yangdok county and Sinyang county, have collected great quantities of wild fruit, wild berries, and wild vegetables for developing local industry. In addition, cities and counties like Huichon city and Chonchon county of Chagang Province, Kim Chong-suk county and Paekam county of Yanggang Province, and Pujon county of South Hamgyong Province, have constantly developed local industry by properly utilizing the specific situation of the regions. These cities and counties have been developing their local industry by building medium- and small-type power plants and other numerous local industry plants, including chemical plants and caustic soda plants, everywhere. Functionaries and working people in the local industry sector have registered great success in their struggle to modernize local industry, too. Today, functionaries and working people in the local industry sector recall with high dignity, their proud days of having traversed the single road of leaping under the wise leadership of the great leader and the dear comrade leader. They are now vigorously struggling with the lofty zeal to effect a decisive turn in the production of people's consumer goods this year.
