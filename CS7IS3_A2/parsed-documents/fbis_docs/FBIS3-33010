"The death sentence must be carried out, regardless of whether the renegade (Rushdie -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note) is repentant," read the statement issued yesterday by the official Iranian press agency IRNA. The comment was made on the fifth anniversary of the death sentence against Rushdie declared by the late Ayatollah Khomeyni due to the supposedly blasphemous nature of his book The Satanic Verses. Minister Kooijmans wants to push within the Council of Ministers for action to be taken against Iran. The Greek presidency, according to a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, is considering approaching the Iranian Government on behalf of the 12 member states of the European Union, in order to show its disgust over the Rushdie affair. The Netherlands does not plan to scale down its diplomatic relations with Iran, said the spokesman. [passage omitted]
