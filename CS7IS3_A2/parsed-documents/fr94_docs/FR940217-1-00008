FR940217-1-00008 FR940217-1-00005 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 17 CFR Parts 240 and 249 [Release No. 34&hyph;33608; International Series Release No. 635; File No. S7&hyph;24&hyph;91] RIN 3235&hyph;AE42 Large Trader Reporting System AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Reproposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Commission is reproposing Rule 13h&hyph;1 and Form 13H under Section 13(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). Rule 13h&hyph;1 was initially proposed by the Commission in Exchange Act Release No. 29593 (August 22, 1991), 56 FR 42550 (August 28, 1991). Reproposed Rule 13h&hyph;1 would establish an activity-based identification, recordkeeping, and reporting system for large trader accounts and transactions. Reproposed Rule 13h&hyph;1 also would establish a definition for large traders and require such large traders to file Form 13H with the Commission. Registered broker-dealers would be required to maintain transaction records for each large trader account and report transactions upon the request of the Commission or a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') designated by the Commission. Reproposed Rule 13h&hyph;1 would fulfill the goals of the Market Reform Act of 1990 (``Market Reform Act'') by providing the Commission with the information necessary to reconstruct trading activity in periods of market stress and for enforcement or other regulatory purposes, without imposing undue burdens or costs on market participants. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to submit written comments should file three copies with Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. All comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;24&hyph;91.

Introduction The Commission is reproposing Rule 13h&hyph;1 to implement the large trader reporting provisions of the Market Reform Act 1 and section 13(h) of the Exchange Act. 2 The Large Trader Reporting System that would be established by reproposed Rule 13h&hyph;1 was initially proposed in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29593 (August 22, 1991), 56 FR 42550 (August 28, 1991) (``Proposing Release''). 1 Public Law 101&hyph;432, 104 Stat. 963 (1990). 2 15 U.S.C. 78m(h) (1990). The Proposing Release chronicled the fundamental changes in participants, information systems, and investment techniques that have shaped the securities markets during the last decade. 3 As a result of these changes, today's securities markets are global in nature and characterized by large foreign and domestic investors that rapidly trade large quantities of securities, for themselves and others, throughout the world. During this period of change, the securities markets have experienced an increase in activity and the potential for volatility. 3 See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42550. The legislative history accompanying the Market Reform Act noted the Commission's limited ability to analyze the causes of the significant market declines of October 1987 and 1989. 4 The Commission's inability to analyze trading activity was attributed to its lack of specific statutory authority to gather broad-based samples of investor trading information. To resolve this problem, Congress provided the Commission with specific authority to establish a large trader reporting system. 4 See generally Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Report to accompany the Market Reform Act of 1990, S. Rep. No. 300, 101st Cong. 2d Sess. (May 22, 1990) (reporting S. 648) (``Senate Report'') and House Comm. on Energy and Commerce, Report to accompany the Securities Market Reform Act of 1990, H.R. Rep. No. 524, 101st Cong. 2d Sess. (June 5, 1990) (reporting H.R. 3657) (``House Report''). In the Proposing Release, the Commission proposed rules that defined the term large trader, required the disclosure of a large trader's identity and accounts to the Commission or others, and provided for the assignment of unique identifying numbers to large traders. The proposed rule also required broker-dealers that carry large trader accounts to maintain records of identified large trader transactions as well as transactions of those persons who have not identified themselves, but whom the broker-dealer knew or had reason to know were large traders. In addition, the proposed rule required broker-dealers to report large trader transactions in machine-readable form through the industry's existing electronic bluesheet system to the Commission upon request. The Commission solicited comments on various aspects of the proposed rule, including the definition of a large trader, the identifying and reporting activity thresholds, exemptions, Form 13H filing requirements, execution time recordkeeping and reporting, and the proposed rule's application to foreign entities. The Commission was particularly sensitive to the burdens imposed by the proposed system and sought alternatives that would reduce such burdens and still accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act. The Commission received 77 written comments on the proposed rule. 5 In addition, members of the Division of Market Regulation met on numerous occasions with the Securities Industry Association (``SIA''), the American Bankers Association, the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), the Securities Industry Automation Corporation (``SIAC''), and two broker-dealers, to answer questions and discuss issues related to the operation of the proposed system and its impact on market participants. 6 5 The comment letters and the Division of Market Regulation's summary thereof have been placed in the Commission's public files. See SEC File No. S7&hyph;24&hyph;91. 6 Memoranda summarizing the Division of Market Regulation's meetings with these entities have been placed in the Commission's public files. See SEC File No. S7&hyph;24&hyph;91. While generally supportive of the goals of the Market Reform Act, 7 the commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule would be unduly burdensome and costly. The commenters generally sought clarification of ``who'' would be a large trader, ``what'' information must be disclosed on Form 13H, and ``when'' Form 13H or trade report information must be submitted. These concerns were manifested in specific questions and comments regarding the rules for aggregation, the definitions of ownership and control, the scope of Form 13H information, and time frames for filing Form 13H. The commenters also addressed the identifying activity level, exemptions, and the duty to supervise compliance with the proposed rule. Finally, the broker-dealer community raised several concerns regarding the technical aspects of the reporting requirements for execution times, multiple large trader identification numbers (``LTID''), and the time frame for submitting trade reports. 7 Comments were received from seven types of market participants and regulatory organizations, which may be grouped as follows: 12 broker-dealers; 24 investment advisers; 13 industry or professional associations; 8 banks or trust companies; 6 regulatory organizations; 4 law firms; and 9 other affected market participants.
