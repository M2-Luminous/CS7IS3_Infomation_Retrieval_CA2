The former Soviet Union currently owes Slovakia about $1.5 billion. Slovakia will seek to recover at least part of the amount by capitalizing its claims, making decisions on the basis of the debtor's payment ability to pay and the Slovak Government's needs, the statement says. On November 30, 1993, Slovakia and Russia signed a protocol on reaching an agreement on partially decreasing the indebtedness of the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation to the Slovak republic through deliveries of special technology. On the basis of this agreement, Slovakia bought in December six Russian MiG-29 fighter planes and spare parts for various other equipment, worth a total of $180 million. On Friday [21 January] in Moscow, Urban announced that Slovakia would reduce the debt further by buying another $80-90 million worth of equipment. Like Hungary, Slovakia is attempting to get partial payment in the form of replacement parts for the Russian military equipment which the Slovak Army uses, according to the statement. Because technical systems cannot be changed from one day to the next in order to be compatible with NATO's weapons systems, it is necessary to maintain our present equipment in combat readiness. This is not possible without deliveries of replacement parts. Urban emphasized that the deliveries did not indicate a Slovak orientation to the East. Nor is this measure to be explained as a lack of seriousness towards our NATO partners.
