He said active development of the Lithuanian economy is unlikely if inflation is not stopped. The fund will try to persuade the Lithuanian central bank to carry out a tighter monetary policy, he said. Knoebl criticized the bank for buying too much hard currency and exceeding the permissible limit of cash in circulation. According to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, the amount of cash in circulation must not rise above 1,100 million lits by March 31, but 1,266 million are in circulation already. Knoebl said the fund began consultation with the Lithuanian Government and the central bank on ways of continuing Lithuanian economic reforms. Both sides are now working on a long-term economic policy memorandum for Lithuania. The new memorandum would cover a period of three years and would come into effect at the end of this year, he said. Knoebl said the memorandum should include strict requirements that would accelerate Lithuania's transition to a market economy. The IMF official said Lithuania's primary tasks are to carry out a number of structural rearrangements, to speed up privatization, to reform enterprises and to reorganize the financial sector. Knoebl said it is extremely important to stabilize the economy even more, because, in his opinion, the economy started to recover. The official statistics does not properly reflect private businesses, he said. In March, the IMF Board intends to discuss Lithuania's adherence to the economic policy memorandum. The fund's mission, led by Knoebl, came to Lithuania to collect information for a report that will be presented to the IMF Board.
