He will attend a meeting of the National Executive and congressional party bloc members tomorrow when a final decision on the PT participation in the constitutional revision process will be made. The results of the meeting are more important even than the votes of the PT during the work of the revision process. If those attending the meeting approve the proposal to participate, it will represent a defeat for the Shiites [fundamentalist PT followers], those who do not want the PT involved in broader alliances with the center-left, and those who want a radical government program. The so-called "flexibility" sought by some PT factions, according to their proponents, will permit Lula to increase support for his candidacy above the present 30 percent level. The PT candidate is being forced to change his opinion. After making a harsh speech against constitutional revision two months ago, in accordance with the position of the National Executive, Lula now wants a "political participation," which is more in accordance with the wishes of the party bloc in Congress. Another meeting with the same agenda took place last week but results were inconclusive. Lula was touring northern states at that time. He could have attended, but preferred not to. Now he is being forced to take sides in the PT internal dispute.
