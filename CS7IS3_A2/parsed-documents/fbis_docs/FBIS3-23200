An unidentified man who spoke in Greek called the duty officer at Larnaca Airport and told him that "there is a bomb on the plane that will fly to Vienna." The Austrian Airlines flight had just landed at the airport coming from Cairo. It was supposed to leave for Vienna at 1435 [1235 GMT] today. Police inspected the aircraft but found nothing suspicious. Following a careful inspection of the luggage and the passengers, which lasted for approximately one hour, the plane left at 1505 [1305 GMT] for its destination. The U.S. coordinator handled the situation with humor. Lamb and the U.S. Embassy spokesman who was accompanying him remained in the VIP room during the inspection.
