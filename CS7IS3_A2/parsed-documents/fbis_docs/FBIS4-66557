Over the last two or three years, Marxists have dismissed the casteist challenge in Uttar Pradesh [U.P.] and Bihar as class-based struggle. In light of India's history, which is more applicable; class struggle or struggle for social justice? The true nature of the communist-socialist struggle [in India] is before us now. What will it be, caste or class? What will laborers base their struggle on? Communists have rested content that this question has been answered. Now they have had to come back down onto the Maidan [open space in Calcutta where processions are held] to deal with this dispute all over again. Leftist theorists are going back to analysis and ledgers. They are shaking the dust off of the books of Ram Manohar Lohiya [communist intellectual]. Along with the casteist politics brought to U.P. by Kansi Ram, Bihar's caste-based politics is also experiencing a wave. There are indications of a joining of forces of Dalits and OBC's [other backward castes]. The Yadavs have been holding gatherings; also, the Vaishyas and Kurmis. The Telis, Dangis, Rajputs, Chandras, Chamars, and Chaursiyas are about to do the same. All in the name of caste! Now the Brahmins and Bhumihars are beginning to organize. Leaders, both government and private are attending these gatherings. These are not really political gatherings but caste assemblages! The recent Kurmi assemblage in Patna was very impressive and turned everyone's head. It was not just a show either. Here BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], JD [Janata Dal], Congress (I) and CPI [Communist Party-India] leaders joined together, showing the force of the wind blowing through northern India. By attempting to swim against the casteism current, Marxists are getting winded, just like BJP. They are both bewildered. Recent political developments have served to remind Hindutva advocates that there is no one basis or point on which to unite Hindu society. BJP has had to deemphasize Ayodhya in Bihar as they do not want to be known as a Brahmin or high-caste party. In order to attract Dalit and Tribal votes, BJP has begun to organize Raths [processions] based on their respective traditions but without much success. The party is not too optimistic over the Sita Ram Keshari case decided in the Supreme Court. Even if communist leaders are divided over the Mandal Commission, they have accepted the U.P. vote as an awakening of the Dalits. In a short time, two things have taken place; an escalating rivalry between the Dalits and higher castes (including OBC's) and Kansi Ram's jihad against communists. His speeches are not mere rustic rhetoric either. The communists have been hostile towards social justice for a long time. A long time ago Lohiya wrote: "Let no one think that it is a matter of fighting the higher castes. In class struggle, when the capitalist system falls, caste problems will automatically disappear. The curse of the caste system is sustained by capitalism and class differences. Those who regard class struggle as inevitable and strive for a classless society have no regard for a caste-based society that thrives on differences." Caste or class; this old socialist-communist dilemma has been stirred up again by Mulayam Singh, Kansi Ram, and Lalu Yadav. Their cry for ``Social Justice'' has gradually spread over northern India. It will undoubtedly be an important issue in the next few elections. Economic issues have been downgraded in this call for social justice. Leftists are seeing whether or not these two issues can be combined. Senior CPI leader Chaturanan Mishra confessed, "We refuse to answer this question. Communists do not understand the necessity for agitation by lower castes." CPM [Communist Party India-Marxist] leader Ganesh Sjankar Vidyarthi also confessed, "Caste conflict has put our party in a difficult position." CPI-ML [Communist Party-India Marxist-Leninist] recently held a gathering in Patna called ``Social Change''. CPI General Secretary Indrajit Gupta confessed: "Just concentrating on class conflict will get us nowhere. We need to focus on caste conflict." The fall of the Soviet Union and China's about face [economically] has forced India's communists to look within. Domestically, while BJP's communal wave has subsided, the caste wave is still rising. Communists are being forced to contemplate the relevance of Marxist theory. CPI recently held a work retreat in Hyderabad in which the focus was ``Caste's internal workings and the question of social justice in India.'' A study paper was published from this in which the folowing statement is found: ``Caste-based politics began to escalate in the 1980's due to lack of economic progress. Leftists have neglected social and cultural issues. This is why caste politics have taken on a social theme.'' The leftists, while doing some soul searching, are still clinging to class struggle as the ultimate explanation. They want to change caste-based politics into class-based politics. Leftists are, of course, vey weak in Hindi-speaking areas. Naxal leader Vinod Mishra fears this declining influence and hopes to quickly break Dalit enchantment with Kansi Ram: "In Varanasi, Yadavs have clashed with Harijans and this will shake up BSP. Kansi Ram cannot solve problems between backward castes and Harijans." Mishra feels unsure, however, whether disillusionment with Kansi Ram will send Harijans toward the leftists camp or toward BJP! Two years ago, leftists united in Bihar in a land seizure and redistribution campaign. This desperate attempt to instigate class struggle and elevate it over caste struggle was directionless and leaders were divided on strategy. Lalu Prasad refused to join hands with leftists despite threats and bribes. Instead, his party often took the side of landowners. Kansi Ram refused to go to Harijan slums. In fact, Harijans did not get tickets to run for SP or BSP; businessmen did. All of these facts challenge leftist class assertions. They are not very strong in Hindi-speaking areas anyway. The new circumstances are causing them to resort to soul searching. Will the communists in India finally have to admit defeat?
