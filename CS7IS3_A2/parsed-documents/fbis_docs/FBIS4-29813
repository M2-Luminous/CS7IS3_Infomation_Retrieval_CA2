More than 200 students and journalists staged a noisy protest in front of the information ministry, saying the government ban had "killed" democracy in the country. One march involving around 150 people went to the ministry from the offices of the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), a human rights group. Scores of others went from the premises of the weekly DETIK tabloid, one of the publications banned. Security officials confiscated banners critical of Information Minister Harmoko, but took several journalists, student and human rights representatives into the ministry. LBH chairman Adnan Buying was among them. After failing to meet ministry officials, the demonstrators promised to return on Thursday with a bigger rally behind them. The government announced Tuesday that publishing licences for DETIK, EDITOR and TEMPO, the country's biggest selling newspaper, had been withdrawn. The authorities quoted administrative reasons for the ban on EDITOR and DETIK. TEMPO was banned because of its editorial content, an information ministry official said. But all three publications had written articles critical of research and technology ministry Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, an ally of President Suharto. A military spokesman, meanwhile, said the ban should not have happened, a press report said. "I am close to the press and of course I do not want this situation to occur," the SUARA PEMBARUAN daily quoted military spokesman Brigadier General Syarwan Hamid as saying. "I hope the press can learn a lesson from it." Syarwan said he was concerned at the ban and added that the information ministry should have considered the move carefully before acting. He said the government wanted to develop openness, but that the press had to use the opportunity positively. "Don't let the openness create a bad situation and tragedy. That is not, of course, what we want," he said. Eros Jarot, chief editor of DETIK, and his counterpart from Tempo, Gunawan Muhamad, met Wednesday and later appeared among the students with calls to remain calm. Jarot said however the country was entering a "clouded" era because of the government move. Jarot called on the government to make clear the motives behind the ban. Petitions distributed by journalists during the protests said the ban breached constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression. TEMPO and DETIK have recently reported on a rift between Habibie and the armed forces and finance ministry over the purchase of 39 former East German ships. Editor this month published a cover story on plans to set up a nationalist student movement, led by Transmigration Minister Siswono Yudohusodo, to rival Habibie's Indonesian Moslems Intellectual Association.
