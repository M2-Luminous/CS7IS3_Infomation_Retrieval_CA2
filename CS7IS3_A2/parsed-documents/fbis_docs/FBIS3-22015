"We all lose if the dialogue is interrupted; peaceful measures must be sought," said Cardenas in pointing out that the eradication of surplus coca plantations should be based on an agreement with the producers and their grass-roots organizations. Cardenas added: "Forceful eradication means violence and we reject it." According to some coca growers' leaders, the clash that resulted in several injuries was prompted by a government decision to forcefully eradicate surplus coca plantations. The government has stated that the plantations eradicated during the past few months were located near drug laboratories and the eradication is being done according to the law. Government Minister German Quiroga asserted that the clash was prompted by the peasants' decision to occupy by force the Coca Eradication Directorate (Direco), instigated by drug traffickers. Cardenas declined commenting on what happened in Chapare. He said he did not have precise information but noted that if abuses were perpetrated, Congress will demand an explanation from the executive branch. He said that although there are laws that provide for the eradication of surplus plantations, it should be carried out by mutual agreement. Cardenas warned that the recent clashes will strain even more the tense relationship between coca growers organizations and the organizations in charge of controlling coca production. Law No. 1008 on coca and controlled substances classifies Chapare as a transitional region in which the coca plantations must be eradicated by common agreement with prior payment of $2,000 per hectares to the growers. Moreover, the law requires that the government carry out programs for alternative crops to avoid any traumatic consequences. However, over the past two years the eradication program has not developed according to schedule and the benefits of the alternative crops are not visible, which has been very frustrating for the peasants, thus causing clashes between producers and interdiction forces on several occasions.
