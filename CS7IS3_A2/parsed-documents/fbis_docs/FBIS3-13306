He said the Lebanese people are firm in their unity no matter how often they are faced with challenges and danger. He added that the abominable crime [explosion in a Beirut church] committed in the midst of the peace process surprised us but the Lebanese people's unanimity on denouncing it came as a plebiscite that confirmed the confidence in our march. The president added: Hence, it is our responsibility to be frank. Committing a criminal act inside God's houses reflects the extent to which moral, spiritual, and civil backwardness has reached. We are no longer able to tell whether the call for peace ushers in the 21st century or whether it stoops with humanity to the world of treachery. We appeal to the wise people and thinkers to rush to launch a major cultural awakening campaign to uproot the desire for violence and extremism. We uphold the cause of peace and democracy, and man's life is dearer than shedding blood in vain. The Lebanese people's denunciation of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was no less than the denunciation of the massacre in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. We are united for the sake of Lebanon as we are united against violence and extremism. Lebanon, which held the shield of defense of all Arabs, is against the defamation of Arab dignity anywhere, even against our brothers [reference to Palestinians], for whom we bore the heaviest burden when they believed that the road to Jerusalem passed through the destruction of Lebanon. When they thought they had obtained their rights, they broke away from us and bypassed Arab solidarity, to which we committed ourselves when the negotiations began. President al-Hirawi continued: Our security has been achieved, but before we could rebuild and recover our rights, certain factions have rushed through crime to revive fear and doubt in our unity and accomplishments. However, the national unity proved how fruitful our efforts have been and proved that our peace process is genuine. He added: You all know that any incident smaller than this crime was enough to foment sedition and destroy the country. We have won the wager, the bet on our unity. The Lebanese people decided on coexistence as their way of life and as the message of their country. Any violation of this method is a blow against the Lebanese people's will and against the whole world, which was unanimous on supporting Lebanon's reconciliation, independence, and sovereignty. Foreign plots will not succeed if people at home are not (?deceived) by wrong convictions and allured by a handful of money. In any case, the state will not hesitate to deal with any breach of security because security, freedom, and national unity take precedence over politics and its ploys. What happened did not target the Christians as much as it targeted the state, the citizen, and all of Lebanon. The president said that what is needed is a link between freedom and fact. He added that decisive options are necessary in various economic, political, cultural, and educational spheres and noted that loyalty to the country is not determined according to relations with officials. He asked: How can we be healthy and how can democracy be healthy amidst sectarian squabbling? What is required is a thought that will develop citizenship and combat sectarianism and tribalism. He emphasized commitment to seeking a comprehensive and just peace based on international resolutions and in coordination with the brothers, especially Syria. He said: We will not go separately and will allow no one to take exclusive control of us. We will not be insignificant in peace time. We are following up the process with every confidence and faith. President al-Hirawi affirmed that everyone will rush to receive his holiness the pope, who will see the truth in our country and realize that the greatest of nations is the one that grows stronger when there is danger.
