Seen in the light of the horrific massacre, the U.S. stand raises many questions about the entire role of the United States. So much so that [word indistinct] list may be as follows: What kind of peace does the United States want? Will the United States be up to the role of a true peace sponsor? Is the United States willing to explore all the possibilities to make peace? [passage indistinct] This is because the long, drawn-out talks convened in Washington following the Madrid conference, and then the Oslo, Granada, Paris, Davos, Cairo, and Taba talks, after the signing of the Declaration of Principles agreement on the White House lawn, have revealed [word indistinct] and real obstacles placed in the path of the peace process and the Declaration of Principles. [passage indistinct] The U.S. argument has consistently been that the United States is loath to apply any pressure on any of the interlocutors. [passage indistinct] As a result of this Israeli behavior and the (?emotional) support for this Israeli behavior [words indistinct] the beginning was set for 13 December, 1993 and the end for 13 April, 1994. Deadlines came and went. [passage indistinct]. The result has been that the peace initiative has lost much of its luster and the hopes pinned on it have been blighted. Also, the Declaration of Principles has lost a good deal of popular support and the hopes based on it have waned. Things now look as if we are back at square one. The U.S. Administration has been aware of the true picture. [passage indistinct] In regards to the Hebron massacre itself and the developments leading up to and following the slaughter and the participants in it, Israel's effort at a cover-up has proved unavailing. The Israeli generals, the state inquiry commission itself, the Israeli press, and the Israeli human rights organization, have been uncovering more and more facts and details that can be proved as follows: First, a massacre on that scale had been predicted. Israeli military and political circles had expected similar [word indistinct]. Second, with so many settlements and settlers [passage indistinct]. Third, the Israeli measures and pledges that followed the massacre [passage instinct]. Fourth, [passage indistinct] calling for placing East Jerusalem under the heading of an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories is nothing unusual; it fits in with the essence of the [word indistinct] and with the letter and spirit of the declaration of principles agreement. More importantly, it fits in with the [word indistinct] as revealed by the appalling carnage at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. Why then is this U.S. position, and why is this U.S. threat to use the veto prerogative? We agree with all the parties, including the U.S. Administration, that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque bloodbath has highlighted the pressing need to pursue the peace process and the negotiations, and to secure all the elements required for bringing the peace process and negotiations to a successful conclusion. [passage indistinct]. The last interesting question is this: The United States, which has consistently argued that it does not want to pressure any of the interlocutors, is now applying maximum pressure, including a direct threat to veto a draft resolution proposed by the PLO and the Arab and Muslim groups, as well as European nations led by Russia, the cosponsor of the peace process with the United States. We have not the least doubt that the United States is the most powerful nation on earth and that its ability to apply pressure and issue threats is limitless. However, we think the world has a need for a framework of legitimacy and neutrality and, at least, a modicum of balanced logic. But the U.S. rationale that the United States will support Israel even when it is at fault and, in the meantime, others can bang their heads against the wall [words indistinct] can implement on account of its limitless power. But it will serve no purpose. [Words indistinct] if peace will bring dividends to all the parties, irrespective of the prevailing circumstances, all these parties must shoulder the responsibilities this sought-after peace carries.
