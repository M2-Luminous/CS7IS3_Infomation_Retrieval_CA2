FR940817-1-00004 FR940817-1-00002 Under ยง113.1(g)(4) of the revised rules, the use of funds for an expense that would be considered a political expense under House rules or an officially connected expense under Senate rules would not be personal use to the extent that the expense qualifies as an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or is an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder. The Commission anticipates that, in most circumstances, political and officially connected expenses will be ordinary and necessary expenses of a Federal officeholder for purposes of the FECA, rather than conversions to personal use. However, section 439a of the FECA uses different standards than House and Senate rules for determining whether a particular use of campaign funds is permissible. Specifically, the Commission would not consider any use of funds that would be personal use under ยง113.1(g)(1) to be an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder under the FECA. Thus, the Commission will have to determine whether political of officially connected expenses are personal use on a case-by-case basis. Proposed section 113.1(g)(5) of the revised rules would indicate that payments for expenses that would be personal use under paragraph (g)(1) of this section will generally be considered contributions to the candidate if made by a third party. Consequently, the amount donated or expended will count towards the third party's contribution limits. However, no contribution would result if the payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund, if the funds used were the candidate's personal funds, if the payment was made by a member of the candidate's family from an account jointly held with the candidate, or if the payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy and such payments were made before the candidate became a candidate. Section 113.1(g)(6) would list the members of the candidate's family for the purposes of ยง113.1(g). The Commission is also proposing an amendment to the list of permissible uses of excess campaign funds contained in 11 CFR 113.2. The amendment would specifically indicate that certain travel costs and certain office operating expenditures would be considered ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder under the FECA. It would also specifically indicate that any use of funds that would be personal use under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(1) is not an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officer. The notice also contains a proposed conforming amendment to the definition of expenditure contained in section 100.8(b)(22). Consistent with revised ยง113.1(g)(5), this amendment would clarify that payment of the candidate's personal living expenses by a member of the candidate's family will not be considered expenditures if they are made from an account jointly held with the candidate or were paid by the family member before the candidate became a candidate. In addition to the comments on the proposed rules set out below, the Commission is interested in receiving comments on whether additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements would be useful in administering section 439a. Several of the commenters that responded to the 1993 NPRM expressed the view that additional reporting requirements would be helpful in this area. However, it is difficult to craft a rule that would be both useful in enforcing the personal use ban and not overly burdensome on the reporting committees. The Commission invites commenters to suggest ways in which the reporting requirements could be amended to achieve this goal. Comments are also welcome on the alternative of requiring committees to keep additional records to serve this purpose, without requiring additional reporting. Commenters are encouraged to focus on how these amendments could be crafted to be both useful and not overly burdensome. The Commission notes that Internal Revenue Service regulations under 26 U.S.C. 527 contain a definition of personal use by political organizations. 26 CFR 1.527&hyph;5(a)(1). However, the IRS definition is not controlling in this situation, and is not necessarily coextensive with the proposed rule. The Commission welcomes comments on the revised rules, and on any other issues raised by this rulemaking.
