FR940429-0-00174 FR940429-0-00015 After calculating all of Sam's possible refunds, TCC must use the calculation which provides for the largest refund. In this case, the largest refund is provided by the State refund calculation: $2187. This refund amount must be returned, in Sam's behalf, first to the Title IV, HEA programs and then to Sam, in accordance with the allocation priorities in §668.22(g); no portion of the refund due can be used to pay Sam's unpaid charges to TCC. Example # 2 Fair and Equitable Refund: Nonterm Institution. Institutional Profile. Nonterm Technical Institute (NTI) offers 900-hour and 1200-hour programs, measured in clock hours, and its academic year is 30 weeks long. NTI participates in the Federal Pell Grant program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs. NTI charges by the program and requires payment up-front. The institutional costs of the 900-hour program are: $3000 for tuition; $520 for equipment, books, and supplies; and a $100 administrative fee. Institutional costs for the 1200-hour program are: $4000 for tuition; $740 for equipment, books, and supplies; and a $150 administrative fee. Noninstitutional charges include: living expenses and meals (NTI has no on-campus housing or food service), transportation, and personal miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional costs vary by student budget, depending in part upon the educational program in which the student enrolls.) Applicable Refund Policies. The State in which NTI is located provides a 90 percent refund to students who withdraw before completing 10 percent of the program; students who withdraw after the 10 percent point but before completing 25 percent of the program receive a 70 percent refund; students who withdraw after the 25 percent point but before completing 50 percent of the program receive a 45 percent refund; and students who withdraw after the 50 percent point but before completing 75 percent of the program receive a 20 percent refund. (Students withdrawing after completing 75 percent of the program receive no refund under State guidelines.) NTI's accrediting agency gives an 80 percent refund to students who withdraw before completing 15 percent of the program; students who withdraw after the 15 percent point but before completing 45 percent of the program receive a 50 percent refund; and students who withdraw after the 45 percent point but before completing 60 percent of the program receive a 25 percent refund. (Students withdrawing after completing 60 percent of the program receive no refund under the accrediting agency policy.) Student Profile. Susan the Student, who lives in an off-campus apartment, enrolled in a 900-hour program at NTI and began attending classes. Susan made a cash payment of $800 toward institutional charges. Financial Aid Package and Disbursements. Susan's financial aid package for the program consisted of a $2000 Federal Pell Grant and a $2325 Federal Stafford Loan. Susan's first Federal Pell Grant disbursement ($1000) and the first disbursement of her Federal Stafford Loan ($1081_loan and origination fees have been subtracted) were credited to her institutional account. At the end of the academic year, NTI determined that Susan had unofficially withdrawn. The last record of Susan's attendance was a midterm exam she'd taken after completing 450 hours of the program. Step One: Figuring the Educational Costs. Only institutional costs are included in the refund calculation. NTI must use the institutional costs as charged, by the term, for a total of $3620_$3000 tuition, $520 for equipment, books, and supplies, and $100 for administrative costs. Noninstitutional costs are treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example # 3.) Step Two: Figuring the Totals Paid to Institutional Costs. NTI's records show that Susan paid $800 in cash toward her institutional costs, and that a total of $2081 in student aid was paid toward institutional charges [$1000 Federal Pell+$1081 Federal Stafford=$2081]. The total paid to institutional costs (student payments and financial aid) is $2881 [$800+$2081=$2881]. Only funds paid to institutional charges are included in the refund calculation; aid disbursed to the student for noninstitutional expenses are treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example # 3.) Step Three: Checking for Pro Rata Eligibility Under the Law. To determine whether Susan is eligible for a statutory pro rata refund calculation, NTI must determine if she's a first-time student and if she withdrew on or before the point in time when she had completed 60 percent of the clock hours scheduled for the period of enrollment for which she was charged. Susan enrolled last year in the same program at NTI, but she never began attending classes and so was entitled to a 100 percent refund. Therefore, in accordance with the regulatory definition in §668.22(c), Susan is a first-time student. Susan's last recorded date of attendance was at the point of having completed 450 clock hours; 900 clock hours are scheduled for the program, and 60 percent of the scheduled hours would be 540 clock hours [900 hours×.60=540]. Because Susan is a first-time student and she withdrew before completing 60 percent of the hours scheduled, she is entitled to a statutory pro rata refund calculation. Step Four: Calculating the Unpaid Charges. Because a student's unpaid charges impact the refund calculation, NTI must first calculate Susan's unpaid charges (as defined in §668.22(c) and (f)) using the following formula: Total Institutional Costs ^Total Aid Paid to Institutional Costs =Student's Scheduled Cash Payment (SCP) ^Student's Cash Paid to Institutional Costs =Unpaid Charges To calculate Susan's unpaid charges, NTI subtracts the $2081 in total aid paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) from the total institutional costs of $3620 (from Step One, above). The resulting scheduled cash payment is $1539 [$3620^$2081=$1539]. From that total, NTI subtracts Susan's cash payment of $800 (from Step Two, above) and Susan's unpaid charges equal $739 [$1539^$800=$739]. This amount ($739) will be used in all three refund calculations.
