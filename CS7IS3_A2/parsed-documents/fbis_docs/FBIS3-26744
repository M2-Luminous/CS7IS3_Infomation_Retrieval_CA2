On the black market, one must pay as much as 40,000 yuan (about $4,600) for one. Moreover, "back door" channels must be used to get this mobile phone as soon as possible. But such hurdles aren't stopping a growing number of people from planning to buy a mobile telephone, a symbol of affluence and status. According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, by the end of last year China had 638,000 mobile telephone users, 2.7 times the number in 1992. Sources in the ministry say that in 1993 alone, the number of mobile phone subscribers grew by 461,000. The ministry, encouraged by spectacular expansion of the whole postal and telecoms network, has revised its previously-outlined development targets for mobile telephone service. According to the new targets, the number of mobile phone users will rise to between 900,000 and 1 million by 1995, instead of the previously projected 500,000. This figure will jump to between 4.5 million and million by the end of the century. The explosive growth in mobile telephone services, spurred by the country's rapid economic growth, has created much excitement among overseas manufacturers. They know that about 90 percent of China's mobile phones and related equipment are imported. The market is now dominated by products made by such telecoms giants as Motorola Inc of the United States, and NEC Corp and Mitsubishi of Japan. To meet this burgeoning demand the ministry is encouraging local telecoms administrations to expand their mobile phone networks. In Beijing, the mobile telephone system is being expanded markedly a process that should be completed in June. An official with the Beijing Telecommunications Administration said the plan is to accommodate an additional 60,000 subscribers and extend coverage to suburban counties. To accomplish this, a mobile phone switching system will be installed and 16 base stations will be built. By the end of last year, Beijing had 31,563 mobile phone users, compared with about 11,000 the year before. Meanwhile, the ministry has also urged local authorities to set up regional "roaming services" for mobile phone users. "Roaming service" allows a mobile phone subscriber from one region to use a cellular phone when travelling to other regions. Some provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have established such services in major cities and towns. Zhejiang in East China is the only province to have a complete mobile phone network. Its system serves over 60,000 users in all of its 74 counties and cities. According to the People's Postal and Telecommunications News, by mid-February automatic roaming service will be available in the Yangtze River Delta region.
