It is, however, obvious that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) has no immediate plan to set her free and has instead devised legal measures to continue her unlawful detention and to bar her future participation in Burmese politics. There remains ambiguity over the state of Suu Kyi's detention and her freedom, but a group of Slorc's legal advisers told visiting foreign reporters on Friday that she will not be released when her five-year term of detention expires on July 20. They ambiguously explained that Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the most outspoken critic of the military's heavy-handed policies against pro-democracy demonstrations can be held up to six years according to "existing laws". They also strongly rejected the term "detention" used to describe Suu Kyi's house arrest, arguing that it is only a "restriction" and that the military rulers have been dealing with her "leniently". Five of Slorc's legal experts led by Chief Justice U Aung Toe and Attorney General U Tha Tun told a press conference Suu Kyi's house arrest "was not decided by the court", but by the "existing laws which stipulate that her restriction period will not be construed as expiring on July 20 this year". They said her case "is an executive issue and not a legal issue", and that "at the decision of a three-member central body a person can be restricted up to one year, and at the decision of the government a person can be restricted up to five years". The central body, they said, comprises the ministers of foreign affairs, home affairs and defence. Burmese and foreign observers here said it was the first time they had heard of the existence of such a central body which could arbitrarily sentence people to a year in prison. They believe Slorc will amend the laws to extend Suu Kyi's detention and that she will not be released until a new Constitution is drafted and promulgated, with many provisions that will restrict her political role in Burmese politics. The Slorc's appointed National Convention resumed its meeting on Jan 18 after a four-month break to discuss the three sensitive issues of the state presidency, the state and its structure. It is clear from the detailed and lengthy opening speech of Chief Justice U Aung Toe, also chairman of the National Convention's work committee, that all the guidelines and qualifications for a new charter have already been devised to bar Suu Kyi, a mother of two sons whose husband is a British professor at Oxford University, from running in the presidential elections. Although Aung Toe urged the 668 delegates to exchange views on the three issues, it was obvious from his speech they were being warned not to stray from "basic principles" which had already been laid down. Among other qualifications, the presidential candidate is required to be rich in political, administrative, economic and military experience and must have resided continuously in the country for at least 20 years. Moreover, the candidate, his parents, spouse, children and their spouses are not to owe allegiance to a foreign power, must not be subjects or citizens of a foreign power, and must not be entitled to the rights and privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power. Attorney General U Tha Tun, also a member of the convention's working committee, said two previous constitutions in 1947 and 1974 also stipulated that the state president should not owe allegiance to a foreign power.
