FR940721-2-00117 FR940721-2-00067 [Docket No. 030&hyph;02278; License No. 24&hyph;00513&hyph;32 EA 94&hyph;113] The Curators of the University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri; Confirmatory Order Modifying License (Effective Immediately) I The Curators of the University of Missouri-Columbia (Licensee) is the holder of NRC License No. 24&hyph;00513&hyph;32 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 35. The license authorizes the Licensee to conduct research and development, instrument calibration, student instruction and medical diagnosis and therapy. The license was issued on April 6, 1962, was most recently amended on May 11, 1994, and is due to expire on July 31, 1998. II From January 24 through January 28, 1994, the NRC conducted a safety inspection of licensed activities at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Numerous apparent violations were identified during the inspection. The findings of the inspection were documented in Inspection Report No. 030&hyph;02278/94001(DRSS) issued to the Licensee on February 23, 1994. The NRC is concerned that the circumstances surrounding the numerous violations reflect inadequate control over the safe use of licensed material. The Licensee met with the NRC staff during a management meeting on February 24, 1994, and during an open enforcement conference on February 28, 1994, at the NRC Region III office to review the circumstances that led to the violations. During the enforcement conference, the Licensee proposed various corrective actions that could be taken to prevent recurrence of the violations and to ensure compliance with NRC requirements. The Licensee agreed to submit these proposals to the NRC in writing for review and approval. In a letter dated March 9, 1994, the NRC concluded its assessment of the inspection findings and issued a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) in the amount of $5,000. The violations identified during the inspection are of significant regulatory concern because they indicated that: •The radiation safety staff and radioactive material users had insufficient knowledge of license conditions and NRC requirements and an inadequate sense of accountability regarding compliance with radiation safety requirements, and •Licensee management was ineffective in completing self-assessments that assured safe program implementation. The Notice required the Licensee to respond to the specific violations. In addition to that response, the NRC requested that the Licensee provide a Safety Performance Improvement Program (SPIP) which would result in: (1) A complete and thorough evaluation of the radiation safety practices and program by qualified persons to determine how the Licensee is currently complying with NRC regulations and the conditions of the license; (2) a compilation of radiation safety deficiencies from that effort; (3) a complete root cause analysis of those deficiencies; and (4) a description of corrective actions to accomplish the improvements necessary for lasting correction of the deficiencies. III On April 7, 1994, and May 25, 1994, the Licensee provided written responses to the Notice, including payment of the $5,000 proposed civil penalty and a description of the SPIP. After discussion of the SPIP with NRC staff on June 14 and June 17, 1994, the Licensee submitted a revised SPIP to the NRC on June 20, 1994. The Licensee's revised SPIP is divided into four phases. The Licensee has agreed to follow the specific actions and time milestones outlined in the SPIP. Phase One of the SPIP involves hiring and directing an independent health physics consulting firm to review the Licensee's authorized activities and report the findings to the Licensee's management by July 15, 1994.
