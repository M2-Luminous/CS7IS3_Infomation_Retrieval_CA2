These squads were set up during the tenure of Major General Nehemya Tamari in order to apprehend stone throwers, including opening fire when necessary. The squads operated for several months, until the military advocate-general sent a letter instructing clarification of the orders relating to their operation. The activity of the squads was resumed when Major General Dani Yatom was appointed temporary commander of the Central Command, and was occasionally halted on the basis of operational considerations. Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of the IDF forces in the West Bank, renewed the activity of the squads several months ago. Maj. Gen. Biran ordered to suspend their operation several days after he entered office. Central Command sources said Maj. Gen. Biran implemented this move in order to avoid unnecessary firing. They said Biran is checking all the standing orders relating to the Central Command, mainly open-fire orders, issued during the tenures of Yatom and Tamari. An army source said "Biran is examining every order given in the Central Command and canceling those he does not approve of." If necessary, Biran will issue out new instructions. The military sources add that Maj. Gen. Biran has held meetings with the Central Command's senior officers, including the division and brigade commanders, and visited the sensitive areas of the West Bank in order to get personally acquainted with the various spheres relating to his new post.
