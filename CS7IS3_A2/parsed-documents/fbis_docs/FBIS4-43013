Rather, the truth is that talks are still under way and are unlikely to reach a conclusion before the Corfu European summit in June. The Italian Government is determined to ensure that the agreement does not take only a few countries into account, but all of them. As a matter of fact, over the last few days we have been considering some very authoritative candidacies on our part, and we are in the process of establishing contacts with a number of European partners, which are not necessarily those mentioned by THE GUARDIAN (i.e., France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal -- CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note)." Forza Italia Senator Livio Caputo, who is the foreign under secretary in charge of European and security affairs, is currently in Cairo attending the conference of nonaligned countries. However, he has not lost sight of Brussels and the complex negotiations concerning the international organizations' key posts. [Orizio] Is it not true that the game is over? [Caputo] No, there is still plenty of time and room for Italy. We have been hampered by the fact that the long government crisis prevented us from concentrating on the negotiations right from their initial stages, but we are still in time to join. The prime minister's office is examining the candidacies that we intend to submit. [Orizio] What institutions is Italy aiming for? [Caputo] Three in particular: OECD, GATT, and NATO. [Caputo] Of these three objectives, how many will we actually achieve? [Orizio] It may prove difficult to achieve all three, but we will submit a sufficiently broad range of candidates not to be excluded from the final agreement. In the end, we will have the right man for the right job. [Orizio] Former Minister Renato Ruggiero is being mentioned as a possible candidate for one of the great European institutions. Is this correct? [Caputo] It is not appropriate to mention any names at this stage. [Orizio] As far as NATO is concerned, THE GUARDIAN is saying that an agreement has already been reached on the name of outgoing Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. [Caputo] NATO is not solely a European institution. Americans have traditionally exercised a strong influence on the choice of the secretary general, and I do not believe that they will cease doing so in the future. When it comes to choosing somebody, therefore, I would not be surprised if an outsider wins the race in the end. [Orizio] Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene is being mentioned as Delors' successor at the European Commission. Does Italy agree with this? [Caputo] It is no mystery that France and Germany are pressing for Dehaene's appointment. However, there are other candidates, too: for example, Irishman Peter Sutherland (former EC commissioner and outgoing GATT secretary general -- CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note). [Orizio] However, should the fact that THE GUARDIAN is predicting Italy's complete exclusion from this European distribution of posts not be regarded as a further indication of our country's international isolation? [Caputo] No. THE GUARDIAN is a newspaper which often runs ahead of events, and, in any case, it does not represent the views of the British Government, from which in fact it is rather far removed. Several European countries taking part in the negotiations have unambiguously expressed their friendship and appreciation for us, and our government's composition will not be an obstacle to the negotiations' success.
