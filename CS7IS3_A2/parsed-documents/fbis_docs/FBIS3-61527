A study involved 18-23 year old men who came in November-December from USSR's European part to work in Trans-Baykal; the sample consisted of 135 patients divided into three groups and a control group of 46 men. The functional activity of monocytes was examined in an integral test with tetrazole nitro blue. The experimental procedure is outlined. The functional activity of monocytes among newcomers suffering from acute respiratory organ diseases and the nonspecific antiviral cell resistance to acute respiratory organ diseases among the newcomers are summarized. The study demonstrated that adaptation to the conditions of Eastern Siberia is related to changes in the functional activity of monocytes and intracellular virusemia in monocytes and lymphocytes but revealed no significant changes in the metabolic and phagocytic activity of monocytes during acute pneumonia and bronchitis whereby the degree of viral damage to monocytes serves as the determining factor. The antiviral monocyte resistance indicators are the most significant adaptation criteria. Tables 2; references 10.
