Havel on the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans: "If V. Havel condemns the principle of collective guilt and the collective responsibility of nations, this does not mean that he is placing a historically equals sign between the ethnic cleansing in present-day Bosnia-Herzegovina and the post-war expulsion of the Sudeten Germans, with which the victorious powers expressed their agreement and which was in response to the horrors of World War II. It is astonishing that the Austrian foreign minister is again returning to issues that had been resolved in December 1974 in the Czechoslovak-Austrian treaty on settling financial and property-related legal issues. All the claims for compensation from Austrian physical and legal persons and also from the Austrian state for Czechoslovak indemnification and confiscation measures from World War II were settled by this treaty."
