Regarding this important and meaningful event in the Lao-Cambodia relations, the people of Vientiane and all the multiethnic Lao people throughout the country are very pleased and overwhelmingly joyous. They also feel highly honored to have an opportunity to welcome the high-level delegation of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia. This official friendship visit to the LPDR by Samdech Chea Sim and his delegation occurs after the high-level delegations of the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Government of the LPDR [words indistinct]. This shows that the relations and cooperation in various fields between the LPDR and the Kingdom of Cambodia in the new era are developing significantly, especially between the governments and the legislative institutions of the two countries. The party, state, and multiethnic people of Laos have always closely followed developments in the Kingdom of Cambodia, regarding it as our close neighbor. We all realize that Cambodia is a nation of energetic and courageous traditions. During the period of the Khmer Kingdom a world wonder was erected -- the internationally famous Angkor Wat. Despite hardships in the course of history, due to the determination of internal factions coupled with international support, the Cambodian people have now entered a period of national construction and national reconcililation. At present this process has reached another step. With the said responsible determination of various factions, the fraternal Cambodian people in the Kingdom of Cambodia under the leadership of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Voraman will convincingly succeed in making the Kingdom of Cambodia a kingdom of independence, peace, and neutrality. Together they will bring progress and prosperity to their country and develop friendly relations with other countries, beginning with their neighbors. The traditional relations of friendship, solidarity, and cooperation between Lao and Cambodian peoples, have existed for quite a long time since the ancient days. They have been passed along from generation to generation from our ancestors. The Lao people have always firmly nourished such relations and still have honest and unchangeable intentions to continuously improve the existing good relations and make them flourish steadily. Nowadays, Lao and Cambodian peoples are attentively implementing the principles of the joint communique issued in July 1993 and the joint statement signed by the two governments in November 1993 of an agreement on economic, scientific, technological, and cultural cooperation between the two countries. The main purpose is to serve the interests of the peoples of Laos and Cambodia who share many similarities, such as cultural, traditional, and religious aspects. Suffice it to say the two countries deservingly enjoy their brotherly and neighborly relations and solidarity. On this glorious occasion, all Lao people wish the people in Cambodia to attain a greater new victory and make a new life to further create national conciliation and build up the Kingdom of Cambodia under the monarchic leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk Voraman with everlasting progress and prosperity. We wish the visit to the LPDR by Samdech Chea Sim and his delegation glorious success. We are all confident that through the visit to the LPDR by the high-level delegation of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the relations between the legislative institutions of the LPDR and the Kingdom of Cambodia will develop into a new stage that corresponds with economic, social, and cultural development of each country.
