You just returned from Germany. I think that the treaty, the preparation of which has taken so much time, was also remembered there. [Gylys] I realized that the news about a breakthrough in our negotiations was received favorably. Germany's signing of the state agreement with Poland was more painful. By the way, they could speak about ethnic borders, as some people are fond of saying in our country, not only with Poland but also, let us say, with France. I think, however, that the future agreement is a proper move in removing historical misunderstandings. [Zukas] Let us try to assess this treaty from the geopolitical viewpoint then. Do you think that this is an overly high level? [Gylys] No, your question is timely. We often reason in categories of inner patriotism: How can I, as a Lithuanian, agree that there are also Lithuanians beyond Lithuania's borders, but not guarantee that they will be together with me. When defending state interests, one must see not only domestic events but one must also understand the surrounding world and even the danger of finding ourselves under siege. We must abandon the enemy image created by the opponents of the treaty. This might seem like patriotism and the protection of state interests, but it looks more like sabotage on second thought. If we do not introduce order in our relations, we will not be attractive to businessmen, and it will be difficult and unreal to think about the integration with Europe. Talks on the associate agreement with the European Union [EU] are beginning in the second half of this year -- we must put things in order by that time. The EU reprimands us for ethnic minorities [as published], and the foreign army is absent from our country -- these are the great advantages. The only problem that remains is the normalization of relations. [Zukas] Does the signing of this treaty mean that General L. Zeligowski's problem has already been solved, or that it will reemerge in diplomatic and ruling circles? [Gylys] We reached an agreement while negotiating that we would be able to discuss this issue in the future, because we are democratic states, or at least we are trying to become such. Discussions will certainly not subside. They might involve primarily historians. I suppose that we must resort to measures and principles typical of modern times. Europe of the 21th century will be different. Problems that are so important to us now will probably look quite different then. [Zukas] How then, could you explain the constant "friction" with the opposition over this treaty? [Gylys] I see two reasons -- the gnoseological and the psychological, that is, how people understand this issue. I think that most of these people really wish the state well. They want Lithuania to make moves which, in their opinion, are beneficial to it. No one can deprive these people of the right to have their own views. However, the responsibility for managing the state falls on the government. Each government has problems. We must resolve the following dilemma now: Either we have no treaty, or we have such an agreement that is possible at the moment. In my opinion, the first option is worse. [Zukas] Speaking about the gnoseological reason, that is, the one linked with the knowledge of specific details, however, you should agree that no one has really seen the treaty. Nor have those people, who are picketing at the ministry's entrance today and who have promised to rally at other government doors in the future, read it. [Gylys] I discern another -- political -- reason here. I understand that many ordinary people do not realize what issues are present or absent in the treaty. However, politicians know its contents quite well. Both sides have expressed the essential items. [Zukas] It would be important then to learn your opinion on Mr. Ozolas' [Seimas deputy, leader of the Center Union] statements concerning not only the treaty but also the Polish ambassador [allegations of Widacki's possible cooperation with former Polish secret services]. This seems to have caused particular tensions, even though Poland did not react to Mr. Ozolas' statements as seriously as it usually does. [Gylys] I think that this was a politically irresponsible move. I was simply shocked by Ozolas' article. He insulted not only Mr. Widacki, but also Germany and Russia. Everything is generalized -- the author speaks about nations. He berates the West and the EU "a priori" only because they might back this treaty. The author maintains that we have met most Polish claims to Lithuania's sovereignty in its southeastern and eastern regions. Why such a conclusion? R. Ozolas states openly that we must claim the territories of the neighboring states. The reason might be that some of our politicians have become accustomed to acting without feedback, they have criticized and struck since 1988. We know from cybernetics that a system without feedback loses the link with reality. [Zukas] I have a few specific questions. When will the treaty be initialed? This seems to be your duty. Is talk about President Walesa's visit to Lithuania to sign the ratified treaty grounded? [Gylys] The treaty will be initialed very soon, within some 10 days. During our visit to Warsaw, we expect to learn the date of President Walesa's visit to the capital of Lithuania. We are looking forward to his visit. I think that this will be a very important and symbolic visit of the Polish leader to Lithuania. [Zukas] Do you not think that L. Walesa will be welcomed with posters, pickets, and all other "symbols of the sacred religion?" [Gylys] We are a nation of peasants, and the majority of us realize how important it is to get along with neighbors. [Zukas] What should be the next move after the signing of the bilateral treaty? [Gylys] We discussed this with Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski. It would be very good to organize a "round table" with the participation of politicians, businessmen, and bankers. We would specify our relations and point out the "weak points." I think that we must accomplish much in regulating our border and customs services. The free trade agreement was drafted back last April. In my opinion, Polish politicians sincerely seek definite cooperation. While I was travelling to Budapest via Warsaw, Minister Olechowski himself came to the airport, although he had promised to send his deputy. The foreign minister offered definite assistance in preparing for negotiations with the EU on free trade: "We know the process of negotiations and all the difficulties, and we are ready to share our experience with you." I stress once again: A political treaty means a favorable political background for definite relations. Our current relations are definite but not perfect due to the unfavorable background. [Zukas] Thank you for the interview.
