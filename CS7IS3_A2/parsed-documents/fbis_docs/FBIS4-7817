Some legal experts see in that enactment, which no longer exists, a legal loophole that cannot be filled by any authentic legal interpretations, but the present article, which was supposed to resolve the perplexity, seems to have managed in a very subtle way to ignore the will of the voters when it comes to deputies listed on the government slates. Because rotation into various positions in the government is altogether normal among parliamentary deputies of the incumbent party, their alternates are coming to take their places in the parliament. While the law is altogether clear about deputies who come to the parliament elected as candidates in their own electoral units, because every candidate had as his alternate a specific individual, deputies elected on the government slates were deprived of that unambiguous provision in the law. The election law tried to solve the problem of the "alternates" of deputies elected on government slates "by personal replacement of deputies from the government slate." When Mladen Vedris gave up his deputy's seat, his place was taken by Simun Saulic, who ran as the 36th candidate on the government slate of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ]. When he gave up his seat to take a post which was incompatible with being a deputy, he was replaced by Borislav Beslic, the 37th deputy on the government list of the HDZ. Thus, for all practical purposes Beslic replaced two deputies, but only one deputy seat was made vacant when the duties of deputy ceased to be performed. In exactly the same way, Dr. Boris Segota, 40th candidate on the government list of the HDZ, is the alternate of Dr. Jurje Njavra, who in this legal arrangement should have been replaced by Vesna Girardi- Jurkic, M.A., who is now a minister and who because of her post in the government also had to take a leave of absence from her office of deputy. Boris Segota, whom we mentioned, just like Beslic, freed only one deputy's seat when he left the office of deputy, in spite of the fact that he was the replacement of two deputies. This example taken at random of deputies elected on the government slate best illustrates the shortcoming of the so-called pairing of deputies and their alternates, because it is quite certain that should the reasons disappear for the deputy's leave of absence, some of the persons mentioned above might simply be put in a position of not being able to call upon the law. The practice of "pairing" also ceases to have meaning in case of an election success, that is, as was the case of the incumbent party, whose government slate obtained 31 seats in the August election. Each government slate has 60 candidates for deputy, so that every candidate of the HDZ who was elected did not have his personal alternate, because the HDZ slate would have had to have 62 candidates for deputy so that each would have his alternate. Nevertheless, in the amendments and supplements we have mentioned to the Law on Election of Deputies to the Assembly, the Committee for Legislation, a well-known working body of the Assembly, instead of overcoming this legal loophole, has actually "taken a step backward." In the final version, the paragraph of Article 1 of the amendments and supplements to the Law on Election of Deputies to the Assembly reads: "A deputy elected on the state slate who accepts a post incompatible with the office of deputy shall be replaced by that unelected candidate on the government slate on which the deputy was elected, to be determined by the political party whose government slate is in question." This seemingly harmless legal wording, say some of the legal experts, essentially disavows in its last clause ("...to be determined by the political party whose government slate is in question") the election slate and instead of the "personal replacement" inaugurates a so-called intraparty consensus as to appointment of the replacement of deputies whose seats have been vacated. Thus, on the basis of this legal wording, which has been adopted, the possibility is opened de jure, for example, for the incumbent party, to which that amendment of the law pertains the most, to promote as replacement for a deputy who has taken a government post a candidate who on the government slate of the HDZ was, say, 58th, while at the same time a large number of candidates ahead of him on the state slate would simply be ignored. In the opinion of those who have a superb knowledge of election law, that amendment, obviously imposed on the Assembly, infringes the political will of the electorate. In voting for candidates on the government slates, the voters were guided by the order presented from one to 60, and in presenting the candidates, the party took care to put at the top those individuals it felt should be those who would carry the slate. Thus, the sacred will of the voters has in a sense been neglected. It is difficult to escape the impression that the most recent amendment to the law on election of deputies to the House of Representatives is actually being used to pay off old intraparty scores in the incumbent party, whereby a small group of people is legally keeping away from the benches of parliament "undesired" alternates, that is, candidates who ran on government slates. The very bitter debate that developed over adoption of this amendment to the law distinctly indicates how essential this relatively unassuming paragraph of the law is to its initiators and proponents, a paragraph which along with everything else opens up the possibility of manipulating some of the deputies and their alternates on the government slate. Leaving it to the party to decide who will be a member of parliament makes things cloudy in political life and, just like the institution of abeyance of the deputy seat, sets a certain precedent concerning the parliamentary benches in the House of Representatives.
