My impression is that the increase in accidents is part of a sequence caused by U.S. defense budget cuts. If so, I cannot help feeling great fear about the recurrence of such accidents. The U.S. Forces say their training must continue to fulfill their duties defined in the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. I am wondering if we cannot be free from the danger and problems until the security treaty is scrapped.
