In a exclusive interview with XINHUA and China Radio International before his third state visit to China scheduled for next Tuesday [3 May], President arap Moi said Kenya and China are cooperating very well with each other in domains such as politics, education, culture, economy and trade. He highly commended the Chinese personnel in various projects in Kenya for their hard but enthusiastic work. President arap Moi said that Kenya in Africa is far from China in Asia, but they are both developing countries, and are facing the common tasks that all developing countries are facing. He rapped the press in Western developed countries over ignoring to report various development in Third World countries. Instead, he said, they attack them on the so-called human-rights issue which was a gross distortion of facts. He warned the Western media not to create unrest in developing countries by using the stick of human-rights. Referring to the problems the developing countries are facing, President arap Moi said that the main issues in the present world are peace and development, adding that where there is no peace, there is no development. He said that the big threat to peace in Third World countries is poverty which is the main root to cause turmoil in those countries. He appeal to the developing countries, particularly African countries to intensify the South-South cooperation and exploit their own resources for development. Recalling the previous visits in 1980 and 1988, he said he was very much impressed by the Chinese economic development. He hoped that the coming visit would further promote friendly cooperation between Kenya and China in various domains.
