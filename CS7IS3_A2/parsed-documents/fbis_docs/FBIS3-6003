The prime minister instructed the banking and finance sectors to provide immediate credit to state-run companies so that they can purchase paddy from the peasants, primarily from their winter-spring crop. To help companies in rice-export localities and enterprises that are efficient but financially strapped, the government will use the Price Stabilization Fund to subsidize partially interest payments to banks. The prime minister has requested that sector and local leaders satisfactorily organize the procurement of surplus paddy at reasonable prices so that peasants can make a profit and private traders not take advantage of peasants. He has also directed the comrade minister of agriculture and food industry to form quickly a rice export corporation in the Mekong River Delta so that state-run companies can dominate rice procurement and export and to eliminate the number of intermediaries. At the same time, raw material-based investments for the state rice trading business in the Mekong River Delta must be increased so that the quality of rice exports will improve and state-run companies can better control the rice market. This will help peasants to implement the government's agriculture promotion policy. Now, the agriculture, finance, banking, and pricing sectors are actively implementing the prime minister's directive to organize the winter-spring rice crop procurement in the Mekong River Delta for the 1994 export target.
