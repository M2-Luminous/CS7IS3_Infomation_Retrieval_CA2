FR940328-1-00014 FR940328-1-00006 IV. Procedural Determinations I. Background on the Utah Program On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program. General background information on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, Federal Register (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16, and 944.30. II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated March 7, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;899). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative to ``streamline the Utah program and to simplify the process for revising permits.'' The provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposes to amend are: Utah Administrative Rules (Utah Admin. R.) 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.400, .500, and .600, regarding the requirements for significant permit revisions. Specifically, Utah proposes to delete Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.400, which requires that permit changes ordered by the Division in accordance with Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;212 and 213 (the provisions authorizing the Division to order permit changes) must always be processed as significant permit revisions. In addition, Utah proposes to recodify the existing provisions at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.500 and .600, regarding additional criterion for categorizing and processing proposed permit changes as significant permit revisions, as Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.400 and .500 respectively. III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program. 1. Written Comments Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under `` DATES '' or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the administrative record. 2. Public Hearing Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT by 4 p.m., m.s.t. on April 12, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held. Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate questions. The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish to testify have been heard.
