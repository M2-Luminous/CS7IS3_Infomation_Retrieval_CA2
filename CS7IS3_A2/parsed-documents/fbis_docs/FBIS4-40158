Previously, only Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had made such a gloomy forecast about the Yugoslav crisis. Kozyrev's sharp statement was prompted by the fact that only President Clinton's possible veto separates the United States from lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the Bosnian Muslims. The [U.S.] Congress and Senate have already voted to lift the embargo. If Minister Kozyrev obviously fears that the U.S. gesture may provoke a reciprocal decision from Russian legislators, his guest today -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic -- evidently expects just such a response from Russia. [Begin recording] [Karadzic] There is no embargo [for the Muslims], they receive weapons every day, very good new weapons, and sometimes I think it might be better for the Serbs if America lifted the embargo on weapons because other countries might lift the embargo against the Serbs. [Dorenko] Can you name specific channels? [Karadzic] They have been receiving them by parachute drops; they have been receiving them from Croatian territory, and some UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] elements are also working with the Muslims. I cannot say that there are high-level orders, but the field commands make unlawful deals with the Muslims and they get some very good weapons and if they did not have them, the war would be over in several months. [end recording] [Dorenko] I met with Radovan Karadzic in the Yugoslav ambassador's residence after he returned from a meeting with Kozyrev. Russia is insisting on a new meeting of the foreign ministers of countries interested in the Yugoslav events in order to advance a new plan for dividing up Bosnia. This plan is supported reluctantly today, even by the Bosnian Serbs, among others. [Begin Karadzic recording] We have 64 percent of our territory, we now control 73 percent, and it would be very painful for us to agree to 49 percent. [sentence as heard] But if we get good quality territory, perhaps, we could discuss this. We shall see how things go in Geneva. [end recording] [Dorenko] Karadzic is afraid that the least valuable territories will be palmed off on him. At tomorrow's meeting in London with his Western counterparts, Vitaliy Churkin, among others, will decide what lands should be given and to whom. Vitaliy Churkin is once again playing the role of diplomatic ambulance. He did not find time, however, to receive Radovan Karadzic after their latest quarrel, when Churkin accused the Bosnian Serb leaders of treachery. [Begin recording] [Dorenko] Are you still on bad terms with Churkin? [Karadzic] No, I do not think we are on bad terms. The thing is that when dealing with the Gorazde crisis we failed to agree on one point, but we achieved great successes since we managed to solve the crisis around Sarajevo. And for this we are grateful to Churkin, who brought a letter from President Yeltsin. This was a real solution to the crisis. I think we will work very successfully with Mr. Churkin in the future, too. We are not enemies. We are friends; we understand him. Working together, one can quarrel only with a friend, not with an enemy. [end recording] [Dorenko] Karadzic hoped to meet the president, but he is in Blagoveshchensk. He still counts on a meeting with [Prime Minister] Chernomyrdin, but it is uncertain if Chernomyrdin can deal with Serb affairs after his recent kidney stone operation, especially considering the fact that this time Karadzic came as a private individual at the invitation of Yuriy Bondarev [chairman of the Russian Writers' Union]. As always he speaks a lot about his affection for the Russian Government, but can be seen most often in the company of the Russian opposition. [Begin recording] [Dorenko] Are you not afraid that your contacts with the opposition here may compromise you in the eyes of the Kremlin? [Karadzic] Each Russian is very important to us. First of all, we are working with the government and we are very grateful to the government, but I believe that this is one and the same thing, it is Russia, Russian people. [end recording] [Dorenko] One of the reasons Karadzic came to Moscow was to receive a literary prize for his poetry from the Writers' Union, and not from the Writers' Union which is for democrats but from the one which is its opposite. In addition to Karadzic, prizes will be given to the chairman of the prize commission, his deputy, and a member of the board. Meanwhile, it is not only the future of Karadzic but, to even greater degree, of the Moscow authorities that is being decided in Washington today. If the U.S. Administration, despite the UN and Moscow, permits the airdrop of weapons to the Muslims, we shall be able to see how big an American pill Moscow can swallow without taking active anti-American actions. Only a little time ago it seemed that the most difficult thing in the Yugoslav question was pacifying Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs and now here is the outcome: They are pacified, and the main danger for Moscow's position comes from Washington. All the best to you.
