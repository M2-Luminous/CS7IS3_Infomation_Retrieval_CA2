FR940127-1-00018 FR940127-1-00008 II. This Action EPA is today proposing approval of the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control plan. The Columbia Falls SIP consists of two submittals. The first contains the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program and Air Pollution Plan regulations. Flathead County contains two PM 10 nonattainment areas for which SIPs were due in November 1991: Columbia Falls and Kalispell. The Flathead County regulations apply to both areas and were submitted with the attainment demonstration for Kalispell on November 25, 1991, after being approved by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on November 15, 1991. The Columbia Falls SIP and attainment demonstration were not submitted at that time since a permit necessary to the control strategy for the SIP was not finalized. The MBHES issued that permit and approved the SIP on January 24, 1992. This second submittal to EPA was made by the Governor on May 6, 1992. Final technical corrections to the SIP were received by EPA on June 15, 1993. In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the Flathead County rules (with the exception of rules 501 through 506 which are specific to the city of Kalispell_EPA will take separate action on the Kalispell PM 10 nonattainment area control plan) and the Columbia Falls PM 10 nonattainment area control plan. To address deficiencies identified by EPA, the State adopted commitments after public hearings on November 15, 1991 and January 24, 1992, and submitted the commitments to EPA with the Governor's May 6, 1992 letter, as additional tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the Columbia Falls and statewide SIP. The State has fulfilled commitments related to SIP requirements due November 15, 1991 for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area. Those items related to deficiencies in the statewide SIP will be addressed in a separate action. EPA has determined that the Columbia Falls SIP can be fully approved without the State fulfilling the remaining commitments. Therefore, EPA is tracking the State's efforts to meet these commitments, but approval of the SIP for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area is not contingent upon the State meeting them by the specified dates (a more detailed discussion of these commitments can be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for this proposed action). The State has made a separate commitment to testing and further dispersion modeling of emissions from the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC) facility. This facility is located outside the nonattainment area and emissions from CFAC were not identified on the Chemical Mass Balance analysis of filters collected from the monitor in the Columbia Falls nonattainment area. Emissions from CFAC are a potential concern, however, since this source accounts for 20 percent of the emission inventory (at permitted allowable emissions). EPA will continue to monitor the testing and assist the State with any action required by the results. Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). In today's action, EPA is proposing to grant approval of those elements of the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 plan that were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted by the State on November 25, 1991, and May 6, 1992 (excluding the Kalispell portion of the county regulations). EPA believes that the Columbia Falls plan meets those applicable requirements of the Act. Since the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP was not submitted by November 15, 1991, as required by section 189(a)(2)(A) of the Act, EPA made a finding that the State failed to submit the SIP, pursuant to section 179 of the Act, and notified the Governor in a letter dated December 16, 1991. See 57 FR 19906 (May 8, 1992). After the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP was submitted on May 6, 1992, EPA found the submittal complete pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act and notified the Governor accordingly in a letter dated August 7, 1992. This completeness determination corrected the State's deficiency and, therefore, terminated the sanctions clock under section 179 of the Act. A. Analysis of State Submission 1. Procedural Background The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 3 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. 3 Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of Section 110(a)(2). The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1992). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission.
