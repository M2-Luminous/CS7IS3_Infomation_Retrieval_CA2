ACTION: Public Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that it is no longer the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in South Africa. The Department of State will, on a case-by-case basis, consider all requests for licenses and other approvals to export or otherwise transfer defense articles or defense services to South Africa. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dean A. Rogers, Office of Export Control Policy, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (202&hyph;647&hyph;4231). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: It is the policy of the U.S. Government to review, on a case-by-case basis, all requests for licenses and approvals authorizing the export or other transfer to South Africa of items on the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121). This notice implements U.N. Security Council Resolution 919 which terminated the mandatory U.N. Security Council arms embargo on South Africa which was imposed by Resolution 418 of November 4, 1977. The Council's actions follow the first all-race multiparty election and the establishment of a democratic South African Government inaugurated on May 10, 1994. The licenses and approvals subject to this policy include manufacturing licenses, technical assistance agreements, technical data, and commercial military exports of any kind involving South Africa under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act. This action has been taken pursuant to Sections 2 and 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. §§2752 and 2778) in furtherance of the foreign policy of the United States. Dated: June 13, 1994.
