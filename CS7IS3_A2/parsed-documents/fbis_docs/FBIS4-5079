FBIS4-5079 "dreas067_c_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 North Korea Peace Committee Condemns U.S. `Maneuverings' Peace Committee Condemns U.S. `Maneuverings' SK0704054094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0439 GMT 7 Apr 94 SK0704054094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The Korean National Peace Committee published a statement Wednesday in connection with the fact that peace and security of the Korean peninsula face a grave challenge. The statement resolutely denounces the maneuverings of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean ruling quarters to deploy new-type missiles and provoke another war, branding them as an outrageous challenge to the sincere efforts of the DPRK and its people for peace and peaceful reunification of the country, as an unpardonable criminal act of driving the Korean peninsula into a whirlwind of confrontation and war. The military moves by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets remind us of the situation on the eve of the Korean war in the '50s, it notes. The shipment of Patriot missiles into South Korea by the U.S. imperialists and their stooges can be justified on no account, the statement says, and stresses: The entire fellow countrymen in the North and the South and overseas should turn out as one in an anti-U.S., anti-war, and anti-nuke struggle to smash by their united efforts the moves of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam group to introduce patriot and provoke another war, which will wreck peace of the Korean peninsula. If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets dare to provoke a war against the North, the Korean people will mete out a severe punishment to the enemy, demonstrating the dignity and stamina of chuche Korea to the world.
