The government, dismissed by decree of President Ruslan Aushev as of March 6, will remain in office until parliament takes a final decision. The Congress passed a resolution which says recent re-election of Aushev as president of Ingushetia showed that the people approved of his internal and foreign policy. Aushev himself, in a message to the congress, described the presidential and parliamentary elections and referendum on the republic's constitution, all held on February 27, as an historic step towards Ingushetia's revival as a state.
