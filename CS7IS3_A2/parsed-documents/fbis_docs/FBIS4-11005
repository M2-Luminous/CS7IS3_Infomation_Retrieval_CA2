It is barely discernible, but the internal confrontation within the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] is devastating. The changes following Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination have not been easy. Representatives of the political class, including the dinosaurs and the technocrats, have been conducting tough negotiations surrounding the presidential candidacy of Ernesto Zedillo to ensure the survival of the Colosio and the PRI political program. Just hours after the Lomas Taurinas crime, confusion was the recurring factor in the process to choose Zedillo. Low blows and unorganized promotion campaigns. Unintentionally, according to his helpers and political companions, Amador Rodriguez Lozano [head of the PRI Secretariat for Electoral Action] was brought face to face with President Salinas and Zedillo: the intention was none other than to make it appear as if Fernando Ortiz Arana was trying to slip everybody a fast one. But days before his death, Colosio had decided to make changes in the PRI leadership. During Holy Week, Cesar Augusto Santiago, a friend of Colosio and Ortiz Arana, was expected to replace Jose Luis Lamadrid Sauza as PRI secretary general. During those days Ortiz Arana had been the target of a campaign to remove him from the PRI national leadership; the campaign was ordered by the Xola government offices. This campaign announced the nomination of Emilio Gamboa Patron or Carlos Hank Gonzalez, or the natural transition to Francisco Ruiz Massieu. With Colosio's death, his followers became the weakest group within the PRI and the non-Colosio groups started to settle accounts, given their previous status as underdogs. The Groups The Zedillo team was quick to open its way among the Colosio followers. The stamp of the new team is Hankism [referring to Carlos Hank Gonzalez], the powerful group with roots in Atlacomulco. Former Governors Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza and Alfredo Baranda (who only had a brief dream of becoming Santiago Onate's successor; instead, Jose Angel Gurria won by a nose) in addition to former government secretary general Humberto Lira Mora, were to take up key positions to give the campaign a different style from that of Colosio. Jose Luis Lamadrid Sauza -- a member of the compact group created by Jose Cordoba Montoya -- to which Zedillo also belongs, was removed from the maelstrom and placed out of the reach of criticism: into the presidency of the Consultative Committee of the Change 21 Foundation, now called the Luis Donaldo Colosio Foundation, a job that was specially created for the Jalisco State senator. Amador Rodriguez Lozano, tasked with the PRI's electoral program -- created by Cesar Augusto Santiago five years ago -- was appointed Zedillo's adviser. In turn, Rodriguez was replaced by Humberto Lira Mora, from Mexico State. Liebano Saenz -- a native of Chihuahua State who wants to become a senator or governor -- was removed from Information and Propaganda and became Zedillo's private secretary, which will help him achieve his objectives. Santiago Onate Laborde, a well-known jurist who worked in the Secretariat for International Affairs, was neutralized by placing him in charge of the Office of the Presidency, a post that he took over without the power of Cordoba Montoya. Onate is a key member of the Colosio group. The Internal Crisis Information provided to EL FINANCIERO by several key actors allows one to ascertain that the recomposition of the Zedillo team has generated a severe internal crisis within the PRI. In the offices of the Secretariat for Electoral Action the afternoon of Thursday 24 March, Hector Landeros -- a mechanical engineer who admires Manuel Camacho, is loyal to Javier Garcia Paniagua, and is tasked with legitimizing the topics and coordinating the debates of the PRI electoral program -- issued an order to the personnel who were working at the time in the operations center of what is known nowadays as electoral engineering. The order was: Call everyone you know and tell them that we must support Ortiz Arana. Jesus Perez Pinon -- an electoral design specialist who friends say has good intentions -- eagerly began the task of promoting Ortiz Arana as the presidential candidate, even though this had not been ordered by Amador Rodriguez. Hipolito Garnica followed suit. Faxes and photocopies of a document were also issued by that office [Electoral Action Secretariat] giving six reasons why Ortiz Arana should be nominated presidential candidate. "Because he is our symbol "Because Ortiz Arana is and represents change "Because he, and only he, is our presidential candidate." The document was prepared on a computer. It carried the PRI logo crossed with the date 21 August [date of Mexican elections] and the words "Colosio yes" on the upper right side. It was sent via fax to some state leadership committees. One of [Amador] Rodriguez Lozano's aides, who refused to support the campaign "because there were no instructions from our boss, Amador," said that from the CEN presidency, Ortiz Arana stopped "the strange" campaign. Sources that were consulted assure us that Amador Rodriguez did not contrive this campaign; "it was handled clumsily," the informants say. First of all because the Colosist team knew the decision would fall on Ernesto Zedillo, who is from the same region as Rodriguez Lozano. The PRI electoral program had been drawn up throughout nearly five years, led by Colosio and designed by the team at that time of Cesar Augusto Santiago Ramirez, from Chiapas. Rodriguez Lozano was left heading the PRI electoral program, which had been tested in the 1991 federal elections and the elections in Mexico, Yucatan, and Morelos States. The Baja California deputy aspired to a Senate seat from his state. With Zedillo's appointment, Rodriguez Lozano would not only have implemented the designed and tested electoral program but his aspirations would have been fulfilled without difficulty. Nevertheless, the "inexplicable" promotion campaign not only brought Rodriguez Lozano face to face with Zedillo and President Salinas, but also exposed Ortiz Arana. The truth is that the appeals to the state leadership committees created a climate of confusion among the PRI members. Ortiz Arana, Securing Support Hours after Colosio's assassination, reporters spoke with Ortiz Arana. It was clear that the only possible formulas for the presidential candidacy were Zedillo and Ortiz Arana. In Dolores pantheon, Ortiz Arana commented: Believe me, boys, the only thing I aspire to in my political career is the Senate of the republic and to govern my state. I do not want to be a presidential candidate. As PRI president, I would not want to have an advantage over anyone. The country and their stability are above anything else. Ortiz ruled himself out on the morning of 29 March. Hours earlier he had secured the support of 69 members of the National Political Council to oppose a possible reform of constitutional Article 82, which paradoxically was ready in Los Pinos. A high-ranking PRI member said that if Article 82 had been reformed, the array of possible candidates to replace Colosio would have been so broad that the PRI would have crumpled until it fell apart. Other negotiations were held as events developed. Ortiz Arana owes his political career to his ability, but also to the loyalty and trust of the president of the republic. He was leader of the Assembly for Salinas, chief of the PRI legislative faction with the approval of the president, and PRI national leader also because of the president. The opinion of the governors was controlled by the president of the Republic. The consensus of the old political class still had to be secured. The governors helped secure an agreement suggested by Salinas to obtain public support for Zedillo's candidacy from former government secretaries, including Javier Garcia Paniagua, Francisco Merino Rabago, Antonio Ortiz Mena, and Carlos Tello Macias. It was up to Ortiz Arana to obtain public support from some 80 former governors, who had already committed themselves to publicly supporting Colosio. They now did so for Zedillo. The campaigns against Ortiz Arana continue, and now the rumors talk of Pichardo Pagaza's quick ascent to the PRI national presidency and Esteban Moctezuma's ascent to the secretary general's post. Such advances would show that the Colosists had been displaced.
