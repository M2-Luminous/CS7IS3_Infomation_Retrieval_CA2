Although some experts here do not absolve Yegor Gaydar from personal blame for the reformists' failure at the parliamentary elections, both Gaydar and Fedorov have become to a large extent symbolic figures for the West. Even their simple replacement by reformists of the same views but with different names would cause alarm to politicians and financiers. Until the national economy demonstrates to international financial organizations its capacity to get through inflation to stability and prosperity Western countries will continue to hold back from experiments in search of a "special route" in the economy and, most importantly, will continue to hold on to their money. The series of mutual recriminations which began immediately after the elections with the charge against Boris Yeltsin that he did not throw his authority behind the attacking ranks of Russia's Choice was continued by Jeffrey Sachs' attack on the World Bank and the IMF and a series of reports from Moscow talking about the indignation felt by Boris Fedorov and his colleagues at statements made by Strobe Talbott, the chief coordinator of the current administration's Russian policy. The nub of the charges leveled by Sachs, until recently an adviser to the Russian Government, is that the World Bank and the IMF approached the needs of the former USSR in a stereotyped way. The entire current leadership must be changed, Sachs states, but the main blame lies with Western politicians, who will shortly spend on defense far more than Russia has required to find its place in the world. Strobe Talbott's statement about "less shock, more therapy for Russians," which, as he has subsequently explained more than once, merely signified the need for greater attention to be paid to social problems but was in no way an appeal to slow down the pace of economic transformations in Russia, was described by Minister Fedorov as a "stab in the back." For the time being the administration prefers to say nothing. For the time being Clinton is in no hurry to draw conclusions. And not because it is dangerous to hurry in politics. Since his visit Russia has clearly clearly fallen from the top of the president's agenda. It is perfectly likely that deep down Clinton is pleased with the turn of events, the changes in Moscow having afforded him the possibility, as it were, not to take resolute actions. But one can definitely say that if some officials in the new Russian Government have tried to create an unfavorable impression of themselves in the American administration, they have entirely succeeded. A reporter who accompanied Treasury Secretary Bentsen on his trip to Moscow cites comments by Russian Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko indicating the latter's rejection of simple market truths. To the American president's satisfaction, the situation in Russia has little impact on the overall level of his popularity. Six months ago Bill Clinton set a record: His popularity during the first year since his election was the lowest for all American presidents since the country began conducting public opinion polls systematically in the thirties. Now, on the eve of his first State of the Union address to Congress, the White House incumbent can be completely satisfied: 54 percent of poll respondents approve of his administration. The president still has one problem actually, but this is not seen as too substantial by the electorate: This concerns the Whitewater Development Corporation, where the Clintons' role has not yet been completely clarified. However, when polled, Americans are in no hurry to form a negative image of the president on the basis of hints and vague exposes in the mass media. Six months ago Clinton sufferd setback after setback. After the failure of his job-creation proposals, two abortive attempts to appoint an attorney general, the military's opposition to the administration's intention to allow homosexuals to perform military service, and the sorry $200-haircut incident at Los Angeles aiport the president seemed flat on his back. But the end of the year brought a series of successful international events, particularly those connected with the creation of free trade zones. The rising American economy and the successful European tour have all brought a triumphant conclusion to the young president's first year.
