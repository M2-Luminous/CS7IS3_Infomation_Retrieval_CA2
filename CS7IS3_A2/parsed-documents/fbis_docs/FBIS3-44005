Strasser. Presenting the envoys to the head of state, the secretary of state, finance, Dr. John Karimu, recalled that the joint World Bank and IMF team arrived in the country two weeks ago to assess and review the country's economic performance. Responding, the IMF representative, Mr. Mike Novak, expressed satisfaction and informed the chairman that the economic performance and development targets of the country are right on track. He observed that within 18 months the NPRC government had reduced the inflation rate from 118 percent to less than 20 percent -- a performance that has not been achieved by any developed economy. While noting that there is now an abundant supply of essential commodities and an absence of black marketeering, the envoy said the release of political detainees and the transition to democratic governing were vivid manifestation of government's tough and courageous measure to make sure that the targets of the structural adjustment program were on track. Mr. Mike Novak expressed the hope that the rebel war would come to a steady conclusion so that military expenditure would be redirected to the purchase of civilian goods and other economic development programs. He assured Chairman Strasser that at the next conference of donors in Paris, France, Sierra Leone will be given positive consideration because of the country's present economic performance.
