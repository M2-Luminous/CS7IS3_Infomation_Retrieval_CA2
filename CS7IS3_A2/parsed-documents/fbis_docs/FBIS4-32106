The radio station in Velika Kladusa, the APZB centre, said Izetbegovic's forces had attempted to infiltrate a terrorist group and had opened artillery and small arms fire on APZB troops. Bihac radio, controlled by Izetbegovic's forces, said the forces of the Sarajevo Moslem government firmly controlled all their positions despite continuing attacks by the APZB army. APZB leader Fikret Abdic is opposed to Izetbegovic's policy of war and wants Moslems, Serbs and Croats to live peacefully side by side. Immediately after the proclamation of the APZB in autumn last year, Izetbegovic's troops attacked the forces and population of the new autonomy. The conflicts, which have so far claimed hundreds of lives, did not stop after the latest Bosnia ceasefire came into effect on June 10.
