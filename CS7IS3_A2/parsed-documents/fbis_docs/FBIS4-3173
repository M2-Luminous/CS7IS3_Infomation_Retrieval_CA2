During the two-day visit, Blix is expected to discuss cooperation between the IAEA and Iran's Atomic Energy Organization. While in Tehran, the IAEA head will hold talks with First Vice- President Hasan Habibi and other senior Iranian officials. According to earlier official reports, Iran has started the construction of the nuclear power plant in the southern province of Bushehr with the assistance of Russian experts. Iran also said that the construction of another nuclear power plant with the help of Chinese experts had also started in southwestern Iran. However, both China and Russia denied the reports. A Chinese official said that the contract has not yet come into effect because of Iran's economic problem. A Russian diplomat said that cooperation between Russia and Iran in building the nuclear power plant is still on the stage of negotiations. But, an Iranian source said that an agreement was reached with Russia months ago on the construction of the first phase of the nuclear power plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.
