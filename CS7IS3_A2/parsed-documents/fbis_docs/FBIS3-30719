Tudor's Slander"] [Text] Messrs. Presidents, I feel most uncomfortable that I have to draw your attention again to a fact that is absolutely unqualifiable, but, given its profound implications on the stability, functioning, and cohesion of the military institution of our country, I am compelled to choose this way of notifying you of it and finding a potential solution to this embarrassing conflict. As you know, for more than two months, I have become the target of malicious attacks, expressed in an uncivilized language. As you most probably have realized, I am talking about the press campaign launched by Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor [Greater Romania Party president], in two publications that he is sponsoring, the ROMANIA MARE [Greater Romania] and the POLITICA. The goal of these actions is obviously to distort the image made about my person and to destroy the public credibility of the minister of national defense. For this goal the entire arsenal of disinformation technology has been made use of, starting with lies and misinterpretations, and ending with hilarious denigratory associations of ideas. In fact, it is no secret that this was the major weapon that the sponsor of the two publications -- who nowadays is not embarrassed to sign his works with the title of SENATOR OF BUCHAREST [preceding three words in capitals] -- used relentlessly for his own political ascent. As far as I am concerned, as a constant supporter of the idea of the political equidistance of the army, I should be completely indifferent to the way in which he chooses to build his own career. However, I cannot remain indifferent when these perfidious attacks are directed against the person of the minister of national defense because the implications are much more serious. These types of actions are aimed at destroying the element of TRUST IN OUR LEADERS, which is vital for the military institution. Therefore, Messrs. Presidents, I feel compelled to ask you to agree and be kind enough to convene the meeting of the Commissions in charge of defense, public order, and national security of the two chambers of the parliament, because I wish to present these commissions with the necessary explanations for the insinuations and slander directed against me. I am requesting this because the core of the problem is the fact that, respecting the provisions of the country's laws and the military rules, I am "guilty" of not having satisfied an absolutely unjustified claim or pressure of the senator; however, such an act would have meant a serious violation of certain rules stipulated in the Statute of Military Cadres and the procedure of granting promotions to certain functions and ranks in the Army. With all the explanations I gave to Mr. Corneliu Vadim Tudor, in his capacity as senator -- although for two months I have kept confidential that personal request, in order to avoid a public scandal -- he continued the attack against my person, the goal of his actions being to discredit me and to destroy the image that our society, and not only that, has made about me ever since I became the head of the Ministry of National Defense. Taking into consideration that one of the first denigratory articles that was published after 1 January 1994, was signed as Senator of Bucharest, I addressed to the president of the Senate an open letter requesting that the Legal Commission in charge of appointments, discipline, immunity, and validations should be notified about the attitude of Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Given all the aforementioned considerations, including those regarding the importance of the position of the ministry whose head I am, I express my hope and my complete confidence that my request will be adequately dealt with. As far as my person is concerned, I am at the disposal of the commissions at any time their meeting is convened. I must also mention that I also informed the president of Romania, the Romanian Government, and the Supreme Military Council of the Army about Vadim Tudor's actions. Messrs. Presidents, please accept my profound respect for the constitutional institutions over which you preside and for you personally. Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, Minister of National Defense
