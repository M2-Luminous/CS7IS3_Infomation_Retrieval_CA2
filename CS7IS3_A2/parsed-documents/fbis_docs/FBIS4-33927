A special cabinet meeting to continue discussing the issue was held this afternoon. Planning Minister Delia Cardenas said she thought the situation was not so grim. [Begin Cardenas recording] It amounts to a $198-million budget cutback. This, however, is not a Greek tragedy. Do recall that I told you we had invested $409 million last year and the we still have $412 million. I hope the $412 million is invested as budgeted. [end recording] Delia Cardenas reported that every minister and his economic analysts have evaluated the priorities in their work programs and that the cutbacks would be made where they caused the least damage to national interests. The special cabinet meeting is basically studying the programs to be suspended and will approve or disapprove them. Cardenas added that the National Economic Council will meet with the National Assembly Budget Commission members next week to evaluate the situation. Education Minister Marco Alarcon commented on the situation and said that several education programs will be negatively affected by this action: [Begin Alarcon recording] The [Education Ministry] cutback will amount to approximately $7.5 million and will have a very negative impact on the entire education sector. We will be unable to meet the demands for new classrooms. The computer education program will have to be brought to an almost complete standstill and will not advance at the speed we wanted it to, and we will not -- this is very important -- be able to repair and maintain existing schools. Also, it will be very difficult for us to cover the school furniture deficit. [end recording] The budget cutbacks are the result of loan curtailments by the International Financial Institutions. Those organizations will implement this measure because Panama did not comply with several conditions for the loans, such as the approval of laws to deal with electricity pilfering at the IRHE [Institute of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification], the elimination of special retirements, the implementation of the privatization process, and the reduction of government payrolls, among others. As they arrived at the Palace of the Herons, all the ministers pointed out that, although the budget cutbacks will limit the government's projections, they will not be so decisive that they tarnish the work carried out by the Endara administration.
