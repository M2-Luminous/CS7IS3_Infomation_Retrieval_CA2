The transitional government, which is based some 40 km south of Kigali, was set up after President Habyarimana's death. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is refusing to talk to this government, claiming that it is a self-appointed clique of murderers. Jerome Bicamumpaka, who is currently visiting Paris, rejects responsibility for the death of the president, for the massacres, and for the war against the RPF. The army, he claims, is only defending itself against the aggressor and the government is attempting to calm people. Here is the Rwandan foreign minister, interviewed by Dominique de Courcelles. [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] Ever since the government launched a pacification action, ever since it called on the gendarmerie to deploy in order to halt massacres and looting, it has succeeded in reducing massacres throughout the national territory. So if this government had not acted as it did we believe that the destruction would have been far worse. [De Courcelles] Are you saying that massacres are now abating in Rwanda? [Bicamumpaka] They are, quite dramatically, but the problem is that in the part of the country controlled by the RPF in the north, the RPF carried out horrendous killings, near Moutarra for instance, where it is estimated that some 20,000 were killed by the RPF. All these actions by the RPF do not make our work any easier. [De Courcelles] Minister, you seem to be saying that all evil comes from the RPF, that the RPF killed, that it bombed the town, that it brought the war to Kigali. Is the RPF the only party responsible? Was it the RPF which started the killings following President Habyarimana's death? [Bicamumpaka] Yes. Why? Because just after President Habyarimana's death -- you know how the Rwandan president died -- the RPF went immediately on the offensive. The units in the [word indistinct] palace in Kigali went on the offensive; they also attacked on the northern front. Following this attack massacres spread throughout the country. [De Courcelles] You probably know what many are saying, that the army -- and the presidential guard within the army -- is mostly responsible for these massacres. [Bicamumpaka] In fact many of these allegations are erroneous. The Rwandan Government did not break the Arusha agreement or go on the offensive -- it was the RPF. The cause of this is the death of the president which we blame on the RPF and on the powers supporting it. In the military sphere we note that the RPF is supported by the Ugandan Army; we estimate the size of Ugandan units supporting the RPF at five battalions. There are also Ugandan army Soviet-made helicopters. So the fact that the president was killed and that an attack on the northern front and in Kigali followed shortly after prompts us to say the RPF is at the root of all the evil, of all the massacres currently taking place in the country. [De Courcelles] Therefore you consider that the gendarmerie, the army, and the presidential guard are beyond any reproach. [Bicamumpaka] There are certainly elements in the Rwandan Army which have committed crimes, in particular the assassination of some officials, but it cannot be said that they represent the whole of the army. It would have been impossible for the Rwandan Army to face the RPF attack and to massacre people at the same time.
