In the meeting Mr. Benavides, the EU representative, was also present. "We welcome you in Athens with a sincere friendship," Papoulias, the Greek foreign minister, said at the beginning of the meeting which lasted two hours. Mr. Papoulias briefly mentioned the main points of the EU Presidency for the first six months of the 1994, emphasizing the special attention paid to the eastern and central European countries which are now in the transition period. The EU intends to strengthen the political and economical relations with those countries, and also the EU especially regards as important the security in the region and promoting a political solution of the crises in former Yugoslavia. Taking the floor, Mr. Benevedis said the fact that 74 per cent of the total assistance for Albania comes from the EU and its member countries shows the level of our relations. "We will consider the Albania's request for improving the mechanisms and the ways of the implementing the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program, Mr. Benevedis said. Mr. Papoulias said the EU has seen the political developments in Albania. "We regard as very positive the fast achievements of the economic reform and the constitutional Law for Human Rights. I am informed that the law on education will pass very soon in parliament. We welcome this step. During my visit in Albania, you (addressing to Minister Serreqi) and the President Berisha assured me that the Greek minority in Albania will be treated according to the international norms. I want to add that any reference to the "minority zones" in the law will not be in conformity with the norms. Minister Serreqi said we regret that for the second time the Greek parliamentary members has disinformed the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. They have prejudiced a normal penal case giving to it a political aspect. In regard with the economic relations with the EU, Mr. Serreqi mentioned the main fields of cooperation. Our desire, Mr. Serreqi said, is that the EU extend the cooperation with the three seas, the Adriatic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Aegean Sea which are very important for all the countries. Speaking of the political reforms in Albania, Minister Serreqi said the democratic forces have made important steps toward the establishing and consolidating a pluralist democracy, a legal state and a full respect for the human rights. As important parts of the reforms in Albania Mr. Serreqi mentioned the new orientation of the Albanian foreign policy which broke the fatal isolation, the establishing and developing the market economy, the wide privatization process, the army restructuring and taking it under the civilian control and the deep reform in the state administration. Regarding the law on education, Mr. Serreqi said it will soon pass to the parliament and the Greek minority will be treated in conformity with the international norms. Concerning the Yugoslav crises, the both sides repeated their known approaches expressed recently in the Vienna consultations. The Greek side said that the NATO decision for air strikes will bring about nothing positive for stopping the war and even it will cause another conflict in Kosova or in another state. The Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi presented a wide expose of the Albanian approach toward the crises in region, stressing the special position of Albania not only for the fact that Albania is a bordering country with the country of the crises but also because the Albanians in Kosova, who make up the half of the Albanian nation, are cruelly being maltreated. Mr. Serreqi said Albania is in favour of the NATO ultimatum which not only would establish the authority of the international community but also because the Yugoslav crises has created a dangerous situation which should be avoided. "We are suffering because of the sanctions but we insist that the sanctions should continue until the situation in Kosova will be improved. Kosova should be under the international presence to make possible the starting of the dialogue whose basis must be the charter of the 1974 Constitution. The present tragic situation showed that the dividing of Bosnia was not a proper option to stopping the war. The option doesn't offer peace not for Bosnian nor for the countries in the region. The international community should find a proper and acceptable solution for all the sides. After the meeting, the Albanian and Greek foreign ministers held a press conference.
