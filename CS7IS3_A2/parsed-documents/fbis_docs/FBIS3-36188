Whereas the parliamentarians restricted themselves to verbal criticism of their president's conciliatory behavior and their dissatisfaction with the amount of compensation for nuclear disarmament, the generals immediately embarked on decisive action. At first the idea developed at the heart of the military department of retaining on a temporary basis at "S" facilities (special bases) the nuclear warheads which had been separated from their delivery vehicles. And then a week ago an unexpectedly but very insistent proposal was made at the ministry collegium that the command of missile troops stationed on Ukrainian territory should take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. On the subject of the political "overtones" of the moves by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, it is hard to see them as anything but a clear challenge to the line which Leonid Kravchuk is pursuing with regard to the state's nuclear disarmament. After all it is clearly written into the Moscow agreement that all nuclear warheads should be withdrawn from Ukrainian territory to Russia for the purpose of their subsequent dismantling in the shortest possible time. You might ask, why then compel the missile troops' officers to take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine, why form their own missile troops, and why create a command center for strategic nuclear forces? You can only come to one conclusion: The Kiev generals are, irrespective of the consequences, attempting to draw out the process of handing over the nuclear weapons to Russia. What is more, this is being done to the accompaniment of public assurances from the minister Vitaliy Radetskyy about the soundness of the three presidents' decision. I think that the key to this paradox is fairly simple. In order to command strategic forces you have at least to have some, otherwise the number of posts is cut, which means a loss of power, privileges, and everything else which guarantees the rank of general. Therefore, the Ukrainian military's reaction is completely understandable. It is more difficult to explain the parliamentarians' behavior. Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief specialist in nuclear missiles at the Russian Ministry of Defense, told me about his recent appearance before Kiev deputies. For about an hour he explained to them how dangerous it is not only for Ukraine but for the whole Europe to continue to store nuclear weapons without proper maintenance and replacement of their components, after which questions were put to him in rapid succession, including for example: But how much will Russia be able to afford for the Ukrainian warheads? An example of how politics and trade are interconnected.... Meanwhile, for some reason nobody is taking any interest in how much it will cost Russia to dismantle the "independent" [Ukrainian] munitions. Very likely much more than the $60 million the United States has appropriated for this purpose. (Incidentally, even this money is not "compensation" from kindly Uncle Sam for hazardous work undertaken, nor is it disinterested aid, but merely an advance made against the Russian share in the contract for highly enriched uranium.) At the same time Russia has also agreed to provide Ukraine with fuel assemblies for nuclear power stations containing 100 tonnes of low-enriched uranium as the a first installment of the settlement for 200 missile warheads which in the next 10 months should be transferred to our plants for dismantling. If the Kiev politicians and generals do nevertheless manage to draw out this process, we may all regret the consequences. The price of procrastination is too high -- radiation respects no borders. Three SS-24 missile warheads which were recently urgently transported to Russia in a dangerous [predavariynyy] condition proved this. Due to periodic technical maintenance not being carried out at the proper time, hydrogen and other constituents began to accumulate in them resulting in a buildup of explosive gas. Apart from this, as time goes by nuclear munitions are subject to corrosion, the products of which are toxic and radioactive. There are after all 46 SS-24 missile launchers, 130 SS-19 launchers, and about 40 TU-160 and TU-95 heavy bombers of the Navy, for which almost 670 long-range cruise missiles with nuclear warheads are in storage. Missile complexes began to be wound down in November and the Ukrainian storage facilities are at this moment already overflowing with nose sections and nuclear weapons taken off alert status, which has significantly increased the background radiation. This is no empty claim but a fact confirmed by the chief designers from Arzamas-16 who have visited Pervomaysk. It is at the very least shortsighted and foolhardy not to take what they say into consideration. There is one more side to the question. Next year the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons runs out. If Ukraine does not become a party to it as a nonnuclear power, a dangerous precedent will be set for the whole world. In such circumstances the notorious "domino" effect cannot be ruled out as there are more than enough people wishing to follow this bad example, including those along Russia's southern borders. We can only rely on the good sense of Kiev's politicians and the Ukrainian president's ability to carry out the adopted decisions and to keep to the obligations he signed with his own hand.
