Nazarov, M.P. Nevolko S.B. Pichugin (Moscow)] [Abstract] A specialized subscriber access algorithm and analytic relationships for calculating the capacity of a satellite communication system (SCS) is proposed. Two configurations of an SCS that implements the algorithm are examined. The first configuration assumes the simplest message stream generated by subscriber stations; the holding time is a random variable with an arbitrary distribution function. In the second configuration the message stream consists of simplest streams with different intensities and a certain holding time distribution. Both configurations are loss type queuing systems. Analytic relationships for calculating the capacity of this SCS are determined using the theory of queuing systems, particularly, the body of Markovian line processes. It is concluded that, all other things being equal, in order to determine an SCS capacity it is sufficient to know the average length of subscriber conflict notification and not to use the distribution law. An SCS capacity is higher when message switching is used. Figures 2, references 3.
