FR941004-2-00085 FR941004-2-00052 [FRL&hyph;5083&hyph;9] Science Advisory Board Notification of Public Advisory Committee Meeting(s) Open Meeting(s) Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92&hyph;463, notice is hereby given that several committees of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) will meet on the dates and times described below. All times noted are Eastern Time. Documents that are the subject of SAB reviews are normally available from the originating EPA office and are not available from the SAB Office. (1) Clean Air Act Compliance Analysis Council (CAACAC) Physical Effects Review Subcommittee (CAACACPERS) Teleconference_October 18, 1994: The Clean Air Act Compliance Analysis Council (CAACAC) Physical Effects Review Subcommittee (CAACACPERS) of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) will conduct a teleconference meeting on Tuesday, October 18, 1994 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. eastern time. In this teleconference meeting, the CAACACPERS intends to discuss six draft documents which have been prepared for review as required by Section 812 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to be briefed by Agency staff on the overall Physical Effects review process, and to plan for an efficient review scheduled for November 15 and 16, 1994 to be held in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (See below for details on the November 15 and 16, 1994 meeting). In the teleconference, the CAACACPERS will be discussing how the review will take place, provide initial observations regarding the first review drafts of the Physical Effects Documents pertaining Section 812 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), namely (1) Ozone, (2) Sulphur Oxides, (3) Particulate Matter, (4) Carbon Monoxide, (5) Nitrogen Oxides, and (6) Lead, and plan for an upcoming November two-day review meeting. The Agency is preparing a draft methodology document for review by the SAB's CAACACPERS, which outlines the overall strategy of this effort. This methodology document is still under preparation, and may be made available prior to the teleconference. Additional draft documents, such as the methodology used to aggregate the effect of hazardous air pollutants, up-to-date assessments of the significance of recent research, and possibly select methodology papers may be provided in the future for review as necessary and appropriate. The Agency has asked the SAB to answer the following questions in the proposed charge relating to this review: (1) Are each of the elements of the methodology developed by EPA sufficiently valid and reliable from a scientific standpoint for purposes of the CAA Section 812 assessments?, (2) The Congress and EPA intend that the CAA Section 812 retrospective analysis should provide the most comprehensive possible statement about potential benefits of historical reductions in air pollution. This includes reporting on the potential significance of effects for which there may be no scientific consensus regarding the magnitude or even the existence of a specific effect. Given this statutory and administrative goal, is the methodology developed by EPA sufficiently comprehensive in terms of plausible health, welfare, and ecological consequences of exposure to the relevant air pollutant?, (3) If the answer to question 2 is negative, what are the physical outcomes of pollutant exposure which the Agency has omitted?, (4) For physical outcomes already included in the methodology paper, as well as those which should be considered for inclusion pursuant to question 2, are there potentially relevant data pertaining to quantitative or qualitative estimation of the effect which should be considered for inclusion in the methodology? What specifically are the sources of these data and how might they be best utilized?, and (5) What is the strength of the scientific evidence underlying each of the physical effects functions or models already included in the methodology paper? What is the strength of each element of additional scientific evidence suggested for inclusion pursuant to question 3 and 4 above? For copies of the Agency's draft Section 812 draft documents, please contact Ms. Eileen Pritchard, Secretary, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Policy Planning and Evaluation (OPPE), Economic Analysis and Innovation Division (Mail Code 2127), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.
