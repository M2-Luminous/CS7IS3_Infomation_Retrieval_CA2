Correspondent Nikolaos Meletis reports: [Begin recording] [Meletis] Ambassador Andonios Exarkhos, Greece's permanent representative at the United Nations, yesterday handed Vance the Greek side's reply to the ideas that the international mediator on FYROM had presented in Geneva. Returning to Athens at noon today, the foreign minister was asked about the contents of the letter and about rumors that the two sides will meet Vance in New York within 10 days. [Papoulias] No, I did not meet Vance. What I know--and I believe you know it too--is that the reply was given to Vance. The letter mentions that Vance's ideas are positive in principle and may constitute a basis for further talks if [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's intransigence is softened. [Meletis] Yesterday, Papoulias briefed European Union [EU] Commissioner Hans van den Broek on the contents of the letter. He and van den Broek represented the EU at the signing of the Croat-Muslim agreement in Washington. Van den Broek conveyed his conclusions from his meeting with Gligorov. Referring to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papoulias stressed that in its first phase the U.S. effort has been somewhat successful, but noted the significant role that the EU is called upon to play. [Papoulias] At their meeting in Ioannina, the EU foreign ministers will make significant decisions on the role that the EU will play in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. factor and Russia are certainly welcome, but the EU action plan remains the basis for finding a viable and peaceful solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]
