This will be decided at the party's national convention, Peter Boross has said at an MDF press briefing. Levente Sukosd reports: [Sukosd] There will be no hidden or destroyed papers in the ministries and government offices. The registered [iktatott] files are stored and safeguarded and thus will be accessible to the next government, Prime Minister Peter Boross said. [passage omitted] One of the mistakes of the existing government, for example, was its excessively strict implementation of the bankruptcy law, the prime minister said, adding: One should not just charge headlong at the economy. [passage omitted] The expectations of the electorate are impossible to fulfill and this will become clear in the near future. All that has happened was inevitable -- people have been disappointed in their illusions and now they have new illusions, Prime Minister Peter Boross said. I am not interested in a position, he said, but he added that he is willing to continue work within the party.
