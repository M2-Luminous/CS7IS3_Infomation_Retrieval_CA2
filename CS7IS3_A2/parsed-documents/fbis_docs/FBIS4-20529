Envisaged among the joint developments will be the combining of PABX (private automatic branch exchange) wireless operations and Matra PABX systems in September, and adopting the QSIG (quality standard inspection g?) interoperability standard for PABX systems in early 1994. Differences in ATM strategies will stay unchanged: Matra is interested in private networks, Northern Telecom in public ATM networks. However, a common association will be created for exploiting WAN (wide area network) communications. For the "private" ATMs, Matra is relying on a U.S.-produced component, based on a switch that is still under development. This equipment should connect the Ethernet networks and the ATM-card-equipped PABX 6500s by way of a 34-MBPS ATM link.
