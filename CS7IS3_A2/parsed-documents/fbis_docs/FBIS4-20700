More than 30 years have passed since we started developing nuclear power, and software has supported the smooth progress that has been made in nuclear power development work. Advances made in computer technology in recent years have been accompanied by demands for more complex, higher-level nuclear power-related software, as well as higher quality information on a much more timely basis. This trend has been accompanied by remarkable advances in computer networking, which is creating an advanced information society, which in turn has further accelerated the growth of computer networks to the point where now all sorts of information can be obtained online. We here at the Nuclear Data Center have been working since our establishment to develop software and disseminate information related to nuclear power, and have contributed toward the development of the nuclear power industry here in Japan by collecting and disseminating nuclear codes in our role as the point of contact (POC) for Japan's Nuclear Code Center. And in keeping pace with the above-described advances, we have constructed a nuclear code information database, linked it up to the Fujitsu Enhanced Information and Communication Service (FENICS) network provided by Fujitsu Corporation and are providing Nuclear Code Information Services (NUCIS) online via personal computer-based telecommunications. This article is designed to introduce you to NUCIS, explain its special characteristics and tell you how to retrieve information from it. 1. Overview of NUCIS Database As stated above, NUCIS was constructed to provide online the latest nuclear code information to researchers and engineers involved in nuclear research and development. The special features of this system are: (1) NUCIS contains roughly 1,500 items of nuclear code information covering all nuclear power fields. These nuclear codes are classified into a total of 24 categories, including cross section information processing using nuclear code functions (A), and energy spectral calculations (B). A total of 1,500 nuclear code abstracts that belong to these various categories are registered in NUCIS. Table 1 gives the number of codes registered in NUCIS by category. (2) NUCIS acquires and registers nuclear code information developed and made public by countries the world over, and which is stored and managed by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/NEA). This information is periodically furnished to the Japan Nuclear Code Center, where it is used to update NUCIS data. (3) NUCIS online services are provided via the FENICS network, which has access points located in 110 cities nationwide. This makes access to the NUCIS database inexpensive since communication charges can be kept low. (4) NUCIS is equipped with detailed retrieval functions which enable retrieval by category, code and code ID. Specific examples of retrieval operations are provided in the following section. (5) The database stores 18 code items, to include descriptions of code functions, methods of solution, special features and material available. The 18 code items stored in NUCIS are listed in Table 2. By referring to these code items -- the types of computers and operating systems designed to run the code information, the functions possessed by the codes, the methods of solution, authors' names and special features of the codes -- users can determine whether the codes they retrieve will meet their requirements. (6) The system has also been equipped with an electronic mail function that links NUCIS users together with the Code Center, making it possible for the Center to field various requests from users. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Retrieval System The NUCIS retrieval system was designed with user requirements in mind, i.e. what form user requirements for nuclear code information would take. That is, it was felt that user requirements for nuclear code information would take one of the following three forms: (1) Users would already know the specific code or abstract number for that code, and would want to know the special features of that code, its methods of solution, programming language(s), author's name, etc. (2) The user would not know the code, and would want to find out if there is a code for the field he would like to do calculations in, for example, structural analysis, transportation calculations, combustion computations, etc. (3) The user would want to know which code is most applicable to the problem he is working on. Figure 1 expresses these various requirements in flowchart form. When a user tries to obtain information related to nuclear codes, he more than likely already has an objective in mind. For instance, he wants to carry out calculations regarding the transport of nuclear fuel, or he wants to do structural analysis work. Then, if he already knows the specific code that will enable him to achieve his objective, he can retrieve information from NUCIS by inputting that code directly. Figure 1. NUCIS Utilization Flowchart Figure 2 provides an example of a retrieval operation where the user input the code ``SAFE-3D'' to obtain structural analysis data. By inputting the input command (e) shown in Figure 2, the user specified FORMULA [Text]The numeral ``1'' following the code specifies the output level. Inputting ``1'' specifies the output of code items 1-4, ``2'' specifies the output of code items 1-4, 10 and 15-18, and ``3'' specifies the output of all code items. Figure 2. Example of Code Retrieval Operation [Text]If the user doesn't know the specific code he needs, he can specify the category that applies to the work he wants to do, for instance Category ``I'' for structural analysis. Specifying ``I'' will display a list of codes belonging to that category, together with a Kwick Index. Figure 3 (showing a brief explanation of code functions) is an example of a retrieval operation in which the user specified Category ``I'' (indicated in the figure by (e)). The terms ``I, NESC'' are shown in Figure 3. ``I'' is the code for Category I, and ``NESC'' stands for the codes made public by the National Energy Software Center (NESC) of America's Argonne (phonetic) National Laboratories (ANL). In this same manner, the user can specify a total of four centers that make nuclear code information available to the public. These are the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) affiliated with OECD headquartered in France, NESC, ORNL's Radiation Shielding Information Center (RSIC) in the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of Austria.

For example, to the right of code ``SAFE-3D'' you can read the explanation ``Stress analysis of 3-dimensional composite structure by finite element method.'' After reading these explanations, the user selects that code which best meets his requirements, then goes back to step (1) outlined above, inputs the code and retrieves more detailed information. If the user doesn't know the specific code or category, he can do a keyword search. To accomplish this, the user must characterize or specify the problem he wishes to solve using a number of keywords. With NUCIS, it is possible to string these keywords together with AND/OR operators to enable sum of sets and common class searches, and thus more detailed retrieval operations. Figure 4 provides an example of a keyword retrieval operation which produced the code for a ``three-dimensional structural analysis using a finite element method.'' Figure 4. Example of Keyword Retrieval Operation [Text] As shown in Figure 4, input command (e) specifies ``stress analysis'' (but ``stress <graphic> </graphic> [Text]'' signifies a forward agreement search--the same holds true for the other keywords). Next, input command (ro) specifies ``finite element method'' and (ha) specifies ``three dimensional,'' thereby completing a common class search. The results of this keyword search produce two data elements. (ni) is the command that outputs these data elements, with the output level being specified by the terms ``OUT1-OUT3.'' OUT1-OUT3 correspond to the output level numerals 1-3 described earlier. That is, OUT 1 is the lowest level output command, and outputs only stored code items 1-4 shown in Table 2. Figure 4 specifies that lowest level of output. As indicated in Figure 4, this keyword search retrieved the two codes SAFE-3D and NIKE-3D, plus the functions, solution methods and other information related to these codes. By reading this information, the user can learn what functions, solution methods, etc. each of these codes possesses. And to learn whether or not this code information is registered with the Code Center, the user must have the system output item 18, ``Status in Japan'' as well. As explained in the beginning of this article, the Nuclear Data Center is the POC for Japan's Nuclear Code Center, and as such, users wishing to obtain information and/or documents pertaining to the codes they retrieve must contact us here at NDC. Conclusions Four years have passed since NDC first started providing NUCIS services online. As of July 1993, these services were being provided to a total of 75 organizational users. In line with progress in nuclear power research and development, increasingly higher level demands are being placed on nuclear power-related software. The human and financial-resources required to develop that software are therefore growing larger with each passing year. For some time now, the development of nuclear-power-related software has been based on the premise of international cooperation. By each country sharing the software that it develops and uses with all other countries, the international community has endeavored to reduce the human and financial resources expended on the development of similar software programs. In order to do this, however, it is imperative that all nuclear power-capable countries provide and have access to information on nuclear power-related software developed by counterpart countries. The NUCIS database was constructed with this in mind, and we at NPDC will undertake to improve our management and updating of this database, the promotion of its utilization and the retrieval system used to access it to even better meet users' needs in future.
