FBIS4-48596 "drafr099_c_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Mandela, Land Minister Meet Mandela, Land Minister Meet MB2005150694 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1252 GMT 20 May 94 MB2005150694 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg May 20 SAPA -- Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom met President Nelson Mandela on Friday morning to discuss the KwaZulu land deal that handed all tribal land in KwaZulu to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini before the April elections. Mr Hanekom said Mr Mandela had undertaken to raise the matter with former President F W de Klerk on Monday. Mr Hanekom said: "I am not in a position to confirm or deny that we knew about this." The WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN reported on Friday that the Ingonyama [King's] Land Trust Act transferred KwaZulu tribal land to the king in return for the Inkatha Freedom Party's participation in the elections. Senior officials of the Department of Regional and Land Affairs told SAPA on Friday it was widely understood that the land deal involving three million hectares was linked to a constitutional settlement whose effect was to end the Inkatha Freedom Party's elections boycott. One official who did not want to be named said KwaZulu government officials made several approaches to the department's legal advisers for assistance in drawing up the legislation. They had been refused on the grounds that the self-governing territories drafted their own legislation for the final approval of the state president. However, their approaches eventually resulted in the department's legal advisers going to Ulundi on April 21 to draw up the law in conjunction with the KwaZulu government's legal advisers. The official said the impression he had gained was that the deal had been decided in talks between Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi several days earlier. The law was passed by the KwaZulu legislative assembly on April 22 and was approved by Mr de Klerk on April 25 when Parliament sat to pass constitutional amendments whose effect was to draw the IFP into the elections. The amendments conferred greater powers on provincial structures and secured the position of King Zwelithini in Natal/KwaZulu's executive structures. The effect of the land legislation was to exempt KwaZulu tribal land from the provision that all self-governing territories' land was to become the property of central government under the new constitution. The WEEKLY MAIL reported that the deal took ANC chief negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa and Mr Hanekom by surprise. The story claimed the deal left little land for redistribution under the new government's land redistribution policies. In a statement, Mr Hanekom said he became aware of the land deal only after enquiries by the media. It has been ascertained that senior leaders of both the IFP and the ANC in Natal had no knowledge of the passage of this act. "The Ministry of Land Affairs is deeply concerned about this issue and is at the moment investigating both the process that led to the passage of this act as well as its legal implications," he said. He said any further information would be released as soon as it became available.
