Nor is it a quarrel about whether the states in this region should be accepted as full members into the NATO club immediately. Much rather, it is a quarrel about whether or not some of these states should be given a clear prospect for this membership even now. At the beginning of next week the NATO heads of government will decide against clarity in Brussels and, instead, in favor of a deliberately vague, deliberately cloudy "Partnership for Peace" -- common consultations and common maneuvers, but little more. Theo Sommer thinks that this is good and sufficient. I, on the other hand, think that this tactic of delays is insufficient and even dangerous, because it contradicts the interests of Germany, the interests of NATO, and the interests of the states in Central and East Europe as well. Germany's interests: In NATO and in the European Union we are the country with the most neighbors in the uncertain East. For unrest and upheavals, civil war, and migrations of poverty there not to endanger stability here we must promote stability in the region as much as possible. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in his statement at the turn of the year: "It is in our urgent interest that NATO and the European Union, that prosperity and democracy do not end at Germany's eastern borders." NATO's interests: As a result of the end of the Cold War, the Western alliance has lost its actual task -- averting the Soviet urge for expansion, and not even Mr. Zhirinovskiy will give it back. The Western inability to respond cohesively and with determination to the challenges of the first European conflict of the new time, the Balkan war, gives little reason for the hope that the alliance will react to future massacres in East Europe with anything else than with agonizing abstinence. To be better equipped against future dangers from the disorderly east and southeast of the continent, NATO must expand its own zone of stability. "Those who are in it are safe," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner says, "those who are not in it are not safe." Finally, the interests of the East European reform states: Even though they have freed themselves from the forced Soviet pact of the past, they see themselves increasingly classified by Moscow as belonging to the new Russian zone of influence, the "near abroad." Some people in the West shrug off their worries as emotional exaggeration. However, how disquieted would the Germans or British be, if Moscow wanted to order them that they must not be members of the Western alliance and if, at the same time, it were to increase the size of its army, as announced? After the latest Russian elections Estonian President Meri called the "partnership program" of the NATO summit a "used-up bottle of perfume" -- "nice to look at, but empty." What should be done instead? The successful reform countries -- Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic at first, others perhaps later -- should receive the promise of the Western alliance even now that they will become full members of the alliance by the year 2000. The necessary adjustment should be carried out in clearly defined stages: renunciation of potential territorial claims on neighbors; protection of the minorities in the country; adjustment of the armed forces to NATO rules; primacy of politics over the armed forces; reliable democratic structures; and coordination of foreign and security policy with the other NATO partners. As long as these conditions have not been fulfilled, a formal security guarantee by the NATO states for these countries would have little credibility; however, as soon as they have been fulfilled, there is no longer any reason to refuse them assistance by the alliance. When the NATO chiefs still leave things at vague intentions of cooperation with everyone at their NATO summit, this is done primarily out of consideration for Boris Yeltsin's Russia. Even though last August the Russian president told his Polish counterpart Walesa that Russia understands Poland's intention to join NATO and that in the long run "such a decision by sovereign Poland, which is oriented toward all-European integration, does not contradict Russia's interests." However, shortly afterwards the Moscow diplomats went into reverse gear. In December Yeltsin grumbled that speedy acceptance of the East European states into NATO damages Russia's strategic interests. The head of Moscow's foreign espionage even said: The expansion of NATO "would bring the world's largest military power with its gigantic attack potential directly to Russia's borders." And today Foreign Minister Kozyrev warns that NATO's expansion to the east is grist to Zhirinovskiy's mill. No one can be surprised that Russia is reacting hypersensitively. However, P4P -- as "Partnership for Peace" is called in NATO jargon -- is no meaningful answer to this sensitivity. On the one hand, the refusal clearly to promise NATO membership to the East European states rather strengthens Russia's claim to its own, exclusive zone of influence in the area of the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact and does not tone it down. On the other hand, by delaying the membership of the East Europeans, the shaping of the future relationship between NATO and Russia is being delayed as well. After all, a date for accession by the reform countries would put pressure on NATO immediately to start and institutionalize the strategic dialogue with Russia. The expansion of a stability-oriented, no longer anti-Russian NATO would not be detrimental at all to the properly understood interests of a democratic Russia. On the contrary: According to Vaclav Havel, it would be the "approach of a sphere of democracy and stability." Moscow's suspicious military as well as the new nationalists and neoimperialists are certainly still miles and miles away from this insight. However, instead of showing them consideration with the help of P4P, NATO should make use of the time that it has to do the best possible work to convince them: In close cooperation with Moscow, promoting the insight that the stability of East and Central Europe is a common interest. Without the simultaneous strategic dialogue with Moscow, NATO's expansion toward the east could look like an isolation of Russia. However, without this expansion toward the east, this dialogue will hardly take place. Since NATO shies away from these decisions, it will miss the opportunity of making the uncertainties in East Europe more masterable by damming them up and making them more predictable for all of Europe. However, could instead, as some people hope, the European Union become the anchor of stability for East Europe? The idea is not so absurd: After all, the European Union already constitutes a security community; also without the NATO treaty would an attack on a country of the European Union be considered as an attack on all other partners and would be answered as such. In addition, the Western European Union [WEU], which is to develop into the security pillar of the European Union, according to the Maastricht treaty, commits the partners to providing "all military and other help and support that is in their power" in case of an attack on a member state; in this it goes even further than the North Atlantic alliance. Thus, should not NATO but the European Union be expanded? The best thing would be both, in clear steps. However, whoever thinks that the European Union track helps avoid the security policy dilemma of NATO expansion, is wrong. In particular because the European Union is a security community, the acceptance of new members has security policy consequences -- not only the desired ones for East Europe, but also undesired ones for the European-U.S. relationship. Three renowned experts of the U.S. RAND Corporation, the leading security policy think tank of the United States, warned in the fall edition of FOREIGN AFFAIRS: "A situation in which a country like Germany commits itself to assisting Poland within the framework of the WEU but not within the framework of NATO, could destroy the Atlantic alliance." The United States will not permit new security duties to be foisted on itself. Rather, it has to agree expressly to them. Therefore, the expansion of the European Union is no alternative to expanding the Atlantic alliance. A NATO that avoids its responsibility toward the East Europeans after the debacle in the Balkans is resigning politically. An alliance that closes itself to the acceptance of new members becomes sterile. Whoever hesitates now, when NATO would still be able to provide effective supports to security in East Europe, might discover in a few years that he has not only lost time but has also gambled away the future of the Western alliance.
