The court continued to look into the case of the defendants accused of belonging to al-Tahrir [Liberation] Party. The court summoned a new witness who testified before the court panel and the defense representatives. The defense representatives objected to the testimony of the witness, arguing that the case had already been referred to the panel for a final verdict. Besides, the defense representatives were not informed of the name of the witness in advance. Some of the defendants parents objected to the witness. This prompted the president of the court to order them to leave the courtroom. The session lasted five hours. The court is expected to issue a verdict next Sunday. It is worth mentioning that the decisions of the State Security Court are not final. The decisions, along with all the papers of the case, will be referred to the Court of Appeals. PETRA reported that the court heard testimony from the court witness, a bailiff who wrote down the minutes of the investigation. The bailiff asserted that the prosecutor of the State Security Court, after identifying himself to the defendants, read them the charges and their rights before they made any statements at the military judiciary building, and that no other parties were present. When the defense lawyers asked the bailiff about the way the defendants were brought to the military court, there was debate between the defense lawyer and the public prosecutor. Afterward, some 20 attendees left the courtroom after making threats and disrupting order. On their way out, these people attacked court guards, smashed windows, and banged wooden doors and walls. Immediately, the court president ordered that they be arrested for disrupting order and committing an act punishable by law. He ordered that those people be referred to competent agencies for interrogation.
