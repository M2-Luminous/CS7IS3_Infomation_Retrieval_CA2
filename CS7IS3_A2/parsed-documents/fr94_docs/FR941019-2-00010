Number of Respondents: 3,000. Responses Per Respondent: 2. Annual Responses: 6,000. Average Burden Per Response: 30 minutes. Annual Burden Hours: 3,000 Needs and Uses: Congress mandated (FY 1988 DoD Appropriations Act, Section 8071) that CHAMPUS continue the Home Health Care (HHC) Demonstration. The purpose of this demonstration is to provide beneficiaries with an alternative to hospitalization and to identify the most cost-effective means for health care coverage to be provided by the government. The collection instrument requests specific data on impatient costs versus home health care costs. This data is used by Home Health Care Managers in determining which is more cost-effective. The Act also authorized an expansion of the Home Health Care Demonstration that permits OCHAMPUS to broaden the criteria for accepting patients, and to include all CHAMPUS beneficiaries_military retirees and their family members, as well as active duty family members. The Home Health Care_Case Management Demonstration represents that expansion. Data collected under the demonstration will assist in developing a coordinated plan of care that meets patients' needs at less cost to the government.
