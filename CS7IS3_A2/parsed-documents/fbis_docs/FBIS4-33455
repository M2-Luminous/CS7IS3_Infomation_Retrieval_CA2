Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 31 May reports that two researchers at Comandante Ernesto Che Guevara nickel factory have developed a new method to reduce the filtering and drying procedure while increasing the quality of the nickel sulfur produced. Radio Reloj at 0204 GMT on 31 May reports that nearly 10,900 caballerias have been weeded in Las Tunas Province as part of the 1994 sugarcane harvest efforts. Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 1 June reports that 1,023 low-cost houses have been built in Granma Province in 1994. Radio Rebelde also reports that the (Chillinma) shipyard in Havana City has recently finished construction of three lobster boats to the Batabano Fishing Complex. Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 1 June reports that the (Input) factory, in Santa Clara City, has built its 100,000th bicycle. Radio Rebelde also reports that in Las Tunas, the cost per patient for the 22 residents in a Jobabo municipal home for the elderly is 2.53 pesos daily, covering food and care only. Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 2 June reports that in Cienfuegos Municipality the municipal committee of the Communist Party of Cuba has called for a day of sugarcane planting and weeding at the Pepito Tey Complex. Jesus Rodriguez Diaz, provincial PCC first secretary, reported that only 75 caballerias had been weeded during May. Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 2 June reports that approximately 2,000 caballerias of tobacco will be planted, tended, and harvested with the aid of foreign capital. Spanish, Dutch, and Swedish companies will invest over $25 million to finance the necessary resources for the tobacco crop. The largest number of the tobacco caballerias -- 1,600 -- are located in Pinar del Rio Province, 65 in Havana Province; 119 in Villa Clara; and 195 in Sancti Spiritus. Radio Rebelde also reports that the planting of "power forests" -- quick-growth trees to produce coal -- is not progressing well, or in those places where the planting goals are met, the forests are planted far from the sites where the energy is required. Rebelde adds that the entire planting program is going to undergo a thorough review. Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 2 June reports the Liberacion de Fomento Cane Cutters Brigade in Sancti Spiritus is the first brigade to reach the goal of 4 million arrobas in the current harvest; adding that the brigade used 161 days to complete the volume with a daily productivity of approximately 25,000 arrobas. The report also says the brigade completed its work at the Ramon Ponciano Mill and has been transferred to Yaguajay, where it will work at the Obdulio Morales Mill. Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 2 June reports the first oil pipeline built in Moa, located on Cuba's northern coast, began to operate today with the arrival of a Cypriot supertanker which brought 50,000 tons of crude oil. The report says the system is built with pipes which have a 24-inch diameter and it measures approximately 4 km -- 1 km of this is submerged. The information says the pipeline will replace the old system, which used smaller boats to transfer the oil given the area water's shallow depth. Local nickel plants need more than 500,000 tons of crude oil per year and the use of small boats renderd operations extremely expensive. The state spent approximately $4 million on the new pipeline, but this will be recovered in about two years given the lower transportation expenses. The old system cost the country $500,000 per month.
