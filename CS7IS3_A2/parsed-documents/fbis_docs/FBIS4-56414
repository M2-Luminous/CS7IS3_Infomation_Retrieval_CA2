"To witness a crime in silence is to commit a crime," Jose Peraza Chapeau, member of the National Executive Bureau of the UNJC, told PRENSA LATINA. Peraza Chapeau was speaking on behalf of lawyers, judges, district prosecutors, notary publics, legal counselors, and other UNJC members. We demand her (Madga Montiel's) protection and the punishment, according to the law, of those who are violating her rights, states the text of a statement made available by Peraza Chapeau. Montiel is being persecuted by groups of right-wing Cubans opposed to any normalization of relations with the island since she returned to Miami after attending "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference held last weekend at the initiative of the Cuban Foreign Ministry. The anger of those groups opposed to any understanding with the Cuban Government was unleashed after a video showing the lawyer speaking with President Fidel Castro was shown on a Miami television station. The Cuban leader hosted a reception last Sunday for approximately 200 Cubans living in some 30 countries who traveled to Havana. In statements to a Cuban radio station, Montiel said she felt like a prisoner, persecuted, and was forced to ask for police protection because of the endless number of anonymous threatening telephone calls and bomb threats at her office and her home. In the UNJC's opinion, "U.S. authorities are obligated not only to give Montiel protection but also to take strong actions against the criminals who are threatening her, her children, and other family members, because the crime of threatening someone's life is covered in all modern legislation." Likewise, the UNJC described as abnormal and highly unusual the fact that Cuban emigrant groups can attack and intimidate a U.S. citizen (although of Cuban origin) in her own country. "They are trampling on a U.S. citizen's rights in U.S. territory," Peraza Chapeau told PRENSA LATINA. "Once again the concept of liberty is waved before us and juxtaposed with the negation of the sacred right to have one's own criteria and to fight for understanding and brotherhood between persons of goodwill," the jurist concluded.
