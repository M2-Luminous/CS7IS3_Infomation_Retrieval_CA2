FBIS3-14246 "drnes057bb_94002" FBIS-NES-94-057 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 Inter-Arab Affairs Arab League Urges Protection of Palestinians NC2403133394 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1245 GMT 24 Mar 94 NC2403133394 Cairo MENA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League General Secretariat has urged the international community and the two sponsors of the peace process--Russia and the United States--to immediately and urgently adopt the necessary measures that would guarantee Israel's respect of international legitimacy's resolutions. The Arab League also called on the Security Council to provide as soon as possible the mechanism necessary to protect the Palestinian people against the atrocities carried out by the Israeli occupation forces. In a statement issued today, the Arab League General Secretariat says that in the past it had warned of acts of violence against the Palestinian citizens in the occupied lands. In its statement, the Arab League says: At a time when the world is waiting for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 904 concerning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the Israeli occupation authorities have carried out an 18-hour siege of a three-story building in Hebron. The Israeli forces opened artillery fire on Palestinian citizens, killing a number of them, including two women, one of them pregnant. The statement affirms that Israel has once again proved its disregard of international resolutions and the appeals of international society. The Arab League said that Israel is endeavoring to torpedo the peace process despite its claims on the issue of peace. This might undermine the Arab public's confidence in the on-going efforts, in view of the clear contradiction between the call for peace and the efforts to achieve it.
