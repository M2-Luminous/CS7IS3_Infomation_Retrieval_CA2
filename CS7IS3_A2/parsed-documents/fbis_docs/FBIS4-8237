"The act committed by the Greek commando has certain anti-Albanian aims. It intends to create tensions in the south, in the context the Greek-Serb Orthodox fundamentalism, as well as aims to stir up old and fresh appetites of the Greek chauvinists towards Northern Epirus," declared the Albanian minister of defence, Safet Zhulali, during the funeral. Giving the last farewell to this martyr also on behalf of the president of the republic, Sali Berisha, the minister of defence said that the Albanians intend to bother no one, but certain political circles, the Greek Government, the Greek church, hatch up deliberate criminal plots against free and friendly people, against a neighbouring country. This is a manifestation of a savage and absurd chauvinism intending to destroy friendship between the two peoples. At a time when the democratic governments of Europe are making efforts to establish peace, the Greek Government, with its constant support to Milosevic, does the contrary. We tell them: "Halt their criminal hand, no one can alienate the Albanian soil and the albanian nation," Mr. Zhulali said adding that there has been never and will never be Northern Epirus. Further on he said that the Albanian Government strongly and resolutely denounces this act, which is a very grave violation of the Albanian people's sovereignty, before the Greek Government and those of other countries and to the international organisations. We ask the governments of the democratic countries to put pressure on and halt the criminal hand of the Greek Government against Albania, we ask the Greek Government to make public the authors of the crime and their punishment. The Greek Government must put an end to the policy which intends destabilization in the Balkans and incitement to extend conflict to the south, Mr. Zhulali said underlining that the Greek Government bears full responsibility for these acts, which will face punishment if repeated in the future.
