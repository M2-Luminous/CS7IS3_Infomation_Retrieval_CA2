At the symposium, a lawyer, a resident, a scholar, and other participants reported on the damage caused by U.S. military bases from their respective positions, and nearly 50 participants discussed ways to handle the lawsuit against noise. The symposium unanimously adopted a "statement protesting against a series of aircraft crashes on U.S. military bases." Speaking at the symposium, Yasuhide Oshiri, secretary general of the committee, said: "The special forces of four U.S. services are stationed on Okinawa and the importance of these military bases in U.S. global strategy remains unchanged. The number of facilities used by NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) units has increased from 15 in 1988 to 27." He also stressed that peace will not return to Okinawa as long as the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is not repealed. Explaining the ruling on a lawsuit against noise caused by U.S. military planes on Kadena Air Base, attorney Noho Ikemiyagi said: "The ruling dashed all the hopes expressed by plaintiffs for calm sleep. Nonetheless, for the first time, we succeeded in having the court hand down a judgment that residents are in an illegal situation and the task before us is how to use the judgment in the future." Explaining the residents' position, Tsuguyasu Tokeshi from Chatan town said emphatically: "Crashes involving U.S. military aircraft have actually occurred. Residents have always been concerned about a recurrence of those crashes." He also stressed the only way of keeping U.S. military airplanes from causing noise is to remove U.S. military bases from Okinawa. Reporting on the health problems of residents at the symposium, Kazuhiko Taira, a professor at Ryukyu University, said: "The aircraft-caused noise has become a cause of stress. It has caused hearing problems and adversely affects hormone secretion and the nervous system. It has also caused major problems in the educational climate, making it difficult for children to concentrate." During a question-and-answer session, a participant said: "The judge who wrote the ruling in the lawsuit against noise--before quitting his office--stated: A group of lawyers from Osaka city was in charge of defending the case and they might have been unable to present solid evidence to back up their claims because they did not have a full understanding of circumstances surrounding the noise case. I had no choice but to write the ruling that way. I could not understand why all the lawyers came from Osaka city and why Okinawans from all walks of life were not rallied."
