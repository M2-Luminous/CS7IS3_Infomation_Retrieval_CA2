Infantry attacks are being supported by artillery fire from the very center of the town next to the facilities with Red Cross and UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] markings. Fighting is in progress along the entire frontline on the right bank of the Drina river. Chaos has descended on all bridges in the town. Strong Muslim forces are crossing to the right bank of the Drina, while the population is hurrying to cross to the other bank in fear of a general disarray within the Muslim troops and a counterattack by the Serb army as happened several days ago. Not even the strong police force that was deployed in Gorazde for this eventuality can secure order in the town. Shooting can be heard in Gorazde itself this morning. It is presumed that the Muslim police are shooting at deserters who did not heed the mobilization call ups. There are no details about possible casualties on either side in today's fighting. The command of the Herzegovina corps links such behavior by the Gorazde Muslims with the increase in the number of NATO flights over the Herzegovina corps positions. These two things have already become a rule on the Gorazde battlefront, Serb military sources say.
