The Pakistan Air Force presently has 37 F-16's and it is said that a similar number of additional F-16's will be supplied to Pakistan. Pakistan is demanding 71 such aircraft for which it has paid $660 million in advance; it is highly possible that the United States will fulfill this demand by first supplying 38 F-16's and then another batch of 31 at a later stage. This decision by the United States will provide a great setback to its nuclear nonproliferation targets. India could decide to massively deploy Prithvi and Agni missiles in response to the new consignment of F-16's to Pakistan. India only has started deploying Prithvi surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 250 km and out of respect for international concerns, no decision has been made about the deployment of Agni surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 2,500 km. The plan was to test three types of Agni missile and only a political decision regarding their deployment needs to be made after successful tests. Now that Pakistan is acquiring F-16's, which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, India will be forced to give up its hesitations regarding the deployment of long-range missiles. In response, Pakistan too will deploy M-11 missiles in much greater number with the help of China. A single step by the United States will start an unprecedented arms race in South Asia, which it will not be able to stop. In the end, this arms race could prove fatal for the United States' own interests. The statements issued recently by various level officials of the U.S. Administration's Departments of State and Defense make it clear that the United States is prepared to supply F-16's to Pakistan. Robin Raphel, U.S. assistant secretary of state for South Asia, during her current Indian visit is full of flattery while talking about relations with India, but she has not given any assurance on retracting the U.S. step of supplying F-16's to Pakistan which has adversely affected the Indian security environment. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's comments to the U.S. Senate on 24 March makes it clear that the United States wants to give F-16's to Pakistan. Talbott, when he visits India on 6 April, will add insult to injury by asking India to cap its nuclear program because he is seeking a similar assurance from Pakistan. The logic for giving F-16's to Pakistan at this time is that the United States will ask Pakistan to accept conditions in return for the F-16's. These conditions will lead to a freeze of its nuclear program at the present level, or in the American terminology, to cap its nuclear program. The capping of Pakistan's nuclear program will mean that it can maintain its current nuclear capability, but it cannot further enhance it. At the beginning of the last decade the United States gave F-16's to Pakistan on the pretext of saving it from Soviet attacks from Afghanistan. Following India's protests, the United States argued that Pakistan is being supplied such conventional arms to make it feel secure and it then refrains from making nuclear weapons. It is interesting that Pakistan then not only acquired F-16's but continued its nuclear program as well. What guarantee is there now that Pakistan will cap its nuclear program forever in accordance with the pledge that it will make to the United States?
