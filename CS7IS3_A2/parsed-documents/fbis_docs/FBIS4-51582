RMAF Chief Lt. Jen. [Lieutenant General] Datuk Abdul Ghani Aziz said today this was a problem because the Russians did not manufacture simulators to train pilots prior to their flight training. "To overcome this problem, we are looking for manufacturer a of simulators to come up with one for th MIG-29. "However, we need to deal with the problem of intellectual property rights as the Russian aircraft manufacturer has to allow data on the MiG-29 to be fed into the simulator manufacturer's computers before such a machine can be built." Abdul Ghani was asked what was holding up the contract, believed to be worth between RM [Malaysian ringgit] 1.2 billion and RM1.6 billion, for the jets despite the Russians being early on the scene compared with their United States' rival, McDonnell Douglas, in pitching for the supply of new aircraft. Unlike the Americans, the Russians had been pushing for the sale of their aircraft as early as 1992 and had even got the contract drafted out as late as last year. Abdul Ghani was speaking to reporters after a courtesy call from his Philippines counterpart Major General Nicasio Rodriguez at his office at Wisma Pertahanan here. Rodriguez had earlier called on Armed Forces chief Jen. Tan Sri Borhan Ahmad. Abdul Ghani said it was important that the RMAF obtained a simulator to train its new pilots, especially to deal with emergencies. "Some of the crashes involving new pilots are due to pilot error ... they are not able to handle situations such as simulated emergencies." he added.
