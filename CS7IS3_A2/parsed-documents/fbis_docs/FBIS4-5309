This was disclosed to an ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter by former North Korean Lieutenant Yim Yong-son who has taken refuge in the ROK. Reportedly, the DPRK chose the areas thinking that other countries would not dare to attack the sites for fear of bombing China by mistake. Former Lieutenant Yim worked at the military construction bureau in Pyongyang till he defected to the ROK last September. According to his fellow soldier who was engaged in the construction of missile bases, the launch sites are located mainly in the eastern coastal areas, including North Hamgyong and Kangwon Provinces and Wonsan City. Recently, however, the DPRK started to construct missile sites along the Chinese border. It is said that about 5,000 people are working at the sites at Chunggangjin in Changang Province and that the job will be completed next year. Former Lieutenant Yim said: "I heard that the DPRK selected the areas presuming that it would be difficult for the United States and the ROK to launch an attack in time of emergency for fear of hitting China by accident."
