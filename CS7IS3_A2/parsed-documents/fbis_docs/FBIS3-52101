"We are not involved in negotiations in which ultimatums can be issued," senior PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th told AFP. "No side can accept such blackmail." He said the "text presented by Israel as an accord is only a draft working paper drawn up by the Israeli delegation and on which the Palestinian delegation never gave its agreement." But the Palestine Liberation Organisation is "serious in its desire to reach a solution to the problems as quickly as possible, if the other party shows the same will," he said. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin warned earlier that his country would return to the autonomy talks only if the PLO accepted the document drafted by negotiators in Cairo. "We are not in a hurry, it's the Palestinians' turn to sweat it out," Israeli state radio quoted Rabin as telling ministers at the weekly cabinet meeting. The Palestinians have called for new negotiations in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Tabah on Monday following recriminations over whether any agreement was made during negotiations in Cairo last week. Israel announced Wednesday that the Palestinians had agreed to a draft document which would give joint control of border crossings and double the size of the autonomous area of Jericho to about 60 square kilometres (25 sq. miles). But the PLO denied any accord and the Israeli press has reported that chairman Yasir 'Arafat is insisting on no Israeli presence at points where Palestinians will cross into the autonomous enclaves from Jordan and Egypt. Israel alleged Palestinian negotiators had gone back on their word. Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, who helped draw up the Cairo document, said: "It is not definite if the talks are to resume. "If they are based on the understandings reached in Cairo, they can go on, but for the moment there is no basis to pursue them." But Sha'th insisted that "only the paragraph concerning the Jericho zone represents common ideas" and that the Israelis had failed to take the Palestinians' views into account in the rest of the document. The paper was intended to review both points of view but the Israelis left out "at least 60 percent" of what was verbally agreed by the two sides, said the Palestinian negotiator. Implementation of the September 13 PLO-Israeli autonomy accord has been delayed by failure to agree mainly on the withdrawal of the Israeli army, the size of Jericho and control of crossings.
