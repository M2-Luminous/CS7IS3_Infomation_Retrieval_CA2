[Ngonhamo] Well, there are various duties because, as in any country in the world, its infrastructures ought to be defended and independence ought to be upheld. Those are the duties of the FADM: to defend independence and Mozambique's sovereignty and territorial integrity. [Jossias] What sort of an army will we have in our country? Will it be an army for purely defensive operations or will it also be geared toward attacking -- an internationalist army? [Ngonhamo] Right now, your question has many answers. It is our desire to have a professional and nonpartisan army with defensive and offensive capabilities. If we create an army only with a defensive responsibility, our task would not be complete. Like I said earlier, we want to defend Mozambique's territorial integrity and that is accomplished in different ways. We can defend ourselves from any aggression by a neighboring country or any power. That could be a defensive action, but within this context we can have offensive actions. So, I can say that the army we are preparing right now ought to be practically and technically offensive and defensive. [Jossias] General, you once said any of Mozambique's neighbors posed a threat. Do you still believe that and if so why? [Ngonhamo] I see things from different angles. My reading is very simple. When I speak of a threat from neighboring countries, I speak as a Mozambican who is inside his country. I see Mozambique as an independent and sovereign country -- a country with economic potential -- and not as a country that is the property of a party, such as the one in power today. I have referred to threats -- and I will continue to reiterate that we ought to be ready -- because today's friend could be tomorrow's enemy. If today there are countries with ties of friendship to Mozambique, it is because they are friends with the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party, which is in power. Our country is under a democratic regime and tomorrow any other party could win the elections, but it may not have ties of friendship with those countries. That can create problems. Let us look at the situation in some countries right now. Today, the South African problem is a threat to Mozambique. One does not yet know what the situation will be there. Mandela, De Klerk, or any other party could win. One does not know what the future has in store for South Africa. Here in Maputo I am seeing the answer to my assertion that those countries pose a threat to Mozambique. South African refugees have begun to arrive in Mozambique, fearing the war there, and there are people already leaving South Africa for Portugal and other countries. That creates a very difficult situation for us. It is not only a military threat, but an economic one as well. If Mozambique is to have refugees again, and the same situation that we had with the ANC in the past, the same situation that we had with the Zimbabweans fighting against the colonial system in Rhodesia, it will be a threat to us and our stability. We, the FADM, will be ready to help, whatever the need. We could speak of a country as small as Swaziland, where the situation is also not very clear. Their lives evolve around a monarchy, but one day a madman may surface and wish to change the situation, as in Lesotho, and he could expel the king and establish a system that might not conform with ours and with our lives in Mozambique. We could even speak of Botswana, where the situation is very calm. But that should not please every Mozambican, because one day some sort of crisis might flare up. When one sets fire to cotton with a match, the fire and smoke will not be noticeable immediately. Cotton first burns from the inside, and the flames only begin afterward. There are many internal problems in Botswana about wish I cannot comment. There are refugees from different countries there. It is a threat that can surface at any moment. Zimbabwe is even a more serious and open threat. Zimbabwe's economic dependence on Mozambique might not please some Zimbabweans. It is not a good situation for us. If Mugabe today accepts that economic subordination and dependence, it is because he has access to the sea. One day, any other party might come to power in Zimbabwe and say that that dependence should stop, and that it should control the access to the sea by trying to integrate Mozambican territory into Zimbabwe. Zambia also has its problems. Today it is a democratic country. President Chiluba was democratically elected, but there are corruption problems there, and the government has been accused of not resolving the economic problems and of not creating stability. As Zambia's neighbors, we ought to be worried. As soldiers we are always on standby, and we ought to be ready to defend ourselves against any dangerous situation and instability. With Tanzania we have historic problems, we have blood ties. As you know, Mozambicans waged the independence war from Tanzania. There are Mozambicans in that country. There are people of mixed blood. Mozambicans have left children in Tanzania, and today some are here and others are there. There has always been a rapprochement. That is still the case today. For instance, there are many Mozambicans who are entering Nampula, Zambezia, and Niassa alleging that they are looking for their parents because they were born in Tanzania during the war. Because life is difficult, they need their parents. It is problems like these that affect Mozambique. To date politicians do not believe that the situation exists. These are the aspects upon which I based myself when I said that all of Mozambique's neighboring countries pose a threat to us. There are other issues which I cannot disclose because of their far- reaching and secret nature, and which we can only deal with within the general staff of the FADM. I have just referred to the tip of the iceberg. [Jossias] Turning to the formation of the FADM. In your opinion, who is responsible for the present delays? [Ngonhamo] Well, that is a delicate situation. I have been involved with the formation of the new army since the very beginning and I feel that in fact there are delays in a number of sectors. All sectors that affect the formation of the FADM are linked to logistics. There are financial problems. I do not know whether there is any authorized person in the Ministry of Finance or in the FADM logistics. It is in those sectors where we can find those responsible for the delays in the formation of the army. It is the Mozambican state that is responsible for the finances and logistics of the FADM. With the support of other countries, the responsibility of restoring training centers rests on the shoulders of the state and the government. The latest example about this slowness was the ship that was supposed to carry the uniforms. It was a joke that so far has not been explained. We expected the ship on 15 March, but it only arrived on 12 April. It sailed from Portugal to South Africa where containers were transferred to another ship. On its way to Maputo the ship was rerouted to Beira. These are very difficult and complicated situations that we cannot understand. We in the CCFADMM [Joint Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces] suggested that the government should use cargo aircraft to ferry at least part of the consignment for the first battalions still to be trained, while the remainder of the uniforms could be sent by ship to shorten the delay. In fact, those problems are the responsibility of the government and the government should shoulder them. [Jossias] We know that during the training at Nyanga the British instructors refused to let the national flag be raised. Now the same situation has arisen at training centers in Mozambique. What is the FADM Supreme Command's position about this matter? [Ngonhamo] Maybe people have not been properly informed. In fact I would like to clarify what has happened or is happening. We are the FADM and the Mozambican army. We recognize the flag of the Republic of Mozambique. What happens is that there are two flags in the country: the flag of the ruling Frelimo Party and the state flag. We recognize the state flag that will be raised at all barracks and at every FADM center, and even at our command post, the Garden, the flag of the Republic of Mozambique will be raised, except for the party flag because then it would be necessary to get hold of the flags of the country's parties and raise them at barracks and training centers. Actually, we have been issuing military cards carrying the Republic of Mozambique seal. [Jossias] But was there such a problem at Nyanga or not? [Ngonhamo] Well, that issue was not carefully studied and clarified. The British and the Zimbabweans did not refuse to have the flag. They were awaiting orders from Mozambique to know whether they could raise the flag. There was no time in view of the speed with which the program was implemented. The course ended before we could address the situation. If for instance a program involving the FADM is to be carried out in any neighboring country, the Republic of Mozambique flag will be raised without any problem. [Jossias] The FADM salary plan has just been approved. General, are you happy with the plan? [Ngonhamo] I am happy and agree with the salary scale. I took part in the discussions with the Frelimo government over that issue. Moreover, the finance minister informed the sides that 80 contos for a trooper was what the Mozambique Government can afford right now. The government's capacity can only go that far. I do not think there is any other alternative. I think that the matter might not be closed because the new government emerging from the elections will, at our request, analyze the situation to see whether the soldiers' salaries can be increased because their pay does not correspond to the current cost of living. The metical has been devaluing all the time. The FADM soldiers will accept those salaries, and we as commanders will explain to them the reasons for their pay, as well as the capacity of the Mozambique Government. [Jossias] We are now going to ask you a personal question. How do you differentiate Renamo's General Ngonhamo and FADM's General Ngonhamo? [Ngonhamo] Yes, there is indeed a difference. First, when I was a Renamo general, I had my instructions and my beliefs were different from those I now have as an FADM officer. Even the uniforms and stripes were different. My views are apolitical at this stage, and I am wearing an FADM uniform. The work I do is no longer for the benefit of the party but, rather, for the benefit of the people. I have nothing to do with any party. Let them have their political clashes, let them have their differences. My task at this juncture is to protect the country's borders and guarantee security. I am a different man. I have changed. [Jossias] You have often come out publicly making political statements that reflect Renamo's views. To what extent to do such statements help the cause of national reconciliation? [Ngonhamo] I can refute such allegations, which I regard as unfounded and arising from the poor understanding shown by some people, notably journalists with certain government newspapers. I could ask any journalist to point out which sentences in my statements he or she perceives to be of a political nature. What is at stake here is not the political statements but, rather, the underlying reasons for such statements. I am a military officer, not a politician. I do not like to shove problems under the carpet. I like to indicate clearly what the problems are. The problem is that those people who are affected by my statements then think they are political statements. Let me cast a look back at the speech I made at the close of the first training course. That speech caused controversy and even SAVANA came out saying that it had been a political statement. That is not true, though. I said that we had very difficult work on our hands and that we were facing financial problems which the government was very slow to address. I also noted that that problem could affect training, that our forces might not be operational prior to the holding of elections, and that the government appears to develop an allergy when money matters come up. This is something that I would like to reiterate even now, because it is the truth. I am very happy with the cooperation of Frelimo officers helping us train the army. They are good and they cooperate in everything as long as money is not involved. When money matters come up, something gives and they do not cooperate. They want to use the country's money as though it were a favor or a gift and that is no way to go about it. We have experienced that problem even within the supreme command. I have discussed this matter with Lieutenant General Lagos Lidimo and we are having problems. The statements made by the Joint Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, CCFADM, at our meetings do not correspond with the reality on the ground. Despite the fact that our office at the Garden has nothing inside, the government team to the CCFADM has already publicly stated that conditions are in place for people to work. That is a lie. That place has no conditions and people cannot work there. That is a money-related problem. We, for instance, are senior commanding officers but we have no houses. We have no cars, but they say that cars have already been ordered. I have already had talks with the government team and told them that there is no need to wait for vehicles to be ordered from France or wherever else. You can buy vehicles here in Maputo or in South Africa. So that our work can get off the ground, let us start working with these vehicles and then we can also use the other vehicles that are supposed to be coming from France. For example, I have said in this interview today that the government must carry the blame for delays in the training of the new army. Many people will see that statement as a political one. Yet, it is not. When I said that all the present government can pay soldiers is 80 contos per month and that we will take up this matter with the new government that emerges from elections, many people will have interpreted it as a political statement. Yet, I was saying the truth. That is the situation. This government says it cannot give more and we are going to work with the next government in a bid to secure better conditions for our soldiers. This is the reality, pure and simple. [Jossias] Will you remain head of the Renamo team to the CCFADM or is that position incompatible with your new duties? [Ngonhamo] For working reasons, that matter is being looked at within Renamo. Because there is a lot of work to be done, the joint commission needs to make many trips to various parts of the country. The new army led by us also has an office and a general staff. We are always having to respond to reports and messages about the deployment of troops. Now, we are going to have the first battalion of special forces and it winds up its training within the next two weeks. That involves a lot of work and it requires separation so that a new work routine can be created in this new area. It is an issue that is being analyzed. Furthermore, it does not look very good if the same person is a colored on one hand and a black on the other. [sentence as printed] A person should have one race only. [Jossias] You do agree, though, that this is one issue that must definitely be clarified? [Ngonhamo] Of course I agree, and it will be clarified as soon as possible. [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo: you are working with two generals who used to be your enemies. I would like to know how you relate to them and with whom you feel more at ease. [Ngonhamo] I feel at ease with both. I also feel at ease with all those generals who are not involved in these commissions or in carrying out these tasks. When I work with them, I am working with Mozambicans. Obviously, some present wrong ideas, but that is not a serious problem because I have managed to analyze things calmly. One can communicate with me, and there is really no problem. What is more, there is no reason for separation from the Frelimo generals because, to my mind, we were separated during the war and now we are together. If we are on an equal footing with them today, it is because work has been done to achieve it. [Jossias] In an interview he granted this newspaper recently, General Mabote said that the war waged by Renamo was not a guerrilla war but, rather, pure terrorism. Given that you were one of Renamo's principal strategists, how do view the war waged by your movement? [Ngonhamo] I did read the interview granted by Gen. Sebastiao Mabote. First, Mr. Mabote said that in this country there had been only one guerrilla war for independence and that what had followed had been terrorism. He thereby clearly suggested that Renamo had been responsible for the terrorism. Second, he implied that there is no general more intelligent than he within Frelimo, his party. I do not believe that he was too aware of what he was saying, or perhaps he said it for some particular reason. What he said was not true because ours was not a terrorist war. Had it been so, it would not have received so much support from the people. A terrorist cannot administer a territory. A terrorist cannot change the situation within a country, or the traditional symbols of government. I do confirm that vehicles were burned and that people were killed during the war. Responsibility for those deaths must not be laid at Renamo's door. Obviously, we have to admit that Renamo bullets did claim innocent lives during the war. Gen. Mabote said that Renamo killed civilians. He also said he had been trained in Soviet academies and suggested he was very intelligent. I can only regret that the Soviets should have trained him poorly. First, one thing I know as a soldier is that barbed wire should be used to fence in any military barracks. Those were not the instructions given by Gen. Mabote concerning Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique, FPLM, barracks. There, he used people as human shields around the barracks and those people were caught in the fire and killed when there were attacks. It was not Renamo that put people around its barracks. Those were orders issued by Frelimo and by Gen. Mabote, who was the FPLM's chief of the General Staff. As for Mr. Mabote's comments about burned vehicles, I would like the Mozambican people to answer that charge. Frelimo forcibly took vehicles from their owners to put them in convoys to carry Frelimo war materiel and soldiers so they could launch military offensives against Renamo. Obviously, vehicles that were part of convoys were ambushed and burned. There are Mozambicans who are still claiming compensation for those losses. It was not Renamo that commandeered those vehicles for its military convoys. Third, Frelimo soldiers forced civilians to join their military convoys. They used to say that it was for security purposes, so they could travel between Beira and Machipanda, from Maputo to Beira, or from Maputo to Namaacha, Ressano Garcia, and Ponta do Ouro. Those vehicles were ambushed and after a few shots the soldiers would flee and the civilians were left to die. It was not Renamo that did that. Civilians who misbehaved and went about on their own were punished and detained. Those actions were the fruit of Gen. Mabote's intelligence, who was the FPLM's chief of the General Staff. I do think that he had some special motive for saying those things. [Jossias] As commander of the new army, do you think that Gen. Mabote would be fit to serve in the new army now being formed? [Ngonhamo] All people are welcome and can serve in the FADM forces. Whether or not they have experience or ability, we are going to train them. There will be no problem about that. [Jossias] He also said that the young generals should refrain from making political statements. Do you agree with him? [Ngonhamo] I agree with him, but unfortunately he contradicts himself in that interview. First, when he compares guerrilla warfare and terrorism, his idea promptly loses validity. He has gone so far as to say that generals who make political statements are illiterate. In saying so, he is making a political, rather than a military, statement. If, however, he was serious when he said that, then we are in agreement, because our view is that soldiers should not make political statements because they are not politicians. Obviously, there are statements which, by virtue of our work, end up as political statements, even though that is not our intention. We must defend our work, our interests with the politicians. We are handicapped and we need the collaboration of politicians to be able to walk. We must report the problems and difficulties we come up against when we deal with politicians, but when we do so they think we are fighting them. We can suppose that the Frelimo government will lose the upcoming elections and a new government will be elected. I can guarantee you that the new government will come in for the same treatment from us. That is how it has to be. We are going to apply pressure on the government to always seek to improve the conditions of the military. This is why I have said we will be touching again on this matter of salaries with the new government. If Frelimo wins, then we will have new meetings to try to negotiate the salaries of military personnel. That is not a matter of making politics but, rather, of working with politicians. [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo: do you think it will be possible to create a regional army in which the FADM forces will take part? [Ngonhamo] The situation in southern Africa does not suggest that any conditions are in place for the existence of a force of that kind. My belief is that such a force will be possible at a later stage, when there is greater stability and a more thoughtful approach to things. I cannot limit the development of such things. At this juncture, such a proposition is difficult because the situation in our region is not particularly good and all countries are full of problems. What is more, those are political problems that affect even the soldiers. However, such a plan will be possible if democracies are allowed to grow more solid and if there is lasting peace. At this point, there is mistrust even among countries, which makes the implementation of such a plan very difficult. [Jossias] Kindly tell us whether work is under way to reintegrate Renamo's generals into the new army. [Ngonhamo] Yes, that work is under way. There are positions in the new army, and we are going to share those positions. There are areas where half of the men will be former government army officers and the other half will be made up of former Renamo officers. They come together and that is what is called a unified army. The fact that positions are being divided must not be viewed as divisions along party lines. That was the way we found to integrate soldiers in the new army. From the infantry up to the special forces, half of the men will come from the government and the other half from Renamo. [Jossias] Very little is known about you. Who is, in fact, Gen. Ngonhamo? [Ngonhamo] My name is Mateus Ngonhamo. I was born on 15 August 1963, and I shall be turning 31 this year. I am still unmarried, but I dating someone and I hope to marry. I come from a family of traditional rulers, and my father is a bishop with the Zionist Church. I was born in the area of Dombe, in Manica Province's Sussundenga District. My first schooling was at the Catholic mission in Dombe. That was where I completed my primary schooling, with the help of the nuns. Then I moved to Chimoio, where I did the first two years of secondary school, after which I joined the Agrarian Institute, where I did the second year of the agriculture course. In 1978, I left school and joined Renamo. [Jossias] Why did you leave school? [Ngonhamo] I made that decision because of a problem connected with my studies. My name came up on a list saying that I should conclude my course in Cuba, in the company of other colleagues, my cousins included. We accepted that because we knew this was a matter of responding to the country's needs. However, I could not help asking myself one question: Those names came up on one day, I was supposed to have my medical check-up the next day, and the following day we would all be leaving for Cuba. I wanted to say goodbye to my parents, who lived some 300 or 400 km from Chimoio. I could not leave without telling my parents where I was going. It was not possible. There were others who felt like me, who could not go without saying farewell to their relatives. It would not be a good thing to leave without saying anything to the family. There were eight of us who felt that way, and we did not go to Cuba on the date that had been set. We stayed and the situation became very difficult. There were witch hunts, various problems, and there was the risk that we might be expelled from the institute. We were reactionaries and we lacked discipline. I told my father that I did not want to study any more. I wanted to leave my studies and get back home to make a decision. I went to my village and explained everything to my father. I told him that I was leaving and that I might come around some day. I had already been in contact with Renamo men, even at that stage. I asked them to come to my house so my father could see and believe that I would be joining them. They arrived there in the morning and I introduced them to my father. We prepared breakfast for them and then we left for the jungle. When I went there, I trained as a soldier, like the others did. After undergoing training, I received a weapon and I started working as a Renamo private. I did a course as section chief, after which I did another to become platoon commander. That was the organization we had in our guerrilla army. On 15 September 1981, Renamo made me a one-star general and I started working in various provinces. I worked in Inhambane, Manica, Sofala, Tete, Zambezia, and Nampula. After completing another course in 1986, I was promoted to two-star general. I worked on various fronts. I went to Niassa and Nampula, and I became a lieutenant general in 1990. Then I came to the Southern Front and worked here as Southern Front commander and coordinator. I was commander for Maputo, Inhambane, and Gaza Provinces. When the General Peace Accord was about to be signed, I returned to Maringue and stayed there until I was appointed head of the Renamo team to the CCFADM. [Jossias] What is your area of expertise, after failing in your agricultural studies? [Ngonhamo] I have specialized in infantry, light and heavy artillery, and military intelligence. [Jossias] Is military intelligence counterintelligence? [Ngonhamo] No. Military intelligence is not counterintelligence. I have also specialized as a military cadres instructor. Those were various duties I had to fulfill during the war. [Jossias] Did you go about on foot in the provinces you have mentioned? [Ngonhamo] That is right. We did not have vehicles. I remember quite well that in 1982 I went on foot from Mabote (in Inhambane Province) to Gorongosa. It was a long march that took us 94 days. I have also traveled on foot both ways bet?een Gorongosa and Zambezia, and Nampula and Niassa. When I left Gorongosa now, I went to Chibuto on foot. It was always like that. We had no transportation. [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo, did you never undergo military training outside the country? [Ngonhamo] Well, I have been abroad on several occasions to do some courses, but most of my training was done inside the country. I have been to South Africa. In 1984, I was with the Renamo team that tried to negotiate an accord with Frelimo. [Jossias] Why did that accord fail? [Ngonhamo] It failed because Frelimo's knowledge about Renamo was very scant. Samora Machel did not know Renamo well and was always given wrong information. That is yet another thing I would like to say about Gen. Mabote. He misled President Samora Machel a great deal. He always gave him the wrong information, even about the military situation, and he knew little about Renamo. Samora always believed that Renamo would end with the signing of the Nkomati Accord. He thought that Renamo survived thanks to South African support. That was far from correct: Renamo did not die out with the Nkomati Accord. In fact, it increased its operations. Samora was also misled when he was told that it was no solution to negotiate with Renamo because Renamo lacked intelligence and that it had neither politicians nor military figures. That was what prompted Samora to outline the program of the talks to get Renamo to integrate into Frelimo, to offer an amnesty to Renamo. That was no good. Jacinto Veloso headed the Frelimo team to the talks. That team included [Member of Parliament] Sergio Vieira; [Labor Minister] Hunguana; [former adviser to Samora Machel] Fernando Honwana; Hama Thai, who is now the Mozambique Armed Forces chief of General Staff, but who was in the Air Force at the time; and others. Their only message was amnesty. They had no alternative in their baggage. So we told them: "We are the ones who should be granting you amnesty, not the other way around." So, the talks flopped and we continued with the war. When we went to Rome, Frelimo already an idea about what the talks should focus on. There was negotiation in Rome. There were ploys, but they no longer viewed the matter as they had done in 1984. [Jossias] One could say that you became a general when you were still very young. [Ngonhamo] Yes, but I think that was due to my military skills. Perhaps I was a good soldier.
