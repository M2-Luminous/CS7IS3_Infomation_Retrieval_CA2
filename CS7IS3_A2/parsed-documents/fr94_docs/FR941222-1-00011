FR941222-1-00011 FR941222-1-00006 40 CFR Part 745 [OPPTS&hyph;62134D; FRL&hyph;4927&hyph;2] RIN 2070&hyph;AC21 Lead Fishing Sinkers; Response to Citizens' Request; Reopening of Public Hearing Reply Comment Period AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Reopening of public hearing reply comment period. SUMMARY: EPA is reopening the public hearing reply comment period for a proposed rule to prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers which was published in the Federal Register of March 9, 1994. DATES: Public hearing reply comments must be received on or before January 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: All comments should be sent in triplicate to: TSCA Docket Receipt (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;G99, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Docket No. OPPTS&hyph;62134D1. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James B. Willis, Acting Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 260&hyph;1024, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11122), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers. In that proposal, the Agency stated that it would hold an informal hearing if persons requested time for oral comment. EPA received requests for a hearing. A notice published in the Federal Register of September 19, 1994 (59 FR 47832), announced a hearing for November 30, and December 1, 1994. The hearing was subsequently held, and as part of the hearing process, reply comments could be submitted through December 15, 1994. EPA received requests seeking to extend the reply comment period deadline of December 15, 1994, for a period of time after the availability of the hearing transcript. EPA expects to receive the public hearing transcript no later than December 23, 1994. Therefore, in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to review the hearing transcript before submitting reply comments, EPA has decided to reopen the reply comment period. Written reply comments must now be received on or before January 6, 1995, and shall be restricted to comments on: (1) Other comments; (2) material in the hearing record; and (3) material which was not and could not reasonably have been available to the commenting party a sufficient time before main comments were due. A person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed rule. Any person who submits a comment that contains information claimed as confidential, must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim information as confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, the Agency will put the comments in the public docket without further notice to that person.

Carra, Acting Director, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31463 Filed 12&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
