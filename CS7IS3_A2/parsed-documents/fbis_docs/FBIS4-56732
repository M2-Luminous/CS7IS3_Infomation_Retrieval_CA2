[Begin recording] [La Corte] As I said earlier, there were disturbances on (Baral) Avenue, but they were efficiently controlled by state security officers. Students from the Fermin Toro High School burned a cargo truck with license plate 109ADS. With me now is Colonel Augusto Vera Lozada, chief of staff of Command No. 5. He will explain how the riots were controlled. Good afternoon, commander. [Vera Lozada] Good afternoon. Our forces have been deployed to downtown Caracas to prevent violence; it is not our intention to harm anyone. We are trying to provide security to prevent the recurrence of incidents, and we will try to restore transportation in this sector. [La Corte] I have been told of attempts to loot stores in this area. Is that true? [Vera Lozada] No. So far nothing like that has happened. A (?truck) was burned in front of Fermin Toro High School, but the situation is under control. [La Corte] Thank you, Col. Vera Lozada, who has informed us that the disturbances have been controlled, although a few students remain inside the school. However, the National Guard and the Metropolitan Police have surrounded all adjacent streets, including (Baral) Avenue and University Avenue, to guarantee the public's safety. The situation is virtually under control. [end recording]
