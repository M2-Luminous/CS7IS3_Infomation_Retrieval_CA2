In 1985, the Central Committee proposed the nationwide selection of various knowledge-intensive areas and adopted special policies for the step-by-step formation of new technology industrial development zones, each having different characteristics. Thereafter, new and high technology industrial development zones such as Jiechunfeng developed quickly. Today the country has 52 national-level new and high technology industrial development zones and 37 province level high and new technology industry development zones. Liaoning Province, which possesses a strong industrial base, scientific and technical forces, and a multitude of institutions of higher education, has not shirked its responsibilities. One after another, three high and new technology industry development zones in Shenyang, Dalian, and Anshan have joined the "national team," and two province-level teams have been founded, one at Jinzhou, and the other at Liaoyang. The Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone in Shenyang also became one of the five new and high technology development zones that the State Science and Technology Commission and State Commission for Restructuring of the Economic System designated test areas for comprehensive reform. "First, sound a clarion call from the heights for an advance in a blaze of color." A large number of the province's scientific and technical personnel left research institutes, institutions of higher education, or large and mediumsized enterprises to found mew and high technology enterprises in scientific and technical development zones. These zones turned into commodities what had formerly been called "samples" or "exhibits." Incomplete statistics show the founding of more than 1,200 high and new technology enterprises in the province's five technology development zones, and more than 630 high and new technology projects represented by Jinzhou's far infra-red technology, Liaoyang's qihuamei [1477 0553 5326] technology, Anshan's static electricity technology, Dalian's hollow fiber super membrane technology, and Shenyang's bar code technology have entered domestic and foreign markets one after another for the preliminary creation of an output value of more than 15 billion yuan. Within the short period of five years, Shenyang's Nanhu Science and Technology Zone, which got off to the earliest start, has seen the founding of 25 enterprises making earnings of more than 10 million yuan, and 126 enterprises making more than 1 million yuan from scientific industrial commodities. They have also developed a number of products having an annual output value of more than 100 million yuan including bar codes, heavy fire retarding steel wire cable conveyor belts, and dansheng hubao ye [6130 3932 6233 1405 3210]. Like the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, Each Showing Special Prowess Making the most of each region's advantages to shape a distinctive economy is the outstanding feature of the province's five major science and technology development zones. This embodies the party's ideological line of seeking truth in facts, and it is also in keeping with the development of a socialist market economy. Liaoyang is neither along the coast nor along the frontier, much less does it have the political, economic, and scientific and technical forces available in large cities; nevertheless, the municipal CPC committee and municipal government recognized the cities' special character and seized opportunities tenaciously. First, Liaoyang began work on three major projects for which the State Council had approved a total investment of 13 billion yuan, namely the second phase of the Liaoning chemical project, the Qingyang MDI project, and the Liaoning linen and polyester project. It coordinated construction of the three projects, which will bring a large amount of high and new technology and products into Liaoyang. It's digestion and absorption of advanced technology, and its in-depth development of new products have become a major advantage for Liaoyang. In this connection, the Liaoyang high and new technology industry development zone established the principle of taking the chemical industry, chemical fibers, and plastics as the three main industries to be developed. Jinzhou City did not attempt across-the-board development. It concentrated its energies on the building of high and new technology industrial parks in an effort to make them into new growth points for the whole city's economic development. It developed leading edge forward positions for new and high technology industries. Currently, a large number of high level technical products, including membrane separation technology, quma [2575 7456] multiple analgesia, and titanium dioxide powder technology have been brought to fruition in the science and technology parks. The steel capital, Anshan, has abundant natural resources. It has one-fourth of the country's recoverable iron ore reserves, and one-fourth the world's magnesite reserves. Its talc and soap stone are renowned in China and abroad. The Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation has an annual 8 million tons aggregate production capacity. Therefore, the Anshan high and new technology industry development zone will make new materials, new energy, and high performance energy saving technology, automation technology, electronic information technology, biotechnology, environmental protection, and static electricity technology its six major technological areas for priority development. The Qixianling Industrialized Base in Dalian's high and new technology industrial zone is the city's key development project. Since the famed Dalian Economic and Technology Development Zone is located in the city, projects coming into the base start from a higher threshold. Using an overall development strategy of building a "northern Hong Kong," the park administration decided during 1993 to attract both domestic and foreign high and new technology by expanding its opening to the outside world in order to make major breakthroughs in the technical fields of electronic information, electromechanical integration, new materials, high performance energy conservation, and on environmental, maritime, and biological projects. It is making an effort to achieve within five to 10 years the formation of an industrial system that is distinctive to that city and at a substantial scale. The Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone in Shenyang has become outstanding among development zones nationwide. The development zone emphasizes major high and new technology fields including electronics and information, electromechanical integration, biology projects, new materials, energy and environmental protection. It has already developed more than 2,000 high and new technology achievements that have spawned 1,113 high and new technology enterprises. Gross earnings realized from technology, industry, and trade total more than 3 billion yuan; high and new technology projects have an output value of 2 billion yuan; and profits and taxes amount to 470 million yuan. It has created more than $20 million in foreign exchange. The software center headed by 38 year old Professor Liu Jiren [0491 4480 0088] of Northeast University's science park enjoys a reputation in the American and Japanese market. The bar code series products developed under the aegis of the 38 year old Zhu Junying [2612 0193 5391], a high level engineer at the Shenyang Engineering Institute, now hold 70 percent of the domestic market. By comparison with the other four zones, the Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone plays more the part of a locomotive for the transformation of traditional industries. The development zone has successfully created a "diffusion butt joint project," a "galloping-dragon changing-into-a-bird project" and a"single plant single role" project. In this way, the development zone has transformed more than 3,000 different traditional technologies producing 1 billion yuan in economic returns. Seizes Opportunities To Create Splendor The high and new technology development zones not only possess policy advantages, but skilled manpower and technology advantages as well. In addition, the investment environment is being constantly improved, procedures simplified, and publicity increased. Consequently, foreign traders flock to the province's five large science and technology industry development zones, and invest enthusiastically. Today, 157 foreign trader-owned enterprises are operating in Shenyang's Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone, 85 percent of them high technology, high return, high foreign exchange earning projects. Foreign-owned enterprises account for 14.2 percent of all enterprises in the Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone. They also account for 35 percent of the development zone's output value, as well as for more than 75 percent of its export foreign exchange earnings. While the science and technology industry development zone is expanding, during the first half of 1993 the central authorities increased macroeconomic regulation and control, and the State Council also issued a notice on taking a hard look at all development zones. How to regard the situation being faced is of crucial importance. Not long ago, leaders from the departments concerned in the State Science and Technology Commission and principal leaders from the provincial science and technology commission headed a group made up of science and technology directors in Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Jinzhou, and Liaoyang, as well as directors from the science and technology industry development zone, which visited the science and technology industrial development zones in Jinzhou, Shenyang, Liaoyang, and Anshan to hear reports and hold panel discussions. Comrades attending the meetings unanimously agreed that the State Council notice made clear requirements for operating the zones, underscored the solemnity of national policy regulations, and abolished all development zones below the provincial level. This is another fist tightening move in the country's economic development, concentrating material, financial, and, manpower resources. It is extremely beneficial to the development of both national and provincial level development zones. Opportunities are hard to come by. There can be no hesitation. We must move ahead vigorously. Comrades attending the meetings recognized that the technological foundation for all the province's industry was laid on the achievements of the last industrial revolution, and that Liaoning Province must carry out "the second creation" to restore its prowess. This means using new and high technology as the technological basis for the transformation of industry. Shenyang's Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone has been successful in doing this. All of the province's five large science and technology industrial development zones must become primary incubators of high and new technologies for the transformation of traditional industries. It is heartening that the fine investment climate and the abundant intellect available in the province's high and new technology industry development zones have not only attracted numerous traders from the United States, Japan, Germany, and South Korea, but, more recently. The favor of many domestic financial institutions and large enterprise blocs as well. This is because they have gradually become aware that the new and high technology industry development zones are gestating "tomorrow's sun." Reportedly, it takes about 10 years for a science and technology industry development zone to become a success. Stanford University Science Park, which was founded during the 1950s, became "Silicon Valley" during the 1960s, and during the 1970s, it became the world-renowned "first international park." The five major high and new technology industry development zones in Liaoning play a turnkey role in moving the urban area ahead in the plans of each city in which they are located. Another five to 10 years arduous struggle, and it will be the turn of the century. By that time, five new modern urban areas will have risen on the Liaodong Peninsula. What a magnificent sight that will be! Leading comrades in Shenyang, Anshan, and Jinzhou have the following ardent expectations of comrades in the science and technology industry development zones: Not all of the millions of workers, peasants, and others in these cities can go abroad, but they can go to the development zones. In going to the development zones, they can feel as though they are in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, or in developed countries of Europe and the United States. They will be able to see with their own eyes what economic development and modernization mean. We look forward enthusiastically to the early arrival of this day.
