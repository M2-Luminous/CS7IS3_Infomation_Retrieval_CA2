Every time the West has threatened force of arms, the Serbs have given in -- of course only as long as the threat was hovering over their heads. As soon as it disappeared, the concessions and the consideration for the international community also disappeared. The first part of this insight also proved true on Wednesday [9 February]. While NATO met in Brussels and more and more indications of an agreement about an armed ultimatum leaked to the public, the Bosnian Serbs and their sponsors in Belgrade showed virtual compliance in advance. Already today, Thursday, they want to withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo. And even more: The cleared Serbian positions and the still remaining artillery positions of the FRY Government troops are to be put under the supervision of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. In addition, UN troops would take up positions in the surroundings to be able to detect the source of potential bombardments. Of course, the second part of the old insight will probably also prove true: As soon as the international community returns to business as usual, the Serbs, too, will resume their old goal. The threat of attack must be upheld -- even more: The artillery and mortars of the government's troops must also be removed. Sarajevo has shed enough blood while the West has tolerated the Serbian game. If the West now once again relaxes its muscles, the next grenade attack will not be far off.
