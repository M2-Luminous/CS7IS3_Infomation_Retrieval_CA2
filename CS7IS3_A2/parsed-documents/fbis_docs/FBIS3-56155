It was announced by DerzhKomNaftoHaz [Ukraine State Oil and Gas Committee] that the duration of this agreement would be until 2005, providing for annual gas deliveries to the volume of 50-70 billion cubic meters. Ukraine will pay for some of the gas by constructing housing and by developing the social infrastructure in Russia, in particular in Stavropol Kray, as well as selling housing in Ukraine to Gazprom. Plans have already been drawn up for 125,00 square meters of housing at a price of $500 per square meter. A document will be prepared on Russia's use of Ukrainian gas storage facilities with a volume of 30 billion cubic meters. The possibility was discussed of selling Ukrainian-made rail tankers, AN-74 aircraft, and fishing vessels to Russia. However, the issue of their price was not settled. In accordance with the intersectoral agreement, in 1994 Gazprom is to supply approximately 60 billion cubic meters of gas at $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. The issue of a payments procedure in respect of the gas was discussed. In order to pay for the transit of gas across Ukraine, Gazprom accountants pointed out, Russia must be paid for the gas supplied, rather than paying irrespective of gas deliveries. Otherwise there will be taxation problems. It was decided that payment for transit would be offset by additional gas deliveries. The date of signing the intergovernmental agreement is yet to be announced.
