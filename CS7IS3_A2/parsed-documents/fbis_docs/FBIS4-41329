On Wednesday Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that certain quite interesting proposals have been made to the Syrians, in case they are accepted by Damascus, a breakthrough can be made in the Arab-Israeli negotiations within the peace process framework. The minister, however, did neither clarify the essence of those proposals nor named the channels through which they would be conveyed to the Syrian capital. Nikolay Tikhomirov, deputy director of the Near East and Africa department, in this context noted Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement, who had said at a meeting with activists of international zionist movement in Jerusalem on Wednesday that Israel is not prepared to pay such a high "territorial price" for peace, which it paid during talks with Egypt, returning Cairo the whole occupied Sinai peninsula. Syria's position at the talks with Israel is well-known, Tikhomirov emphasised. Damascus is for an unconditional exchange of territory for peace. In other words, for compeletely returning the occupied Golan Heights and establishing peace between the two countries within the framework of a comprehensive settlement. It follows from the Syrian leadership's statements that they won't go in for anything less than this.
