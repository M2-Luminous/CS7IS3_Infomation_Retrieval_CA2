[Mock] Good morning. [Oberhofer] We felt very bad about calling you so early. We know that you came back from Brussels at 2 o'clock this morning. [Mock] No problem. [Oberhofer] Thank you. Your comment is important for us. Things do not seem to be going well in Brussels at the moment. You and State Secretary Ederer came back early this morning without having achieved anything. Together with Sweden and Finland, you were supposed to confirm officially and formally the results achieved last week. This was not possible because two other issues are still unresolved in Brussels. There are claims that, if it is not possible to achieve agreement with Norway, and if agreement cannot be reached in the discussion about the blocking minority, the entire schedule of the European Union might be in danger, and there might be problems concerning Austrian membership in the European Union on 1 January 1995. How do you assess the situation? [Mock] Everything is open at the moment. Talks with the three countries Sweden, Finland, and Austria have basically been concluded. Thus, the only thing that was still missing was the official confirmation and explanations concerning the wording of the agreements. This has also been settled. The Norwegian issue is still unresolved. Since negotiations always took place on a bilateral basis, one can assume that our agreements might be forwarded to the European Parliament, despite the suspension of talks with Norway. However, the European Union must first settle an internal issue -- the question concerning the blocking minority. Today [Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros] Pangalos, the president of the Council of Ministers, will meet with the president of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Then we will see how things go. [Oberhofer] Does this mean that we could go ahead without Norway, but that the question of the blocking minority might be crucial. When Austria negotiated with Brussels, was it possible to foresee that this blocking minority might play such a big role? There was never any mention of this problem. [Mock] Since this question had been unsettled for a very long time, everybody assumed that it would be resolved within a week. Yet this was not the case. [Oberhofer] You seem to believe that there are still major difficulties ahead, that there is the possibility of a failure to reach agreement. Talks on the blocking minority have not only been postponed, but apparently they have been terminated. [Mock] Political contacts are naturally taking place all the time. Thus, negotiations have not really been terminated. There are no official talks at the moment. The question now has to be settled what the European Parliament can do, and what is possible on the basis of the standing orders. This will be discussed today. [Oberhofer] Well, what is possible on the basis of the standing orders? There have been contradictory statements in this respect. Some officials claimed that a regulation is required by 10 March, some mentioned 4 May. Generally, one has the impression that the European institutions are rather inflexible. [Mock] I would say that, basically, this might happen in every parliament. If the groups represented there reach agreement, the standing orders can be handled in a relatively flexible way. If they fail to achieve agreement, they have to adhere closely to the standing orders. The same applies to the European Parliament, which is much younger and does not have the required experience. [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, is the impression correct that there are currents in the European Union that are not really interested in an enlargement of the community? [Mock] This became apparent during the negotiations, and it is one of the reasons why the talks were so tough. The acceptance of new states was not a foregone conclusion. Some members of the European Union are asking themselves whether the union should be enlarged or not. However, the three countries finally achieved a positive result. In the current difficult situation, other factors are decisive -- that is, the fourth applicant and, above all, an issue that must be settled internally. The question is whether the European Parliament can immediately start consultations and conclude them by the beginning of May, prior to elections on 12 June, or whether this is not possible. [Oberhofer] Is is not frustrating for you, that, after the enormous pressure under which you had to negotiate -- you personally did not sleep for days -- things are now stagnating? [Mock] Well, the situation is certainly not pleasant. Yet one must always take a certain risk. [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, are you still hoping that things will develop faster than one might expect at this point? Are you still optimistic? [Mock] I believe that we have achieved the most difficult part. I hope that everything else will also be resolved on a timely basis. Basically, I am optimistic. [Oberhofer] Do you have to wait until you are called back to Brussels to ratify and sign documents? [Mock] We will certainly receive news today. [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, thank you very much for the interview. Good bye. [Mock] Good bye.
