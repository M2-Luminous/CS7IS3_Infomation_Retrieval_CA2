In a new CILFA onslaught against the U.S. Government, Challu said Ambassador James Cheek "is mistaken" when he justifies the "threat" of trade sanctions with "the argument that GATT acts a reference." While the draft of a new patents law continues without resolution in Congress, the pressure of interested groups was again refloated this week. In his most recent meetings with the media, Cheek took advantage to once again apply the thumbscrews on the topic of patents, and on 19 May, after meeting Radical [Radical Civic Union] deputies, he warned that trade sanctions "will be unavoidable" if the new law is not approved. Meanwhile, CILFA, through its executive director, today parried these remarks with an ardent defense of the GATT agreement's precepts. "The countries that signed the agreement are not obliged to approve patent laws that surpass the norms established in it," Challu emphasized. The executive director of the organization that groups national laboratories considered it a "mistake" to justify that GATT "is a reference point that must be taken into account by the countries that must introduce greater protection." This is exactly one of Cheek's justifications to insist that Congress approve a law that will favor his country's laboratories. To disqualify these justifications, Challu today clarified that despite the fact the Article No. 1 indicates that GATT members can include complementary protection in their national legislation in addition to the protection demanded by the agreement, "this cannot violate its precepts." Challu stressed that due to this motive "there is no obligation for Argentina to grant those greater concessions." "The unilateral U.S. trade sanctions are an illegal and illegitimate action because it is not contemplated in the GATT nor in any other international legislation," Challu stressed. [passage omitted]
