"The Santa Cruz del Norte cardboard plant will use raw material acquired through foreign financing, which will allow us to make this plant part of the national strategy to bring in foreign currency." Cuba Vision at 2330 GMT on 11 January reports that the first phase of the Palo Alto bulk sugar terminal in Ciego de Avila Province is near completion. The project, estimated at over 75 million pesos, will increase efficiency in marketing the sugar produced by 17 nearby mills, as well as reduce transportation costs. The facility is designed to handle 750 tons of sugar per hour. Minaz and Micons workers affirm the first phase will be completed within the next few weeks. Cuba Vision adds that the San Jose White china factory in Havana is operating in the black a few months after its inauguration. Ninety percent of the raw materials used by the factory are obtained in Cuba. The factory has already contributed $500,000 to the national economy. It has 140 workers and operates 24 hours a day. Cuba Vision also reports that the workers of Varadero's Tuspan Hotel accrued $10 million in 1993, thereby fulfilling their pledge to Fidel Castro. This hotel is considered among the best in Cuba due to the quality of its service and its economic efficiency. The 230- room two-year-old hotel is a joint investment of Cubanacan and the Mexican group DSC, and is managed and marketed by the German enterprise LTI. The money earned is a significant contribution toward purchase of food and medicine for the people.
