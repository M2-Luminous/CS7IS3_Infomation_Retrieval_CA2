FR940817-0-00021 FR940817-0-00010 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [CA 32&hyph;2&hyph;6530; FRL&hyph;5007&hyph;7] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision; South Coast Air Quality Management Division; Ventura County Air Pollution Control District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the Federal Register on March 15, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD). This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control emissions of VOCs from the transfer of gasoline into storage or fuel tanks, and from crude oil and natural gas production and processing facilities. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective on September 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 15, 1994 in 59 FR 11958, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SCAQMD Rule 461, Gasoline Transfer and Dispensing, and VCAPCD Rule 74.10, Components at Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production and Processing Facilities. Rule 461 was adopted by the SCAQMD on July 7, 1989, and submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on December 31, 1990. Rule 74.10 was adopted by the VCAPCD on June 16, 1992 and submitted by the CARB on September 14, 1992. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above. EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 11958 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX office. Response to Public Comments A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 11958. EPA did not receive any comments regarding these rules. EPA Action EPA is finalizing this action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.
