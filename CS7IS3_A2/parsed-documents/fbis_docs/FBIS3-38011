"In recent days," the document points out, "Russia has undertaken additional efforts to realize its initiative with regard to unblocking Sarajevo and transferring this city to UN control, which it advanced back at the 47th General Assembly Session. We have sought and are seeking to implement this initiative by acting openly within the framework of Security Council resolutions." It points out that "as a result of the steps taken by the leadership of Russia and intensive diplomatic work, this firm and consistent line, which rules out unilateral ultimatums, has produced a result." "In response to our appeal the Bosnian Serbs adopted a decision at their assembly in Pale to withdraw their heavy arms from the Sarajevo reigon. We reckon that this show of goodwill by one of the sides involved in the conflict at a critical moment for a settlement will elicit equally specific countersteps.... We also urge our partners in the Bosnian settlement -- above all, the United States and the EU countries -- in the spirit of their statements on the preferability of a political solution to the problem, to exert the necessary influence over the Bosnian Government to make it cooperate with the United Nations in the matter of completely unblocking and demilitarizing Sarajevo," the statement reads. Russia has proposed that, following the unblocking of Sarajevo, the UN Security Council urgently begin examining ways to establish an administration in this city, as well as measures to strengthen other safe areas on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
