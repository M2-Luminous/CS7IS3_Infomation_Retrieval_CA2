In the summer of 1990, a peacetime strength of 370,000 soldiers was stipulated. This figure, which was bindingly agreed upon during the Two Plus Four Talks with the former Soviet Union in 1990, seem to be the only basis for all considerations concerning the structure of the Armed Forces. However, it is based on structural considerations concerning the military services that were made at a time when the collapse of the East Bloc and Germany's reunification were just becoming apparent. Thus, the goals of Army Structure 5, which was initiated in the middle of the 1980's and which has not yet been implemented completely, are still valid today. Moreover, the equipment of the Air Force and the Navy is still based on targets that did not yet take into consideration the fundamental security-political changes in Europe. The Federal Government, Mr. Ruehe in particular, has not made any useful proposals for the adaptation of the structures of the Armed Forces to the new situation that would help the Bundeswehr overcome the lack of orientation that was bound to develop. As recently as during the 1993 budget debate, Chancellor Kohl and Defense Minister Ruehe still insisted vigorously on the planned strength of 370,000 soldiers and 155,000 civilian employees for the Armed Forces and the Bundeswehr administration. Even at the security conference in Munich on 5 February, the chancellor confirmed these figures, despite the finance minister's announcement that 1.25 billion German marks [DM] have to be saved. He cited the tense situation in the former Yugoslavia and the uncertainitees of the Russian reform process as the reasons. The fact that the Bundeswehr has already been reduced to a strength of 350,000 because of an acute shortage of funds is being described evasively as "structure-neutral variation." This term is nothing but the admission that the lack of 20,000 soldiers is the utmost limit of what the Bundeswehr can handle without immediate changes concerning the structural objectives. A comparable gap only existed in the 1950's when the Bundeswehr was newly established. The situation shows that the personnel structure of the Armed Forces is no longer determined by the goals of the defense policy but exclusively by the government's budget problems. The Bundeswehr Association has rightly commented on the government's most recent decision to reduce the defense budget, stressing that it deprives the Bundeswehr planning "of the financial basis, makes the government's often repeated intention to adhere to a strength of 370,000 men finally incredible, and that it will largely paralyze the system of training and exercises." Nothing is to be added to the conclusion of the Bundeswehr Association that the austerity course will make maintenance and repair and urgently required structural improvements impossible in the next few years, which will lead to the closure of even more barracks and new burdens for the soldiers and their families. It is common knowledge among experts that the defense budget is no longer determined by the tasks of the Bundeswehr but is being used to fill gaps in other spheres. The government's course not only reveals its inefficiency in the area of defense but also leads to an increasing lack of orientation among the troops and administration. This happens particularly at a time when the Army is exhausted because of the implementation of German unity. Since the completion of German unity, the soldiers of the Bundeswehr and the civilian employees of the Bundeswehr administration have carried out Herculean labor in restructuring the Bundeswehr and in adapting to the new tasks. They succeeded in establishing Bundeswehr barracks in the new laender and in creating new administrative structures within a very short period. In addition, they had to handle difficult reorganization measures and the closure of barracks in the old laender. These far-reaching changes not only affected the soldiers involved but, above all, their families. Some of the decisions on the deployment initiated earlier still have to be implemented or are in the process of being realized. Nothing is more important and urgent for the members of the Bundeswehr than planning continuity and security. Instead, however, they are confronted with the fact that the tight budget situation leads to unsystematic cutbacks and austerity measures in areas where a solid planning concept and an honest financial framework would have been necessary. None of the soldiers or civilian employees who were still involved in the restructuring process in a dedicated manner one year ago would have thought that the "peace dividend" would be distributed in such a haphazard manner with disastrous consequences for the barracks, units, and troops and for decisions on investments. A Federal Government that has to fulfill a constitutional task vis-a-vis our Armed Forces must ensure security in spite of a decreased military threat and scarce funds. The main task of the Federal Government continues to be national defense. It must be in a position, together with the alliance partners, to deter or ward off external enemies who threaten Germany. Ensuring security also means equipping the Bundeswehr with sufficient personnel and material to meet its obligations within the alliance. In spite of the disappearance of the East-West conflict and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, Germany's territorial sovereignty can only be guaranteed in the future if the North Atlantic Alliance can guarantee the territorial sovereignty of its member states. I am not surprised that, after the end of the East-West confrontation, the NATO members who carried the main burden within the alliance in the past are now calling for a redistribution of the roles and of the spheres of responsibility. They increasingly point out the Atlantic or European responsibility of the alliance partners. At the same time, organizational structures like the Eurocorps which were viewed suspiciously in the past are being welcomed. Germany must be prepared that the range of tasks resulting from NATO obligations will make the preservation of Germany's defense capability more expensive. As compared with the defense assignment, all other tasks of the Bundeswehr are secondary. This applies to the cases explicitly stipulated in the Basic Law and to an even greater extent to missions that may take place at the initiative of the Federal Government with the approval of the Bundestag. Until a decision is made by the Constitutional Court, they include all contributions by the Bundeswehr to the collective safeguarding of peace. Crisis management and the settlement of conflicts are the basis of the new planning. The Bundeswehr needs new structures. However, these structures must not solely be determined by the financial situation of the state whose defense the Bundeswehr is to ensure, as is currently the case. Rather, the structures must be task-oriented. Every political decision on the structures of the Armed Forces must be based on comprehensive considerations. All these considerations are linked with each other and depend on each other. The isolated examination of individual components as a basis for decisions is useless. When planning for the Armed Forces, one must begin with the task. It reflects the threat analysis and the risk assessment, as well as the leeway for action and willingness to act. The Federal Government defined the task of the Bundeswehr in the Guidelines on Defense Policy by the federal defense minister, dated 26 November 1992. What is remarkable about this basic document designed to outline the principles of security policy, the task of the Bundeswehr and the major tasks of the Armed Forces, are the references to threat and the avoidance of risks. The core of the threat analysis is the statement that Germany is no longer within the immediate range of a state capable of a strategic offensive or of capturing territory. "Germany is no longer a front-line state." Another passage reads: "The most dangerous case of a large-scale aggression has become highly unlikely." Assessing the risks posed by the successor states of the Soviet Union, the document reads: "A threat for Germany or its allies can be ruled out in the foreseeable future if the (NATO) Alliance preserves its ability for flexible deployment and strategic balance." As compared with an early warning time of a maximum of 14 days during the Cold War, plans are now based on a militarily usable warning time of at least one year. The document draws the following final conclusion: "Military conflicts that might endanger Germany's existence have become unlikely." The Guidelines on Defense Policy have the character of a decree in the defense ministry and are the "binding basis for the work in the organizational spheres.... and for the safeguarding of German military interests toward the outside." The threat analysis of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is exactly the same. The resolutions on foreign and security policy adopted by the party conference, which took place in Wiesbaden on 16-19 November 1993, point out that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the East-West conflict have fundamentally changed international relations, particularly on our continent. This opens up big opportunities but also involves dangers. On the one hand, the dramatic changes have made it possible to extend peace, freedom, and prosperity to the whole of Europe. On the other hand, the negative phenomena accompanying the far-reaching changes that may entail poverty, disorientation, and bloodshed hold the danger of a relapse into authoritarian regimes as a result of ethnic-national conflicts, and of an exacerbating tendency toward settling conflicts with the use of force. For this reason, the Bundeswehr, together with its partners, must provide military protection while at the same time actively participating in disarmament and confidence-building measures throughout Europe. The Bundeswehr must continue its efforts to prevent war and remain capable of effective defense within NATO. However, the government coalition arrives at a different conclusion from the Social Democratic opposition concerning the structures of the Bundeswehr. One of the major reasons is that the government parties advocate a more comprehensive leeway for military action for the united Germany, and that they orient themselves to a greater extent toward a role in foreign and military policy which they themselves are depriving of the financial means. This applies particularly to Bundeswehr missions outside the NATO area and military UN operations that go beyond blue beret missions. Presently, the dilemma of the Bundeswehr is that the task of the political leadership goes far beyond what the financial resources permit. It is useless in this respect to continue the quarrel between the government and the opposition concerning the possibilities and limits of Bundeswehr missions outside the borders defined by Article 87a of the Basic Law. The Constitutional Court will make a binding decision this summer. Before the SPD brought the matter before the court in Karlsruhe, it launched initiatives for a clarifying completion of Articles 24 and 87a of the Basic Law, aimed at limiting the participation of the Bundeswehr in UN missions to peacekeeping missions (including military emergency measures) and at rejecting military operations on the part of the parties to ae conflict. The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] objected to these restrictions. With the participation in the Somalia mission, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Defense Minister Ruehe even forced the smaller coalition partner Free Democratic Party of Germany to appeal to the Constitutional Court. If the CDU/CSU continues to point out the vast difference between the SPD's position and the defense policy of the federal government and of the parties that support it, this applies exclusively to the military leeway demanded by the CDU/CSU. It is wrong from a security-political viewpoint and harmful for the future of the Bundeswehr to base all future structural considerations beyond 1995 on an army strength of 370,000 soldiers. After the disappearance of the East-West threat, the larger Germany does not need an army of the same actual strength as during the Cold War. Germany today is surrounded by friends on all sides. The states to the south, west, and north even want to shape a common foreign and security policy, as in the European Union. Our Eastern neighbors want to establish closer economic and military ties with us. Because of this strategic center position, we are basically protected against direct aggression. Moreover, our allies on our eastern border can also expect a solidarity security contribution that is in our very own interest. After all, security precaution within the European Union means that every member state can rely on joint solidary action to ensure the security of all in the future. A beginning was made in a treaty on European Union. The common military framework will be the Western European Union. This results in a multinational operation profile of our Armed Forces that is oriented toward Europe. Flexibility and professionalism are needed. The changed strategic and operational framework conditions require a Bundeswehr concept that is based on flexibility and a high degree of professionalism. The concept must also provide for an increase in the number of soldiers after a longer warning period, made possible by compulsory military service. In addition, there must be a militia element. The range of tasks of these Armed Forces includes the direct defense of the country and the defense of the boundaries of the NATO alliance. Smaller local conflicts are the more likely scenario in the foreseeable future. Large-scale military operations with a Europe-wide conduct of operations or interventions on the model of the Gulf war are of less significance. The current framework conditions allow a drastic reduction in the mechanized major formations of the Bundeswehr but no renunciation of the reinforcement component for the allies or our own forces outside our territory. This applies mainly to the Army. The conditions in the Air Force and the Navy are different. They depend to a large extent on the integration in a European security architecture. How long do the European states want to afford the luxury of national massed concentration? Is a European labor division not necessary for cost reasons? This makes it clear what structural changes the Bundeswehr will be facing in the middle of the 1990's. An operational profile that includes both the classical national defense and international police operations requires military units with a broad range of possible operations and a high level of professionalism. They must be in a position to carry out operations even in the event of an escalation at high survivability, and they must be able to end conflicts quickly. At the same time, they must not lose the ability to form the spine of the Armed Forces as the core units. On the basis of the current warning periods, the Armed Forces are capable of carrying out large-scale operations within the framework of a common European defense system. The crisis reaction forces in all three military services will have to assume different tasks from the units whose main job is to defend the country. A dual system with professional units consisting of soldiers who sign up for longer periods and with national defense units on a militia basis requires a careful examination as to the distribution of resources, fitness for operations, and the social acceptability within the Bundeswehr and its impact outside the Bundeswehr. The shaping of the future structures of the Armed Forces will depend on the way and the probability of the requirements within the national and international framework. Forms of operation have to be developed in which units can be combined in accordance with the tasks. To achieve this, combinations from all organizational spheres and of the military services must be permissible. However, it must be prevented that, like on the occasion of the Somalia mission, specialists are gathered like heroes and that special operational units are formed on this basis. As a result, the troop loses its operability, and the operational unit must first develop its own identity. Structural changes and reductions of the strength will affect the Army most. The goal is the formation of elements for units on the basis of the brigade as the smallest possible operational unit capable of conducting operations. It should be possible to combine these units in the above described sense for every individual task. For these kinds of organization, one can also use something that has proven its worth, such as the command and support organization of the Army, which is planned for 1995. Alternatively, it must be examined whether the hierarchical command structure of the Army can be tightened. Thus, following the French model, one could perhaps even do without the level of brigades and enable the level of battalions to engage in operational command in a regimental structure. For the Air Force and the Navy, there are less serious structural changes in the offing. However, for these partial forces, too, a command and communication ability that crosses partial forces and can be used multinationally becomes necessary. In the resolutions of the party congress in Wiesbaden on foreign and security policy, the SPD demanded that the Bundeswehr must exclusively and visibly correspond to its defensive assignment in terms of size, structure, armament, training, and operational concept. In case of scarce budgetary means, as now exist, savings can be achieved almost exclusively by reducing the personnel of the Armed Forces, if the functioning of the Armed Forces will not suffer. However, personnel is not something that can be changed arbitrarily at any time. Therefore, the SPD gives priority to the social compatibility of personnel reduction. If, in this connection, the target of 300,000 soldiers is mentioned for the time after 1995, it must be taken into consideration that such a reduction of personnel by 70,000 soldiers is linked with the closing down of a considerable number of barracks. As a figure for orientation, one can say that if there are about 1,000 soldiers less, one of the barracks must be closed. Any communally or locally oriented politician is aware of the social dynamite that is hidden behind such figures for the affected community or region. After all, an entire armored infantry battalion with its soldiers constitutes purchasing power of about 30 million marks per year. The structural changes for the Armed Forces, which the Federal Government has to carry out in line with its drastic thrift decisions in the individual budget number 14 in order to keep the Bundeswehr functioning, need time for planning and implementation. It is possible to reduce the Armed Forces relatively quickly. We have been shown this by the U.S. Forces, which have reduced their strength from 1.8 to 1.4 million soldiers, the number of Army divisions from 14 to 12, and the number of combat ships from 434 to 413. The German Armed Forces have already been reduced drastically, if one adds the Bundeswehr and National People's Army in the reunitied Germany. In this process, however, the Bundeswehr had the advantage that it suffered less closings and layoffs than the other German army. In any future reduction, however, it must be taken into account that the potential ability to increase the national defense forces must be preserved. It will not always be possible to implement a new profound structural change in the Army immediately after the implementation of the Army Structure Number 5 as of 1995. However, already in 1992 and 1993, it was possible and urgently necessary in the Defense Ministry to undertake a self-critical inventory. It would have been necessary to convene a defense structure committee, as this was done in 1970-72 by Defense Minister Helmut Schmidt with excellent results for the Armed Forces. The new Defense Structure Committee could have even relied on the preparatory work done by the past committee. Thus, planning time could have been saved, which is valuable time for thorough basic work. There is the specific danger today that structural planning will be started only after the Bundestag elections and thus too late. The Bundeswehr's current structure does not correspond to the situation. The Federal Government is stubbornly sticking to this structure, but it is not providing the money necessary to keep it functioning. There are only two alternatives: more money or another structure that is smaller. For the Armed Forces' assignment, there applies the following: clear orientation toward the assignment given by the Basic Law and priority for alliance defense.
