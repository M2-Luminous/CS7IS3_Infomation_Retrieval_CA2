Recently Valentin P. Gaponchev, president of the Russian laser manufacturer IRE-POLUS, visited Japan and spoke with our editors about the history and present status of laser research in Russia and about his company's business strategy. OPTRONICS: Tell us about the history of laser research in Russia. Gaponchev: Laser research in Russia began about the same time it did in the U.S. Many kinds of research were conducted beginning in the early 1960s by scientists at universities, government research institutes, and businesses. Until about 10 years ago we obtained many outstanding results and possessed very advanced technology, but hardly any of that information was conveyed to Western nations. The fact was that strict secrecy was maintained in the country, and even our own researchers did not know what other Soviet researchers were doing in detail. For example, researchers at my company developed a 100 kW class YAG laser 10 years ago, and I myself developed the phosphite glass used in glass lasers in 1969. Furthermore, eight years ago we had already developed a Q-switched Cr:YAG laser used in range finders, etc., with better performance than those used by Western companies today. At that time 200-300 large companies, and it becomes a vast number if we include all the small companies, were involved in laser research. Research on laser technology was also heavily emphasized at universities and government research institutes. There were a lot of laboratories doing research on solid state lasers, but only a few were working with semiconductor lasers. Furthermore, all this R&D was essentially for military use, and no thought was given to converting lasers to civilian use. OPTRONICS: What is the present status of laser research? Gaponchev: Researchers are suffering from monetary problems because beginning last year government research spending, especially military spending, was cut considerably. Because government funding was determined in the past by the size of the organization and number of people employed rather than the content of the research, the major research organizations hired more and more people in their desire for funding. Actually, however, about 90 percent of the personnel were unnecessary, and those conducting research accounted for only about 10 percent of the total, so there were only a few researchers in the true sense of the word. The way for our scientists to survive from now on will be to jump feet first into the free market economy on their own and actually compete with Western products. We can't expect that kind of change from large companies, however. The fact is that they are not investing capital in developing new technology. Almost all their money is used to pay researchers' salaries, so research is not adequately funded. Therefore, from a practical standpoint, the most effective solution is to start a new company and assemble researchers. Government funds will just be wasted if they are sent to places operating under the old system, so they are now being directed to new companies instead. These past few years more than 100,000 companies have requested government funding to carry out high-tech development, and in laser-related fields there are more than 1,000 companies requesting startup funds. However, almost all of them are just companies on paper and all they really want is government funds. They are insipid companies that merely want to sell the technology that the nation has already developed. As far as I know, only about 10 companies at most are actually developing commercial products. Almost all the companies involved with lasers were established by groups from departments in government research organizations. Their product lines are small, so they do not receive funding from the government, and it is difficult for them to develop new products. Our best human resources, technology, and equipment are leaking away into foreign countries. The companies that remain have already lost competitive strength, and that puts Russian companies in a dangerous fix. There is a small number of companies, however, that are investing in new equipment, and in fact, some strong companies are emerging. IRE-POLUS is one of those companies. OPTRONICS: Tell us the history of IRE-POLUS. Gaponchev: IRE-POLUS was established in 1990 by the merger of two groups of scientists. One of them was the IRE group, where I was conducting research on laser materials. The other was a group from POLUS, one of Russia's leading solid state laser research organizations, and is led by Alexander Chestakov. Our researchers and their friends supplied 89 percent of the capital, and the remaining 11 percent came from the government. Because only a small amount of our capital is from the government, we can do research, development and sales with almost complete freedom. Our capital was originally about $2,000, but now we have about $20,000,000, and we have invested about $15,000,000 of that money in new technology such as equipment and facilities. Over the past three years we have reinvested 90-95 percent of our profits in new technology. These investments are for the development of high quality items to meet our unique specifications such as the materials and optical parts necessary to develop laser equipment. Our goal is to develop new solid state lasers and systems. We plan to proceed with development to the prototype and small-volume mass production level in response to the market, and if the market demands a large quantity of our products, we will license the manufacturing out to Western companies. We started with a staff of 27, and now we have about 250 people working for us with about 50 Ph.D's. OPTRONICS: Tell us something about your products. Gaponchev: For example, our Er:fiber amplifier has a high output of 150 mW and is very compact. Right now we are developing a 500 mW model, and we have achieved oscillation at the experimental level. Our Er:fiber laser has a high output of 200 mW and uses direct diode excitation. We have finished development of a 500 mW prototype. We have also developed green and blue lasers that employ nonlinear optic crystals and up-conversion for use at wavelengths of 1.5 �m and at 1 �m with Nd, Yb, etc. We have developed fiber lasers in the 20-30 W class and in the future we expect output of several hundred W. Compared with lamp and diode excitation formats, our lasers are compact, highly efficient, low in cost, and do not require cooling, so we expect applications for them in industry and medical therapy. Our Nd:YAG lasers have achieved high outputs of up to 3 kW, and we also manufacture a single mode type. Our 1.5 kW class laser has a compact resonator of about 40 cm, and our single mode type has an efficiency almost as good as multimode types. We still have to address problems with the power source and chiller, however. Because there are no good suppliers in Russia, and we have not developed these items in-house, we want to do business with a reputable manufacturer from a Western nation. We are also working hard on tunable lasers such as the Ti:sapphire laser. We started with high quality crystals and proceeded with development of green Nd:YAG lasers. We have completed development of a green laser with an output of 10 W CW and 30 W Q-switched. In addition, we have developed a Cr:YAG laser that can cover the range from 1.35 �m to 1.6 �m, and a diode pump Yb:fiber laser capable of continuous variation from 1.04 �m to 1.18 �m. We are now building prototypes of both. We are also working on development of Ho:YAG lasers and Er:YAG lasers for medical equipment. These perform as well as the most advanced lasers in Western nations, and we have begun our activities in this field by setting the prices low enough that they can be used in medicine and establishing a subsidiary for dedicated sales. OPTRONICS: What about semiconductor lasers? Gaponchev: We are thinking of developing semiconductor lasers for excitation purposes. We have developed semiconductor lasers for the fiber lasers, and we hope to become as strong in the field as Western semiconductor laser manufacturers. We are also working on the development of E/O and A/O devices and fiber sensors. Our fiber thermometers are compact, have a precision of +/- 0.01�C, a range of -50 to +150�C, and their cost is about the same as high precision thermocouple thermometers. The catheter internal insertion type with a 200 �m sensor head can be used to control temperatures in heat therapy for cancer. The cost will be only one-tenth those made in the U.S., and we are looking for companies in Japan and elsewhere to do mass production. Another item we are working on is the fiber gyro, and we want to form a partnership with a Japanese company for manufacture and sales. As far as price is concerned, we have supplied them for communications satellite attitude control for about $1,000, and we expect they will run about $100 for use in automobiles. OPTRONICS: Low prices are your strength, but do you expect them to stay that way? Gaponchev: I think there are two reasons why products from the old communist bloc were inexpensive. The first is that their performance was inferior to products from the West. The second is that their initial cost was extremely low because they came out of government research institutes. Therefore, it was possible to price them low and make a good profit. However, when we think about supplying stable quality and performance and establishing a service system, the market prices of Russian lasers will probably approach those from the rest of the world before too long. It is true that in the past there was a major price difference because material and labor costs were low, but the gap with the West has been steadily closing. Because the prices of Russian products are rising, there may be cases in the future where it will be less expensive to buy something made in the West. Actually, the price of metal has gone up 30 times already this year. The frames for our equipment that we used to make for $200-$300 now cost 10 times more, and the cost of manufacturing an Nd:YAG rod has jumped from $50 last year to about $200 today. OPTRONICS: What was the purpose of your visit to Japan? Gaponchev: I visited at the invitation of TEM for installing laser equipment and strengthening our cooperative relationship. At the same time I wanted to sound out the possibilities for joint ventures with Japanese companies and having them provide OEM. Right now our main market is Europe, then the U.S. We have subsidiaries in both places. As far as the Japanese market is concerned, there are still a lot of unknowns, but we would definitely like to enter it. It is true that the situation in Russia today is unstable. Inflation is out of control, the interest rates at lending institutions are very high, and there is a limit to how much we can borrow. Therefore, we have high hopes for financial aid and support from Western nations. Unfortunately, it is my impression that Japanese companies are not very eager to invest. Contrast that with China. China is building its own plants for development and manufacturing based on Russian technology, and it looks like their purpose is for military use. OPTRONICS: Thank you very much for speaking with us.
