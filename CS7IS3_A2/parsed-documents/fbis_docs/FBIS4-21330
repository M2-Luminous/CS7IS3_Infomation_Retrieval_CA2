"We have always been extremely careful about who we will accept," one Geneva banker said recently. They say that even in the bad old days, when the famous anonymous numbered accounts were permitted, they always checked their clients' credentials thoroughly. These claims ring rather hollow in the light of the latest case of dirty money--a $150m (102.7m pounds) account at Union Bank of Switzerland [UBS] in Zurich held openly in the name of Mrs Sheila Miriam Arana de Nasser, wife and partner of a suspected big-league Colombian drug dealer. Swiss bankers now admit lamely that their screening of clients was perhaps not quite as rigorous in the 1970s--when this particular account was opened--and before as it is today. "We were not as sensitive to money laundering then," Mr Stephan Haeringer, a UBS director, conceded last week. But bankers were surprised that UBS was the one caught out. Switzerland's largest bank is renowned for its careful scrutiny of potential customers. In the late 1980s, for example, UBS alone among the three large Swiss universal banks managed to steer clear of Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, Olympia & York, Omni and other big corporate groups that subsequently collapsed. It was also the first Swiss bank to refer the deposits of foreign politicians to the executive board. The problem, Swiss bankers say, is one of Altlasten, a German word describing old deposits of toxic waste. All the well-established banks have accounts like that of Mrs Arana that were opened years before screening was tightened. And like concentrations of toxic waste, these accounts can explode at any time without warning. The Swiss Federal Banking Commission's 1992 guidelines to bankers provide no fewer than 30 pointers to help them detect whether or not money is being laundered. But all of them have to do with transactions--withdrawals, purchase of drafts, transfers or excessive cash movements. If, as in the Arana case, the account lies virtually dormant for several years, it is more difficult for the bank's internal auditors to detect a problem. The commission acknowledged the difficulty, saying that "it is not the banks' responsibility to investigate systematically all customer transactions for a possible connection to criminal activities". That said, UBS's local competitors still have trouble understanding this case. They say that now banks have put customer accounts on computer files, it is not difficult to isolate all the Altlasten from, say, Colombia or Sicily for a special audit. Also, bankers say they now scan the newspapers for scandals and criminal activities out of fear that some of those involved are among their clients. But the prevailing view among Swiss bankers remains rather fatalistic--that a banking centre like Switzerland which specialises in attracting investment funds from rich individuals will inevitably also attract criminals. "They have to place their money somewhere and they prefer to do it in the biggest and most efficient financial centres," a Swiss Bankers' Association spokesman stressed. The Swiss doubt that they need further legislation to combat criminal money. In the past four years they have put in place what they believe is one of the best prevention and prosecution systems in the world. Money laundering has become a criminal offence, which allows the Swiss police to co-operate fully with their foreign counterparts. Bankers are obliged to know the real owners of all their accounts and are forbidden from accepting criminal money. Acceptance of such money through negligence is also punishable. Later this year two additional legal reforms will complete the package, one permitting bankers to denounce suspected criminal clients to the police and the other making membership in a criminal organisation a criminal offence. This will enable the Swiss authorities to co-operate with Italy in Mafia investigations. The one consolation arising from the latest case is that it showed that the Swiss, who often turned a blind eye to financial crime in the past, are now willing to move quickly when suspicions are raised. Once the facts were known, the authorities froze the bank account and arrested Mrs Arana at her home near Geneva. The Banking Commission and the Bankers' Association have already launched investigations of UBS's conduct, and the bank has suspended a vice-president responsible for the account. The Swiss, at least, believe that the message to both banks and money launderers is clear.
