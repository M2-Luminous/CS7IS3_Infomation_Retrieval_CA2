The object of the meeting was to strengthen peace and security in Bujumbura. Here is Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko, speaking with by Celcius Nsengiyunva. [Begin Kanyenkiko recording] Everyone recalls that the government asked the population to maintain peace and security to honor the memory of our dead president of the Republic, the late Ntaryamira and Ministers Cyriaque Simbizi and Bernard Ciza. Unfortunately, the peace and tranquillity which had been observed, particularly after the tragic night of 6 April, was shattered over the last two days in some suburbs of Bujumbura. It has been clear that the state of security in the entire territory is dependent mainly on the security situation in the capital. For this reason, the Council of Ministers, in the short term, has set the following three objectives: First, to restore security and trust in all the suburbs of the town. Second, to resettle the displaced people and refugees in their respective homes. Third, to make the people and armed groups surrender their arms. In order to attain these objectives, the government will carry out the following actions: First, it will do everything possible to ensure that political and administrative officials in zones and suburbs are men and women who are acceptable to all sections of the population. The officials must be open to dialogue with the cooperation of the security forces, be impartial, and must not show leniency to wrongdoers. Second, we shall invite members of the MIOB, the OAU observation mission to Burundi, to go to the spot and work with civilian and military officials, whether in the framework of territorial administration or in the framework of the security forces. This will bring about more trust and objectivity in what is happening on the ground. Third, we shall broaden the composition of the proposing committee for officials in matters of security at the level of zones, so as to extend members of the committee to sub-divisions and streets. [Words indistinct] by appointing people there who are known for their integrity and who strive for the return of peace and security. Before ending the session, the Council of Ministers recommended that government members immediately join other members of the proposing committees in all the zones. This has been in effect since 1100. [end recording]
