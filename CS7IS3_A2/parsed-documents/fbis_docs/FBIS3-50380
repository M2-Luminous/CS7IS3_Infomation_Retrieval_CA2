He also indicated that the media misrepresent the new prime minister when they portray him as an uncompromising representative of the political right. While Ferenc Kulin, in a 13 January interview in the Budapest weekly BESZELO, refused to speculate about postelection coalition possibilities, he stressed that the MDF would like to be able to cooperate with the liberal parties against the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), a successor of the former ruling communist Hungarian Socialist Workers Party (MSZMP). Desire for such cooperation is a legacy, Kulin indicated, of recently deceased Prime Minister Jozsef Antall, who "considered it the most important result of the system change, which must not be given up and must not be lost, that the country can exclude the successor of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party when choosing its leading politicians and governing parties." FIDESZ, however, is the only liberal party that seems suitable for cooperation with the MDF, according to Kulin. The long-standing conflict between the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) and the MDF, he indicated, has in fact gotten worse now that "the SZDSZ creates the impression that it is ready to work together with the MSZP. In effect, this simplifies our problem, because our two adversaries are merging into one. Having said this, I have also answered the question of whether I see a difference between the two liberal parties [FIDESZ and SZDSZ]. Of course I see a difference, and the difference I see is that Fidesz is not preparing to cooperate with the successor of the MSZMP. In our system of values, this is a basic difference," Kulin said. Kulin also commented about his relationship with Prime Minister Boross, asserting that there are no unbridgeable differences between his own "national liberal" stance and Boross's more conservative views. Charging that the media misrepresent Boross, Kulin said that the Boross who is portrayed by the press as standing on the right and even "extreme right," and who is "allegedly... on close terms with Istvan Csurka"--Hungary's leading right-wing extremist, who broke with the MDF last year--is "not the Peter Boross that I know." In Boross's "whole mentality there are many elements that differ from the things that I represent. However, it never occurred to me for one minute that Peter Boross, the man who thinks and acts with political responsibility, would present me with the kinds of dilemmas that Istvan Csurka presented me with.... I do not feel any tension between him and me that we would not be able to clarify and resolve through a direct dialogue or an exchange of views within our party."
