This is part of efforts to increase imports of U.S. automobiles into Japan. In the Japan-U.S. economic talks, the United States condemned the Japanese system of inspecting imported cars as an invisible trade barrier. Under the system, every single imported car is inspected to make sure that it meets Japan's safety standards.
