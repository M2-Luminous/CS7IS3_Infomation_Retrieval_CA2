"It is not NATO or the United Nations that should dictate their terms to the Serbs but Russia that must determine the policy there," said Vengerovskiy, who is one of the leaders of extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party. At a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, Vengerovskiy criticized the Duma's decision to suspend debates on the situation in ex-Yugoslavia until the return of a Duma delegation due to leave for the war-torn country on Thursday. The Duma is trying "to get off easy by setting up another commission, which would engage in political tourism. Commenting on his recent trip to Pyongyang, Vengerovskiy said relations between Russia and North Korea are today at a "zero" level. Asked whether he discussed the issue of the North Korea's nuclear facilities during his visit, he said that, when he asked whether Pyongyang had an atom bomb, his hosts replied, "We don't know."
