Talking to journalists in Samara he said that any attempt to weaken the monetary policy will as a rule have result in the opposite of what was envisaged. Ukraine had often offset such debt and the result was one of the most critical financial situations in the CIS. In the Baltic states such steps had never been taken and there the debt problem was much less acute, said Gaydar. He said that defaulting was an indicator of financial responsibility. "If there was a high level of responsibility, defaulting is high. One can refrain from paying and put one's money in a bank or commercial structure and receive a profit." He said this was impossible in countries with strict bankrupt legislation and a high level of real responsibility. Gaydar also considers the government to be to blame. "This concerns the defaulting of the government itself and its non-fulfillment of obligations -- a line actively pursued by the Chernomyrdin cabinet since the beginning of 1993," said Gaydar. He said that serious changes in the present tax system can only be based, in the first place, on real cut-backs in government expenditure and, in the second, on the gradual lowering of profit tax and the gradual raising of tax on natural resources, land and property. On the decision to unify the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, Gaydar said that a series of principal conditions had been accepted in Belarus (in contrast to the initial draft) and that Belarus would win a considerable amount from the agreement, e.g. equal prices for energy and access to the stable Russian currency. Russia is widening its market. In addition, it will not have to pay any lease for military units stationed in Belarus. However, Gaydar said that one point did give him cause for concern: Private individuals will be able to exchange Belarusian rubles for Russian rubles at a rate of one to one for the first two hundred thousand in cash and for the first million in bank accounts. As there is about 60 million dollars in cash circulation in Belarus, this would result in the circulation increasing to 1.5 billion dollars. Thus, Gaydar said, Russia would be making Belarus a gift of two trillion rubles. This does not take into account bank savings. The main thing, according to Gaydar, is that the possibilities for financial speculation will increase massively at a cost of many trillions of rubles for the Russian economy.
