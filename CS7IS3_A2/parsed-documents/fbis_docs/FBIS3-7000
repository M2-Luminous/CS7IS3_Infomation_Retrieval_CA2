In a message addressed to the 10th assembly of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), Hosokawa said APEC and PECC "should complement each other by identifying complementary activities for the promotion of regional economic cooperation." This is because "PECC and APEC share common objectives and an equal recognition of the importance of facilitating and promoting Asia-Pacific economic cooperation," he said. PECC, a nongovernmental organization formed in 1980, provides a forum for the region's best thinkers, business leaders and government officials to meet and exchange views every 18 months on ways to boost economic cooperation in the world's fastest growing region. Hosokawa noted the importance of dialogue in boosting cooperation among countries in the region. Japan, he said, "is ready to make efforts to continue playing a positive role in promoting such cooperation." Hosokawa's message was read to the audience of 500 delegates. He also expressed hope that trade blocs in the Asia-Pacific region such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] and the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] will not become economic fortresses. "I hope to see AFTA and NAFTA, while keeping up their coordination with GATT, continue to contribute to maintaining and strengthening the open and multilateral trading system," he said. "Open, multilateral free trade under the auspices of GATT is of paramount importance for the development of not only the Asia-Pacific area but the entire world," he said.
