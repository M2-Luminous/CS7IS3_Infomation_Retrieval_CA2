"Russia's Army will walk out when we become not interesting for Russia or other states that it cannot ignore will dictate it. Until then, Moldova and Russia, for their citizens' life, have to find an acceptable variant for both parties" Plugaru believes. Asked about the information saying that the National Security Minister is involved in the activity of the Ilascu Group, Plugaru said "we supported only those forces which acted according to Moldovan legislation. Therefore, I think that if someone infringed it, he should be made responsible basing on this legislation." The ex-minister spoke about various forms of people's fight against Dniester regime, including partisans. The National Security Ministry has done its best to support all forces that pleaded for territorial integrity of Moldova. If he did not do so, the ministry should have been dissolved and its employees sued for criminal passivity, states the quoted source. Asked about the assertion that Ilie Ilascu's arrest was organized by the National Security Ministry, Plugaru said: "We must understand the condition of a man sentenced to death" but still "we should examine much seriously this declaration of Ilascu, since it should worry us." Neither Ilascu nor his comrades have done anything against Moldova's Penal Code. Three years ago, the new state formation, that is the Republic of Moldova, "was unable as it is now to make order without bloodshed" on territories where certain forces speculating with Romanophobia and difficulties of republican power have took the power and declared their own republics, ex-USSR's interests on this territory were also menaced. Russia has never before had such a rude attitude towards the people of this land. "It is an illusion that somebody can win in this situation." Russia must pay for its presence here, and not raise prices for gasoline and energy, says Plugaru.
