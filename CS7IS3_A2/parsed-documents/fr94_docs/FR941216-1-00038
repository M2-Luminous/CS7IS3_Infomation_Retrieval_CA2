List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Proposed Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 1_INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 is amended by adding two entries in numerical order to read as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 *␣*␣* Section 1.483&hyph;4 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 483(f). *␣*␣* Section 1.1275&hyph;6 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1275(d). *␣*␣* Par. 2. Section 1.483&hyph;4 is added to read as follows: §1.483&hyph;4 Contingent payments. (a) In general. If a contract for the sale or exchange of property subject to section 483 (the overall contract) provides for one or more contingent payments, interest under the contract is generally computed and accounted for under rules similar to those that would be applicable if the contract were a debt instrument subject to §1.1275&hyph;4(c). Consequently, all noncontingent payments and quotable contingent payments (within the meaning of §1.1275&hyph;4(b)(4)(i)) under the overall contract are treated as if made under a separate contract, and interest accruals on this separate contract are computed under rules similar to those contained in §1.1275&hyph;4(c)(3). Each nonquotable contingent payment (within the meaning of §1.1275&hyph;4(b)(4)(ii)), if any, under the overall contract is characterized as principal and interest under rules similar to those contained in §1.1275&hyph;4(c)(4). However, any interest, or amount treated as interest, on a contract subject to this section is taken into account by a taxpayer under the taxpayer's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method or the cash receipts and disbursements method). (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
