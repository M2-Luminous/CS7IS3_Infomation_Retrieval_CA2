The threat of Japanese nuclear weapons development is being actualized, North Korean envoy to India Cha Pong-chu said in a keynote speech to the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). Tokyo currently possesses enough plutonium to make 6,500 nuclear weapons, Cha claimed, demanding that the Japanese Government announce to the world it will not go nuclear. If Japan did choose the nuclear option, the inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization would become meaningless, he said, reasoning that North Korea would then have to pursue its own nuclear program. Cha, a former vice foreign minister, said in an earlier interview with YONHAP News Agency that Pyongyang would decide whether to produce nuclear weapons after considering all external threats.
