To meet this target China has to bring down its average annual loss of farmland below 2.5 million mu in the remaining seven years of the century, according to a senior official with the State Land Administration. In an interview with XINHUA today the official said that China has seen a sharp reduction of cultivated land in recent years, due to the overheated boom in real estate development and economic zones. According to an estimate, China's cultivated land accounts for 13.2 percent of the country's total land area. The per capita land area under cultivation stands at 1.8 mu, or 41 percent of the world's average per capita figure. The official noted that China has had a net loss of four million mu of cultivated land annually since 1991. However, thanks to vigorous measures taken by the government, particularly after the nationwide delimitation of the protection areas for farmland in 1993 in line with the state's agriculture law, China has made headway in checking the loss of cultivated land. According to incomplete statistics, 27 of the mainland's 30 administrative divisions have started delimitation of protected areas under cultivation. In the pace-setting provinces of Zhejiang, Hubei and Hebei the farmland acreage under protection accounts for 96 percent, 60 percent and 62 percent, respectively, of their total cultivated land areas. Within the protection areas no encroachment of any kind is allowed except with special permission, said the official. As a result, random occupation and exploitation of cultivated land has been effectively curbed, he added.
