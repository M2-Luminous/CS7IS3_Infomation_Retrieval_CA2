The correspondent says that it is understood in Groznyy that disputes with Russia damage the republic's own interests. The correspondent goes on to note that the rupture of the old economic ties have already caused considerable decline in production and many enterprises are barely making ends meet. He adds that wages cannot be paid because cash is in short supply. Nor is the situation likely to change until accounts held in the Russian banks were unfrozen, he says, adding that in the meantime people are engaging in all kinds of commercial activities. He notes that there are many soldiers on the streets, because "considerable numbers" are dissatisfied with the present regime, as evidenced by the recent attempt on the life of Chechen President Dzokhar Dudayev. The report concludes with a brief interview with President Dudayev by the reporter. Asked what he personally expects from the talks with Moscow, if they take place, President Dudayev says: "We expect positive results. Any talks should be positive in spirit."
