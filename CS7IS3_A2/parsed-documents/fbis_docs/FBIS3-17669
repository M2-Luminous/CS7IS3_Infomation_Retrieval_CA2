[passage omitted] On March 26, several parties and public organizations reiterated that, in their opinion, the agreement undermines Latvia's security and sovereignty, and pressured President Guntis Ulmanis not to sign the document. The Saeima (parliament) should never ratify the agreement in the present edition, they said. The group includes the Latvian National Independence Movement, the Tevzeme (Fatherland) National Association and the Latvian Popular Front. The National Independence Movement (LNNK) urged Ulmanis not to confirm the draft because "the signature of these agreements would mean Latvia's enclosure into the sphere of Russian interests, endanger Latvian sovereignty and chances for the national survival." The initialed agreements contradict the CSCE and UN declarations on the complete and unconditional withdrawal of ex-Soviet troops, according to the statement. The accord on Skrunda was, in fact, reached by the presidents of the United States and Russia without consent of Latvian citizens. "Accepting the initialed agreements, Latvia actually fails to resolve issues connected with troop withdrawal" while "armed Russian servicemen may freely move in the Latvian territory, thus, posing a threat to the Baltic security," said the document. LNNK wants the Saeima (parliament) to first adopt a law on the status of aliens and stateless persons, foreign policy concept and an appeal to the United Nations on the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940. Letting occupation army officers stay here, Latvia voluntarily gives up its earlier claim for the recognition of its occupation. By doing so, Latvia also lifts the responsibility for Soviet-era damages of Russia, the party said. The Saeima should form a new negotiation team for talks with Russia to tackle withdrawal issues, repatriation of former Soviet colonists, return of the Abrene (now Pitalovo, Russia) district to Latvia and compensation for occupation damages. LNNK also wants to Saeima to accept its proposal for the organization of nationwide referendum on the functioning of the Skrunda radar after all Russian troops leave Latvia. The attitude of Latvian citizens toward granting social guarantees to retired Russian military persons would be another question at the referendum. If the Saeima rejects these demands, LNNK will propose extraordinary Saeima elections. Similar demands are included in a statement by Fatherland's congress. Association member, MP Roberts Milbergs described the document as "a document of despair" saying that the issue (of the ratification of Latvian-Russian accord) is actually determined. Popular Front's board member Juris Kokins told BNS that, if the international community recognized Latvia's occupation in 1940, Latvia could turn for help to international organizations. Fatherland plans to stage a rally March 29 at the Cabinet building to protest signature and ratification of the Latvian- Russian agreements. The Cabinet is scheduled to look through the initialed documents on the same day.
