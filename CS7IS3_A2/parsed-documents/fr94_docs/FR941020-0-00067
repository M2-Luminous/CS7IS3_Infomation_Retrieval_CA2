FR941020-0-00067 FR941020-0-00023 OSM revised 30 CFR 780.25(c)(3) as proposed by removing the reference to ``§77.216(a) of this title'' and the phrase ``located where failure would not be expected to cause loss of life or serious property damage,'' and by replacing it with a reference to §780.25(a)(2), where equivalent MSHA standards and the added SCS impoundment classification criteria are now located. This is consistent with changes described above. In 30 CFR 780.25(f), OSM is replacing, as proposed, the phrase, ``is 20 feet or higher or impounds more than 20 acre-feet,'' with the phrase, ``meets the SCS Class B or C criteria for dams in TR&hyph;60 or meets the MSHA size or other criteria of section 77.216(a) of this chapter.'' This revision has the same effect as the existing regulations and makes §780.25(f) consistent with the regulation changes referencing structure classification previously discussed. Sections 816.46/817.46␣Hydrologic Balance: Siltation Structures 30 CFR 816.46 of OSM's permanent program regulations establishes performance standards applicable to siltation structures. The proposed revisions to move the definitions of siltation structures and other treatment facilities at §816.46(a)(1) and (a)(3) to §701.5 are being implemented as proposed. This relocation of the definitions is an organizational change, the reason for which has been previously discussed. Also as proposed, in 30 CFR 816.46(c)(2), OSM removed the spillway design requirements at §816.46(c)(2)(i) through (iii) and replaced them with a reference to the requirements in newly designated §816.49(a)(9). The spillway design requirements in §816.49(a)(9) are the same as those in existing §816.46(c)(2)(i) through (iii). Therefore, for clarity and conciseness, OSM revised §816.46(c)(2) to reference §816.49(a)(9) and removed §816.46(c)(2)(i) through (iii) instead of duplicating the same design requirements in two places in the rules. One commenter was concerned that revisions to §816.46(c) would remove the authority to use storage based sedimentation ponds instead of ponds with spillways. OSM continues to allow the use of storage based sediment ponds. The authority to use these structures is found in §816.49(a)(9) which refers to §816.49(c)(2). Section 816.49/817.49␣Impoundments 30 CFR 816.49 of OSM's permanent program regulations establishes performance standards for impoundments. The revisions incorporate by reference the criteria in TR&hyph;60 and require impoundments meeting SCS Class B or C criteria in TR&hyph;60 to meet the same stability, spillway, foundation investigation, freeboard hydrograph, inspection, and examination requirements as impoundments meeting MSHA criteria in 30 CFR 77.216(a). The specific sections revised in 30 CFR 816.49 are summarized below. The rationale for these revisions as previously discussed is based on the August 30, 1990, decision in NWF v. Lujan and would achieve the necessary clarification. As proposed, OSM is adding a new section, 30 CFR 816.49(a)(1), which incorporates by reference the SCS guidance document TR&hyph;60 as it relates to minimum emergency spillway hydrologic criteria. This addition requires the redesignation of the existing sections in §816.49(a). Former sections (a)(1) through (a)(12) are therefore, redesignated as paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(13) respectively. A minor change from the proposal is the change in OSM's address for its Administrative Record which is now located at 800 North Capitol Street instead of the former location at 1100 L Street. One commenter objected to the cross-reference to TR&hyph;60 because it could lead to the implication that the document including standards are being incorporated. The commenter suggested OSM should repeat the pertinent classification criteria in the rules. OSM does not intend to imply or to require that all the standards in TR&hyph;60 will have to be met, except those for minimum emergency spillway hydrologic criteria. OSM is not repeating these criteria in the regulations because they are established by SCS through TR&hyph;60 and referencing that document will insure compatibility with the appropriate criteria. As proposed, existing 30 CFR 816.49(a)(3) is redesignated as §816.49(a)(4). Section 816.49(a)(4)(i) is added so that impoundments meeting the SCS Class B or C criteria for dams in TR&hyph;60 would be subject to the stability and margin of safety requirements of this section. OSM also removed the phrase, ``located where failure would be expected to cause loss of life or serious property damage'' because it is now redundant with the cited SCS reference. In redesignated 30 CFR 816.49(a)(4)(ii), OSM removed the reference to 30 CFR 77.216(a) and replaced it with a reference to §816.49(a)(4)(i). This clarifies which safety factors are related to specific types of impoundment classification. This is being issued as proposed. Existing 30 CFR 816.49(a)(4) is redesignated as §816.49(a)(5). OSM revised redesignated §816.49(a)(5) by specifying that impoundments meeting the SCS Class B or C criteria for dams in TR&hyph;60 shall comply with the freeboard hydrograph criteria in the ``Minimum Emergency Spillway Hydrologic Criteria'' table in TR&hyph;60, in order to be compatible with SCS requirements.
