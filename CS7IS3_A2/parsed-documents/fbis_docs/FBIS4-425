Linda Dewin put this question to the RPF representative in Brussels, James Ruego. [Ruego] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is 2 km from the capital. There is information of two battalions of 4,000 soldiers each. [Dewin] Why are you not attacking? [Ruego] Foreigners are still being evacuated, and the RPF promised that it would allow them to leave and to be evacuated. [Dewin] Is that not risky? Can the RPF continue waiting? [Ruego] We want the evacuation to be finished. I have heard, and this is very encouraging, that all foreigners might be gone from here within the next 24 hours.
