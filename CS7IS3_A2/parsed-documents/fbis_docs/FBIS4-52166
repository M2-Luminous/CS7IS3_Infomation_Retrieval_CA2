The two parties made the demand at a preparatory meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, claiming Hosokawa conceded that remarks he made before the Diet and the documents he presented concerning the loan included falsehood. The LDP and the JCP also requested that three other persons, including Hosokawa's Secretary Namio Yatsuka, be summoned to the committee as witnesses over Hosokawa's shady fund management. The 100 million yen Hosokawa borrowed from Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-ridden trucking company, in 1982 created a Diet stalemate which led to his resignation last month. Hosokawa admitted in a press conference when he announced his resignation that he received the interest on the loan as a political contribution, partly revising his previous account that he had fully repaid the loan with interest. In connection with the fund management problem, Hosokawa's secretary said last month that his private office had failed to report investment profits of 29 million yen to tax authorities. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, however, hinted at a press conference Monday [9 May] that the ruling coalition is not enthusiastic about summoning Hosokawa before the Diet. An executives' meeting of the upper house's budget committee later decided to summon financial consultant Shuzo Fujiki before the committee Wednesday as a witness in Hosokawa's alleged involvement in the 1986 purchase of shares in telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. The committee will formalize the decision in a meeting Tuesday. Hosokawa has denied he was personally involved in the transaction, saying the deal was conducted by his late father-in-aw, although he has admitted he provided collateral for a loan from a stock investment firm to finance the purchase. Opposition lawmakers claim Hosokawa used his position as a regional governor to secure the loan under favorable conditions. Fujiki has said at a press conference he arranged the loan for Hosokawa and that it was his own deal. The opposition camp apparently hopes Fujiki's testimony will force the ruling coalition to allow Hosokawa himself to be called before the committee and eventually force the former premier to resign as a member of the Diet.
