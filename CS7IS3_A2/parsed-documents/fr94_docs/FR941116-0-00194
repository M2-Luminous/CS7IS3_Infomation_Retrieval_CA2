FR941116-0-00194 FR941116-0-00023 The minimum figure for prior Committee approval of purchase exceptions granted by central nonprofit agencies in §51&hyph;5.4 has been raised from $25,000 to the simplified acquisition threshold established by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, currently $100,000. Sections 51&hyph;5.5 and 51&hyph;5.6 on prices and shipping of commodities have been amended to allow for pricing and delivery on an FOB destination basis, consistent with recent developments in Government ordering procedures, as well as the Committee's traditional FOB origin practice. Section 51&hyph;6.2 has been amended in paragraph (f) to correct an undetected typographical error in the 1991 amendments. Section 51&hyph;6.8 on deletions from the Procurement List has been amended by adding a paragraph making it clear that the Committee can delete a commodity or service from the Procurement List without a request from a central nonprofit agency. A new paragraph has been added to §51&hyph;6.12 on specification changes to indicate that nonprofit agencies are to recommend changes that will improve the commodity or service being provided, reduce costs, or improve overall value to the Government. The paragraph also requires contracting activities to respond promptly to the recommendations. Section 51&hyph;6.13 has been amended to clarify its language and to indicate that other colors, sizes, or variations of commodities on the Procurement List which have not been recently procured are considered to be on the Procurement List as well. Section 51&hyph;8.3, consisting of definitions applicable only to part 51&hyph;8 on Committee actions under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), has been amended by removing the definition of the Committee, which also appears in the general definitions for the Committee's regulations at §51&hyph;1.3, and by changing the title ``Chairman'' to ``Chairperson'' as the title of the Committee's presiding officer. The same change to ``Chairperson'' has also been made in §§51&hyph;8.7, 51&hyph;8.10, 51&hyph;8.11 and 51&hyph;9.405. Changes have been made to §§51&hyph;8.1 and 51&hyph;8.4 and to paragraph (a) of §51&hyph;8.5 to make clear the distinction between material which the Committee is required to make available for public inspection and material which the Committee provides in response to a FOIA request. The provision in §51&hyph;8.14 for a minimum amount for FOIA processing costs below which no fee will be charged has been qualified to indicate that the minimum will apply to each Committee response to a FOIA request where it is necessary to make more than one response to a request. The Committee bills FOIA requesters separately for each response, which requires a decision each time as to whether the cost of collection would exceed the amount billed.
