It had been stored in a building leased by the army to the Klinlab limited company. Then, at the beginning of March, under similar conditions, army experts destroyed yet another "common" batch of viral strains stored in the Military Research Institute in Techonin. The defense minister, the Chief of the General Staff Nekvasil, and other military top brass have described the two banks as common batches that had nothing to do with the development of biological weapons. Although, according to the claims made by the gentlemen from the Defense Ministry and the General Staff, the two viral banks were stored safely and there was no risk of a leak or a potential threat to the population from the stored viruses, the subsequent conduct by the ministerial and military top brass is tantamount to the contrary. The Stresovice bank of viruses was stored in a so-called nitrogen chamber. It is located in the second basement of the building belonging to the Klinlab company. A bank of tissue cultures was also deposited there alongside the "harmless and safely stored" viral bank. Tissue cultures are cellular lines intended for the reproduction of viruses in a living organism. The location in question was locked and only a limited number of staff from the Central Military Health Institute had access to the keys. The viruses and the tissue cultures were stored in containers full of liquid nitrogen, which has to be topped up once a week. Last August, one of the containers -- by coincidence, the one with the bank of tissue cultures -- was left open. All the nitrogen had evaporated and so the tissue cultures were destroyed. Of course, it takes more than a few minutes or hours for nitrogen to evaporate. According to the experts, it takes 5-7 days for this. Throughout this entire period, however, no one went into the nitrogen chamber or, if someone did, then he did not secure the container, despite the fact that it would have been impossible to overlook the unfastened lid and the escaping vapors. So, the batches of tissue cultures were destroyed. By the way, they were the largest in the Czech Republic and their procreation took 30 years, which is another matter. An investigation was initiated and conducted by the police in Prague 6. The culprit was not found. There are more variations. These include a -- relatively unlikely -- accident or oversight and -- more likely -- deliberate sabotage. In this event, another two possibilities can be taken into consideration: First, that the culprit or culprits intended to destroy what was actually destroyed, that is, the bank of tissue cultures. But why? Simply to make sure they do not exist? The second possibility is that this was a mistake and the other container with the viral bank should have been left open. In this case, dangerous viruses would have escaped into the surrounding environment and not only the patients and staff in the Central Military Hospital would have been placed under a direct risk. This could have been called, without exaggeration, a catastrophe. Understandably, there is also the possibility that someone wanted to remove, and perhaps even did remove, something from either of the banks. It is not difficult to guess for what purpose. One can only speculate about which country is supposed, for example, to have its source of drinking water infected. It just remains for me to add that, if the lid had stayed shut, then -- it goes without saying -- that no one would have had any idea that some unknown person had been in the nitrogen chamber. It is impossible to say whether he had visited it for the first time. So, this was the situation with the -- according to the defense minister -- "safely stored harmless and common viruses that were not intended for use as biological weapons." During their news conference, the defense minister and his retinue declared that nothing had in fact happened and that biological weapons have never been developed or stored in our country. The two rapidly -- and under extraordinary security measures -- destroyed viral banks were, according to them, common batches. Of course, they did not say a word about what happened in Stresovice last August. It would probably be difficult for them to say that there is no risk and that there was not a risk. It would also be difficult for them to say that everything is in order in the army and that biological weapons were never developed in it. It would be difficult for Deputy Minister Kalousek to talk nonsense and claim that the army will save 50 million by transferring some of the activity carried out hitherto by the Central Military Health Institute to the Klinlab limited company. And so on and so on.
