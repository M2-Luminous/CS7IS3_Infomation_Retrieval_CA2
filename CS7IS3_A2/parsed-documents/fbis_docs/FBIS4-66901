Although Russia needs the planes it will not pay such a price for them. "If Ukraine does not agree to our terms the planes will remain on its territory," Liutenant-General Yuriy Merkulov from the Defence Ministry told TASS. Military experts told TASS on Tuesday that Russia needs the bombers as they are not liable to reduction under the START I Treaty. They will be decommissioned only after their service time expires. At present the Russian Air Force has 77 heavy bombers and it is hard to build new ones because of financial difficulties. No changes are planned by the Defence Ministry regarding the number of bombers. Defence Ministry sources also told TASS that Russian estimates were made in 1993 prices and took into account ammortization costs, but Ukraine objected to such an approach. At the same time Kiev has no money and technical possibilities to maintain the bombers in proper order by itself.
