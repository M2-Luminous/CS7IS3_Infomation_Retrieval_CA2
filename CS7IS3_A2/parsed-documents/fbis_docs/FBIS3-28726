His statement has raised controversy within the government. The Foreign Ministry has asked the U.S. Government to correct Mr. Kantor's statement, claiming, "The foreign minister never made a statement to that effect." The U.S. Government, which is pinning high hopes on the Japan-U.S. foreign ministerial talks to he held shortly before the Japan-U.S. summit talks slated for 11 February, has yet to answer the request. The interpretation of Mr. Kantor's statement is that Foreign Minister Hata has assumed the position of Japan's top negotiator responsible for the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. A source familiar with the talks, who attended two rounds of meetings between Mr. Kantor and Foreign Minister Hata, said the foreign minister made no remark to that effect. On 7 February, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito shook his head, saying, "Since (Mr. Hata) is foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Mr.Kantor probably thought Mr. Hata would assume overall responsibility for the talks." He also flatly denied Mr. Kantor's statement, saying, "It is not proper for Mr. Hata to assume the overall responsibility for the talks." It has been agreed that vice ministerial officials from the two countries would hold the talks. Agreements reached by both sides will be compiled in a report for presentation at the Japan-U.S. summit talks, but no ministerial talks are scheduled. At first, the Japanese Government was annoyed by Mr. Kantor's visit to Japan, but it treated him as a special envoy to the U.S. President. It is unclear why Mr. Kantor made the statement, but he is believed to have made the statement with the aim of bringing a hasty political settlement to the talks by drawing Prime Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata out to ministerial talks if vice ministerial negotiations fail to hammer out any agreements. At first, the Foreign Ministry tried to ignore Mr. Kantor's statement as "publicity for back home." But it later decided to ask the U.S. Government for a correction, fearing that controversy might spread within the government. The United States has pressed Japan for concessions in the automobile negotiations, which have continued to face rough sailing. Vice Foreign Minister Saito stressed that the automobile issue is out of our ministry's jurisdiction, saying, "How to deal with the automobile issue is primarily up to the international trade and industry minister." It seems that the real intention of the Japanese side is that: "It does not want to break a good relationship among the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry." Did Mr. Kantor's feint operation not work in the face of the bureaucratic barrier of the three ministries that remain more cohesive than at any time in the past?
