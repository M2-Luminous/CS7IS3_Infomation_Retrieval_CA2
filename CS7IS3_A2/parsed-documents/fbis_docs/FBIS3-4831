Jean Marie Leye was sworn in today as the country's third president after two previous attempts to elect a national leader failed. South Pacific correspondent Erina Reddan reports one opposition group crossed the floor to support the government's candidate, paving the way for a future coalition between the two groups. [Begin Reddan recording] In the third attempt to elect a president, the political deadlock was broken when one opposition group, the Vanuaaku Pati [VP], voted with the government to achieve the required two-thirds majority. Leader of the VP and of the opposition, Donald Kalpokas, is confident that within a few days his party will have formally joined the government. The VP's nine seats in Parliament will bolster Prime Minister Maxine Carlot Korman's slim majority. President Leye, 61 years old, formerly the vice president of the ruling Union of Moderate Parties, was elected with 41 votes. Five went to Father John Bani, and nine were spoiled or left blank. After being sworn in, the president said today's consensus was only the start of greater harmony and unity in Vanuatu. [end recording]
