Turkmen-Russian Agreements on Dual Citizenship and the Protection of Migrants' Rights Could Become a Model for Other CIS Member Countries"] [Text] Ashgabat -- Actually, even before, it was not necessary to flee from Turkmenistan: The problem widely termed "the problem of the Russian-speaking population in nearby foreign countries" in several of the former Union republics did not exist here. "But," Turkmen President S. Niyazov stressed in an interview with IZVESTIYA, "it would be arrantly superficial not to see or understand that, for many reasons, the growth of national self-consciousness is everywhere, including in our country, accompanied by negative tendencies..." These "tendencies" are most commonly encountered at a mundane level. But now, the Turkmen government assures me, following the high-level signing of agreements "On the Regulation of Questions of Dual Citizenship" and "On the Regulation of the Process of Resettlement and the Protection of the Rights of Migrants," the situation around Russians could radically change for the better, and people will feel completely at ease. "Each side" -- I am reading from the text of the first document -- "recognizes its citizens' right to acquire the citizenship of the other country without losing the citizenship of their own...." "A person who is a citizen of both countries fully enjoys the rights and freedoms, and also carries the obligations, of the country on whose territory he resides permanently..." And this means that whether you are Turkmen or Russian, Uzbek or Armenian, no one will now prohibit you, if you currently live in Turkmenistan, from obtaining a Russian passport. And the same goes for those who, living in Russia, want to acquire Turkmen citizenship: Just go to the Turkmen Embassy in Moscow and get the green passport that denotes citizenship of Turkmenistan. And, praise God, we already have an example of this -- Boris Yeltsin was the first citizen of Russia, by acquiring Turkmen citizenship, to receive such a document.... Migrants are another aspect of the question. "Well, if you have made up your mind to go, at least do it in a civilized manner," Russian Ambassador to Turkmenistan Vadim Cherepov says. "First register as a migrant, and then both sides are obliged to assist you in privatizing and selling your house, conveying all your domestic property to your new place of residence in Russia, and transferring funds..." Excluding all forms of discrimination against migrants on political, socioeconomic, ethnic, or religious grounds, the agreement on the protection of migrants' rights especially stresses: "Migrants and their families have the right to convey from the state they are leaving all movables in their possession, with the exception of items that are prohibited under the laws of that state. They can sell, bestow, exchange, bequeath at their discretion, or otherwise dispose of property in their possession...." Few people are aware how difficult it was for officials of the Russian Embassy in Turkmenistan and the Russian Federal Migration Service to uphold these lines, without which the whole document would not be worth a dime. Well, judge for yourself how much protection migrants would have if they were forbidden not only to sell their privatized apartments in Turkmenistan -- selling, exchanging, or bestowing them was forbidden by presidential edict -- but even, given the harsh rules restricting the exportation of objects and valuables, to take with them to Russia the household chattels they had scraped together here. "When we discussed this question with the various authorities," Vadim Cherepov recalls, "I constantly had to remind our interlocutors: `Hundreds, even thousands of Turkmens are privatizing their apartments in Moscow; moreover, many of these apartments are in the capital's best apartment blocks. If they have to, they later sell them, asking from 50 to 100 million rubles for them. No one objects to this or forbids them to take their money to Turkmenistan. So what is worse about Russians wanting to sell their homes in Ashgabat, Krasnovodsk, or other Turkmen cities in order to go to Russia and buy apartments there with the money. Come, I said, let us resolve this problem at a bilateral level...'" Much, I repeat, has been resolved. Even, it would appear, such trivial points as the following: "The sides guarantee migrants and their families freedom from all restrictions on importing or exporting their personal property, and also from customs duties, taxes, and levies associated with this process. Monetary funds and transferred monetary deposits are exempted from levies..."
