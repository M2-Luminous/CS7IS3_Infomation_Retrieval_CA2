CSJM Judge of Inquiry Marco Rodriguez Huerta delivered his report accusing the 18 officers to War Hall Auditor Luis Delgado, so that he might request that the prosecutor formally ask for a jury trial against these individuals. The 18 officers have been accused of allowing the embezzlement to take place, systematically and over a period of a number of years, at the offices of the Peruvian attache in Washington. The crime was discovered in November 1992. Up until now it was believed that only 11 officers were involved in the case. The main culprit in the case, Enrique Villagarcia, an old administrator in the attache's office, was condemned to eight years' imprisonment in the United States in June of last year for violating laws forbidding the use of illegal funds in U.S. financial institutions. Villagarcia confessed to that country's judiciary that he spent most of the money on cocaine, race horses, and prostitutes. Among the officers involved in the case are a vice admiral and four rear admirals who occupied positions in the Navy Economy Directorate and who were Navy attaches in the United States. The case was denounced by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who said that Villagarcia justified the use of the money with forged deposit certificates, drafted with the complicity of American Security Bank and Potomac Valley Bank employees.
