Theoretically, it is predicted that this future-type semiconductor laser will make ultra-low current oscillation possible. This laser is different from the conventional element which consists of layers of ultra-thin semiconductor film. The new structure lines up minute semiconductor particles that are 30 nanometers in size. With this structure, the electrons can be used for radiation without waste. Right now it is necessary to supply a large current under an ultra-low temperature condition and the laser is not at the point where its full potential can be realized. However, it can be expected in the future that the performance level can be raised if the manufacturing technology is improved. Minute semiconductor particles are lined up. The experimental laser consists of a plane surface indium-gallium-arsenide film with many particle forms of gallium-indium-arsenide lined up in a grid pattern and embedded in it. This film itself is sandwiched between indium-phosphorus films. The diameter of a single particle is 30 nanometers, the thickness is 12 nanometers, and the space between adjoining particles is 70 nanometers. These kinds of semiconductor particles are called ``quantum boxes'' since the electrons are confined in these particles one by one just as if they are in boxes. The conventional semiconductor laser is a thin film with electrons held in it. The electrons can be trapped in a much smaller space when this is chopped up into boxes and it is predicted that the radiation efficiency will be exceptionally advanced. For this reason, in comparison with semiconductor lasers actually in use at the present time, it is possible that these lasers will be able to oscillate with only several tenths or less of the current. Since the current consumption is small, the result is that heat generation and such will not be a problem even if a number of them are grouped together and it is expected that the laser will be useful in the development of optical communications and optical computers. In experiments with the experimental laser at 196 degrees below zero Celsius, light pulses were oscillated at about 1.3 microns. It was also confirmed that the quantum box confined the electrons well. However, the current necessary for oscillation is 1.1 amperes, which, when compared with the current required by a conventional semiconductor laser, is rather larger.
