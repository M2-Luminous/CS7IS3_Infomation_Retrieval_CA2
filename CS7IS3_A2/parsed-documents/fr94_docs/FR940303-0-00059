FR940303-0-00059 FR940303-0-00018 48 CFR Part 1815 Applicability of NASA Formal Source Evaluation Board (SEB) Procedures AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NASA has amended the NASA FAR Supplement part 1815 to make editorial corrections and administrative changes to clarify when formal SEB procedures are to be used. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tom O'Toole, NASA Headquarters, Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division (Code HP), Washington, DC 20546. Telephone: (202) 358&hyph;0478. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background NASA formal SEB procedures apply to all competitive negotiated procurements of $25 million or more, except for specific categories of procurements (e.g., NASA Research Announcements) that require their own unique procedures. For actions under $25 million, the formal procedures are optional. Existing agency regulations on this issue are not clear, and the NASA FAR Supplement is revised to clarify the applicability of formal SEB procedures. These revisions affect internal procedures only and have no direct impact on external entities. The revisions are issued as a final rule to ensure immediate implementation. Availability of NASA FAR Supplement The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this proposed coverage will become a part, is codified in 48 CFR, chapter 18, and is available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. Cite GPO Subscription Stock Number 933&hyph;003&hyph;00000&hyph;1. It is not distributed to the public, either in whole or in part, directly by NASA. Impact NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. et seq. ). This rule does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 1815 Government procurement.
