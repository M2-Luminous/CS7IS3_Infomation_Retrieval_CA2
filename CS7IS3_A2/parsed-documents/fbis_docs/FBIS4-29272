FBIS4-29272 "dreas116_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 South Korea DLP Demand on Denuclearization Analyzed DLP Demand on Denuclearization Analyzed SK1606062394 Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean 16 Jun 94 p 4 SK1606062394 Seoul CHOSON ILBO Korean BFN [Article by Kim Min-pae: "Why Does the Democratic Liberal Party Call For Reconsideration of the Denuclearization Declaration on the Korean Peninsula?"] [Text] In a statement released during a meeting of its lawmakers and district chapter chairmen on 15 June, the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] demanded that "the government reconsider the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula." This attracts the people's attention. The DLP, as a ruling party, has called upon the government to reconsider the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula "only if it is not observed." It is very significant, because the DLP, of the same family of the government, has urged it to reconsider the declaration and to independently formulate steps to deal with it. This is not the first time the DLP has made such remarks. Figures -- who believed that to play the game with Kim Il-song, an atmosphere for negotiations will never be created if North Korea is not cornered -- have demanded that the North-South denuclearization declaration be reconsidered. During a parliamentary inquiry in the meeting of National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yi Se-ki, chairman of the party Policy Committee, and lawmakers Hwang Myong-su and Pak Chong-su have also called for its reconsideration. Many lawmakers seem to have the same feeling as the above-mentioned lawmakers. The reconsideration of the denuclearization declaration means the revision of "the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula" agreed upon by the North and South during talks in Panmunjom on 31 December 1991. We have observed this agreement, while North Korea has ignored it by maintaining a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon and extracting plutonium from there. They ask: How can South Korea abide by it under these circumstances? North Korea consistently moves forward with its nuclear development program, while the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula has only fettered our nuclear sovereignty [haekchugwon]. They said, therefore, that its reconsideration is indispensable. The government's official position regarding this is that "the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula must be maintained." During a parliamentary inquiry last year, Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung hinted at the possibility of its reconsideration. He was criticized by people after he made such remarks and, thereby, retracted them. If the government officially decides on its position regarding the need for its reconsideration, it will face difficulties in urging North Korea to abandon its nuclear development program, as well as to accept nuclear inspections. Also, big problems can be created in relations with the United States, which has pursued the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula. Then, why does the DLP call for it? The figures who have called for its reconsideration said: "This is because we can effectively use the card, the reconsideration of the denuclearization declaration, to exert more pressure against North Korea in dealing with Kim Il-song." In other words, this is another card to induce North Korea to the negotiations table. Along with this, the DLP demand includes a message to the United States.
