This ruling was made today by the court of the Supreme Court Military Board, which is in charge of the case of the State Committee for the State of Emergency [SCSE]. Lukyanov's lawyer, Genrikh Padva, applied for the criminal proceedings against his client and Vasiliy Starodubtsev to be discontinued pending the adoption of the law on the status of deputies. In the court's opinion, the adoption of the law will not free the defendants from criminal liability. Nor does the Russian Constitution, adopted at the 12 December referendum, free the SCSE trial defendants from liability, the court believes. INTERFAX reports that the trial is to be resumed at 0900 on 13 January.
