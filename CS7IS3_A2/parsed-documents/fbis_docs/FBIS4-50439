Xiang Zhongde, chairman of the China Statistics Information Consultancy Service Centre (CSICSC), said the bureau planned to launch the joint ventures in the United States, Britain and Hong Kong. He added that the CSICSC was already involved in discussions with potential partners. Mr Xiang said the joint ventures would improve the bureau's ability to provide information on China to foreign investors who, he added, would no longer have to make the long journey to get such information first hand. He said he expected the joint ventures to be operative within a year. The CSICSC was formed in late 1992 as the bureau's Hong Kong vehicle, underscoring China's efforts in facilitating a flow of information among the foreign investors who have joined the headlong rush to invest in the mainland. The bureau has similar offices in 30 mainland cities. Mr Xiang said Beijing was losing control over the dissemination of information as the economy of the country rapidly developed and opened. He said more than 80 percent of official statistics and information was now freely available to the public. As an example, he said information was now available on foreign exchange rates and gold reserves. Such information was previously not disclosed. "Gradually, China will provide the general public with more statistics and figures complied by the country," Mr Xiang said. He said the bureau also planned to set up a database for professional use which would be available to both government departments and the public. Mr Xiang said that in addition to regular large-scale population censuses and surveys of the industrial and commercial sectors and tertiary industry, the bureau also conducted sample surveys on small enterprises to cater for the changing economic environment. He said there had been a change in companies' operating mechanisms after sweeping reforms in enterprise. This, he said, had led to a proliferation of joint ventures, collectively-owned enterprises and private concerns. Mr Xiang said the CSICSC would conduct research on specific industries in line with customers' requests. To improve dissemination of information on China, the bureau will also launch a bilingual annual statistics digest in the second half of this year. This will replace the existing series with Chinese and English versions.
