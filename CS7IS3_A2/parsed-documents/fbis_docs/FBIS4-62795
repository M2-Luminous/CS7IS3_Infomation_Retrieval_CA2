Thus, to date, compared with the 1993 level, 45 percent of the foodstuffs, consumer goods, and petroleum products have been shipped in and just 8 percent of the contracts concluded for technical industrial output. As of 1 May, 765,000 tonnes of freight had accumulated in sea and river ports, although by May last year this figure had reached 2 million tonnes. There is virtually no freight in Far Eastern ports that is earmarked for delivery to the North. The dramatic nature of the situation is indicated, for example, by the fact that goods are brought into a number of internal regions of the northern territories along rivers on which navigation begins in May and continues for several weeks. At the same time it should not be forgotten that many of the northerners' needs are met in full by means of deliveries. Whereas in the eighties they were funded through the credit system, this is impossible now. Resolving the problem, the government has adopted a decree altering the mechanism of state financial support and shipping of output and goods into northern regions. The Federal Fund for State Funding of Shipping of Products and Commodities is being created as a result of this. It is being formed out of state budget funds, which will essentially be the North's annually indexed working capital. A special operational commission is being set up, which should, in my view, be endowed with extraordinary powers. We frequently say that Russia will grow by means of the North, but the inhabitants must be given active assistance now, so that they do not again encounter the dramatic situation in which they found themselves last winter.
