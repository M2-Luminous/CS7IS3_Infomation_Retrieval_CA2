The ruling Democratic Liberal Party said it was inconsiderate of outgoing Prime Minister Yi to resign without wisely striding over a mountain of important state affairs. "We regret it that Prime Minister Yi, whom we expected to wisely surmount many important state affairs, tendered resignation all of a sudden," party spokesman Ha Sun-pong said. "We believe Prime Minister-designate Yi Yong-tok, with his high virtues and rich experiences, would wisely overcome today's difficulties to make the people feel easier." The opposition Democratic Party said the party regrets Prime Minister Yi's resignation which it said was caused by "reckless checks" by those in power. "The people expected much from Prime Minister Yi. But, he couldn't unfold his policy and had to step down due to reckless checks," party spokesman Pak Chi-won said. "We fear if Yi Yong-tok's appointment as prime minister won't turn the administration more conservative," he said. The United People's Party said the party was shocked at Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang having resigned for the reason that he couldn't fulfill the duty given him under the Constitution.
