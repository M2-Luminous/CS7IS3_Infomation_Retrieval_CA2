The members of the union drew attention to the urgent necessity to increase efforts to combat crime also because, in their view, a large proportion of the population come to view entrepereneurs -- the main taxpayers -- as a mafia-like corrupt set. "Democracy means a strong authority, not anarchy". The entrepreneurs want to see a realistic transition from intentions to carry on reforms to specific actions, the statement emphasised.
