Its structure is simple. Since it can easily be made only some ten microns in size, it appears that it can be used as medical micromachines, for example, micro-pumps or micro-robots. Until recently high polymer actuator development tested only the use of swelling high polymer gel, but that had the drawback of slow response time. Moreover, it was difficult to use in a living body because high voltage was needed to drive it with a signal and hydrogen gas would be given off by electrolysis in bodily fluids. In 1992 GIRIO chemically plated silver onto fluorine resin ion exchange film and ascertained that when electricity was sent along a lead line attached to both sides of the film, the film was driven by low voltage. Later research on its functions confirmed it: it was several tens of microns small, it moved on low voltage, there were no emissions of gas due to electrolysis, it moved freely at low to high speeds, varying with frequency of 1-100 Hz, and it showed responsiveness similar to living muscle. Its endurance was confirmed in experiments which showed stable behavior for more than two months, including usage more than 5 million times. Revolution and bending should be possible using these functions. If it can be made to move like a fin it can be used as a micro-pump inside the body or as the propeller for a micro-robot swimming through bodily fluids. "It can probably be used soon for opening or closing valves or as a micro-valve or artificial pancreas-type liquid drug release control," said Keisuke Oguro, chief of GIRIO's energy and environmental materials division. The movement of the actuator is influenced by ions in the solution and type of electrode metal, so it is possible to design actuators that have different movement functions by altering these conditions.
