The Iranian delegation enjoyed a warm welcome during their visit on June 13-15, and the Turkish press reflected the mutual understanding between the two countries. Newspapers and television channels gave wide coverage of the visit by the Iranian delegation, and there was no mention of the fact that the delegation has not visited the [Ataturk] Mausoleum, a source of tension and dispute between the two countries. Iran impressed the Turkish public with its stance regarding terrorism, particularly the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK). The anti-PKK statements made by Iranian officials, coupled with the fact that they had handed over a number of terrorists, made a favorable impression on Turkish officials. This visit laid a solid foundation for President Suleyman Demirel's visit to Iran, which will take place on July 25, a Turkish official told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN]. "Iranians were very positive regarding our concerns about PKK activities in the Turco-Iranian border region. They reassured us that they would never condone terrorist activities that targeted Turkey. They proved this by handing over to us scores of PKK members who had been caught on their soil. Turkey and Iran also shared similar views on regional issues. Both sides want to improve their mutual relations," one of official said. Meanwhile, Turkey has reacted to Iran's concerns on terrorism in a similar manner. Asked if Turkey would turn over to Tehran members of the Iranian opposition Mojahedin-e Khalq Party detained in Turkey, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said: "We will not allow any anti-Iranian activity on Turkish soil. We will not shelter anyone who can harm Iran." One Iranian official told TDN that they were delighted with Turkey's response. "They assured us that they would prevent anti- Iranian activities in Turkey. Time will tell whether these guarantees hold true, but we trust in the words of the Turkish officials," he noted. Mentese announced that Iran and Turkey would struggle against terrorism together. "Our agreement covers issues other than the PKK," Mentese concluded. Besharati stressed that positive and constructive contacts had been made during his visit. "We have no dispute with Turkey," he said. "Our borders are closed to Turkey's enemies. There are no members of the subversive and separatist PKK on Iranian soil. Turkey does not have a closer or more sincere friend in the region than Iran." As the Iranian delegation left Turkey for Tehran on Monday [13 June] morning, Besharati aid: "Turkey and Iran should follow a common policy regarding Northern Iraq. We informed Turkish officials about our stance and strategy on this issue. During our meetings with Turkish officials, we said that Iran supported the territorial integrity of Iraq and was opposed to the establishment of a Kurdish state in the region." The Problem of Northern Iraq Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ataman said that the terrorist organization has benefited from the instability in Northern Iraq. "The Kurdistan Democracy Party (KDP) leader Mas'ud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani held a meeting in Silopi on June 13... During the meeting we informed them of Turkey's stance and on the country's views on the latest developments in the region," Ataman noted. He said that Kurdish leaders were aware of the fact that Turkey considered a renewal of the elections in Northern Iraq unnecessary. Pointing out that the way to stability in Northern Iraq should be sought for in Iraq, Ataman concluded: "This attitude was also expressed by the communiques published after the meeting of Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and that of Turkey, the United States, France and Britain. A dialogue should be created between Baghdad and Northern Iraq."
