Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the call in a speech to Swedish entrepreneurs and businessmen. According to Li, the two-way trade between China and Western Europe topped 29.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. By June 1993, China had 2,146 projects using West European funds, with 5.7 billion U.S. dollars pledged and 2.25 billion dollars utilized. However, Li said, "Western Europe's shares of China's commodity and investment markets are not commensurate with its real strength." He added that China is a huge market and its economy is growing at a pace rarely seen in the world. Therefore, he said, "We hope that West European governments and business communities will not miss the opportunity to boost their share of the China market." The CPPCC leader said China will accelerate the improvement of its investment environment, including the legal framework concerning foreign businesses, with a view to effectively protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. Li expressed the hope that Western Europe will open its market wider to China in an effort to seek a mutually beneficial cooperation. On Sino-Swedish relationship, Li said, "There is a great potential for our economic cooperation and scientific, technological and cultural exchanges." Trade between the two countries reached 900 million dollars in 1993, marking a 43.7-percent increase over the previous year. According to Li, Swedish investment in China has also made remarkable progress. Swedish firms like Ericsson, Atras Copco and Volvo have built up a reputation in China. Products of Sino-Swedish Pharmaceuticals Corp. and Kanthel Ltd. are selling well. Li arrived in Sweden on Friday for a five-day official visit.
