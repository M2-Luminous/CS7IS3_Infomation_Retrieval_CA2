The press service said that "Abkhazian and North Caucasian units continue to terrorize" civilians in the Gali and other districts of Abkhazia and carry out brazen raids on villages along the Inguri River. Earlier today, the Abkhazian Defence Ministry accused Georgian military commanders of making preparations for a new aggression. The Ministry said in a statement that between February 24 and March 6 Georgian military commanders had moved paramilitary Mkhedrioni and White Eagle units and military hardware from central Georgia to the Zugdidi district. Meanwhile, Georgian secret services continue sending out saboteurs and terrorists to Abkhazia. Abkhazia will take all necessary measures to give an adequate response to these activities. All responsibility for their possible consequences will rest with the Georgian side, the statement said.
