[Soares] We must do both at the same time. [LE FIGARO] Would not such change be too much of a shock for newcomers? [Soares] Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland want to join the Union. Their motives are mostly economic. But we need to explain to them that enlargement without a renewed political structure is not a viable proposition. One of these days, Europe will fall apart unless it has a political structure and a real European constitution. We need European parties, European trade unions, etc. [LE FIGARO] After taking in such countries, will it be necessary to rebalance the Union to the south, for instance by having Malta or Cyprus join in? [Soares] Yes, I believe it is necessary. We shall also need to readjust eastward. [LE FIGARO] Do you believe that Europe is taking too long in opening its doors to new Eastern democracies? [Soares] Yes, without any doubt. I believe Europe has not proved bold enough, that its response to the perspectives that have opened has been completely inadequate. The Europe we built was one based on the divide between two blocs. Now that blocs have vanished, we cannot keep looking at Europe in the same light as before. [LE FIGARO] How do you view Europe's attitude with respect to the Bosnian conflict? [Soares] Europe has not progressed as far as external policy and defense are concerned. Institutionally, Europe has made no headway either. Bosnia is a good reason for us to speed up the construction of a real European political structure. [LE FIGARO] Is not the Maastricht crisis behind us, now? [Soares] Things have improved, no doubt about it. But everything remains to be done. One major problem is the fact that since Europe's inception, the driving force has been the Franco-German axis. What will become of this axis in the future? That is the question. There is no certainty that all difficulties have been overcome. [LE FIGARO] What are you worried about? [Soares] What will come out of the election in Germany? Chancellor Kohl has taken a major part in the European construction; he has always been strongly pro-European. He is a German of the West. We do not know whether his successors will share his European ideal. [LE FIGARO] Doesn't Europe need a charismatic figure? [Soares] Yes, I think so. You know, for years, all Europeans have tended to look at Mitterrand as the man who embodied this determination to build Europe. But Mitterrand is now reaching the end of his term.... [LE FIGARO] Among Europe's other potentially troublesome neighbors are also North African countries, and especially Algeria. What turn do you expect things will take in Algeria? [Soares] I do not see any short-term solution. [LE FIGARO] Do you believe a military dictatorship can work toward the reestablishment of a civilian government in a few years' time? [Soares] This can only be a temporary solution. [LE FIGARO] There is the example of Turkey.... [Soares] Turkey remains a problematic country, but true, things have not gone too awry there. [LE FIGARO] Is Islam the West's new enemy, now that communism is dead? [Soares] There are exponents of Islam with whom it is possible to talk. One cannot be satisfied with a simplistic vision of the problem; no attitude could be worse. There are positive forces within Islam. We must encourage and help them. One must never lose sight of the economic and social context in which Islam thrives. This is what fuels religious fundamentalism. [LE FIGARO] Even in Saudi Arabia? [Soares] We should not let Saudi Arabia remain the way it is, we should not let the people of Islam revert to archaic models. [LE FIGARO] And still we do nothing about it.... [Soares] The West does nothing about it; that is the West's mistake. If one wants to foster democracy, one cannot tolerate dictators. This is the contradiction at the core of the United States' policies, as well as Europe's, to a lesser extent. Take East Timor, which was annexed illegally by Indonesia after the 1975 military invasion. We have been exerting pressure on the United Nations so that this island's right to self-determination may be recognized. This is a just cause. And yet, when we ask France or other European countries for help, we are faced with a wall of silence. Of course, Indonesia is a powerful country that purchases European goods. So we conveniently forget that it is a dictatorship. [LE FIGARO] Is not your position somewhat inconsistent? On the one hand you advocate dialogue with Algeria's fundamentalists, and on the other you believe that we should interfere with Indonesia or Saudi Arabia's affairs -- hard-line regimes, to be sure, but without a civil war. [Soares] No, they do not have a civil war, they are dictatorships. One must call a spade a spade -- and dictatorships are dictatorships. And one must not respect those as though they actually represent a people. I am quite sensitive to these things because I fought dictatorship in Portugal. And the Western world -- including England, the United States, and France -- used to consider that the Portuguese and Spanish dictators were acceptable because they were anticommunist. I believe there is no excuse for such an attitude if one wants to have a global human rights policy. [LE FIGARO] After the Gulf war, there were aspirations to a new world order. Today, the dream has collapsed, has it not? [Soares] It will re-emerge, it is inevitable. Because humankind's major problems know no border. Only a global policy will solve problems such as environment degradation or starvation. This is why we are necessarily headed for a global legal order, headed by a reformed United Nations organization. Living in a world where two-thirds of the population are starving is an untenable proposition. [LE FIGARO] You know Africa well. Is it a lost continent? [Soares] No. Africa is a continent that has gone adrift, but it is not lost. We have no overall policy with respect to this continent. [LE FIGARO] Which is Africa's key country? [Soares] As far as Sub-Saharan Africa is concerned, this is undoubtedly South Africa. If peaceful elections can be held there, then I think settlements can be found for peripheral conflicts -- in Angola, Mozambique, Zaire, etc. [LE FIGARO] Do you think Mandela is the right man for the job? [Soares] He has learned a great deal. He is a really wise man. [LE FIGARO] Your trust in him is total? [Soares] Yes I trust him. He is a moderate. He knows what the issues are, and he wants a peaceful way out for his country. He is prepared to make a number of vital concessions to avoid causing a panic among the population. [LE FIGARO] All told, you are much more optimistic than most Western leaders.... [Soares] I am optimistic inasmuch as I think we are going to rediscover a number of essential values. We shall finally realize that humankind's evolution does not solely hinge on interest rates and growth rates, but also on political and social values. That humankind must mobilize for ideas, not only for interests. And that notions of equality, fraternity, democracy, and human rights are the only ones likely to free humankind. We are still in a transitional phase. The end of totalitarian regimes constitutes a considerable improvement. This is important. If we feel the world has been going all wrong lately, it is also because of the hopes for an everlasting peace created by the collapse of communism.
