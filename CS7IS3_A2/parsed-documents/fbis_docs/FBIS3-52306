He was speaking during a visit to the Jordan Valley moshav Na'ama, some five kilometers north of Jericho. According to the draft agreement reached in Cairo, Na'ama will reportedly be bordered to the east and to the north by the Palestinian autonomous zone. In Na'ama today was reporter Dick Winter: [Begin recording] [Winter] Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu dropped his bombshell after Na'ama members accused him of selling them out, when in September after the Knesset approved the Israel-PLO accord, he pledged then that the Likud would honor the agreement if they came to power. Now, says Netanyahu, the situation has changed: [Netanyahu] Agreements are made to be abided by, but that cannot be a unilateral action. In fact, the PLO has already violated the central tenets of the agreement. It hasn't canceled the PLO charter, as it promised; it hasn't espoused an antiterror policy. What it has done, in fact, is the very opposite. So if the PLO violated this agreement, I don't see why we should be bound by it. In all international law, an agreement that is not kept by the other side does not bind the other signatory. That is the common thing. Contracts are not one-sided. If one side violates, it doesn't oblige the other, and in this case the PLO has clearly violated this agreement completely, eviscerated it of any meaning, abrogated it central tenets, and therefore I will not see this agreement as binding on a government that I would lead. [Winter] Addressing the Na'ama settlers, most of whom were Rabin supporters in the last elections, Netanyahu said he couldn't believe that the Labor Party, much less the Likud, could support an agreement which reportedly leaves Na'ama bordered to the east and to the north by the Palestinian autonomous zone. As to his program, this is what the Likud leader had to say: [Netanyahu] I think what we have to see is an alternative plan that gives autonomy to the Palestinian Arabs in their cities and their villages and gives Israel control over security. Security for Israel, autonomy for the Arabs, and not a PLO state that would perhaps fast become the bridgehead for another war against Israel. [Winter] Displaying to reporters the document including what he said were the latest Israeli proposals to the Palestinians -- but not giving many details -- Netanyahu said they were a blueprint not for autonomy, but for a Palestinian state.
