Under impressive antlers in the Muerzsteg hunting lodge, the Austrian president's summer residence, Thomas Klestil on Sunday [29 May] at noon shook hands with his official guest, Museveni, and Sudanese President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir shook hands. The extremely serious background of the meeting, which was kept secret until the last minute, was the civil war in southern Sudan, where the Muslim central government has fought against rebel troops for more than 10 years. The south, where Christians and believers of natural religions live, has resisted the policy of islamization that has been enforced by the north in recent years. In Sudan, the Muslim law, the Shariah, is in force. According to estimates, between 500,000 and 1 million people were killed in the war. According to Museveni, there are approximately 300,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda. All peace initiatives and mediation efforts, for instance in the framework of the IGADD (Inter-Governmental Authority on Draught and Development), have been unsuccessful. Members of the IGADD, which deals with the consequences of draught and development problems, are Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya. Excursion to a Mountain Pasture Museveni said on 29 May that the meeting in Muerzsteg had come about at the initiative of "friends in Uganda and Sudan." Al-Bashir had arrived at the hunting lodge on 28 May in the afternoon at the head of a government delegation, shortly after Museveni. Several rounds of talks were held, and they had dinner. On Sunday morning [29 May], the three presidents made an excursion to a mountain pasture. According to unofficial statements, the negotiations were very tough. Al-Bashir told newsmen that there had been "productive discussions on all areas of bilateral relations." They had agreed to continue the talks within the framework of the IGADD. Museveni said agreement had been reached on the framework of the next negotiations. In northern Sudan, which is primarily Muslim, the Shariah also applies to non-Muslims. In the south, al-Bashir's government has formally renounced this. Answering a question by DER STANDARD, the Sudanese president said: "It is a fact that the Shariah is not applied in the south. This could be the basis of a peace agreement." He said the West was launching a "negative campaign" against Sudan, and the West was uninformed about the real situation in the country. Klestil hinted subsequently that both sides had made "considerable progress" in Muerzsteg. Austria's federal state structures were to a certain extent viewed as a model. The next step should now be "to get the rebels to the table." The southern Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) is divided into two wings, the "United" under Riek Machar and the "Mainstream" under John Garang. Machar advocates full independence for southern Sudan. Garang has meanwhile also come closer to this position. Museveni considers the secession of the south the "last way out," whereas his foreign minister, Paul Ssemogerere, says it is the "only solution."
