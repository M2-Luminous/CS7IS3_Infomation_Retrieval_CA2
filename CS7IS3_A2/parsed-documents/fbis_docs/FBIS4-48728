The reason given was that the term of office of the incumbent president of the Supreme Court, Frederick Houndeton, had not yet expired. President Nicephore Soglo has accepted the court's decision. Theodore Holo, the Beninese Government spokesman, speaks on the issue to Herman Gnani: [Begin Holo recording] We live in a state of law, where the Constitutional Court has annulled a presidential decision. You know that the government and the head of state, who respect the rule of law, have accepted this decision. This does not mean that this decision, which cannot be appealed, does not deserve to be analyzed and commented upon by the citizens of our country, who can appreciate its quality. You know that the law is a living organism which evolves; it is not an exact science. Even the Constitutional Court can make mistakes. It is true that today's errors may be corrected tomorrow. This does not mean; however, that this decision will stand for all eternity. I regret this particular decision because of the reputation -- and our personal attachment for -- the Constitutional Court. The Court must prove, through the relevance of its decisions, that it is a body which correctly interprets the Constitution. This is all the more true since the person called into question in this situation is former Minister Yehouessi, who we owe a great debt to for his work in bringing ethics to our country's public life. Do not forget that he was one of the great artisans of the Cisse trial, and if it is in this manner that the nation intends to reward him, then I think we are going to dissuade a lot of initiative from those who want to engage in the fight for improving the moral quality of public life.
