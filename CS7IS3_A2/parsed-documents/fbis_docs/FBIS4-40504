Among the most probable candidates is Vitaliy Masol, former head of the government, who resigned from his post after the 1990 students demonstrations. It is quite possible that Masol's "second coming" to the Cabinet of Ministers will become a reality, since he enjoys support from the leftist majority in parliament. We present to our readers an interview with the candidate for prime minister by a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent. [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, what do you think of the prospect of again sitting in the prime minister's chair? [Masol] If I am to work in the government, I should know that I will be supported by parliament, to avoid the following situation: I am appointed as head of the Cabinet of Ministers today, and tomorrow, I will be asked why the economic situation is still unstable. Stabilization will take place in neither three days nor a month. Thus, when the three main state officials live like a swan, crayfish, and pike in the same lake, I want to be neither a swan, nor a crayfish, nor a pike. Moreover, I am currently morally pleased that I had once properly assessed the situation. Three years have already passed, and these years have confirmed that my conclusions were correct. I said, and still say, that I very seldom make mistakes in my predictions. I was against the introduction of hard currency. Ukraine was not ready for that; we should have established a banking system first. People were shouting: "Conservative, Moscow's protege!" When I was saying that we should not break ties with Russia, no one believed me: "We are feeding Moscow!" Tell me what real grievances, regarding the economy, were presented against the Masol government in 1990? None. It was simply -- "Down with Masol!" [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, the leftists have overwhelmed the new government. Will they be able to assume responsibility for forming the government? What kind of a government could there be? [Masol] Personally, I would like very much that the leftists be able to form the cabinet. I would like that new politicians-realists appear, first of all, in the Executive Branch. In my opinion, among the recently elected deputies there are people who are able to soberly assess the situation and begin implementing reform. Regarding the leftists, they must establish a unified bloc with the centrists. They must cooperate to stabilize the economic situation. Decrees that have been blocking production must be rescinded, the system of taxation must be reformed, and the pricing mechanism must be altered. [Zhalovaga] You were against shock therapy... [Masol] We have not had shock therapy. We have had a stress-shock therapy, because no economic policy has been conducted. It was decided: "We will not meddle in the life of enterprises and kolkhozes. Do whatever you want to do." That was all. But first, there should be discipline and order in the state. How are you going to maintain and oversee them is another question. [Zhalovaga] To which period of history can Ukraine's current situation be compared? [Masol] I think that there have been no analogous situations in world history. It is simply ridiculous to compare today's Ukraine with postwar Germany -- these are two incomparable situations. Although we had relative wealth, we ended up in poverty. Currently, I am categorically against our heading toward poverty while promising wealth at the same time. I do not know how many years we need to reach the same volume of agricultural production as we had three years ago. [Zhalovaga] So you believe that our country has its own way. How would you describe it? [Masol] Russia was, is, and will remain for many years our primary market. No one will allow us to enter the West with our meat, milk, or butter. There are strict market relations. Fight. Ukraine is currently losing the Russian market, and at the same time, the West is conquering it. Plus, there has been a resolution to introduce customs duties! If Ukraine loses the Russian market, it will be very hard for us to survive, because the agricultural sector is a priority in our country. We were delivering a great volume of agricultural production to Russia, which was allowing us to pay for gas and oil deliveries. [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, would you like to be an owner? [Masol] If there were market relations in our country, I would be, if not a rich man, at least not poor. I would be an independent man today.
