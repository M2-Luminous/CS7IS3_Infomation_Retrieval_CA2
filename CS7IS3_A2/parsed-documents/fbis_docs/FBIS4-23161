Speaking at the South African Embassy in Washington Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said President Nelson Mandela would soon sign an agreement covering international regulation of missile delivery systems. Mr. Mbeki was reacting to questions about news reports in the United States that South Africa planned a sharp increase in its arms exports following the end of the arms embargo. He said South Africa had a strict policy not to send weapons to conflict areas in Africa. He said it was possible that South Africa could provide aid to Rwanda in the form of a military field hospital.
