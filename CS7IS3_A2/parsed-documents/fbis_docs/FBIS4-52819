The North Korean boat is scheduled to pull up anchor and start towing the submarine Friday, the report said. In November last year, Russia concluded a deal to sell 12 obsolete diesel-engine submarines to North Korea, and has already delivered one to the North Korean port of Najin in December. But delivery has been suspended since January when the Western press first reported on the contract. Although Russian officials in Vladivostok say the obsolete submarines are being sold to North Korea as scrap iron, Pyongyang reportedly plans to use them for military purposes, the Japanese- language newspaper said. The paper quoted a Russian official as saying Moscow would deliver the remaining 10 submarines in the near future under the terms of the contract. The official added the contract provides for the presence of Russian officials at North Korea's dismantling of the submarines for scrap iron, but Pyongyang has yet to issue entry visas to Russians to monitor the work, raising suspicions that the submarines will be used for military purposes, the newspaper said.
