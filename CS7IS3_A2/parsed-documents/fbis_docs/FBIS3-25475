The confrontation occurred yesterday between Mogadishu Somali citizens and UNOSOM mercenaries based at the port. A reporter from Radio Mogadishu Voice of the Great Somali People, who witnessed the event, said the people were enraged by this foreign provocation. He said the people barricaded all the roads leading to the port with burning tires and carried placards with slogans expressing their indignation and opposition to the so-called taxes imposed on cargo goods at the port. Asked by our reporter about the taxation, one of the transport owners at the port said UNOSOM was not the country's central government and therefore had no right to levy taxes at Mogadishu Port, adding that they would prefer to die rather than pay taxes to UNOSOM. Our reporter also said he had met some Mogadishu Port Corporation Officials, (MPOC), an agency appointed by UNOSOM to supervise the port's operations and which is composed of whites and pseudo- Somalis. The officials told our reporter that what UNOSOM had imposed on the Mogadishu Port was not taxes but a GATT tariff. They preferred the GATT tariff to tax, believing that Somalis would not interpret this as tax. Whatever you call it -- tax, taxation, tariff, GATT, duty, levy and others -- basically they are all the same. The Somali people will not allow the invading foreigners to impose any types of taxes on them.
