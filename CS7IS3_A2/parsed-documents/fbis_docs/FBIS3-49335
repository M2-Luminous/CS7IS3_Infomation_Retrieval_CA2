This process was exceptionally dynamic and smooth. From this point of view, the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Slovak Republic was very important, and so was the fact that Slovakia, as one of the successor states, took over treaties and obligations between the former CSFR and the United States," Peter Burian, charge d'affaires in Washington, told a TA SR reporter. In 1994, the work of the ambassador will be to strengthen economic and commercial contacts. The interest of U.S. firms, such as Westinghouse and others, in investing in Slovakia is a positive factor. Moreover, we succeeded in establishing continuous working contracts with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The conclusion of the treaty on avoiding double taxation between the United States and Slovakia was an important factor in the development of our trading contacts. Burian described as a success of our diplomacy the establishment of the conditions for Slovakia's being taken off the list of countries to which the United States does not export advanced technology (COCOM). According to Burian, the final decision is expected in the days to come. "In the political sphere, we are going to invite a high U.S. official to Slovakia. There are many occasions for it, such as the 50th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising," Burian said. He stressed that the basis for active relations was established in 1993 after the visit of the president, the prime minister, the National Council chairman, and other ministers and Slovak officials to the United States. The work of the ambassador and pushing for the Slovak Republic's interests, in general, was complicated, to a certain extent, by the negative publicity about development in the Slovak Republic. Some sectors are underestimating the importance and the tasks of the embassy. They should address the embassy as the primary source of information and consult it about the preparation of any action having an impact on bilateral contacts. Otherwise, the embassy has to act as a fire brigade. Burian sees certain possibilities in cooperation with the community of Slovak countrymen. The activity of the World Congress of Slovaks, headed by a new leadership, is quite a pleasant thing. The premises for the embassy are a problem that still has not been sorted out. "In Washington, there is an unwritten law regarding prestigious matters. One of them is the fact that the flag of a state should be fixed in a certain place on the building. Even this helps build respect for one state or another in the U.S. capital." Burian described as very important the fact that, in January, the Slovak ambassador will arrive in the United States.
