FR940202-2-00102 FR940202-2-00071 NNIS reports that pneumonias (diagnosed on the basis of the CDC surveillance definition of nosocomial pneumonia) and surgical-wound infections account for approximately 15% each of all hospital-associated infections and are the second most common nosocomial infections after that of the urinary tract. 3 In 1984, the overall incidence of lower respiratory tract infection was 6 per 1,000 discharged patients. 3 The incidence ranged from 4.2 to 7.7 per 1,000 discharged patients for nonteaching and university-affiliated hospitals, respectively, probably reflecting institutional differences in the level of patients' risk for acquiring nosocomial pneumonia. Nosocomial bacterial pneumonia often has been identified as a postoperative infection. 59,60 In the Study of the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control in the 1970s, 75% of reported cases of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia occurred in patients who had had a surgical operation; the risk was 38 times greater for thoracoabdominal procedures than for those involving other body sites. 60 More recent epidemiologic studies, including NNIS studies, have identified other subsets of patients at high risk of developing nosocomial bacterial pneumonia: Patients with endotracheal intubation and/or mechanically assisted ventilation, depressed level of consciousness (particularly those with closed-head injury), prior episode of a large-volume aspiration, or underlying chronic lung disease, and patients >70 years of age. Other risk factors include 24-hour ventilator-circuit changes, fall-winter season, stress-bleeding prophylaxis with cimetidine with or without antacid, presence of a nasogastric tube, severe trauma, and recent bronchoscopy. 7,34,35,61&hyph;69 Recently, NNIS stratified the incidence density of nosocomial pneumonia by patients' use of mechanical ventilator and type of intensive care unit (ICU). From 1986 to 1990, the median rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1,000 ventilator-days ranged from 4.7 in pediatric ICUs to 34.4 in burn ICUs. 63 In contrast, the median rate of nonventilator-associated pneumonia per 1000 ICU-days ranged from 0 in pediatric and respiratory ICUs to 3.2 in trauma ICUs. Nosocomial pneumonia has been associated with high fatality rates. Crude mortality rates of 20%&hyph;50% and attributable mortality rates of 30%&hyph;33% have been reported; in one study, pneumonia comprised 60% of all deaths due to nosocomial infections. 18,35,70&hyph;75 Patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation have higher mortality rates than patients not receiving ventilation support; however, other factors, such as a patient's underlying disease(s) and organ failure, are stronger predictors of death in patients with pneumonia. 34 Pneumonia-associated morbidity has not been evaluated in recent years. Past studies, however, have shown that pneumonia could prolong hospitalization by 4&hyph;9 days. 74&hyph;77 A conservative estimate of the direct cost of excess hospital stay due to pneumonia is $1.1 billion a year for the nation. 78 Because of its reported frequency, associated high fatality rate, and attendant costs, nosocomial pneumonia is a major infection control problem. IV. Pathogenesis Bacteria may invade the lower respiratory tract by aspiration of oropharyngeal organisms, inhalation of aerosols containing bacteria, or less frequently, by hematogenous spread from a distant body site (Figure 1). In addition, bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract has been recently hypothesized as a mechanism for infection. Of these routes, aspiration is believed to be the most important for both nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia. In radioisotope-tracer studies of healthy adults, 45% were found to aspirate during sleep. 79 Persons with abnormal swallowing, such as those who have depressed consciousness, respiratory tract instrumentation and/or mechanically assisted ventilation, gastrointestinal tract instrumentation or diseases, or have just undergone surgery, are particularly likely to aspirate. 7,34,35,60,80 The high incidence of gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in hospitalized patients appears to be the result of factors that promote colonization of the pharynx by gram-negative bacilli and the subsequent entry of these organisms into the lower respiratory tract. 33,81&hyph;84 Whereas aerobic gram-negative bacilli are recovered infrequently or are found in small numbers in pharyngeal cultures of healthy persons, 81,85 colonization dramatically increases in patients with coma, hypotension, acidosis, azotemia, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, leukocytosis, leukopenia, pulmonary disease, nasogastric or endotracheal tubes in place, and in patients given antimicrobial agents. 33,84,86,87 Oropharyngeal or tracheobronchial colonization by gram-negative bacilli begins with the adherence of the microorganisms to the host's epithelial cells. 83,88&hyph;90 Adherence may be affected by multiple factors related to the bacteria (presence of pili, cilia, capsule, or production of elastase or mucinase), host cell (surface proteins and polysaccharides), and environment (pH and presence of mucin in respiratory secretions). 82,83,88,91&hyph;100 The exact interactions among these factors have not been fully elucidated, but studies indicate that certain substances, such as fibronectin, can inhibit the adherence of gram-negative bacilli to host cells. 91,93,101 Conversely, certain conditions, such as malnutrition, severe illness, or post-operative state, can increase adherence of gram-negative bacteria. 82,91,95,100,102 Besides the oropharynx, the stomach has been postulated to be an important reservoir of organisms that cause nosocomial pneumonia. 34,103&hyph;107 The stomach's role may vary depending on the patient's underlying conditions and on prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. 22,104,108&hyph;111 In healthy persons, few bacteria entering the stomach survive in the presence of hydrochloric acid at pH<2. 112,113 However, when gastric pH increases from the normal levels to >4, microorganisms are able to multiply to high concentrations in the stomach. 110,112,114&hyph;116 This can occur in patients with advanced age, 114 achlorhydria, 112 ileus, or upper gastrointestinal disease, and in patients receiving enteral feeding, antacids, or histamine-2 [H&hyph;2] antagonists. 104,110,111,116&hyph;118 The contribution of other factors, such as duodeno-gastric reflux and the presence of bile, to gastric colonization in patients with impaired intestinal motility has been suggested and needs further investigation. 109 Bacteria can also gain entry into the lower respiratory tract of hospitalized patients through inhalation of aerosols generated primarily by contaminated respiratory-therapy or anesthesia-breathing equipment. 119&hyph;122 Outbreaks related to the use of respiratory-therapy equipment have been associated with contaminated nebulizers, which are humidification devices that produce large amounts of aerosol droplets <4Î¼m via ultrasound, spinning disk, or the Venturi mechanism. 119,122,123 When the fluid in the reservoir of a nebulizer becomes contaminated with bacteria, the aerosol produced may contain high concentrations of bacteria that can be deposited deep in the patient's lower respiratory tract. 119,123,124 Because endotracheal and tracheal tubes provide direct access to the lower respiratory tract, contaminated aerosol inhalation is particularly hazardous for intubated patients. In contrast to nebulizers, bubble-through or wick humidifiers mainly increase the water-vapor (or molecular-water) content of inspired gases. Although heated bubble-through humidifiers generate aerosol droplets, they do so in quantities that may not be clinically significant; 120,125 wick humidifiers do not generate aerosols. Rarely, bacterial pneumonia can result from hematogenous spread of infection to the lung from another infection site, e.g., pneumonia resulting from purulent phlebitis or right-sided endocarditis. Another mechanism, translocation of bacteria via the passage of viable bacteria from the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract through epithelial mucosa to the mesenteric lymph nodes and to the lung has been shown in animal models. 126 Translocation is postulated to occur in patients with immunosuppression, cancer or burns; 126 however data are lacking regarding this mechanism in humans. 127
