Gen. (Retd.) Nasirullah Babar said after a press conference in Islamabad, in formal talks with reporters, that the federal government has decided to establish voting right for adults in tribal areas. During the last general election and afterwards, the organization and almost all the national political parties related to tribal areas demanded voting rights in the tribal areas. The parties involved in the present government have also included plans for voting in the tribal areas in their election manifestos. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, during her visit to the Kurram Agency, announced loudly that elections would soon be held with voting rights for adults in tribal areas. Major General Nasirullah Babar, federal home minister, may be talking informally; however, Madam Benazir Bhutto's declaration is a very welcome step. It will be remembered in the political history of this nation. As a result of the implementation of this plan, hundreds of thousands of tribal people who have been deprived of their right to vote will get this right. Major General Nasirullah Babar wants amendments to several laws in order to attain this goal. Therefore, it will take some time to implement this plan. Once this decision has been made, however, we can expect that, Allah willing, all tribal adults will be able to cast votes in the next general election. The federal home minister also revealed that in light of this decision, the government has told the election commission to prepare new election lists for the tribal area during the next census. The people in the tribal areas will vote according to this list in the next election. Similarly, it is the duty of the tribal leaders and the people there to encourage the tribals to join the national campaign, and to start a campaign for this in order to prepare them to make the election lists. The federal home minister also revealed during his talks that the FATA [Federally Administered Territories] members support voting rights. The main reason for the tribal people not having any right to vote was that the Parliament members from tribal areas were not in support of this kind of election. Now, with the grace of God, the situation has changed, and the Parliament members from tribal areas, perhaps for the first time, support the right to vote for tribal people. It is expected that the people in the tribal areas will have the rights for which the educated people in the tribal areas have fought for a long time. As a result, the areas included in FATA will become part of Pakistan's political structure. All the laws of the country used in the other states will be imposed in the FATA region also. Along with FATA, the PATA [Politically Administered Territories] region will also be included in the political structure. Thus, the political boundaries of the tribal areas will merge with the boundaries of our nation and fulfill the dreams of Khushal Khan Khatak and Ilama Iqbal.
