Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and other congressmen told Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu that they expect positive progress in ongoing negotiations, according to Chang Chai-ryong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's American Affairs Bureau. The U.S. visitors agreed that dialogue, at least for now, is the best way of solving the problem, Jang said. The group came to Seoul last week after a field trip to Russia and Japan. Nunn was quoted as telling Han that Moscow officials explained to him that they opposed North Korea's acquiring nuclear weapons. The U.S. senator mainly asked questions, mostly about South Korea's evaluation of North Korea-U.S. dialogue, the degree of Seoul-Washington cooperation in countering the situation, and China's possible contribution to solving the problem. He also is said to have asked about South Korea's position on possible relations improvement between North Korea and the United States once the nuclear question is resolved. When Nunn inquired about the possibility of sanctions if dialogue fails, Han said that he hopes to clear up the problem before it goes that far, Jang said.
