FR940106-0-00062 FR940106-0-00018 Chilipepper rockfish . In 1993, the coastwide ABC was set at 3,600 mt with nearly all the catch coming from the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas. The catch in 1992 was about 2,895 mt; 1993 landings data are not yet available for this species. A new assessment indicates that the ABC could be higher, up to 5,000 mt, due to a very strong 1984 year class, and that the stock is at a level above that expected under the recommended level of exploitation. However, the Council recommended a lower ABC of 4,000 mt for 1994, higher than the expected 1993 catch, but less than the maximum amount suggested by the assessment and close to the long-term average yield. Although a higher ABC appears supportable from the assessment, it is not recommended because bocaccio, which is at a low stock level and has an ABC of 1,540 mt and 1993 landings near that level, are unavoidably caught with chilipepper. There is no harvest guideline at this time for chilipepper rockfish. Pacific ocean perch (POP) . Based on the 1992 stock assessment, the ABC for POP remains at zero. A rebuilding program was established for POP in 1981, following depletion of this stock during the 1960's and early 1970's. Significant rebuilding has not been detected. The stock abundance is estimated to be about 50 percent of its target level and recent harvests of about 1,000 mt are near the level of overfishing. If the stock recovers to its target level, then annual yields of about 1,400 mt may be possible. Strong year classes which are necessary to rebuild the stock occur infrequently, so the lack of rebuilding is not unexpected. The harvest guideline continues to be set at the level that accommodates the incidental catch of POP caught while fishing for other species. The reduction of the harvest guideline from 1,550 mt in 1993 to 1,300 mt in 1994 results from converting the harvest guideline from an estimate of total catch (retention plus discards) to an estimate of landed catch (retention only). The harvest guideline of 1,550 mt in 1993 applied to the total catch, 1,300 mt for landed catch and a 250-mt (16 percent) estimate of trip-limit induced discards. In 1994, the harvest guideline represents only the landed catch, and therefore is lowered to 1,300 mt. For the last several years, the harvest guideline, in conjunction with a very small trip limit, was necessary to accommodate only incidental catches of POP which otherwise would have been discarded. The trip limit will not be relaxed to achieve the harvest guideline, but may be changed to reflect revised estimates of bycatch levels. The catch in 1993 is projected to be about 1,447 mt, 93 percent of the harvest guideline. The 1994 harvest guideline is consistent with the Council's policy to allow for incidental catches during the 20-year rebuilding schedule for POP. Shortbelly rockfish . Shortbelly rockfish remains an unexploited stock and thus is difficult to assess quantitatively. In recent years, the ABC has been maintained at 13,000 mt until further data can be collected. However, the midpoint of the range of recently revised yield estimates is 23,500 mt. The Council agreed that this represents the best available scientific information and recommended that the harvest guideline be set equal to the ABC. To date, a fishery for this species has not developed. Less than 10 mt were taken in 1992 and similar landings have occurred in 1993.
