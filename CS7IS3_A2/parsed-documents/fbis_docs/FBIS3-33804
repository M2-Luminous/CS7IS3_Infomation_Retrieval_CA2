The world may sympathize with our suffering and understand our insistence and why we are losing patience. The countries in the world will continue to loudly declare that the prisoners have every right to be set free. They might couple this with a condemnation of the Iraqi regime for its violation of human rights and UN principles. But, none of what we seek will be realized. Of course, this is neither a call for despair, or an attempt to absolve an issue that concerns every Kuwaiti, and to that effect, every free man in the world. We are just stating a fact with the realization that keeping silent about it, or trying to hide it will not serve anyone. You want your prisoners? Then, stop deceiving yourselves and say it as frankly as possible because you know it well. If you lack the courage to do so, we find no harm in declaring it on your behalf: We will say that it is a political issue before a humanitarian issue. It is a card in the hands of the alliance countries, specifically the Western countries. They have their own strategic calculations, which do not necessarily tally with our national or regional calculations. It is high time for us to understand that they do not want to change the current situation because it represents an ideal state that is needed to have circumstances that will help bring a new move on the Gulf map to fruition. They want to keep the area crucified on the cross of the prisoners and of other outstanding issues until they complete the rearrangement of the state of affairs in other areas that have more priority on their strategic agenda. In light of this reality, we call for a qualitative move to redress the course and end this state of begging for a solution, to begin shaping a new reality that will force the Western countries to change their course and tackle the issue of the prisoners and the demarcation of borders -- not as a Kuwaiti issue but as a Gulf issue that endangers regional security. The best thing that we can do to control this new reality is to establish a strategic regional group with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries at the center, flanked by Syria and Iran. Then, we can tell the Western countries: Leave our countries, as we no longer need your services, and Saddam's army is no more than a scarecrow with which we know how to deal. You will then be astonished to see how well the Western countries can actively and positively move to align their stand with this new reality to secure the interests they have in this regional group, even if the price needed for this is Saddam's head. Otherwise, we shall remain captives with our prisoners, moaning in Baghdad's prisons.
