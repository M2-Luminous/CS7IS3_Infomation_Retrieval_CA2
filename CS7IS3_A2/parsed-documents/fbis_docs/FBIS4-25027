Chinese workers used to be assigned jobs solely through the government labor departments. But in recent years, with the number of foreign-funded, private and co-operative enterprises increasing, the need for a fluid labor market has been felt keenly. In the meantime, large numbers of surplus workers in state-run enterprises are waiting to be re-employed. The first Tianjin labor market was set up on November 30, 1992 under the supervision of the municipal labor department. So far 600,000 workers have applied with the labor markets for new jobs, and 20 percent have been lucky. Now labor markets have been set up in 18 city districts and suburban counties, catering to 12 professions. Furthermore, over 100 state-run enterprises have also set up their own labor markets. A computer network links the various labor markets exchanging labor supply and demand information. The Tianjin Municipal Labor Bureau has also set up a special section to provide a continuous line of service: giving information, connecting demand and supply, exchange personal documents, signing contracts and providing unemployment security. The labor markets are welcomed by both enterprises and job seekers. A Sino-Japanese joint-venture electric machinery company was set up April this year in Tianjin, as the biggest Japanese company in Tianjin. Its over 1,000 employees were all recruited through the local labor markets. Tianjin plans to connect its labor markets with those in other big cities like Beijing and Shanghai through a computer network to enhance labor exchanges.
