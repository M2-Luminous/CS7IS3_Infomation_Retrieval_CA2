This will allow Japan to technically handle issues of nuclear nonproliferation as well as environmental problems. The idea under consideration by Donen is that a fast breeder reactor and a spent-fuel reprocessing plant are constructed to simultaneously burn ultra-uranium elements mixed in with spent fuel and plutonium. This idea would remove concerns about the extraction of pure plutonium and its conversion into nuclear weapons.
