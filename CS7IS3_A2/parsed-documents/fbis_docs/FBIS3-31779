The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] patrols on the ground have discovered another 55 similar sites. Frozen guns and howitzers are located in many of these sites, and several days will be needed to haul them away. According to UNPROFOR representative Colonel Bill Aikman, another 12 sites with Serbian artillery have still not been placed under control, although this should have been accomplished before the expiration of the deadline in the night from Sunday to Monday. Colonel Aikman said that two incidents with Karadzic's Serbs had occurred yesterday. The Serbs came to two sites and demanded that they be allowed to haul away the heavy artillery. After the UNPROFOR soldiers had refused to allow them to do so, they withdrew without causing further problems.
