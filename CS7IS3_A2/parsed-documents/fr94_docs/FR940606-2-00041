SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA has received from Miles, Inc., Agricultural Division (formerly Mobay Corp., Agricultural Chemicals Division), P.O. Box 4913, Kansas City, MO 64120-0013, an amendment to the notice of filing under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a) for pesticide petition (PP) 9F3724, which appeared in the Federal Register of March 23, 1989 (54 FR 12009). The original petition proposed to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing tolerances for the fungicide ( alpha -[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethyl]- alpha -(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1 H -1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) in or on the commodities barley grain at 2.0 ppm, barley grain forage at 5.0 ppm, barley straw at 5.0 ppm, grapes at 2.0 ppm, grass, seed cleanings (including hulls) at 25.0 ppm, grass, seed straw (including chaff) at 30.0 ppm, peanuts at 0.05 ppm, peanut hulls at 3.5 ppm, peanut hay at 50.0 ppm, raisins at 3.0 ppm, wheat grain at 0.40 ppm, wheat grain forage at 4.5 ppm, and wheat straw at 19.0 ppm. Miles, Inc., has amended the petition to propose amending 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation to permit the residues of the fungicide ( alpha -[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethyl]- alpha -(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1 H -1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) in or on peanuts at 0.1 ppm and peanut hulls at 4.0 ppm. The proposed analytical method for determining residues is high-performance liquid chromatography. In previous amendments to the cited pesticide petition, requested by Miles, Inc., all commodities other than peanuts and peanuts hulls (peanut hay, barley grain, barley grain forage, barley straw, grapes, grass seed cleanings including hulls, grass seed straw including chaff, raisins, wheat grain, wheat grain forage, and wheat straw) were withdrawn. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 346a and 371. Dated: May 26, 1994. Stephanie R. Irene, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs.
