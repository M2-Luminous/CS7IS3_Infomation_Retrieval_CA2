How much will bread cost this fall, or by the end of the year? What is the volume of grain purchases which can be realistically expected in 1994? These tricky questions were discussed last Thursday by members of the Russian Federation Government Food Commission under the chairmanship of Agriculture and Food Minister V. Khlystun. In respect of current reserves of bread grain, these, according to "Roskhleboprodukt" Corporation President L. Cheshinskiy, are sufficient to last until the next harvest. There are particularly plentiful reserves of rye, which will meet the requirements of the Russian population right up until 1996. But it is grain purchases from the 1994 harvest which are prompting alarm. And this alarm is wholly justified. After all, last fall, for a number of reasons, a sizable area earmarked for winter crops was left unsown. The wintering of cereal crops took place in difficult conditions. As a result, owing to frosts and rot over large areas, farmers were forced to undersow or even resow winter grain with spring grain. All this, of course, will affect the harvest. In the light of this, forecasts by food commission members regarding appreciable price increases for bread were completely justified. "It is clear even today," V. Khlystun said, "that, by fall, because of inflation and for other reasons, purchase prices for grain will rise to 200,000 rubles [R] a tonne." It will be remembered that the average purchase price in 1993 was R57,000 per tonne. But then the situation was different to the one taking shape now. The custom of state grain procurements was still genetically strong. However, political infighting, in which bread prices constituted a bargaining chip, led to a situation where debts for products submitted were not paid to agricultural commodity producers for many months. As a result, virtually all farms -- large farms and private smallholdings -- ended up on the brink of economic collapse, irretrievably disenchanted with the word of the state as a guarantee of any kind of commitment. The volume of grain purchases destined for the Federal Fund is currently defined at a level of roughly 11 million tonnes, or 1 million tonnes less than it was planned to purchase in 1993. Then, you may recall, the plan was exceeded. The drop in planned volumes for this year is attributed to the fact that the government has restricted the circle of users of the "state corn bins," suggesting to many that they themselves take care of grain and other food reserves. The market, after all, is the market. Whether these 11 million tonnes will be poured into state silos is, so to speak, another matter. These fears are not arbitrary. Unless purchase prices for fall 1994 are determined sufficiently reliably in the very near future, and unless appropriate contracts are signed, the peasant will not assume commitments to deliver grain on credit. To all appearances, the Russian Federation Government Food Commission understands this only too well, having given instructions to a number of ministries and departments to define the volume of budget funds necessary to cover expenditure on grain purchases as soon as possible, and with due account of inflation and other factors.
