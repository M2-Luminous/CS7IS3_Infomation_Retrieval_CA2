The interview was recorded in Moscow on 20 January. Topics covered included the background and aftermath of Gaydar's resignation, rumors in the press on Chernomyrdin's presidential ambitions, the possibility of a general strike this year, his attitude toward Yeltsin, the events of October 1993, his own resignation, the election results, his past relations with the Russian media, and his hopes for the work of the State Duma. Asked about the background to Gaydar's resignation, Poltoranin said: "As regards the actual resignation of Gaydar, it was no surprise to me, because we discussed this problem -- the resignation of his whole team from the government -- as early as the beginning of last November when we were preparing for the elections. I'm sure that Russia's Choice would have got a bigger percentage if this team had distanced itself from the government and distanced itself from the mistakes that the government made in 1992. Having weighed up all the pros and cons, we said that Gaydar cannot afford the luxury of resigning just prior to the referendum, because at that time society had started getting irritated and as a result of this irritation many people would not have gone to the polls, and we might not have got the constitution. We set the adoption of the constitution higher than our party interests, and thank God, we've got the constitution. Now Gaydar has resigned, and in principle his umbilical cord was cut long ago and nothing links him with the policies -- if you can call them policies -- currently being pursued by Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin." Karaulov went on to ask how Yeltsin could let Gaydar go. Poltoranin said: "It seems to me that the president himself has, in this difficult situation, got slightly disoriented to some degree. We're all disoriented. Today we're faced with a massive halt to production, of enterprises, and so on, and the president is already feeling a sense of danger for Russia. It seems to him that a man who has got hold of the economy in his teeth -- Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin -- can see more and make a more correct assessment of the situation. He has given him all the cards, and he is now giving Chernomyrdin the opportunity: Go ahead, if you don't agree with this or that, sort it out for yourself. There is a question, and I do not blame the president in this although to some degree a time will come when we shall all have to reflect again on today's actions -- say, those of the prime minister and his entourage." Having warned of the possibility of a general strike this year as a result of political intriguing, Karaulov pressed Poltoranin as to whether he really thought it possible that a general political strike might occur this summer. He replied: "I wouldn't want that to happen, of course, just like the rest of us. But just look at the situation today, what is happening in Russia, and you can't rule it out. The figures are large, colossal unfortunately. Group B factories are coming to a standstill, that is, the ones that produce clothing, our personal effects. And there are people, there are groups -- I'll cite them in specific terms now -- for whom it is advantageous for all this to happen. There are people, there are now movements, for whom the worse things are, the better. I would include here the movement, or party, of Zhirinovskiy, because it's very advantageous to Zhirinovskiy that everything should be seething. He's one of those people who like to surf across the waves." Asked why Yeltsin cannot see this for himself, he said: "The points of view from which we all look at one problem or another don't always coincide. Why are reforms under way in the Ministry of Security and its structures, a search for some kind of normal or acceptable forms? Because they don't satisfy the president -- they don't satisfy any of us, we don't know and the president often doesn't know what is going on. That is, it seems to me he doesn't have enough information."
