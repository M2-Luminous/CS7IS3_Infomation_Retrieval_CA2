In particular, the fifth HindIII fragment of PCaD and hybrid plasmids containing small functionally significant segments of this fragment are investigated. Altogether, a bank of HindIII, EcoRI, and PstI fragments of the Ca[.sup]2+[/]-dependence plasmid of Yersinia pestis, strain 358, is constructed, and restriction pCaD charts are plotted by means of restriction analysis using these fragments as probes. The findings demonstrate that the study of the mutation versions' expression of an intact pCaD plasmid or even its small fragments is probably not justified in some cases due to the complicated and little-known regulatory relationships among this plasmid's individual genes. An animal study also reveals that two subfragments of the fifth HindIII fragment are capable of ensuring the pathogenic and invasiveness properties of avirulent strains of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and E. coli while the full nucleotide sequence does not exhibit such properties. The issue of the reasons for the absence of protective effect from immunization with E. coli strains pSM2[.sup]+[/] and pSM3[.sup]+[/] remains unclear.
