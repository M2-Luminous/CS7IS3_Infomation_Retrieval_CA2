The greatest splash was produced by the interviews granted to THE WASHINGTON POST, the renowned BBC, and French television. Lech Walesa warned that "life may cause us to wind up making military arrangements with Ukraine if we do not get into NATO," stating that "it is not possible to be a partner without being a participant," and ultimately, just before the meeting in Brussels, described the U.S. initiative "Partnership for Peace" as blackmail. In December, Minister Andrzej Olechowski held many talks in Washington, trying (unfortunately, with little result) to have the "proposal for nonrejection," as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs terms Partnership for Peace, turned into an institutional precursor for entry into NATO. Recently [in January], Olechowski proceeded to Bonn, hoping for a warm response from the Germans. There, as well, unfortunately, he did not have much luck, and his reception by Klaus Kinkel was downright frosty. Despite this, he visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, clarifying Poland's position through the publication of several articles in the opinion-molding foreign-affairs press. On 1 December, IZVESTIYA carried an article by Olechowski entitled "Poland's Concerns." Just before the NATO summit in Brussels, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU carried another article by the chief Polish diplomat in which Olechowski gave assurances that "we are not afraid of Russia but, rather, of the objective situation that may push it to behave in a manner that is threatening to Poland. This situation is the security vacuum that now exists in Europe." The Polish-U.S. lobby took up the call to action in the United States. The result of Lech Walesa's efforts was the trip made before the Brussels summit by Ambassador [to the UN] Madeleine Albright (a Czech by extraction) and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili (born in Warsaw), to the "Visegrad" capitals. The trip by the two politicians showed that "four" are not only going at different speeds but that the Czechs clearly indicate that they do not feel any commonality of interests with their neighbors. Lech Walesa's closest ally turned out to be the president of Slovakia, Michal Kovac, who as early as the first part of January proposed that our countries immediately be granted "full political membership in NATO and security guarantees." The Hungarians, who did not share Walesa's angry reaction to the proposal from Albright and Shalikashvili, did not make life easy for Walesa. Just before the Brussels summit, a real contest developed. The parliament of Bulgaria demanded that NATO treat that country the same as the "Visegrad" countries, Romania officially asked for accession to NATO, and, several days later, Algirdas Brazauskas, the president of Lithuania, submitted a similar petition. In response to the Polish offensive, Moscow recently launched a counteroffensive. Vyacheslav Kostikov, spokesman for President Yeltsin, stated That admitting the countries of Central Europe into NATO would bring the Russian reforms to a halt. The Russian Army "would be furious," and Russia "would have to form its own military-political bloc."
