The visit will last until February 17. The mission, led by Spyros Margetis, senior environmental specialist for Europe and Central Asia at the World Bank, will survey the implementation of the plan of action which is part of Bulgaria's environmental strategy. The plan, specifying the main aspects of this country's environmental policy until the year 2000, was developed in 1991 by Bulgarian specialists with the assistance of experts of the same financial institutions and agencies. Some of the foreign experts are members of the present mission. The plan will be updated to bring it into line with the changes that took place in Bulgaria over the last few years. Stress will be laid on the development of an investment matrix specifying the ways and mechanisms of attracting investment for the implementation of the updated plan of action. The draft update is expected to be ready by the end of March. Bulgaria would like to show it pursues a consistent environmental policy conducting cooperation with the international financial and political institutions concerned with the problems of environment at the 1995 Conference on European Environment which Sofia is to host, Environment Minister Bosevski said today before the opening of the working meeting with the foreign experts. He stressed that Bulgaria seeks integration with the financial and political mechanisms of Europe and the world for the purpose of optimizing its environmental policy. As hosts to the 1995 environmental conference, we want to make our own contribution to the formulation of the concept about environmental policy, Minister Bosevski added. World Bank resident representative John Wilton, who attended the opening of the meeting, said that the updated plan of action could also provide an input to the meeting of international donors organized by the World Bank in June this year. The idea of both meetings is to provide assistance for those priority actions that are to be taken in the environmental area, Mr. Wilton stressed. Minister Bosevski expressed his hope that during the mission's visit a national group would be established to draw up Bulgaria's report for the 1995 conference. "This national team would act as a coordinator of relations with the countries in Central and Eastern Europe which are expected to raise a number of social, political and economic problems at the forum," the Bulgarian environment minister said. Apart from the Environment Ministry team, the mission of experts will also meet representatives of state and academic institutions and non-government environmental formations.
