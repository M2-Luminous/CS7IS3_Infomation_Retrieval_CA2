Ryazantsev, member of Sakhalin Oblast election commission; by unidentified reporter; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program; place and date not given -- recorded] [Text] The attempt by Sakhalin residents to create a bicameral oblast parliament was not successful. The oblast was corrected by Moscow. [Begin recording] [Ryazantsev] The Moscow authorities wanted, on one hand, to box our ears and put the regions in their place so that they would not act too independently, and on the other hand, the goal is probably to whittle down our representative power and reduce it, making it into some kind of decorative screen. Frankly, my first emotional response was as follows: If Article 77 of the Russian Constitution, which postulates that nomination of oblast and kray authorities is the prerogative of federation members, is being directly violated here, then we should not do it, we should just distance ourselves from it and not do such work. But on the other hand, the representative power has to be elected. Even if I and other members of the commission leave, the elections still need to be carried out. The only thing we will accomplish is making the elections more difficult. [Reporter] So you are staying? [Ryazantsev] For the time being, I am, and I think that other members of the election committee also are not seriously considering leaving. But like an aftertaste, a very bitter residue remains.
