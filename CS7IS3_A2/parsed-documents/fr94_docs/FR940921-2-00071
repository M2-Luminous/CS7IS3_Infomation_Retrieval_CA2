FR940921-2-00071 FR940921-2-00063 [Docket No. 50&hyph;458] River Bend Station; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;47 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), for operation of the River Bend Station, located in West Feliciana Parish. The proposed amendment would revise the formula for calculating the average power range monitor (APRM) flow biased simulated thermal power-high reactor trip and flow biased neutron flux-upscale control rod block trip setpoints T-factor specified in Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.2.2. The proposed changes are necessary to support implementation of recommendations contained in NRC Generic Letter 94&hyph;02, ``Long-Term Solutions and Upgrade of Interim Operating Recommendations for Thermal-Hydraulic Instabilities in Boiling Water Reactors.'' Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), a licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This change only redefines the APRM setpoints T-factor. The modified APRM setpoints T-factor does not change or affect operator required actions in relation to the APRM setpoints T-factor and is only applied at different power peaking for given reactor power. Therefore, this change only affects the precursors to events that can be initiated as a result of different power peaking. The only event affected is the formation of coupled thermal-hydraulic and neutronic oscillations (reactor stability). Since the modified APRM setpoints T-factor allows power distributions which permits the application of stability controls to increase stability margin, the probability for initiation of reactor instability is significantly reduced. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability of any event previously evaluated. The consequence of a reactor instability event is minimized since the initial reactor conditions are associated with very stable power distributions. These stable conditions are established using stability controls which are permitted with the modified APRM setpoints T-factor. Since the initial reactor conditions are very stable, the severity of a postulated reactor instability event is significantly diminished. In addition, the modified APRM setpoints T-factor is confirmed to provide adequate LHGR [linear heat generation rate] protection at off-rated conditions for other anticipated events. Protection of other thermal limits for all previously analyzed events is accomplished by specific limits that are independent of the APRM setpoints T-factor. These are the power and flow dependent MCPR [minimum critical power ratio] Operating Limits which provide protection from fuel dryout and the rated MAPLHGR [maximum average planar linear heat-generation rate] limit which provides protection of the peak clad temperature for the DBA [design-basis accident] LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident]. Therefore, the proposed changes does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of any event previously evaluated.
