FR940303-2-00014 FR940303-2-00011 Bureau of the Census [Docket No. 940121&hyph;4021] Annual Survey of Communication Services AGENCY: Bureau of the Census, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of determination. SUMMARY: In accordance with Title 13, United States Code, sections 131, 182, 224, and 225, I have determined that 1993 operating revenue and expenses are needed for the telephone, radio and television broadcasting, cable and pay television, and other communication services industries to provide a sound statistical basis for the formation of policy by various governmental agencies, and that these data also apply to a variety of public and business needs. These data are not publicly available from nongovernment or other governmental sources. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas E. Zabelsky, Chief, Current Services Branch, on (301) 763&hyph;5528. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Census Bureau is authorized to conduct surveys necessary to furnish current data on subjects covered by the major censuses authorized by Title 13, United States Code. This survey will provide continuing and timely national statistical data on communication services for the period between economic censuses. The latest economic census was conducted in 1992. The data collected in this survey will be within the general scope and nature of those inquiries covered in the economic censuses. The Bureau of the Census needs reports only from a limited sample of communication firms in the United States. The probability of a firm's selection is based on payroll size. The sample will provide, with measurable reliability, national level statistics on operating revenue and expenses for these industries. We will mail report forms to the firms covered by this survey and require their submission within thirty days after receipt. This survey has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB approval control number 0607&hyph;0706 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96&hyph;511, as amended. We will provide copies of the forms upon written request to the Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233. Based upon the foregoing, I have directed that an annual survey be conducted for the purpose of collecting these data. Dated: January 28, 1994. Harry A. Scarr, Acting Director, Bureau of the Census.
