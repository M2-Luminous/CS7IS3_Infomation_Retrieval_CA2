Technology is required for high yield seeds, animal feed, low-poison pesticides, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery, said Lin Kun, deputy director general of the Foreign Investment Administration under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. Lin revealed the government's list of overseas investment priorities on Tuesday. Other areas which need foreign cash include infrastructure, high technology development, export production, and know-how to recycle industrial waste. So far, China has approved 186,062 foreign-funded enterprises, with an accumulated contractual investment of $241.5 billion. The actual foreign investment amounted to $67.2 billion since 1978, Lin said. In the first three months of this year, overseas investors pledged $19.6 billion in 11,834 projects. And more than $5.4 billion flooded into the country during this period. Foreign companies have been keen to enter the vast and rapidly developing Chinese market. And numerous multinationals have made long-term investment plans in China. They include General Electric, American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and Ford of the United States; Northern Telecom of Canada; Matsushita, Nippon Electric Corporation, Mitsui and Company Limited, and C. Itoh of Japan; Citroen of France; Volkswagen and Siemens of Germany; Royal Dutch Shell of Britain; Philips of Holland; and Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland. Eighty of the top 500 companies ranked by Fortune magazine, have invested in China. "We will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in sectors like infrastructure, basic industries, technical renovation, and capital and technology-intensive industries," Lin said. Special government approval is needed to invest in banking, insurance, securities, retail sales, foreign trade, audio-visual products, printing and publication, and air cargo service. And overseas firms are barred from running enterprises which affect social security and national economic development, those that pollute the environment, as well as those which mine radioactive minerals. They are also prohibited from running posts and telecommunications services, radio and television stations, newspapers, and enterprises producing military goods. "We encourage foreigners to invest in existing Chinese enterprises and produce goods for Chinese and foreign markets," Lin said. "The vast Chinese market is open for foreign-funded enterprises provided they can balance their foreign exchange earnings and expenditure." Besides agricultural technology, China also needs overseas funds for projects like energy, transport, and raw material production. It will invite foreign firms to take part in the construction and management of power plants, highways, bridges, ports the development of coal products and coal mining equipment.
