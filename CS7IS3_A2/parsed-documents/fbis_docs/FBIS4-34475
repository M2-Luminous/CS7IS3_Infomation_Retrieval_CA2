The top Canadian official will meet with Cuban Government officials and deliver a speech at the International Conference on Business Opportunities in Cuba promoted by the British magazine THE ECONOMIST, which will begin here on Monday. A Canadian Embassy representative told PRENSA LATINA that this visit to Cuba falls within the framework of the political dialogue between the two countries, which has increased since 1989 with the exchange of official visits. Former Cuban Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon traveled to Ottawa that year, and the following year his Canadian counterpart, Louise Frechette, visited Havana, where she met with President Fidel Castro. Both countries have expressed their satisfaction over the development of the political dialogue and the expansion of economic ties. Since the administration of Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Canada has been strengthening its relations with Latin America. The current Liberal administration of Jean Chretien wants to consolidate those relations, particularly in the commercial arena, and has taken steps in that direction. At the recent OAS General Assembly, Stewart called for breaking the isolation orchestrated against Cuba and advocated Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization. Prior to that time, Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet stressed Ottawa's rejection of the U.S. blockade against Cuba and called for an end to the policy. Canada and Mexico were the only countries in the hemisphere who in 1962 refused to accept U.S. demands that OAS member-countries break relations with the island.
