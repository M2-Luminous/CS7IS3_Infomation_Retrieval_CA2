FBIS4-61478 "drsov088_a_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Security Council Official on Borders, NATO Partnership Security Council Official on Borders, NATO Partnership LD0505195194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1805 GMT 5 May 94 LD0505195194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Valeriy Manilov, suggested that the next meeting of the Security Council planned for May was likely to focus on issues concerning the Russian borders. He said at a press conference today that this was one of the priorities when ensuring Russia's security. The second important problem was the Russian brain drain, he emphasized. Manilov stressed that the Security Council was trying to solve the problem by non-standard ways with the participation of all interested organizations. Manilov suggested that threats to Russia could stem from the economic problems, inter-ethnic relations within the Russian Federation and possible social-economic collisions due to the growing unemployment. Manilov announced that the Russian Security Council had recommended that all the interested departments work on problems concerning Russia joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program. This analysis and specific proposals on the issue are expected to be submitted to the Security Council in June. The issue on the joint U.S.-Russian military exercise in the Southern Urals (the Totsk training ground) was also carefully worked on. Manilov said when discussing this both moral and economic factors must be taken into consideration. Manilov said the Security Council was preparing radical proposals on the Black Sea Fleet issue to prevent it becoming a real danger. "I think the Russian and Ukrainian presidents will adopt mechanisms for making the final decision on this issue in the interests of the two countries and their peoples," Manilov emphasized.
