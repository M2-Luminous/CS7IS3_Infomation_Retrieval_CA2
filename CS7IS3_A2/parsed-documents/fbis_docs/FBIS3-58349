For the first time, Michel Giraud also replies to the president of the republic who is advocating a "new social contract." [Lecluse] The prime minister is inviting the social partners to a roundtable meeing at the Hotel Matignon at the end of February. What subjects do you plan to discuss? [Giraud] The aim is to implement the five-year law, especially as regards negotiations on the adaptation of the working week, and to urge the social partners who manage unemployment insurance to reach agreements on long-term compensations for reduced working time and the differential compensation paid to the unemployed person who finds a job. In addition, it strikes me as necessary to pursue the effort in the sphere of reducing the cost of labor on low wages within the scope of available budget resources and the effort in the sphere of youth employment. In addition, I attach particular importance to the rapid development of service jobs. [Lecluse] Is that not ring alarm bells? [Giraud] It has been discussed for a long time, but it does not ring alarm bells because the five-year law has made provision for their development through the service voucher [cheque service]. On a very practical level, tenders are being invited for implementing it. [Lecluse] What do you think of the president of the republic's idea for a "new social contract for employment?" [Giraud] The president of the republic is putting into words what the government has been doing since its installation nine months ago: dialogue, consultation, negotiation... The drafting of the five-year law gave rise to a very broad exchange with all the social partners even before its presentation to Parliament. The law itself strongly revives collective negotiation in many spheres. Thus, in the next few months, employers' and trade union organizations, at branch, enterprise, or establishment level, will have to decide on the length of the working week, the level of wages, initial training courses, the rate of continuous training, and the organization of work time (free time, probationary periods), the best methods to be adopted by institutions which represent staff, and so forth. This is not an exhaustive list but it is enough to show that the five-year law revives social dialogue and thus gives full meaning and every opportunity to a new organization of relations between employers and employees. Moreover, the employment law requires us to build ever broader partnerships with the regional councils, associations, and other regional operators, thus prompting a healthy decompartmentalization in the social sphere. Is it not a very practical and very operational task to mobilize everybody in the fight for employment? [Lecluse] What are the grounds for the government's hope to stabilize employment by mid-1994 in view of the fact that the recovery will be much lower than the necessary level for halting the slide? [Giraud] All the macroeconomic forecasting bodies agree in predicting the beginning of a reversal in the situation during 1994, with the differences only relating to the starting point and the scale. However, it is obvious that the recovery would be too modest to generate, on its own, a number of jobs likely to significantly reduce unemployment. However, the government is justified in hoping for the full effect of the emergency measures (law of 27 July 1993), the five-year law (better organization of work, training, youth employment...), and the 1994 budget. Thus, during the second half of 1994, we should experience an encouraging deceleration in the unemployment curve. [Lecluse] With hindsight, if you were to draft the five-year law today, would you proceed in the same way? Do you have regrets? [Giraud] The process of design, drafting, consultation, and then consideration of the five-year law took place over eight months... In all honesty, I do not think that I could now take a more open approach... On the other hand, with regard to some expectations -- I am thinking in particular of the "32-hour" working week -- I might envisage a more vigorous response so that the attention of our fellow citizens is not distracted from the essential issue of the law's content. Moreover, it is in this spirit that I have started a wide-ranging effort to provide information on all the new measures proposed in this law. [Lecluse] The government plans to pursue the reform of social security funding. Do you advocate a more rapid implementation of the timetable to include family contributions in the budget or a new reduction in the sickness benefit contribution? [Giraud] The pursuit of the reform of social security funding and its implementation provisions require a concerted and united choice by the government. I would like to confirm two personal convictions: -- The relationship between the reduction in contributions and the preservation or creation of jobs is undoubtedly strong. -- The effort to reduce social security contributions must be based on the minimum wage if we are to secure the maximum effect with regard to employment. I am therefore strongly in favor of speeding up the reduction in the cost of labor for the benefit of the lowest wages, and, moreover, this is a way of protecting the jobs concerned. [Lecluse] Are you not afraid of creating daunting threshold effects by concentrating the reductions on wages in the region of the minimum wage at the very time when enterprises are very strongly limiting their wage increases? [Giraud] This is a false debate in that there is no threshold proper. Indeed, every year until 1998, the level of the wage exempted increases by 10 percent in accordance with the process started last July. In addition, through the opportunity given to new enterprises to benefit from the 1998 conditions as from 1994, considerable room to maneuver is being opened up. In other words, the reductions do not fix the most modest wages at their present level. I am even convinced that they could encourage a gradual increase in them. [Lecluse] Are corporate social plans being presented to you today better constructed than a few months ago? [Giraud] Since the beginning of last fall, we have observed a clear improvement in the quality of social plans. The mobilization of the public employment services, greater awareness on the part of enterprise chiefs, and the early implementation of the provisions of the five-year law make it possible to further encourage alternative solutions to redundancies. Out of 2,000 procedures concerning enterprises with more than 20 employees, only 80 observations of shortcomings have been reported. This is a good development especially because the number of social plans is still worrying. In reality, we are gradually moving toward company plans composed of three largely equal parts: one-third internal measures (partial unemployment, gradual early retirement, shorter working hours compensated over a long period, reorganization of the enterprise); one-third external conversions with reorganizing divisions, leave, and conversion conventions; and one-third age measures (Social Security -- National Employment Fund). [Lecluse] Enterprises are now stepping up initiatives of all kinds to help employment and the unemployed. What do you think of social marketing? [Giraud] I do not like the term "social marketing." It suggests that the enterprises are using employment as an argument for "comparative social publicity" whereas many of them, by becoming aware of the social and economic implications of unemployment, have decided to become involved themselves and in their way in the struggle for employment. This display of solidarity is constructive and beneficial and must be welcomed. For instance, it is reflected in the circular of 29 December 1993 which institutes the clause of "best social policy." This gives priority to job creation as a selection criterion in the awarding of public procurement contracts. [Lecluse] Will the very strong reservations, not to say hostility, of the social partners to the plan for a single alternative training option prompt you to postpone your bill, initially planned for spring? [Giraud] You will have noted that Article 64 of the five-year law calls on the government to present Parliament with proposals aimed at "extending and harmonizing the use of different training measures in work contracts to help the young." This means that the debate is open. To clarify it, at my request, the Tax Inspectorate and the Health and Company Affairs Inspectorate have launched a mission whose conclusions I will have at the end of February. On that basis, I will decide my position and propose the guidelines which strike me as most beneficial for the training and employment of young people. However, it is very clear that I will strive to respect and ensure respect for the deadlines set by the legislator. If the bill could not be included in the spring session, I will ensure that it is included in the fall session. [Lecluse] What progress has been made on the decree relating to compulsory rest periods which particularly affect banks wishing to open on Saturdays? [Giraud] I am anxious to propose to the social partners in the next few weeks a perfectly balanced document relating to the long postponed implementation of the ruling of 16 January 1982. This document should safeguard the employees' most important gains while improving flexibility in the organization of the working week in the spirit of the five-year law. In this sphere, there cannot be any winners or losers, but, I hope, a better service to the public and additional jobs, especially part-time jobs. [Lecluse] You are drafting a bill on participation. In addition to the financial aspect, how do you plan to encourage the participation of employees in the enterprise? [Giraud] With the bill on participation and profit-sharing which I will present in the spring session, staff share-ownership will be given real recognition with greater involvement of staff representatives in supervision and management councils. The distribution of profit-sharing funds will now be such that it cannot benefit a particular category of employees as is still the case with the 1990 legislation. With regard to participation, the conditions for drawing up group agreements will be made more flexible to encourage procedures which enable all the employees of different companies to benefit from the group's health. The first draft of the law also makes provision for the creation of a time-saving account and the adaptation of profit-sharing to this provision. For instance, it will be possible to allocate profit-sharing in the form of time following agreement from the social partners. In order to have an effect on employment, the leave resulting from this capitalization would be a minimum of six months.
