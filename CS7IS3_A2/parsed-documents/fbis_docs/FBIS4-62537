The partnership of the European Union's fledgling defense group will help Latvia regulate relations with Russia, Levits said. Levits described cooperation with the WEU as "entrance into NATO via detour." As reported, the three Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, as well as six East European countries, were offered WEU "associate partner" status Monday in Luxembourg. In addition, the Baltic defense ministers met in Luxembourg by themselves and decided to join efforts to refute Russia's "alternative Partnership for Peace" program in the forthcoming Nordic defense ministers' conference, said Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis.
