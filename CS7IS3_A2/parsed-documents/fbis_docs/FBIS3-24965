Speaking to ZNBC [Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation] in Kalulushi today, Mr. Mumba said it was unacceptable for the workers to expect the council to award them 1,000 kwacha transport allowance when their homes are less than a kilometer from their work place. Mr. Mumba said the council has already awarded the workers the 5 percent allowance, an indication of the council's commitment to the welfare of workers. Meanwhile, garbage is pilling up in the town as workers continue with the strike.
