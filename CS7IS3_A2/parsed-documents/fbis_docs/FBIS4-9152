From my position here, I can see Mr. Ion Iliescu, PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and Mr. Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the Romanian Government, taking their seats in the Presidium. [Unidentified correspondent] [words indistinct] the Bucharest talks, and whether you fixed a deadline for the signing of a future agreement. ['Arafat] We are still continuing our negotiations and it seems that, this evening, we will continue these talks, thanks to the president's kindness. We hope to unite all the bridges of understanding and solve the differences between us. I am sure of that, particularly in view of the goodwill shown by Mr. Peres, and we will make progress in the peace process. [Manea] Magdalena Manea of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. Mr. 'Arafat, Mr. Peres, would you say that there are similarities between the conflict in Bosnia, former Yugoslavia, and the current conflict in your region? Are you maybe waiting for the Bosnian conflict to be resolved first? ['Arafat] Definitely we are eager to see the Bosnian conflict resolved. I do not like to call it Bosnian, I would like to call it a part of the Balkanization process. This is not the first time that a Balkanization is going on in this region, after World War I and World War II. Therefore, here we are faced with a third kind of war, a hot and cold war. We are doing all our best to find a solution to this conflict. Actually, I do not like to call it conflict. After all, can there be a conflict among brothers? [Peres] I do not know enough about the conflict in Yugoslavia, but Tolstoy said that all happy families are happy when they are alive. If they are unhappy, they can be unhappy in different ways. Consequently, Yugoslavia's unhappiness is different from the unhappiness prevailing in the Middle East. In Yugoslavia, you had an aggressor and a victim, while in the Middle East, you have two negotiators striving to end this conflict. ['Arafat] If you will permit to butt in, I have good relations with all the sides and I am doing all my best for a solution, without propaganda. I am trying to do all my best, but without too much fuss. This is my mission. [Iliescu] The conflict in Bosnia has [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] AFP. There are rumors that Rabin and 'Arafat will sign an accord around 3-4 May. Can you confirm that you have reached an agreement with Mr. 'Arafat in this respect? Can you specify the day when the aforementioned accord will be signed? The question has already been put to you, I believe. [Peres] I believe that Chairman 'Arafat has already said that we will try to find the time for further consultations tonight. I do not think that we can announce a date in this respect. First of all, we would like to be very sure in this respect. Any deadline should be observed, consequently, we should properly prepare the latest chapter of our negotiations. [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to ask both Mr. 'Arafat and Mr. Peres whether they have made any headway during their talks in Bucharest and what are the specific fields where progress was made? And a second question -- what, in your opinion, are the most difficult obstacles to overcome in connection with the agreement signed in Washington? [Peres] Well, we have the following problems. One has to do with the present schedule for the withdrawal, since there will be an overlapping period. We do not know exactly how to solve these parallelisms. In the meantime, we will hand over the administration and security to the Palestinian side and we are trying to resolve this in the most pragmatic possible way. As far as I am concerned, I have learned from Mr. 'Arafat about his priorities and we will obviously take his feelings and preferences into consideration and try to satisfy them. [Unidentified correspondent] I have two questions for Mr. Peres. The communist regime has made that today's Romania should be the country of (?immigration) [words indistinct]. How do you see the further evolution of the Jewish community in our country? [words indistinct] The second question: What is the Israeli Government's policy regarding the issue of the Jewish assets confiscated by the (?communist) regime? [Peres] Well, to answer the first question, each Jew has the right to say where he wants to live, here or in Israel. We are very glad that 400,000 Jews had the possibility to emigrate to Israel. We are grateful to the Romanian people for enabling this emigration and I told Romania's president that Romania has made an investment of friendship in Israel, where there is a sentiment of friendship toward Romania. Both the Romanian side and we ourselves share the same sentiments. If there are still some 60,000 Jews left in Romania, the majority of them are elderly people and I am convinced that the Romanian Government -- and I hope the Romanian people, too -- will consider them as equal citizens, without antisemitic sentiments. On the issue of compensations, I believe that the Jewish agency will negotiate this matter and will solve it. [Correspondent] JOURNAL DE GENEVE. Chairman 'Arafat, what is stage of the installation of the PLO administration in the respective territories and of the preparations for the forthcoming arrival of individuals and authorities from the Palestinian diaspora in Gaza and Jericho? ['Arafat] It is very difficult to give an answer to this question, because it a lot depends on Israel, in this respect. When they withdraw, we will start the takeover process. Hence, the need for this overlapping period of taking over and giving up certain prerogatives, after which the police force will have to intervene, in the presence of certain international bodies. I hope, that if I have the opportunity, I will go there myself. [Jaganaru] Ana Juganaru from the JURNAL NATIONAL. I have a question for Chairman 'Arafat. Can a final agreement be reached without the consultation of Syria and Jordan? I also have another question for Foreign Minister Peres. Can the Israeli Government return the territories without the approval of the Knesset or a plebiscite? ['Arafat] I see that you are worried about the approval of our brothers, the Syrians. We have contacts with all our brothers in the Arab world and they are present even here, at this conference. We are coordinating all our actions with the Arab League. [Peres] As a matter of fact, Prime Minister Rabin submitted these agreements to the Knesset and the Knesset approved them. Therefore, we were empowered by the Knesset to continue our efforts and implement these agreements. Therefore, you should not be worried about this. The Knesset has already endorsed them. [Dumitrescu] Rodica Dumitrescu. Will Mr. 'Arafat leave Romania this evening, tonight, or tomorrow morning? ['Arafat] I see that you would like to know the exact date. I am sorry, but I cannot give you the list of my appointments. I like this friendly country and people and, for the sake of his excellency, I would like to sojourn here as long as possible, but then, as you probably know, I have a lot of other things to do. [Duma] Mircea Duma from CATAVENCU ACADEMY. I just want to make an announcement. According to our information, Mr. 'Arafat left the country last night. [laughter, applause] [Ionescu] Victor Ionescu from Romanian Television. Mr. Peres, Mr. 'Arafat, if you were the counselor of the other side in the current stage of your negotiations, what advice would you give to the other? If you were Mr. 'Arafat's counselor, for instance, what advice would you give him? And the other way round. [Peres] Well, I would advise him to accept the Israeli proposals. [laughter] Actually, we have to find the common ground. I would like to give you a serious answer. There is an Israeli opposition and a Palestinian opposition to this process and our task is not to force the Palestinians to accept our views or the Palestinians the oblige us to accept their views. We are striving to find common ground that is acceptable to both sides. ['Arafat] The most important thing is to reach a conclusion and an agreement between the two sides. To be an adviser of one or the other side, well, I hope that in either case I would hope that an urgent withdrawal takes place, as well as a quick implementation of the already signed accords. [Peres] As far as Israel is concern, we would like to leave Gaza and never go back there again. We are extremely serious, and I would like to express my hope and desire that this plan becomes a successful reality and that Chairman 'Arafat can accomplish that. [Hudginson] Chris Hudginson from THE NEW YORK TIMES. I would like to ask Chairman 'Arafat, now that the withdrawal has been delayed so much, once the agreement is finalized, how long do you think the Israelis will remain in Gaza and Jericho? [words indistinct] What are the main points which are still hampering the progress of the agreements? ['Arafat] If there is a will, there is a way. This is the most important thing. If there is an agreement, time will not be an obstacle. We have many experiences from the past. Well, it should not take longer than a few days. I was told this clearly by the generals that accompanied Mr. Peres at the latest meetings and talks in Davos, Oslo, and Cairo. [Hudginson] Mr. Chairman, what do you find most frustrating? You have said many times that you are ready, you are ready to go in, but the talks were still delayed and people are talking about another two weeks. What is most frustrating in the negotiations with the Israelis? ['Arafat] It is very difficult to give you such details when we are in the middle of negotiations. I think that the actions will speak for themselves. [Text] [Martalogu] Victor Martalogu of ROMPRES. My question is also directed to the two distinguished guests. Two years ago, in 1991, at the time when the declaration of principle was signed in Washington, the press in Romania and in other countries referred to Romania as the major, unjustified absentee. Now, at the Crans Montana Forum conference, a forum that generally and primarily approaches economic issues in democracies that are undergoing the process of transition, the issue of Middle East comes up and the officials involved in it are invited to Bucharest. Do you see or do you admit that there is a connection between Romania's role of mediator -- which has not always been recognized -- 5-6 years ago and the current situation, and do you see the possibility that Romania will receive a more active role in this process? [Iliescu] I believe that any country that can (?relaunch) contacts and negotiations is welcome to do so. We could also see it in a more distant past. Even a small country with limited potential such as Romania, but which has the advantage to maintain normal and open relations with Arab countries and with Israel, could at the respective time facilitate such contacts. More recently, a country such as Norway offered to host the negotiations and talks between the two sides, which resulted in the Washington accord. Today's example, the opportunity given by the Crans Montana Forum, shows that if it is based on good will -- and this good will was shown by the representatives of the two sides -- this opportunity can be used to support the positive progress of contacts. Thus, Romania is open to offer all kinds of such support for the continuation of dialogue and the promotion of the peace process. [Unidentified correspondent] Actually I am....[pauses] Okay, I think I have the possibility of asking two questions. My name is [words indistinct] and I am the editor of a Palestinian newspaper published in Jerusalem. First I want to ask President 'Arafat a question in connection with his recent trip to Moscow and Eastern European countries. We are currently noticing a new development in relations between Palestinians and Eastern Europe. We hope that this new development will lead to positive results both in the political and peace process and in the economic relations that we hope to establish between Eastern Europe and the future Palestinian state. We hope that Romania... and this is a question for Romania's president, is there going to be a development of economic relations as well as commercial relations between Palestine and Romania? Now a question for Mr. Peres: We are now seeing two important economic conferences. There are high hopes of progress for the implementation of the Oslo Agreement. These high hopes were dashed at the Davos meeting. I would like to ask you which are the problems that have been left for the last chapter, as you call it, to be discussed and how long will it take until these issues are solved? Then, there is the question of land and territories. According to the peace process, a new check point is being built at the moment between Jericho and the rest of the West Bank. According to the time table, the Palestinian authority will be established within six months in the rest of the West Bank. Are we going to face the same problems or are we going to move faster in the future? [Peres] Both sides made very serious efforts for progress. It is possible that we are going to conclude the negotiations with a two to three week delay, but do not forget that we have to take into account the complex nature of problems that we are facing and certain unfortunate events. And I want to say, on behalf of my government, that any victim on the Palestinian side is considered by us with the same pain as any victim on our side. An end should be put to this. Extremists should not stop the peace process and I have the impression that we are very close to the beginning of new relations. There are many issues, but many of them are of a technical nature and some of them are of issues of principle and, as Mr. 'Arafat said, we do not want to hold negotiations in the open but behind closed doors and on friendly terms. Thus, about the continuation of negotiations, to answer your question, there will be two continuations. One, the so-called early empowerment, namely turning the responsibility in many areas over to the Palestinian authorities in the Gaza strip. This will be done in the same framework in which we negotiate the overall Gaza-Jericho arrangement. Parallel, we will open negotiations soon, we hope, in Washington to conclude this problem of authority. I believe that the presidents who helped a great deal will also help in accelerating the talks within these negotiations. Because it has been very difficult for both sides to pave the way for something Chairman 'Arafat said was unprecedented, and I know that many of our Palestinian friends are concerned in their hearts that we are delaying things. But it is not so. I want to tell you that we know each other from Jerusalem and Israel, and I would like to tell you very openly that our government is determined to conclude the negotiations and to respect the Palestinian decisions represented by Chairman 'Arafat, namely to depart from declarations and confrontation and to proceed to the world of reality. Thus I am indeed convinced that Chairman 'Arafat will be the first Palestinian leader who will bring home not a declaration, not simply a gesture, but real peace, authority, and solutions in geographic terms in all of the Middle East. We are going to work together and I also appreciate the expression Chairman 'Arafat made this afternoon, which is normal, namely we said farewell to the use of guns, terror, violence, and war and we are going to negotiate only for the future, as we also convened in Oslo, through diplomatic means. ['Arafat] We should not forget that Russia is one of the cosponsors of this accord. We have very good relations with them. We have had a joint committee and a standing bureau since we participated in the Madrid conference, and they are still functioning now. We had very positive and constructive talks with President Yeltsin two days ago. They promised to continue their efforts aimed at giving an impetus to the peace process. Regarding my visit here, you should not forget that I am an old visitor to this country, this is not the first time I am here. I have had a very long-standing relationship with the president, from the times when we were both students, in 1956. Can you imagine that? He was the boss. I was not the boss, he was [as heard]. We have to thank His Excellency for his coordination and cooperation, not only in bringing me and Mr. Peres together for continuing our peace efforts, but also in promoting multilateral ties among us at all levels. We have very many students here. We are looking forward to further developing our economic relations. We are hoping to receive assistance in our country's reconstruction. [Iliescu] In this respect, I would like to add that, in my talks with Chairman 'Arafat, we tackled this issue of reconstruction, the problem of infrastructure, and the participation of Romanian companies in this process. Apropos our cooperation, we also have very good ties with Israel, and this joint cooperation can be a good example of joint participation in the reconstruction efforts, to the benefit of all sides. [Unidentified correspondent] Israeli Radio-Television. I would like to put a question to Mr. 'Arafat. Do you share Mr. Peres' assessment that the negotiations will conclude in two to three weeks? And a second question. Do you believe that the latest news from Cairo is good and satisfactory? Do you have anything positive to say in connection with the latest news from Cairo and the developments of recent days? Would you say that the situation is good, or rather bad? ['Arafat] We hope, but I do not have concrete information about what happened today in Cairo. What I was told is that the talks were suspended this afternoon, to be resumed next Sunday. We hope that we will have some concrete results in the following week. Likewise, we can say that we hope to have a final agreement. We hope so. [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the news conference is over.
