But fate so decreed -- 4 February saw the completion of the almost two-month marathon to choose the new head of the Pentagon. Reports that President Bill Clinton had chosen William Perry as his latest candidate for the post of defense secretary were headlined in various ways in different American newspapers: "Mathematics Professor Gets Difficult Job"; "Pentagon Number Two Becomes Number One." All of them got it right. Hitherto he held the post of first deputy secretary of defense, a very responsible post but one, in general terms, with a not very high public profile. In this capacity, as the right-hand man to the retiring Les Aspin, William Perry played a considerable role in preparing and implementing the revision of the strategic concept for America's military-organizational development. He also gained a detailed grasp of all the nuances and subtleties of the budget battles in and around Congress. He also managed to build working, and to some extent personal, contacts with the top U.S. generals. Addressing hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Perry stated that in his activity at the head of the U.S. defense machine he intends to continue to a considerable extent the strategic course set by his predecessor and former boss. This is not surprising. First, he himself had a hand in formulating this line and, second, the main guidelines of the country's military policy are dictated by perfectly obvious objective factors. There is no way Perry can get away from the need to reform the Armed Forces, nor can he ignore the increasing requirement for American troops to participate in multinational coalitions, including when peacekeeping operations are being conducted. However, some new strands can also be detected in the new defense secretary's first public statements. Among these one might single out the point that henceforth American troop contingents -- whether they are under the UN flag or NATO auspices -- will nonetheless be under American national command. The only exception envisaged is for small units up to company level. Definite conclusions have evidently been drawn from the Somalia operation, whose none too successful outcome had a negative impact on the Clinton administration's prestige and did not strengthen the former defense secretary's position, either. All the indications are that William Perry will also have a new approach to the problems of forming the defense budget. He does not intend to repeat the mistake made by Les Aspin, who advocated a drastic and substantial reduction in U.S. military expenditure. This is why the word both on Capitol Hill and on the right bank of the Potomac is already that this process is necessary but will be more "cosmetic" in nature. During the Senate hearings Perry himself mentioned a shortfall of $20 billion in the draft budget for fiscal 1995. Avoiding categorical statements as to whether he agrees or disagrees with this kind of deficit, the new Pentagon boss promised to find the money earmarked for paying servicemen's wages at the new, increased rate by cutting expenditure on certain weapons systems. So all the niceties will be observed: We have cuts in the military budget but they do not undermine the foundations of combat readiness (since cutting expenditure on these weapons systems one way or another had been suggested under the previous leadership). It is easier to understand William Perry's skill or, if you like, his inventiveness when you remember that before the Pentagon he headed up a number of enterprises in the U.S. defense industry, including big ones like United Technologies and FMC, and that he also worked for a big investment banking company in Sam Francisco. The defense secretary's career resume is indeed an impressive one. He is a mathematician by training who studied at Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania, the holder of many academic titles and degrees, and a member of the National Engineering Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Committee on International Security and Arms Control under the National Academy of Sciences. He has been a member of a group of advisers to the foreign intelligence service, the Senate Technology Review Commission, and the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie International Foundation. In the early sixties he was a Pentagon technical expert, and in the Carter administration he held the post of deputy secretary for research and development and was in charge of arms purchases. In "scrutinizing" the as yet still a contender for the defense secretaryship, as is common practice in America (it was precisely this which finished off the previous candidate for Pentagon leader, retired admiral Robert Inman) journalists noted William Perry's great erudition. In their words, Perry has a pretty good knowledge of the works of Victor Hugo and Graham Greene. He has pretty liberal views on the role of women in the armed forces. Perry himself has five daughters, and his wife is an accountant and economist. U.S. senators consider that 67-year-old William Perry will be "an excellent defense secretary" and "a real professional with enormous practical experience." He was given a similar testimonial by President Clinton when he nominated Perry for the post of defense secretary. The new Pentagon boss' view of relations with Russia and its immediate neighbors is not without interest for us. The development of events in Russia, he says, can and must be controlled only by the Russians themselves. At the same time Perry agrees with Bill Clinton's view that help for the implementation of democratic reforms in Russia is a most important priority for U.S. national security and the policy of ensuring lasting and stable peace. William Perry also sees it as one of his most important tasks in his new post to promote the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia. It has been reported from Washington that top officials in the U.S. Administration offered the post of defense secretary to almost a dozen prominent American politicians and businessmen. Virtually all of them, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, former Republican Senator Warren Rudman, and Martin Marietta boss Norman Augustine turned down this honored but exacting post. William Perry joyfully accepted. He believes that in his new job he will be able to worthily serve his country and the American people.
