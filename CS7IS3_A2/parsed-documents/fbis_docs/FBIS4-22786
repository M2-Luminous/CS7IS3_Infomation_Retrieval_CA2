It is a notable fact. But the real sensation is in the data it published on the state of crime. The report says proudly: "For the first time over the past five years, through the common efforts of state and regional structures, the growth of crime has been somewhat contained. In 1993 it increased by only 1.4 percent." One would think we should cheer such a progress. But somehow we are not happy. Over the entire past year militia officers of all ranks, led by Minister Viktor Yerin, had been scaring us with tales of crime, quoting figures and facts, and saying that it was growing at a horrible rate. They also explained the causes: imperfect laws, insufficient powers of the MVD, loyalty to criminals, and so on. So what happened? Is it that we were being scared on purpose and now the deception has come out? More likely it is now that an attempt is being made to deceive us. Many jurists maintain that there has been no real improvement in the situation. If one carefully reads the MVD report, it becomes clear that it contains far more significant data than the miserly percentage points of the total increase in crime. Judge for yourself. What kind of success are we talking about when grave offenses--those that really frighten everyone--have increased over the year by one-quarter? Premeditated murders are up by 27 percent; grave bodily injury, by 24 percent; assaults, by 32 percent; robberies, by 12 percent; incidents of hooliganism, by 31 percent; and the increase in the registered incidence of swindling amounted to a whopping 140 percent. The overall decline is achieved mainly by "trifles." But the worst part is that crimes are not being solved. In one-half of the instances--which is 1,360,000 crimes--the culprits have not been found. One more important point. Departmental statistics do not correspond to reality--they embellish it. A considerable number of crimes by different means are deliberately kept out of reporting by the militia. Many of those who have been victimized by criminals know that local militia precincts are reluctant to register citizens' claims. Under all sorts of pretexts the victims are persuaded not to file a claim or are forced to change the circumstances of the event. The purpose is simple--to avoid registering the crime. If they succeed, it immediately improves two indicators of militia work: reports on crime and reports on solving crimes. For the sake of good indicators, criminal proceedings are not initiated, investigations are not conducted, nobody looks for criminals, and they continue with impunity, committing new crimes. The situation with respect to car theft is indicative. According to the MVD report, over the past year there have been 60,415 -- 3,067 fewer than in 1992. Who will really believe that fewer cars get stolen? The explanation is quite different: Not all victims' claims are registered by militia. It is impossible to develop reasonably effective measures for combating crime when we have reports that so clearly contradict real life: It is hard to cure a disease when one does not know the diagnosis. But our militia commanders want so much to look good in the eyes of their superiors. As a result, while admitting in the report that crime is a social phenomenon, and that problems are growing, the MVD nevertheless promises to somewhat "restrain" crime. The MVD is willing to admit its "own shortcomings and considerable reserves to increase the efforts," but insists that their department still "is a steadily functioning state structure capable of mobilizing and effectively carrying out the tasks set for it. Attempts of some political forces to weaken it and compromise it have been unsuccessful." With such conclusions, it is hard to count on truthfulness in MVD reports on its activities. Because any criticism of the agency may be labeled a subversive action. Of course, from time to time manipulations involving failures to register crimes come into the open. Sometimes it happens because citizens complain; more often, as a result of procuracy audits. Last year, for instance, the Procuracy registered more than 40,000 crimes unregistered by militia--almost five percent more than in 1992. It is impossible, however, to place a procurator to look over every militiaman's shoulder. Besides, what can the auditors do considering that their bosses, too, demand that crime be "reduced?" What to do? At this point, probably the only solution is in a more active position of local authorities. To a great extent, the material and technical equipment of militia and personnel matters are in their hands. The national crime suppression program is useful, of course, but it will not be a panacea--the main burden will still remain on the shoulders of local budgets. So why pay for fake crime reports when people are afraid to leave the house at night?
