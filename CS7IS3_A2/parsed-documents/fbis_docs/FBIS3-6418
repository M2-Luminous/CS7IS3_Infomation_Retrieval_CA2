At a time of reform, when the state of the political and official communities is encountering serious criticism following the collapse of the 1955 system, it is impossible for the business community to be immune from criticism. The prolonged recession, which is said to be the worst one since World War II, may be one of the causes of such an opinion. I am vice chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations. I think it is worthwhile in its own way for me to express my own, impartial views as a member of the business community. Before I attempt that, it will be necessary to review the historical roles that the four economic organizations have played. In making a fresh start from the ruins following the end of the Pacific war, Japan's first objective was economic revival. "Catching up and passing developed nations through attaining economic growth" was the consensus of opinion of the whole nation. For nearly half a century since then, Japan has devoted itself solely to the pursuit of economic growth. For that purpose, each business had to be internationally competitive. For Japan, which is dependent on other nations for resources, to attain economic growth, it had no alternative but to increase its exports. In this period, the efforts of each business to make profits and to develop and expand its scale led to the growth of macroeconomics. Therefore, the government assisted enterprises, and the Japanese public made efforts to develop enterprises, which made yearly wage increases possible, and the Japanese standard of living improved substantially. Working hard for enterprises benefited individual workers and benefited the nation as a whole. In this way, in Japan, the government, enterprises, and the people had the same idea, and they made a concerted effort to develop the so-called Japan, Inc. In that process, the role of the four economic organizations were to insist on what enterprises wanted to do for the economic development of Japan as the representatives of the business community as a whole, to ask for the assistance of the government, and to ask for the understanding of the people. The four economic organizations had different roles to play: Keidanren (Japan Federation of Economic Organizations) represented large enterprises as the organ of business organizations; Nikkeiren (Japan Federation of Employers Associations) principally handled labor-management relations and matters related to employment; Keizaidoyukai (Japanese Association of Corporate Executives) served as the place where each executive can express his personal opinions; and Nissho (Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry) served as the representative of an enormous number of minor enterprises throughout the country. If a goal is well defined, the method for achieving it will be devised accordingly. What the four economic organizations did to achieve their goals according to the methods they devised was of great benefit to the Japanese public and Japan, as well as to businesses. Japan enjoyed such a period. This system began to exhibit some changes, probably about 10 years ago. Statistically speaking, Japan's per capita national income exceeded that of [West] Germany in 1985 and even exceeded that of the United States in 1988. At least on the surface, Japan's national goal after the war was achieved in a way. And the next goal was not well defined. At the present stage in which the Japanese economy has attained full growth and the only demand existing is the replacement of what the people already have, such as electrical home appliances and automobiles, no amount of new products and no amount of price reductions will expand domestic demand greatly. In the field of exports, a great trade imbalance has bred tension, and the appreciation of the yen has decreased the competitiveness of Japanese products overseas. In short, it has become impossible for Japan to concentrate its energies on the growth of its economy as in the past. Moreover, although Japan has accomplished its goals from the standpoint of statistical figures, a number of problems still remain to be solved. These are problems such as housing, an aging society, and the environment, none of which can be surmounted by economic growth. To accomplish economic growth, the principle of "efficiency first" will be pursued, the concentration of people in one area will be continued, and the problem of housing will never be solved. Furthermore, if the economy grows, personnel costs will inevitably rise, making the care of the aged practically impossible. With regard to the environment, it is certain to deteriorate with the growth of the economy. Once the goals that Japan has been pursuing are accomplished, the Japan, Inc. established for that purpose should be dissolved, and the relationship between politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community should be changed greatly. Under the present circumstances in which the next goals are not well defined, a new relationship between them inevitably remains unclear. As far as Japan, Inc. is concerned, nothing but the unfavorable aspects of the cooperation between politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community remain -- which have come to be censured as the iron triangle composing the collusion between politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community. The estrangement of the Japanese public on the one hand and politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community on the other hand was at the point of rearing its head in the period of high economic growth, especially during 1965-75, when the problems of pollution became acute. At that time, the relationship between the two was somehow restored through the serious application of antipollution measures, which was considered to be the "social responsibility of enterprises." However, what little trust the Japanese public had in the business world and the government was completely lost because of land speculation at the height of the bubble economy and because of the Recruit scandal, the issue of securities firms' compensating clients for losses, and the current recession. To overcome the current recession, we must regain the trust of the public by implementing political reform, administrative reform, and economic reform; by setting a new goal for Japan, and by establishing a new relationship for cooperation between politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community to attain that goal. The problems of the four economic organizations must be reconsidered in that context. The Background of the Birth of the Four Economic Organizations In August 1993, the long-term, one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] collapsed, and the coalition government was established. Around that time, Keidanren stopped acting as a middleman for political funds. At the time when politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community formed a trinity in Japan, Inc., the contribution of political funds was a chain which connected the three. Of course, even at that time, the public should have dimly perceived that some of the political donations were unlawful. It is quite natural for the public to suspect that "they are bribes." At the time of the cold war, however, the majority of the public preferred the long-term, one-party rule of the LDP to the administration of the Social Democratic Party of Japan. The public may have been in the mood to tolerate the contribution of political funds which were used to support the long-term administration if that was of benefit to the public, for these political donations were not taxes imposed on the public. However, the prices of goods rose sharply with the growth of the economy, and the amount of funds needed to support the administration increased. Meanwhile, the conditions for political donations became strict because of the enactment of a law regulating political funds. Driven by these two contradictory forces, scandals such as the Recruit scandal, the Saga Kyubin scandal, and the general contractor scandals occurred in succession, although such scandals used to occur only once every five or 10 years. Furthermore, it became evident that the collusion between the government and the business community did not necessarily benefit the public. At a time when food, clothing, and shelter were inadequate, the lives of salarymen became remarkably richer with the growth of enterprises and with the increase of wages every year. However, at the present time, when our society has become rich enough to have almost all the necessities of life, the realization that the mere increase of income does not bring happiness to individuals has spread among the public. There is a growing desire among people to give priority to themselves, their families, and their friends because they consider it unbearable to work desperately for their companies only to die of overwork. It is natural for public opinion to favor the discontinuation of political donations if the promotion of policies facilitated by donations by the business and financial communities benefits not the public but rather exclusively enterprises. Meanwhile, what kind of kickback can enterprises expect for contributing political funds? Excepting some enterprises, no rights and interests have been awarded; no subsidies have been granted; no tax exemptions have been awarded. On the contrary, enterprises which make political donations solely "to avoid ill treatment" are increasing in number. Moreover, public opinion preferred a change in the system, by which reform could be implemented through changing the administration, to maintaining the status quo -- the protection of vested interests -- under the long-term, one-party rule of the LDP. I think that it is for this reason that Keidanren has decided to stop acting as a middleman for political donations. There is no denying the fact that the discontinuation of acting as a middleman for political donations has been one of the reasons that triggered the opinion that the four economic organizations are unnecessary. It is an undeniable fact that we considered an economic organization to be an agency which made requests to the government as the representative of enterprises. The political donations made through Kokumin Seiji Kyokai [People's Political Association] were a guarantee that those requests would be enacted, and those donations were also funds to protect the LDP government. It is also true that political donations given through Kokumin Seiji Kyokai are cleaner than those given by enterprises individually. However, political donations came to be perceived as the means by which the economic organization reflected the egoism of the business community in government policies. In other words, there were people who considered the economic organizations to be agencies which forced the egoism of the business community on the government. If that is true, the business community will lose its reason for being. However, is it really true? What Are the New Goals? Before I answer that question, I will narrow down my discourse to Nikkeiren, whose vice chairman I am. As I mentioned before, the problem of employment is the primary concern of Nikkeiren. We may term employment problems labor problems. Keidanren was originally established by the executives who felt a sense of crisis concerning the intensification of the labor movement following the end of World War II, in order to protect their management rights from labor problems such as labor disputes and collective bargaining. However, labor problems have undergone a great change because of economic growth and the capital-labor conciliation policy. For example, I think that spring labor offensives, on which Nikkeiren has had a great influence so far, will cease to exist in the future. The reason is that sooner or later it will become impossible to continue the current system under which the basic wage rate is raised every year. Then, if spring labor offensives cease to exist, will Nikkeiren lose its reason for being? The fact is that Nikkeiren, since the time of Chairman Eiji Suzuki, has promoted various projects with the focal point being the lives of workers. If what we have been doing is persuasive and if member companies approve of what we have been doing, Nikkeren will continue to exist. Let us take housing problems, for example. It is certain that the living conditions of the Japanese have improved. However, because of the concentration of people in one area which was caused necessarily by economic growth, land prices have risen sharply. And it has become almost impossible for salarymen working in big cities to buy a house in an area from which they can commute to their jobs in big cities within one hour. To solve this problem, there is no alternative but to restrain the concentration of people in one area, to promote decentralization, and to activate the provinces. As Rengo (Japanese Trade Union Confederation) claims, the rise of nominal wages does not lead to the solution of this problem. Past experience has shown that the rise of nominal wages leads to the rise of land prices. Politics has no choice but to promote the following with full determination: the decentralization of each ministry and agency, reforms of the land system such as constraints on the private ownership of land in urban areas, the improvement of the transportation system, and the improvement of the environment so that living in a local city can compare to living in Tokyo. Deregulation also must be promoted with full determination. To accomplish these goals, there is no alternative but to establish a political system which makes a change of government possible. A change of government means none other than the public's choice, through elections, from among the policies presented by each political party. It is impossible for the government to carry out drastic policies resolutely unless it has the definite support of the majority of the public. It was because of the aforementioned reason that the four economic organizations expressed the view that "political reform should have priority over economic stimulus measures" in reference to the recent political reform bill. The LDP raised the outcry, "Should not the economic organizations say that priority should be given to economic stimulus measures?" However, the position of the four economic organizations is that economic problems cannot be solved unless politics changes. The fact is that the four economic organizations have been advocating the need for political reform for the past few years. Unless Japan reforms itself now, it will suffer a prolonged decline and may well incur a great depression. Political reform is the first step toward that reform. However, it seems that the LDP could not understand our sense of crisis. I think that the four economic organizations must continue to advance such a claim and present concrete measures for realizing the claim from the standpoint of each organization. If the four economic organizations, as economic professionals who stand not only for the business community but also for the public as a whole, actively propose policies and insist that "if you implement these policies, bankruptcies will decrease and employment will be maintained," the public will listen to our proposals and the government will have to implement our proposals, even if the four economic organizations wholly abolish political donations. If many enterprises go bankrupt, that will only lead to the unhappiness of the people. Losing the Raison d'Etre Can Only Mean Going Out of Existence If organizations lose their reason for being, they will have to fade away, and this fact is not confined to economic organizations. If economic organizations are entities which merely contribute political funds and maneuver government policies, member companies will leave their organizations, and such organizations will immediately disappear, even if they do not disband their organizations themselves. In other words, as long as the four economic organizations have their roles to play, member companies will pay their membership dues and the organizations will continue to exist. What then are the four economic organizations' reasons for being? Some supporters of the four economic organizations say that the organizations should survive as think tanks for proposing policies. That is right, but I do not think that is enough. There must be a lot of things other than that which the organizations should do. For example, the peace and prosperity of Japan cannot be attained without the peace and prosperity of its neighboring countries or those of the world. For this purpose, Japan is asked to do a lot of things. Japan's security system, its aid to developing nations, and its contributions to peacekeeping operations are all interwoven and have ceased to be separate problems. Therefore, there must be services we can render as economic professionals. The good management of economics also leads to peace and prosperity. In international as well as domestic problems, what is important is the support of the nation. In that sense, the business community should be able to play a major role in shaping public opinion. Some people express the opinion that the four economic organizations are unnecessary because there are too many of them. It may be that administrative reform is needed in the business community also. However, I have already stated that each of the four economic organizations has a different role to play. It seems that Keidanren receives the most severe criticism, but its opinion counts heavily in Japan's business community, where big businesses form a large percentage of the existing firms. Furthermore, opinions from a group of individual executives such as Keizaidoyukai are valuable because the members are not bound by the resolutions or the interests of their business organizations. When Keidanren was leaning toward egoism, Keizaidoyukai put the brakes on that. For example, it was Keizaidoyukai which advocated social responsibility by enterprises when environmental pollution became an issue. Keizaidoyukai spoke out early on about business ethics, the protection of the environment, and consumer protection. And Nissho, which is the representative of smaller enterprises, is an organization authorized by the law, and it goes without saying that it is still needed at the present stage. I have already discussed Nikkeiren. The four economic organizations have functioned effectively in Japan's economy or in Japan's society because they have played their respective roles well. However, we should think and act with the determination that "losing the reason for being leads to our immediate disappearance." Developed European nations and the United States do not have economic organizations in the form of those found in Japan, although they do have associations. In a sense, economic organizations are found only in developing nations. When viewed in perspective, the day will come when Japan will not need economic organizations. We do not know when that will be. I think that Japan will need the four economic organizations for the next five to 10 years, but I do not know about their future in the 21st century. That does not bother me. I think it is meaningless to make efforts to save economic organizations which have lost their reason for being. If economic organizations become organizations whose only reason for being is to receive honors from the government, their existence is meaningless. Many owner-executives who are a generation younger than we are seem to be less conscious of their country and society than are the old executives, who have acted with due consideration for the interest of their country as well. They tend to think only of their enterprises and themselves and to view things only from the standpoint of "What advantage will we gain if we become members of the organization?" I sometimes feel that it will not be easy for them to take a broad view of their society and country. Or, that may be natural. It may be essentially unnatural if enterprises think, talk, and act like the government or if employees and labor unions think like executives. Therefore, it can be said that they, our next generation, may be the ones who are thinking naturally. We have regarded a sovereign nation as an absolute entity, and that has been the center of all our thinking. However, the authority of sovereign nations is diminishing or breaking up, while various countries are moving toward a loose unity. That is the actual situation of the world today. Economics is also becoming global and borderless. It is a plain fact that the four economic organizations, whose primary concern has been about Japan, are being pressed to change amid all of this.
