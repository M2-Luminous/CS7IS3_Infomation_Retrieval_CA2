FR940810-0-00053 FR940810-0-00021 In 1991 both agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to share information which will aid their enforcement efforts. Pursuant to that MOU, OSHA is developing with EPA an information sharing system based on the reports submitted both to EPA and to various states upon delegation from EPA to access that information to help OSHA target asbestos removal jobs. OSHA also believes that at this time some EPA delegated states, and OSHA state plan states have worked out ways to share notifications. OSHA believes that utilizing the EPA data to assist in targeting inspections will be more effective than duplicative reporting requirements. The Agency believes, based on its own enforcement experience that a limited notification requirement may enhance compliance in specified circumstances. Employers who choose to use new or modified control technology to reduce exposures in Class I asbestos work, must notify OSHA in advance, using EPA's NESHAP reporting form. Such information about new and/or modified asbestos control technology submitted to OSHA by employers who wish to use it will provide accessible information for the Agency to use to evaluate such technologies. OSHA believes that requiring employers to routinely submit to the Agency their data in support of claims of the effectiveness of new technology will help OSHA, employers and employees and their representatives to evaluate its effectiveness promptly. Shipyard Employment Standard One area of the proposed standard to which SESAC raised objection was the requirement that OSHA be notified 10 days prior to initiating work on large scale asbestos operations. In addition to reiterating many of the objections to the provision raised by others, they pointed out that often they must immediately work on ships which enter their shipyards and turn them around quickly and that the delay caused by the notification would be overly burdensome. As OSHA explained above, notification of OSHA is required only when Class I operations are undertaken and alternate methods of control, other than the negative-pressure enclosure methodology, is to be employed. This provision applies both in the construction and shipyard employment standards. B. Notification of Other Employers and Subsequent Owners The Court remanded the issue of whether OSHA should, as recommended by BCTD, require employers contracting asbestos-related work to establish, maintain and transfer to building owners written records of the presence and locations of asbestos or asbestos products, in order to facilitate identification and prevention of asbestos hazards. As noted in the 1990 remand proposal, the Court remanded this issue so that the Agency may reach ``its own judgment on the issue'' of whether it was legally empowered to adopt such a requirement (See BCTD v. Brock, supra at 1278). OSHA concludes that BCTD has made a persuasive case for the need to expand the notification provisions to other employer and building owners and from them to subsequent employers with exposed employees. This is a necessary way to informing subsequent employers that their employees are at risk of asbestos exposure and of the need to take appropriate precautions. Requiring building owners to maintain and provide this information is by far the most effective way of notifying employers of exposed employees who are doing work many years after the asbestos was identified. OSHA has developed an information transfer scheme concerning the presence of asbestos in buildings and structures which may present a hazard to employees which is more comprehensive than the recommendation of BCTD. The approach places the primary compliance burden on the building and/or facility owner, even though the employees at risk may not be the owner's direct employees. Thus, this final standard confirms OSHA's tentative view in the proposal, that it has authority to require building owners who are statutory employers to take necessary and appropriate remedial action such as notifying other employers, to protect employees other than their own (see 55 FR at 29729). The proposed hazard communication provision limited the building owner's communication obligations to ``available'' information concerning the presence and location of asbestos. Now, in the final standard, the building owner must communicate his knowledge of the presence and location of ACM, based on ``available'' information, and, new to the final standard, of the presence and location of certain high risk materials, which are presumed to contain asbestos (PACM), unless the building was constructed or renovated after 1979 or is rebutted using laboratory analysis. Further details of this provision are spelled out later in this preamble. Issue 9. Competent Person. The Court remanded to OSHA to determine whether employers engaged in any kind of asbestos related construction work should be required to designate ``competent persons'' to oversee safety measures, or whether, as in the 1986 standard, employers should only be required to designate trained ``competent persons'' for asbestos removal, demolition, and renovations operations that are not small-scale, short duration. The court requested that OSHA either expand the ``competent person'' requirement or provide a more persuasive explanation of its refusal to do so.
