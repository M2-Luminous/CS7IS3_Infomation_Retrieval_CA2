FBIS3-48870 "dreas020__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-020-A Document Type:Daily Report 31 January 1994 ANNEX Japan New Government Procurement Program Revealed OW3001213894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3001213894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The contents of a new action program being drafted by the government to improve the government procurement system have been revealed. Key points in the draft program are that: 1) open competitive bidding will be carried out in a more thorough manner; 2) initially, application of the open bidding will be expanded to projects of more than 500,000 SDR [special drawing rights] (from the current 1,000,000 SDR); 3) a comprehensive evaluation system which takes into consideration factors other than price will be introduced; and 4) a new complaint arbitration body to deal with overall government procurement will be inaugurated. The government decided earlier on a plan to open up public works projects, and is now discussing procurement of communications equipment and medical equipment in Japan-U.S. economic consultations. The government wants to stress its position on market liberalization by presenting a comphrehensive action program which attaches importance to transparency and internationality even in government procurement in nonspecified sectors. In a meeting of the Action Program Implementation Promotion Committee (chaired by Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura) on 27 January, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa formally instructed Deputy Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara to prepare a new action program aimed at improving the government procurement system. The program is expected to be finalized by early February and to be announced at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February. While past plans aimed at improving the government procurement system have dwelled on such specific commodities and fields as supercomputers and public works projects, the new action program will apply in principle to all equipment, commodities, and services procured by the government. It is an action in recognition of criticism against "the bureaucrat-businessman colluded structure" that arose in the wake of the scandals involving general construction companies. According to the draft, the new actiaon program first of all advocates thorough application of opening tenders. Under the Accounting Law, government procurements are supposed to be conducted through open bidding in principle, but they are mostly conducted by designated bidding or free contracts in actual practice. Given the circumstances, the draft restricts the cases wherein designated bidding and contracts ad libitum are allowed, and specifically note when they are allowed. The draft also proposes announcing the numbers and value of procurements have been conducted through opening bidding, designated bidding, and free contracts, and what part of them are from local sources and what part from foreign sources. In addition, with regard to large value procurements which are required to be announced in advance, the value of the procurements for announcement will be lowered from the current 1 million SDR TO 500,000 SDR. All concerned offices will be also required to hold seminars on their purchase plans at the same time. While under the current bidding system, the lowest bidders are basically supposed to win, the new system will have an element of a comprehensive evaluating system. At present, such a system -- adding equipment performance to the price as a factor in deciding on winners -- is used in procuring supercomputers, but in the future the government wants to apply it to telecommunciations and medical equipment. The new action program, in addition, proposes activating a neutral review committee (complaint arbitration committee) which will handle complaints on procurements on areas other than specific sectors like supercomputers. The program suggests empowering the committee with such rights as ordering the suspension of certain bidding processes.
