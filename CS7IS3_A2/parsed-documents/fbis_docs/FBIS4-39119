The president also emphasizes the need to resolve all problems between the two states through political means, in talks around a table. According to the president, the exchange of ideas which took place in Geneva between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin and Raul Malk, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry, demonstrate a willingness to seek a mutually satisfactory solution through talks. The elimination of the last vestiges of World War II on 31 August not only presupposes the withdrawal of Russian troops from the former East Germany but also from Estonia and Latvia, President Lennart Meri says. The Estonian president was prompted to explain Estonia's foreign policy by remarks made at a news conference on Saturday [4 June] by Major General Aleksander Einseln, the commander of defense forces. Einseln said on Saturday that the Estonian defense forces are capable of forcibly driving out the Russian military units deployed here. According to the president, any practical solutions about a prompt and unconditional withdrawal from Estonian territory by Russian troops will proceed from Estonian legislation and from decrees and instructions of the Estonian Government. This has been reported by the BALTIC NEWS SERVICE agency.
