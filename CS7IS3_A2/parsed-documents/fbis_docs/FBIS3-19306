Gligorov, who along with Slovene President Milan Kucan was invited to a Europe Dialogue Forum sponsored by Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth, underlined his readiness for immediate talks with the participation of UN mediator Cyrus Vance. For two years, Greece has been trying "irrationally and emotionally" to prevent international recognition of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. The Macedonian president once more denied any territorial claims on the Greek province of the same name and emphasized the need for a peaceful agreement. "Our objective is the Europeanization of the Balkans," Gligorov said. Slovene President Kucan, who had come on a private visit to Bonn just like Gligorov, said that implementing the market economy and full integration into Europe was his supreme objective. Both presidents were planning to pay a courtesy call on Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker on Tuesday.
