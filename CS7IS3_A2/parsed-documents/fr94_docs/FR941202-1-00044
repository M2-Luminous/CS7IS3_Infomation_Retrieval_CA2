FR941202-1-00044 FR941202-1-00006 OSM announced receipt of the proposed revised amendment in the July 14, 1994, Federal Register (39 FR 35871) and reopened and extended the public comment period (administrative record No. UT&hyph;951). The public comment period ended on July 29, 1994. During its review of the revised amendment, OSM identified additional concerns relating to the provisions of Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, the definition of ``continuously mined areas;'' Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553, general provisions on highwalls and backfilling and grading; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.110, backfilling and grading of disturbed areas; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.120, backfilling and grading of spoil and waste; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.130, slope stability requirements; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.510, remining operations on previously mined areas, continuously mined areas and areas with remaining highwalls subject to AOC provisions; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.550, .551, and .552, AOC exceptions; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.650, highwall management under the AOC provisions; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.651, non-mountaintop removal mining on steep slopes; and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.653, the applicability date. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated August 24, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;967). Utah responded by telephone conversation and requested a meeting between the Division and OSM for the purpose of addressing the applicability date issue set forth by OSM in the August 24, 1994, letter. On September 7, 1994, an executive session between the Division and OSM was held at the Western Support Center in Denver, Colorado to discuss the applicability date issue. Notice of the executive session was posted in the Western Support Center (administrative record No. UT&hyph;969). A summary of the executive session was recorded by OSM and entered into the administrative record (administrative record No. UT&hyph;970). By letter dated November 3, 1994, Utah responded to the concerns identified in OSM's August 24, 1994, letter by submitting the revised amendment that is the subject of this notice (administrative record No. UT&hyph;990). The provisions of Utah Admin. R. that Utah proposes to revise and add are: Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, concerning continuously mined areas; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553 and 553.110 through 553.130, concerning general backfilling and grading requirements; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.510, 553.550, 553.552, 553.611 and 553.612, concerning previously and continuously mined areas; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.650 and 553.651, concerning Utah's AOC provisions; and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553&hyph;663 concerning the applicability date of Utah's AOC provisions. Specifically, Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 by limiting its definition of the term ``continuously mined areas'' to underground mining operations. Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553 by deleting a paragraph that was intended to be a general provision regarding the exceptions approved in the Utah program for complete highwall elimination.
