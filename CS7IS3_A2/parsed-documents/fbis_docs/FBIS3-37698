This propagandistic argument was based on the fact that the Armenian Foreign Ministry has rejected to participate in a scheduled meeting of Armenian and Azerbaijani experts in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. As is known, the international non-governmental public organization International Alert is sponsoring this meeting. The Armenian Foreign Ministry press and public relations service is authorized to state the following: The Armenian authorities are convinced that any mediation mission aimed at settling the Karabakh conflict can be productive only if the plenipotentiary representatives of the legally elected authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are included in the negotiating processes. Attempts to resolve the Karabakh problem through talks between the representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan show that, despite the developments over recent years, certain international circles have failed to grasp the essence of the problem. Despite periodically disseminated disinformation, the Armenian authorities have defended and continue to defend all peacemaking efforts for the establishment of peace in the region, including those of the CSCE and Russia. This is revealed by the existing initiatives, the constructive stance shown, and positive responses by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia is convinced that there is no alternative to a peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict. All strong-arm methods to resolve the conflict are doomed to fail.
