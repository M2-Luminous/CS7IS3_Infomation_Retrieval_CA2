Yi Chong-su, secretary of the Association of Brokers Unions, said his association members would return to normal farm and fishery goods wholesaling and auctioning on Wednesday evening. "I think the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, which had taken a mistaken policy, seems to have come to know the sufferings of farm and fishery goods producers," Yi said. Market brokers went on a strike on Tuesday in protest against the implementation of the new law which they argued would heavily undermine their interests.
