Paektu 11111111 11111111 CSO [Editorial Report] ROK citizens who want to visit Mt. Paektu must obtain an entry permit from the Jilin provincial government before they can apply for a Chinese entry visa. The 3 May KYONGHYANG SINMUN reports on page 21 that the PRC Government will enforce the requirement beginning on 1 June this year. Due to the Seoul government's lifting its China travel restrictions in April, the Jilin area is inundated with South Korean tourists, causing "terrible shortages in transportation, lodging, and so on." The PRC Government is also concerned about the impact on the area's environment as well as for the safety and security of the visitors. According to KYONGHYANG SINMUN, South Koreans who want to visit Mt. Paektu will have to start processing their travel documents at least 30 days in advance. All the paperwork must be processed by PRC Government-designated Chinese travel agencies. The PRC plans strict implementation of the new requirements. Koreans without proper papers will not be allowed to visit Mt. Paektu and they will not be able to purchase airline tickets to other cities in Jilin Province and the use of hotels will be denied.
