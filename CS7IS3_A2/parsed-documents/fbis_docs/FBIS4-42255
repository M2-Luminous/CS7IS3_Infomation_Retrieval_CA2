The Greek Cypriot National Guardsmen fired 12 shots, in twos or threes, towards the Turkish Cypriot side in the Lefke [Lefka] [word indistinct] region at 2045 today. No one was killed or injured by the shots, which were probably fired from automatic weapons. Soldiers attached to the Security Forces Command acted with a cool head and did not respond to the provocations, preventing the incident from escalating any further. Turkish Cypriot authorities lodged a protest about the incident with the UN Peace Forces. The Greek Cypriots fired shots on the Turkish Cypriot borders on three different occasions in the past week.
