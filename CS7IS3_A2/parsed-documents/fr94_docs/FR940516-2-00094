The proposed Consent Decree concerns the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Superfund Site (the ``Site'') near Albany, Georgia. The Site involves soils and groundwater contaminated by PCBs and other hazardous substances. The Albany-Dougherty Payroll Authority has owned the Site since 1967.

Bridgestone/Firestone (``B/F'') is the corporate successor to Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.

The selected remedy requires excavation and off-site disposal of the contaminated soils and the extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater.
