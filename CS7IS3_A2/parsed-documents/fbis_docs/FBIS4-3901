It would be Lu's first visit since Chris Patten took office. Patten has said he would be "delighted" to talk to Lu. "Patten probably thinks that he can do whatever he wants," said the local Xinhua deputy director, Zhang Junsheng. "He thinks if he wants to meet Lu, he can do so at any time. It is just his wishful thinking." When asked why Lu should decline Patten's invitation, Zhang said no reason was needed. "It is him (Patten) who has undermined the cooperative spirits of the two countries. "Now Britain's Foreign Affairs Select Committee report publicly voices its support for Patten's so-called reform proposal. "There is nothing Lu can talk to him (about)." Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing, said yesterday the report represented the views of some MPs, not the British government.
