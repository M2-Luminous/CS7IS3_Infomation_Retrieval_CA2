Aware of the low increase in electricity demand in mainland France as well as the high productivity rate of its power plants, EDF [French Electricity Company] will place no new order for nuclear reactors for at least five years, CEO Francois Ailleret announced in Birmingham on the occasion of the 23d UNIPEDE congress, which brings together Europe's major electricity companies. It is the first time that such a long suspension has been decided since France launched its large-scale nuclear program 20 years ago. This decision may cause problems for boiler manufacturer Framatome, which had been hoping for an order from EDF by 1997 and which will have to make do with maintenance work to maintain its know-how. The nuclear industry is not the only one hit by the slower growth in power requirements. According to EDF, which reviewed the matter at its board meeting last Friday [17 June], there is "no need to order any new power generation equipment, whether nuclear or not, before the end of the decade, except for Corsica and overseas territories." Scheduled to invest 38.9 billion francs [Fr] this year, including Fr7.5 billion for nuclear power generation, Fr.7.5 billion for power transmission, and Fr16.1 billion for power distribution, EDF has decided to order only two gas turbines instead of a an anticipated six. As for power export levels (currently at 63 billion kilowatt-hour [kWh]), they are expected to increase only slightly, to 70 billion kWh, within 10 years. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, EDF's CEO indicated that the public utility is ready to pay "a significant amount" to fund the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to Mr. Ailleret, "the odds are better than ever" that reactor number one will be shut down by this winter, with the rest of the plant being shut down within two or three years, when construction currently under way has been completed. The reported cost of the closure program is about Fr10 billion.
