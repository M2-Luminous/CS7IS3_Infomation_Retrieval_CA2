This Is the Price at Which the Sarajevo Authorities Are Trying To Provoke Foreign Interference"] [Text] Do you remember the Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda movie "Twelve Angry Men"? A youth accused of murder is in the dock. The jury must bring in a verdict of "guilty" or "not guilty" -- a unanimous verdict, moreover. Otherwise, according to the law, the jury will have to reconsider the case until they all, to a man, reach the same conclusion. The jury member played by Fonda voted against a conviction and...found himself alone. By the end of the movie, at the cost of an incredible effort, he succeeds in changing the jury's mind. A "guilty" verdict proves groundless -- it is based on questionable evidence and is passed by jurors who treated the accused either with indifference or with prejudice. When doubt is interpreted in the accused's favor, this does not mean that any court is taking his side in advance. It is the democratic norm. So we had only to publish an item on the UN experts' report which did not fit in with the version about the Bosnian Serbs' involvement in the blast for the West at once to assign KRASNAYA ZVEZDA to the "pro-Serbian camp." One Russian newspaper called our article on this subject "provocative." Right from the start of the Yugoslav conflict KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has not aimed to please anyone or win plaudits. We have always been interested only in the real situation and the conclusions to be drawn from it. This is the usual approach among the military. So it is unscrupulous, to say the least, to interpret our desire for objectivity as a manifestation of "pro-Serbian" (London's THE TIMES) sentiments or, equally, of "pro-Muslim" or "pro-Croatian" sentiments in the Russian Army. In our analysis we rely only on facts or on assessments by professionals. For example, we basically share the assessment of British General Michael Rose, commander of the "blue helmets" in Bosnia, who recently said in a BBC interview: "It is surprising that the (Muslim) formations which have refused to submit are trying to sabotage the cease-fire agreement (reached on the day the NATO ultimatum was put to the Bosnian Serbs -- S.S.) and thus prolong the suffering of their people in Sarajevo." Only, unlike Gen. Rose, we assert that it is not a matter of "formations which have refused to submit." It has, all along, been the tactic of the present leadership of the Bosnian Muslims to provoke military intervention from outside. This conclusion is not unfounded and is based certainly not on "reports by the Serbian TANJUG state agency" but on long-standing observations and repeated personal conversations with Muslim and Serbian leaders in Sarajevo as well as with representatives of the UN forces in the Bosnian capital." [quotation marks as published] As an argument we publish for the first time a highly eloquent document with minor abridgments. It is the text of a report by Canadian Gen. Lewis Mackenzie, first commander of the UN force's Sarajevo sector, to Marrack Goulding, UN under secretary general for peacekeeping operations. The document is dated 14 July 1992. "1. The situation in Sarajevo is continuing to deteriorate despite the arrival of humanitarian aid and its distribution in blockaded regions. We are keeping the airport open at the cost of an almost unacceptable degree of risk. Everything could collapse overnight. "2. The UN force is being subjected to a slander campaign by the (Muslim) Presidency. But their leaders, including the president (Izetbegovic), deny this. Meanwhile the campaign of persecution is highly effective. The attitude of people on the Presidency's side to us is extremely negative. There have already been several incidents directed against our officers and men while they were discharging their official duties. "3. My conversation yesterday convinced me once and for all that the president will agree only to military intervention or death for 'his' people as a final solution (his words). Over the past few days many opportunities for talks have presented themselves, which he rejected. He also rejected proposals from functionaries of his party, the SDA (Footnote) (Party of Democratic Action), wanting to meet with the Serbs. The necessary preparations had been made, but the president decided not to approve a meeting until there was a cease-fire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. My attempts to persuade him to meet with the opposing side at a working level, in order to discuss the details of demilitarizing the Dobrinja region, came up against a solid wall. He made it clear that, if the international community is not prepared to intervene, then he is prepared to 'die twice' rather than have dealings with an 'aggressor.' "The situation in Sarajevo points to the Presidency's desire to maintain the current crisis. The majority of the Serbian guns are silent, although the Serbs are not free of accusations either. As for the Presidency, they are continuing to provoke exchanges of fire in an attempt to improve their tactical position. It is rather difficult to prove this, although a trend can definitely be traced. "Shelling in Sarajevo is now considerably less frequent, although the Presidency is continuing to exploit the myth that shells are being lobbed into the city. This does not tally with reality but is a version published by someone who expects foreign military aid. "On the other hand, the Serbs propose that we station 'blue helmets' at all their positions, right down to the smallest subunit. This is an attractive idea, but I do not possess adequate resources or the mandate. "The situation will probably deteriorate unless military intervention is undertaken. I personally, however, consider such a step impractical. Disappointed as a result of unrealized expectations, the Presidency's forces will continue attacking the `blue helmets' in an attempt to portray matters as though the Serbs are to blame. The artillery shelling of the headquarters building last night, which could be repeated, was probably carried out from the Presidency side's positions. I am most anxious for the military observers in the regions of concentration of heavy arms. They are isolated and are virtually sitting targets.... I believe that the time for tough decisions has come. For obvious reasons they cannot be adopted here. With best wishes, Mackenzie." So, how did the Sarajevo leadership's tactic turn out for the Bosnian Muslims themselves? The hopes of military intervention were drawing now nearer, now more remote, but people were still dying. Ethnic cleansing was continuing, and numbers of both Muslims and Serbs, who were inconvenient to the West, were falling. But the Muslims remain the side which has suffered most. The number of dead among them long ago topped the 300,000 mark. As for the role of the mass media in this whole game, this is a separate topic. Probably never before in the history of conflicts has Joe Public been subjected to so many lies and so much disinformation. Following the television reports of the "Serbian shelling" of a bread line in the Old Town, the UN Security Council met and announced sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It later came to light that the people had died as the result of a mine laid by Muslim extremists. London newspapers reprinted a UN experts' report on this, and the anti-Serbian campaign eased off a little. Then the emaciated figures of "prisoners of Serbian camps" appeared on the television screen. But, following inoculation with another dose of hatred, it came to light that the shots had been falsified, etc. Suffice it to say of the role of official European diplomacy only that an ethnic war on an unprecedented scale in Bosnia-Herzegovina had been predicted 100 percent by experts in the event of a recognition of Bosnia's independence before all the contradictions had been resolved around the negotiating table. Bosnia's second-largest -- the Serbs -- disagreed categorically with secession from Yugoslavia. The majority of the Muslim population then was also in favor of a peaceful path. It was international recognition of Bosnia that gave the original boost precisely to the "party of war" headed by Izetbegovic. Now the moderate politician Fikret Abdic, who won 300,000 more votes than Izetbegovic in the prewar election precisely on a platform of interethnic concord, has been forced to fight Izetbegovic's gunmen for the right to conclude a peace with the Serbs and Croats. Meanwhile the prospects for peace in Bosnia remain hazy. Of course we should agree with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. After all, the most important thing is not to ascertain who was to blame for the recent tragedy in the Sarajevo market; the important thing is that people should no longer suffer shelling. But, as experience shows, to strive for that by increasing pressure on one of the warring sides and, still more so, by putting an ultimatum to it means playing into the hands of extremist forces among the Bosnian Muslims and pouring oil on the flames of the Bosnia conflict.
