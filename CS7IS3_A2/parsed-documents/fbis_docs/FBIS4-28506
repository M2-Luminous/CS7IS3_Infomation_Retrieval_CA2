The Japanese-language economic newspaper said the reason of the Western banks' increased credit to North Korea last year in spite of the heightened tension over the Stalinist state's nuclear standoff was not known, citing an international financial market source. Western credit to North Korea was on the decline between 1990 and 1992. Japanese banks' loans to North Korea have leveled off at about five percent of the Western banks' credit over the years, the source was quoted as saying. The EUROMONEY magazine published in England put North Korea at the 157th place in the country-risk ranking in its March issue last year. The Western banks' increased credit to North Korea last year in spite of such a high country risk may be attributed to increased trade between North Korea and Western nations on a short-term credit basis, the newspaper said.
