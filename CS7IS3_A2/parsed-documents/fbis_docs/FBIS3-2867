In his report, Lu Ping first discussed the origin and evolution of the differences between China and Britain on the Hong Kong question. He noted: The fundamental cause of the current differences between China and Britain on Hong Kong's political structure is that the British Government has changed its policies toward Hong Kong in recent years and has assumed an uncooperative and confrontational attitude in an attempt to maintain the greatest possible influence in Hong Kong after 1997. Lu Ping said: From the outset of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements held from April through November of 1993, the British side showed a lack of sincerity and refused to hold talks on the basis of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law, and the agreements and understandings reached by China and Britain, all three of which had been agreed upon by China and Britain. It stubbornly adhered to Chris Patten's "constitutional reform package" containing "three violations." Just as the first phase of the agreement was about to be reached, the British side raised new issues and partially submitted the draft legislative bill to Hong Kong's Legislative Council [Legco] for discussion, without regard to the Chinese side's repeated dissuasions and warnings, thereby terminating the talks. Hong Kong's Legco, under the manipulation of the British side, recently adopted the partial legislative bill, thus completely closing the door on talks. The British side, without prior consultation, also unilaterally issued a white paper called "Representative Government in Hong Kong," in which it divulged the contents of the talks and distorted and attacked the Chinese side's position. For this reason, our Foreign Ministry spokesman, citing a host of facts, explained that the responsibility for the disruption of the talks rested entirely with the British side. Lu Ping also discussed the construction of Hong Kong's new airport. He noted: The Chinese Government has always supported the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong. The British side, however, introduced a financing scheme, which leaves behind a heavy burden for the future Special Administrative Region [SAR], in violation of the relevant provisions in the "Memorandum of Understanding Between the Chinese and British Governments on the Construction of A New Airport in Hong Kong and Relevant Questions." The Chinese side, driven by a desire to protect the interests of its compatriots in Hong Kong and those of the SAR Government, waged a struggle, through arguments and reasoning, against the British side. Our government is now holding consultations with the British side on the latter's fourth financing scheme and is working to settle the financial arrangements for the new airport on the basis of the memorandum, with a view to prodding the British side to complete as much of the new airport as possible before 1997 in accordance with the provisions in the memorandum. Lu Ping related various preparations made by the Chinese Government to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in the absence of cooperation from the British side following the disruption of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political structure. Lu Ping said on a firm note: The Chinese Government is confident and capable of ensuring Hong Kong's smooth transition in 1997 and its long-term prosperity and stability. Li Dengzhu, deputy secretary of the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for Party Organs, chaired the meeting. More than 1,000 people from the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for Party Organs, the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for Government Organs, PLA troops stationed in Beijing, and departments under the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, heard the report.
