The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday that "certain positive shifts have been registered in Iraqi approach to fulfilment of decisions of the UN Security Council. This mostly concerns disarmament aspects which is acknowledged by the world community and was reflected in the latest document of the special commission on Iraqi disarmament". Russia actively supports the idea of establishing a deadline for Iraq before which the efficiency of the system of control can be proved, as well as the honesty of Iraqis in fulfilling their pledges. "In case after the deadline expires, and it should not last for more than six months, it is confirmed that Iraq honestly and fully implements the disarmament aspects of the Security Council resolutions 687 and 715, Russia will be ready to consider the issue of lifting the oil embargo according to item 22 of resolution 687", the document said. Russia resolutely and invariably stands for the fulfilment by Iraq of all other resolutions of the Security Council on the post-crisis settlemenmt in the Persian Gulf, including the resolution 833 on the demarcation of Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. Only in this case can the issue of lifting all other sanctions imposed by Security Council against Iraq can be raised, the statement said. The Russian position strictly corresponds to the terms and criteria fixed by decisions of the UN Security Council, it added.
