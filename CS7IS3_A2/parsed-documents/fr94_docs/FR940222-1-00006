FR940222-1-00006 FR940222-1-00002 Few commenters offered specific guidance as to an appropriate objective formula to assess capital for concentration risk. However, many commenters indicated that determinations should be performed on a case-by-case basis because of the high variability in type and riskiness of concentrations among institutions. Regarding the general levels of capital appropriate for concentrations, some commenters suggested requiring higher than minimum capital ratios for affected institutions, while others suggested reducing reported capital to reflect the additional risk. Other commenters indicated that concentration risk should be viewed in the context of all other factors affecting the capital adequacy of the institution, including the size of the allowance for loan losses, profitability, liquidity, and internal controls. Some commenters were concerned that proposed regulations might be overly burdensome or provide incentives for institutions to engage in activities such as out-of-territory lending that, while adding to diversity, also add to an institution's overall risk. Some commenters were also concerned that new regulations might place the banking industry at a competitive disadvantage. Proposed Approach Most institutions, large and small, can identify and track large concentrations of credit risk by individual or related groups of borrowers. Many institutions are also able to identify concentrations by either industry, geography, country, loan type or other relevant factors. However, because of practical and theoretical problems, there is no generally accepted approach to identify and quantify the magnitude of risk associated with concentrations of credit. In particular, definitions and analyses of concentrations are not uniform within the industry and are based in part on the subjective judgments of each institution using its experience and knowledge of its specific borrowers, market area and products. For these reasons, it is not feasible at this time to quantify the risk related to concentrations of credit for use in a formula-based capital calculation. However, techniques do exist to identify broad classes of concentrations and to recognize significant exposures. The volatile and unpredictable nature of the timing and magnitude of losses associated with concentrations suggests that the effective tracking and management of such risk is important to ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions. Moreover, the agencies believe that institutions with significant levels of concentrations of credit risk should hold capital above the regulatory minimums. With these considerations in mind, the agencies propose to take account of concentration of credit risk in their risk-based capital guidelines or regulations by amending the standards to explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and an institution's ability to manage them as important factors in assessing an institution's overall capital adequacy. In addition to reviewing concentrations of credit risk pursuant to section 305, the agencies also may review an institution's management of concentrations of credit risk for adequacy and consistency with safety and soundness standards regarding internal controls, credit underwriting or other relevant operational and managerial areas to be promulgated pursuant to section 132 of FDICIA (12 U.S.C. 1831p&hyph;1). In implementing regulations concerning concentration of credit risk, the agencies recognize the need to ensure that any treatment does not inadvertently create false incentives or unintended consequences that might decrease the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries or unnecessarily reduce the availability of credit to potential borrowers. For example, while portfolio diversification is a desirable goal, it may also increase an institution's overall risk if accomplished by lending in unfamiliar market areas to out-of-territory borrowers or by rapid expansion of new loan products for which the institution does not have adequate expertise. In addition, to the extent certain loan products, geographic areas or borrowers are perceived to fit into generic designations of concentrations, credit availability to certain groups of borrowers might be severely limited, despite the creditworthiness of individual borrowers, or the neutral or beneficial impact a single credit might have on the overall risk of the institution's portfolio. Another consideration in evaluating credit concentrations is the ``Qualified Thrift Lender'' test that requires thrifts by statute to hold 65 percent of their assets in qualifying categories. This requirement necessarily ``concentrates'' a thrift's portfolio in certain types of assets. OTS does not intend to implement section 305 in such a way as to penalize thrift institutions for fulfilling this obligation.
