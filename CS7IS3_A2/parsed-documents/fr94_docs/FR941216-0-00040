FR941216-0-00040 FR941216-0-00011 It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable those activities that would or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act at the time of listing. The intent of this policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of this listing on proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range. For further information, contact the Field Supervisor (see `` Addresses '' section). During the public comment period inquiries were made as to the effect listing would have on the mining industry, water projects, and recreational activities. The Service believes that, based on the best available information, the following actions will not result in a violation of section 9, provided these activities are carried out in accordance with existing regulations and permit requirements: momentary moving of individual adult toads out of danger (e.g., road, path); release, diversion, or withdrawal of water in a manner that does not displace tadpoles or eggs or disrupt breeding of adults; normal lighting and noises around campgrounds; and non-destructive recreational use of breeding habitat outside of the breeding period (January through May). Activities that the Service believes could potentially result in the take of the arroyo toad, include, but are not limited to, unauthorized collecting or capture of the species, except as noted above to momentarily move an individual out of harm's way; introduction of exotic species into occupied habitat (e.g., fish, other species of toads); unauthorized destruction/alteration of the species' habitat (e.g., in- stream dredging, rock removal, channelization, discharge of fill material, operation of any vehicles within the stream channel); violation of a construction, discharge or withdrawal permit that affects occupied habitat; pesticide applications affecting occupied habitat in violation of label restrictions; or other illegal discharges or dumping of toxic chemicals, silt, or other pollutants into waters supporting the species. Other unauthorized activities not identified in the above two paragraphs will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if a violation of section 9 of the Act may have occurred. The Service does not consider these lists to be exhaustive and provides them for the information of the public. The Act and 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed wildlife and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;2063; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
