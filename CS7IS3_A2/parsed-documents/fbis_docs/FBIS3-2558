It seems that the British side is determined not to converge with the Basic Law. However, the structure of three-tier councils of Hong Kong formed during British rule will end on 30 June 1997. By doing this, the British side will have to be totally responsible for all consequences thus arising. Chen Ziying, who attended a CPPCC panel meeting today, made the above remarks when asked a question by reporters. Chen Ziying said: Everyone sees very clearly that the British side has already decided to refuse to cooperate with the Chinese side on the political system issue by coming up with another package which does not converge with the Basic Law. This shows that they do not wish to have the through train. "It seems that they are already determined about this, so it is not strange (that they are tabling another part of the political reform package to the Legco). A reporter asked what he thought about some NPC deputies from Hong Kong preparing to make an official proposal to the forthcoming NPC session that the three-tier councils be reelected. Chen Ziying said: I am not very sure of the contents of the proposal, but I believe that after 1997 as China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, "we have the Basic Law and we are completely able to and have the means to thoroughly implement the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and to carry out one country, two systems, and the rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people. This is not to be doubted at all." He said: Now that the British Hong Kong authorities are determined to refuse to cooperate with the Chinese side on the political system question and not to converge with 1997 during the transition period of British rule, "the decisions they make before 30 June 1997 under the British Hong Kong administration, of course, will be valid until 30 June 1997, and this means that the three-tier councils formed in Hong Kong under British rule will end then. This is a very natural thing. By doing this, the British side will have to be completely responsible for all consequences thus arising." Moreover, asked whether the Chinese side has taken a milder attitude than in the past, Chen Ziying said there is no question of being mild or not, the Chinese side's fixed position has always been to maintain Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term prosperity and stability. Regarding whether or not the fact that the British side has ruined the foundation of cooperation will have an adverse influence, Chen Ziying stressed: "We have always hoped that China and Britain could have good cooperation on the question of Hong Kong during the transition period as this is good for Hong Kong's smooth transition. But this is only our wish. The British side does not wish the same. In the last 17 rounds of talks, we already made very great efforts, but in the end they were ruined by them so easily. This was what we very much did not want to see. The fact that they have ruined cooperation on the political system issue, of course, has a very bad influence. Therefore, we hope that the British side will not ruin cooperation in other areas any longer and will not go against the wishes of Hong Kong people any longer.
