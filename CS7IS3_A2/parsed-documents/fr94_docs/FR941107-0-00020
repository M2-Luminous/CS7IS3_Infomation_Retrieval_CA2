FR941107-0-00020 FR941107-0-00008 As previously explained, this final rule establishes size requirements for canned pitted olives under the order in terms of illustrations, approximate diameter ranges, and size variances which are set forth in the Standards. Thus, in accordance with section 8e of the Act, conforming changes are made in the minimum size requirements for imported canned pitted olives so that such requirements are applied in a manner similar to that under the order. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final rule. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including information and recommendations submitted by the committee and other available information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, with changes, as published in Federal Register [59 FR 38104], will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
