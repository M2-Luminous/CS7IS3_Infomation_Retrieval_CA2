Trubnikov said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS about the place of the intelligence service in ensuring Russia's state sovereignty and its role in a democratic state that "the development of nuclear weapons in our country was a result of the efforts of our scientists, such as Kurchatov, Khariton, Zeldovich, and many others. The atom bomb is not a simple device that could be seen in one place and then copied at home. If our science had not come up close to the understanding of the secret of the atomic nucleus, it would have been simply unable to understand and evaluate the information gleaned by our intelligence in the nuclear field". "It is now history, and when history is recorded mistakes are often made due to deliberate omissions of some things or deliberate highlighting of other things. The intelligence service does not claim other people's achievements. It has enough of its own. The achievement of the intelligence service in this case consisted in sensing in good time the important trend in the development of science and technology which had a colossal military potential and succeeded in obtaining information which enabled us to accelerate -- I repeat, accelerate -- work in the development of nuclear weapons in our country," Trubnikov said. He said the external intelligence service is playing a considerable role in ensuring Russia's security, although this role is not always made visible. He stressed that "on the whole the trends in the global development are favourable for our country, but the spectrum of threats remains quite extensive". The general said that the Russian intelligence service can compete quite effectively with the recognised leaders of world espionage as the CIA, Mossad, and the British secret service. "We have always been in the same league and, I want to believe, will remain in it always," he said. General Trubnikov added that "should the personnel of our competitor services find themselves in conditions similar to those in which the Russian intelligence service is finding itself now, few would be able to stand it. As regards our people, they are serving and will continue to do so".
