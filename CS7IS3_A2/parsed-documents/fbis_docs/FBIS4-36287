[Al-Bid] I believe that there is an attempt to reenact the Gulf crisis in the Arabian Peninsula. There was an attempt to let this crisis drag on after it had been contained in order to drown the region in tension and instability. Some states have clearly declared their stand. We hope they will not go too far in dragging the area into more instability and destruction. [Tannuri] Do you need military support and do you get any such support from abroad? [Al-Bid] Any man who fights needs certain capabilities. We are defending ourselves with what we have. We will make every possible sacrifice to defend ourselves at any price. We taught the retreating invaders unforgettable lessons. They realized that in the areas they tried to invade and in courageous Aden. [passage omitted] [Tannuri] Do you expect Arab and foreign states to recognize your republic or does that recognition depend on the United Nations? [Al-Bid] We believe that charity begins at home. Our people in Arab and Muslim states come first. I believe that the world now knows what is happening in Yemen -- there is a conflict and a cause. The proclamation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen was based on principles I believe will be approved and backed by many Arab, Muslim, and world states. [Tannuri] Analysts believe that the south sought secession when it turned out that most oil reserves were in the southern parts of the country. [Al-Bid] We knew about the oil before unity. We had sufficient information. But oil never dissuaded us from seeking unity. The oil is not new. What hindered the march toward unity was the emergence of another venture that conflicted with unity, whether Yemeni or collective Arab democratic unity. On the one hand, there is an alliance between the mentality of the military and the al- Ahmar [reference to Parliamentary Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar] family gang and on the other there is the fundamentalists who want to take the Arab nation to the middle ages. We in Yemen and many parts of the Arab homeland want to enter the 21st century with the entire world. A last word. I hope the crisis that befell the Yemeni people will stop at is current level. It is the Yemeni people and not the advocates of war who are losing. I hope the United Nations and international legitimacy will live up to their responsibility to restrict that arrogant mentality by which Sanaa rulers seek to force their will on the people. They are bombarding areas of Aden indiscriminately and are trying to destroy the economy and its foundations. The latest crime they committed was shelling Aden's oil refinery twice. They are still trying to do that. I hope reason will triumph. I also hope capable states will succeed in putting an end to this. We made contacts with all parties concerned. I believe they are capable of ending this tragedy. What is taking place on the ground must be monitored. Our task right now is to put an end to the catastrophe by first observing a cease-fire and then discussing future issues. [Tannuri] Thank you.
