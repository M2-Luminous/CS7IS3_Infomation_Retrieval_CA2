The classified intelligence report, obtained by AFP on Saturday [5 February], predicted fresh fighting among Somalia's warring factions or between Somali militias and the slimmed-down UN force after the March pullout. It said General Aidid, currently in Nairobi where he is officially holding talks with rival Somali factions, was "busy preparing for renewed conflict against United Nations military forces." It said that if the Group of 12 factions opposed to warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid joined an interim administration to be formed under UN-sponsored peace accords, General Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction would take up arms again. The Group of 12 spokesman, self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, backed controversial US-led strikes against the SNA militia during the UN's abortive hunt for Aidid, abandoned after his fighters killed more than 70 peacekeepers including two dozen Americans. "Recent reports indicate that if Ali Mahdi's 12-faction Transitional National Council (TNC) is established as planned, the SNA will restart the civil war as it feels that the TNC is a puppet government of UNOSOM (the UN Operation in Somalia)," the report said. It said Aidid's faction "may be formulating a plan which involved a large-scale attack against the UN...intended to break the will of the contingents left here, forcing them to leave Somalia and showing that the SNA is in charge of Mogadishu."
