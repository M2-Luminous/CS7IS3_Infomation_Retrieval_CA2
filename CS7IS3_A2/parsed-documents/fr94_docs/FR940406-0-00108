FR940406-0-00108 FR940406-0-00011 As noted earlier, the DC Circuit held that the consultation requirement in section 202(a)(6) does not alter EPA's duty to issue ORVR requirements. After the decision was issued and after publication of EPA's May 27, 1993 Federal Register notice (58 FR 30731), EPA held technical discussions with representatives of AAMA regarding the ORVR test procedure (See items IV&hyph;E&hyph;101,102,105,106 in the public docket for this rulemaking). The purpose of these discussions was to identify potential changes to the ORVR test procedure which, if enacted, would facilitate the use of an integrated evaporative/refueling control system approach with a liquid seal in the fillneck. (As was discussed above, in March 1993, EPA published a final rule requiring enhanced evaporative controls on gasoline-powered LDVs, LDTs, and HDVs. The enhanced evaporative requirements will lead to an increase in the size of the canister used to capture evaporative emissions, an upgrade in the purge system capabilities, as well as other system changes and improvements.) An integrated system approach would allow manufacturers to make use of the upgraded evaporative control hardware (common carbon canister, purge system, vapor hoses, etc.) as part of their ORVR control strategy and thus address both system complexity and cost issues. This approach would be used in lieu of the non-integrated control system approaches which were characterized as being complex and potentially less safe. ORVR test procedure changes which would ease the use of integrated evaporative/refueling control systems with liquid fillneck seal approaches were identified. EPA explained this option at the July 22, 1993 public hearing and requested additional public comment. Auto manufacturer comments supported this approach. For example, Chrysler Corporation's comments indicated: ``Chrysler believes that the proposed AAMA revisions to the test procedure and the 0.20 g/gal. standard will allow Chrysler to design safe, efficient ORVR systems.'' Ford Motor Company's comments stated: ``Ford recommends that EPA adopt the test procedure changes and standards outlined by AAMA at the Hearing on July 22, 1993, and contained in the attached comments. These changes should allow for the design and development of a canister-based, integrated refueling and evaporative emissions system which is less complex than a nonintegrated system and which addresses the safety issues raised in previous rulemakings. These procedural changes along with others identified in the comments should allow EPA, in consultation with NHTSA, to find that integrated systems do not present an unreasonable risk to automotive safety.'' General Motors expressed similar views: ``The ORVR test procedure changes described in these comments are critical to permitting manufacturers to develop ORVR systems for passenger cars that minimize or eliminate any adverse impact upon motor vehicle safety.'' And, in summary, an October 13, 1993 AAMA letter to NHTSA stated that: ``We believe this procedure will allow the use of an integrated ORVR/evaporative emissions system including a common carbon canister. An integrated ORVR/evaporative emissions system will allow manufacturers to design and build safe, efficient ORVR systems.'' Comments by other manufacturers also supported this position. Accordingly, this rule enacts the test procedure option identified above. It is supported by AAMA, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM), and the individual manufacturers and, according to their comments, minimizes their longstanding vehicle safety concerns. 3. DOT Consultation In response to the changed circumstances since it's prior safety analysis, DoT/NHTSA undertook an independent assessment of vehicle safety concerns associated with ORVR systems. In November 1993, NHTSA completed a study entitled ``An Assessment of Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery System Safety''. This document reexamined the conclusions raised in their July 1991 study, upon which EPA relied heavily on its April 1992 decision not to require ORVR controls. In this recent study, NHTSA revisited the principal findings of its July 1991 report to consider the positive safety impacts of the test procedure changes and other changed circumstances. The NHTSA report, which is available in the public docket, reached the following general conclusion regarding ORVR safety: ``Basically, there were three principal areas of concern pointed out in the July 1991 report: the increased size of vapor canisters to hold the fuel vapors, the mechanical complexity of the ORVR system, and the ability of the ORVR system to safely manage and purge the increased volume of vapors. As discussed above, technical developments, and test procedure and regulatory changes that have occurred since the July 1991 safety assessment, have had the net effect of reducing the safety concerns raised in the July 1991 report. The majority of vehicle manufacturers have stated that it is now possible to design safe ORVR systems that will function properly under all operating conditions. However, there still remains some small unquantifiable increase in safety risk due to the addition of the ORVR systems. This risk is unquantifiable since there are no data upon which to base a numerical estimate.''
