Mr Reynolds, due to meet John Major when both attend the February 19 England-Ireland rugby fixture at Twickenham, said the talks would involve Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring. "The meeting will be a question of monitoring the situation relating to the Downing Street peace declaration, updating ourselves as to where it's at and having a general review of the progress of the declaration," he told the Dublin parliament. Mr Reynolds, who on Monday [7 February] night received British proposals for resuming inter-party negotiations on Northern Ireland's future, said ministers from the two governments would consider how they could proceed to the next stage of the talks that stalled well over a year ago. He insisted there was no "conflict or competition" between last year's December 15 peace statement and the British attempt to restart the talks. "I do not see the peace declaration standing in the way of talks. I believe it gives the talks process a greater chance of success. There is now a new starting point because of the declaration." Mr Spring said today the proposals received from Britain contained "a checklist of relevant points in relation to the recommencement of the talks process." Mr Reynolds rejected calls in the Dail to publish details of his correspondence with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. He refused to depart from "a long-established tradition of confidentiality" regarding communications involving the head of government. The premier said he sent a detailed letter to Mr Adams, backed up by a memorandum, in reply to a request for clarification of the Downing Street declaration. "I have provided as much explanation and clarification as possible." Mr Reynolds said he looked forward to an early response from the IRA and its Sinn Fein political spokesmen to the peace initiative. While no deadline had been set, a lot of attention would naturally focus on Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin at the end of the month, he added. He brushed aside opposition criticism of Dublin's attitude towards the granting by the US of a visa permitting Mr Adams to speak in America last week. "The American administration took the decision and that was that. We don't get involved in trying to tell foreign administrations what kind of decisions to take." Sinn Fein today put the blame for their slow response to the declaration on the [British] Government. Party chairman Tom Hartley condemned London's "continued stubborn refusal" to clarify the declaration. He said that in contrast to Britain's inflexibility, the Dublin government acted responsibly in the matter and its efforts were welcome and helpful. "If John Major is serious about constructing a real peace process he should follow the lead given by Albert Reynolds, rather than pursuing the tried and failed policy of partition." Mr Hartley said long-overdue clarification would allow every one to make a judgment of the London-Dublin plan. "Britain's refusal to do so is unnecessarily delaying our process of consultation and consideration." Sir Patrick tonight emphasised the Government's determination to defeat terrorism. "We shall continue to provide the security forces with the resources they need to bring those guilty of terrorist crime to account through the due process of law," he said during a visit to police and Army bases in north Belfast.
