Tsai] [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Friday [3 June] announced the abolition of restrictions on foreigners investing in domestic banks -- another step in Taiwan's financial liberalization and internationalization. Foreigners and overseas Chinese were barred from investing in domestic banks even after the government lifted the ban on the establishment of new banks in 1990. But from now on, MOF officials stressed, foreign investors will be allowed to open new commercial banks on an equal footing with domestic investors. Foreigners must still abide by Article 25 of the banking law, which sets the maximum stake of any one investor in a single bank at 5 percent, the officials noted. In addition, they said, the remittance of investment funds should comply with the requirements for securities investment and foreign exchange settlement by overseas Chinese and foreigners. The MOF and the Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs will jointly screen applications from abroad, they added.
