The NATO member-states allocate 40 percent [as received] of their military spending for armament, while the funds allocated to the Bulgarian Army will be just enough for the payment of salaries, subsistence and some supply services, he pointed out. If that amount passes the vote, parliament must take political responsibility for the liquidation of the Bulgarian Army, Mr. Rusan Georgiev, chairman of the Independent Trade Unions in the Army, told yesterday's news conference. In Maj. Gen. Maznev's view, the trade unions should also assist the efforts for the allocation of a larger amount to the Army. Army units commanders are to propose measures for making their activities more efficient and for optimizing their structures. A commission is set up to help solve the problems of Defence Ministry financing. It is chaired by Mr. Vladimir Penchev, deputy minister of defence in charge of financial and foreign exchange affairs. The commission is expected to submit its estimates for the Army's draft budget and for the most efficient utilization of all internal reserves by March 15, Captain Tsvyatko Donchev, head of the Defence Ministry Press Centre, said at today's news briefing. No losses will be reported by the military repair works for the 1993 fiscal year, the output sold is 3.7 percent up from 1992 at comparable prices, Gen. Maznev said. Local customers owe the military repair works some 192 million leva (about $5.2 million) and foreign customers in Russia, Iraq and Libya are indebted to them for another $15.5 millions. According to General Maznev, the Defence Ministry's allocation for equipment repair will not be enough to put into operation all damaged aircraft, armoured machines and automobiles, nor will it be enough to secure orders for the works. The military plants do not rely only on the Defence Ministry's orders, Major General Dragomir Ivanov, defence industry chief at the Defence Ministry, specified at the news briefing. At present, civilian products accounts for 23 percent of the defence industry total output, it is planned to increase their share to 32 percent in 1994. The share of military products will be 54.3 percent, Maj. Gen. Ivanov said. A contract has been already signed with a foreign customer, another two contracts are awaiting signing. Gen. Ivanov believes that despite the meager funds which the Defence Ministry allocates to the military industry in its draft budget, external orders will help the military industry enterprises cope with the situation for the time being. A variety of civilian products made by the military plants are already exported to Italy and Germany, it is worked jointly with the Kirov Works at St. Petersburg and the U.S. Curtis, Gen. Ivanov said.
