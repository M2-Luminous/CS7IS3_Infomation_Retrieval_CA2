Speaking at the meeting, Counselors Zhang Houcan, Tang Sheng, Zhou Xiqing, Lu Deyun, Shen Daming, Tang Zongshun, Deng Yinyin, Li Jiahua, and Zhou Jing affirmed the achievements made in China's education. At the same time, they pointed out: we leaders at all levels should further enhance our awareness of the strategic role of education in socialist construction. We must set up school disciplines in a scientific way and according to the laws governing education. While giving students knowledge, we must cultivate their independence and creativity. We must strengthen advanced in-service study and training of teachers. The counselors also gave their opinions and suggestions on raising teachers' pay and benefits as well as other issues. Li Lanqing earnestly listened to the counselors' views, thanking them for their concern and support of China's education. He said: China is a developing country, not well-off in economic terms. To run the world's largest educational system, it is necessary to gradually increase investment in education as the economy develops. The fundamental approach, however, is through reform. The State Council and local authorities are actively but prudently promoting education reform on the basis of the "Outline for China's Education Reform and Development" to raise teaching qualities and improve the social effect of school education. Li Lanqing said: At present, it is necessary to concentrate on improving basic education first. This is a fundamental issue affecting the improvement of the entire nation's standards. At the same time, we must vigorously develop vocational education at the elementary, middle, and secondary levels as well as adult education to train more practical personnel needed in society. Higher education should be reformed to improve its teaching quality and social effects. To make our education more successful, it is necessary to raise the awareness of society as a whole, particularly the awareness of leading cadres at all levels, on the strategic importance of developing education on a priority basis, and it is necessary to foster a social ethics of respecting teachers and valuing education. Li Lanqing urged all counselors to continue their investigation and research in this regard and give their views and proposals on improving education to the State Council.
