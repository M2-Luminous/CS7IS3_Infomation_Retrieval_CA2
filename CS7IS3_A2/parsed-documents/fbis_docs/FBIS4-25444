The network has made it possible to organize leading cadres at all levels to study socialist theory with Chinese characteristics in light of realities. In carrying out the work of organizing cadres to engage in theoretical study, the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee has attached great importance to the study programs for leading Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government groups. As early as 1992, a central study group for major leading Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government cadres was set up. Such groups are staffed with two secretaries solely responsible for supervising and inspecting its study programs. A record of each student's attendance and performance is kept by the study group. Meanwhile, a theoretical study network has been formed in Beijing, with each immediate higher-level authority supervising the work of each lower-level authority. Priority attention has been given to the study programs for cadres at or above the department level. In their theoretical study, leading cadres at all levels in Beijing City have focused on the goal of emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and establishing a socialist market economy. They have systematically studied the theory of socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. To facilitate leading cadres at or above the bureau level to achieve a better result in their study, the city's leaders have taken the advantages of the capital's favorable conditions by inviting responsible comrades of various ministries and commissions and experts in relevant fields to deliver reports on such special topics as current financial, foreign trade, and taxation systems reforms, as well as on the establishment of a modern enterprising system. These reports, serving as a supplementary to the study programs, have helped leading cadres at or above the bureau level master the market economy theory and relevant new knowledge, acquire a general understanding about the establishment of a socialist market economy framework, and enhance their policy-related theory and decision-making level. Leading cadres at all levels in Beijing City have integrated their theoretical study with investigations and research. They have tried to deepen their understanding about theoretical problems through investigations and research and by improving their theoretical level to find new methods to solve practical issues. This is one of the outstanding features in their theoretical study. Last year, Secretary Chen Xitong and Mayor Li Qiyan of Beijing City made more than 30 trips to visit mountain and rural areas, industrial and commercial enterprises, construction sites, and universities and colleges. They listened carefully to opinions expressed by the masses, solved new problems which had cropped up during the course of reform and opening up, and took a lead in writing theoretical articles and investigation reports, including: "There Is No Leadership Without Conducting Investigations and Researches" and "Work Hard To Achieve the Goal of Leading a Fairly Comfortable Life." Under their leadership, leading cadres at all levels in the city have made it their practice to conduct investigations and research in the grass-roots units. Leading cadres at or above the district, county, and bureau levels have written more than 250 theoretical articles and investigation reports. Party schools at all levels in Beijing City have also sponsored rotating training classes for cadres at or above the department level. They have sponsored more than 20 terms of rotating training classes for cadres at or above the bureau level, with more than 1,600 people having received the training. They have achieved the goal put forward by Beijing City's leaders that leading cadres at or above the bureau level should receive such rotating training once a year. They have sponsored more than 250 terms of rotating training classes for cadres at or above the department level, with more than 12,000 people having received the training. Propaganda departments at all levels in Beijing City have conducted more than 250 report meetings in various forms as a supplementary to the study programs, with more than 200,000 people having attended such report meetings.
