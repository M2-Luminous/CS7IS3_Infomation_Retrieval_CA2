A legislator labelled the trip a "publicity" stunt and a waste of time. The British experts said that Daya Bay posed no danger to Hong Kong, but environmental groups and legislators disagreed. And Reverend Fung Chiwood, an outspoken Daya Bay critic, attacked the visit of the two experts as a waste of time because they offered no suggestions or advice to Hong Kong about the plant. "I feel that they are doing publicity and public relations in Hong Kong rather than giving advice," Rev Fung said. "It was a waste of time, energy and money because they didn't give any suggestions and only said there was no problem. "What is the use of 10 monitoring stations in Hong Kong if we are not in danger? "If there were a minute accident then water and food could be affected and people would be affected," he said. Chris Willby, deputy chief inspector of nuclear installations in Britain, said there was a high level of commitment to the plant at the moment, and that for the foreseeable future it would be run efficiently. "The plant is designed to high international standards and I gained an overall favourable impression," Mr Willby said. "I am satisfied that if there was an emergency there is no doubt that Hong Kong would be told quickly, although it is difficult to say how much time because we have no control over information links in China. "There is a political commitment to nuclear power in China so this plant will get the resources," he said. A spokesman for Friends of the Earth said: "The point is that you can design a nuclear plant as safely as possible, but accidents still occur and you can't rule out human error. Telling us we are safe is not enough, and the government needs to demonstrate that all systems are in place if there is an emergency. The spokesman said the contingency plan for Hong Kong was a concern of Friends of the Earth. At a test in August police and the government seemed not to know what their functions were. Mr Willby stressed the need for China to maintain good public relations so people were informed of what little risk there really was at the plant. "No people will die from nuclear power plants this year and more than 600 will be killed in aeroplanes," he said. Frances Fry, assistant director with the United Kingdom National Radiological Protection Board, said she was very pleased with the visit and was satisfied with the contingency plan procedures in place. "You are not in danger here but the import of foodstuffs from the affected area should be checked if there was an accident," Ms Fry said. "All parts of Hong Kong are sufficiently far away (from Daya Bay) so it is not possible to envisage a mass exodus."
