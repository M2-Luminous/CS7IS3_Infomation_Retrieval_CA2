The withdrawal from Bihac will take place in six months. As for the destination of this contingent, France will decide on what action to take, depending on the progress of the peace process. Edouard Balladur was speaking in the National Assembly: [Begin Balladur recording] Things are clear, ladies and gentlemen, we are at the service of the United Nations and at the service of a policy aimed at restoring peace. If this restoration of peace were to prove impossible, if the other powers were not working toward this end, then, as I said last week, we should be forced to ask ourselves questions about the meaning and duration of our action. We do not have to blush; quite the contrary, we can be proud of what we have done, and of what we are continuing to do. We have the largest number of soldiers -- by a long way -- at the service of peace on the territory of former Yugoslavia. We are quite prepared to continue with our efforts, on condition that every party is willing to make its own contribution. [end recording]
