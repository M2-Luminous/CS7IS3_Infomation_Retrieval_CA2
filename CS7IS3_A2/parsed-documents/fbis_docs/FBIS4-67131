According to figures presented by him, there are more than 100,000 drug addicts in Georgia and 200,000 people who are taking narcotic substances; these are principally young people aged between 16 and 30. Georgia is facing the serious threat of the development of the drugs business. During the first quarter of 1994, there were 290 registered cases of drugs being smuggled into the republic. According to Menagarishvili, the main suppliers of drugs today are Azerbaijan, Central Asia, India, Pakistan, and Singapore. Moreover, so-called South Ossetia has recently become a dangerous center for the narcotics business. The cultivation, processing, and sale of raw materials for "impure drugs" has become the main source of income for many residents there. According to the deputy prime minister, the solution lies in the creation of the corresponding legislative base to combat drugs and the drugs business and also a national bureau for the struggle against drug addiction and the drugs business attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and rayon police departments. He believes that it is also essential to coordinate work in this direction with international services that are engaged in the fight against drugs.
