Promoting the necessity of ratifying the October 1992 agreement signed in Bishkek by nine states, Andrei Cucu, privatization vice minister, stated that this agreement pertains first of all to Russia, where Moldova possesses 11 wine plants, three construction organizations and numerous branches of joint ventures founded by Moldovan economic agents. Russia, in its turn, has several enterprises in Moldova and the largest is the "Sovtransavto" haulage enterprise. Russia ratified the Bishkek agreement in November 1993. Cucu told BASA that most important is that Russia will recognize Moldova's rights over its properties in Russian territory. Thus, a proper foundation for their future privatization will be created. "Our enterprises in Russia employ Russian personnel and, vice versa, Russian enterprises in Moldova employ Moldovan personnel who will be allowed to participate in their privatization," said Cucu. The Ukraine did not sign the mutual property rights agreement. Cucu mentioned that an accord with the Ukraine will be established through a bilateral agreement which is now being elaborated. He pointed out that the agreement mainly concerns the numerous vacation houses located in the Ukraine. Cucu said that in 1993 Russia and the Ukraine signed an agreement on recognizing the rights over the properties located outside their borders.
