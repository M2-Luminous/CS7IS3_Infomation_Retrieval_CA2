Concerning Inflation In 1993 market prices started high and rose greatly. For the year, retail prices rose 13 percent over the previous year and residents' cost of living prices rose 14.5 percent. For the year, cost of living prices in 35 large and medium-sized cities rose 19.5 percent. From the perspective of the yearly price changes, the following four new trends appear: 1. Urban and rural prices rose simultaneously. While in 1993 urban prices continued their high increase, inflation of rural prices also clearly increased, and the increase was rather high. It is estimated that the annual rise will be 12.5 percent. And the differential with urban price rises shrank from 3.8 percentage points to 1 percentage point. 2. The new price rise factor had a great affect. According to calculations, in 1993 retail market prices and residents' cost of living price rises, the affect of new price rise factors in the current year (including the adjusted price structure and spontaneous price rises) was 80 percent or more, clearly higher than the previous year. 3. Residents' basic cost of living prices were highly inflated. The 1993 urban residents' basic necessities prices, greatly influenced by reform of prices in such areas as grain, housing, and fuel, rose rather greatly. It is estimated that the annual rise will reach 18 percent, 2.5 percentage points higher than overall urban cost of living price increases. Within that, grain prices rose 38 percent, pork prices rose 14 percent, and fresh vegetable prices rose 13.5 percent. 4. Service prices rose sharply. For the year, it is estimated they will rise about 28 percent, effecting a 3.2 percentage point rise in residents' cost of living prices. Within that: rent rose by 23.4 percent; transportation fees rose 26.7 percent; miscellaneous education and child care expenses rose by 37.8 percent; entertainment expenses rose by 52.3 percent; and water and electrical fees, post and telegraph fees, and medical and health care expenses rose by 16.2 percent, 16.5 percent, and 38.6 percent, respectively. The main causes of the large prices increases are, first, that the country has further increased the extent of price reforms. On the base of successive extensive price reforms in the past few years, the prices of grain, steel products, and some unified distribution coal have been freed up; the producer prices of timber and unified distribution cement have been adjusted and raised; and the prices of some heavy oils have been "leveled." This has a positive function as regards smoothing price relations, changing the long-term low price situation of basic products, and forming mechanisms to gradually establish market prices, but it also brings with it rather large increases in overall price levels. The second thing is that the large overall scale of fixed assets and the large amount of currency put into circulation have increased the pressure to demand price rises. The third thing is that while increasing the extent of price reforms and accelerating economic development, there have not been effective checks on arbitrary price rises, covert price rises, and ever rising prices. The fourth thing is that the adjusted exchange rate fluctuated for a while. The fifth thing is the influence of such non-economic factors as residents' changing psychological expectations and the orientation of public opinion. II. Concerning the Scale of Investment Our basic judgement regarding the scale of 1993 investment is that the scale of investment was already large and with an excessively large scale, the structure was not altogether reasonable. From the perspective of the scale of investment already achieved, the 1993 rate of fixed asset investment for the whole society was 37.5 percent. If we discount the influence of such factors as the fact that the prices of investment items were more inflated than consumer items and actual use of foreign funds increased rather greatly, the approximate investment rate was about 33 percent, three percentage points higher than former years averages, making it large. Presently China is in a rather stable period in the growth of consumption and rapid economic growth relies even more on the pulling power of investment and the function of investment to stimulate and curb the economy is more pronounced than at any time in the past. To maintain the rapid growth of the economy, we must have the support of a rather high rate of investment. From the perspective of establishing the overall scale, this obviously is too large. It is estimated that the overall scale established by state units for the year will reach 3.3 trillion yuan, 40 percent greater than the previous year. If we discount the fact that at the end of the year after the investment totals are completed, incomplete projects still require the investment of 1.9 trillion yuan, the increase is close to 60 percent and the ratio that it occupies reaches as high as 57.6 percent, far exceeding normal limits. The root cause of the establishment of an excessively large overall scale is that reform of the investment system is lagging, and it lacks effective investment risks and responsible restraint mechanisms. A considerable number of regions do not arrange their investment based on the capability of their regions to utilize such aspects as their area's resources, technological advantages, market prospects, and funds, but blindly keep raising them, craving to rashly put up establishments, increase projects, and expand the economic scale, forming low-level duplication and unchecked development. Based on the situation in 1993, not only does this make the entire atmosphere of economic operations tight, but in the area of investment itself, it brings about the following two problems: First it lowers investment returns, reflected in the fact that all indicators for overall investment returns declined from the same period the previous year. Secondly, it exacerbated the tight funds. As regards the structure of investment, there are some not altogether reasonable places: One is that the share of investment in energy and raw material industries has declined. The share of investment completed in the first eleven months declined from 42.9 percent in the same period the previous year to 36.9 percent. The second is a clear tendency toward extension of investment. In the first eleven months, investment used in newly extended projects increased by 78.3 percent and the share rose from 34.1 percent in the same period of the previous year to 38.6 percent. Among transformation and renovation funds, the share used for newly expanded investment rose from 48.8 percent to 53.8 percent, but the share used for reconstruction and replacement of equipment declined from 43 percent to 40.3 percent. The third thing is that wasteful government buildings, first class villas, vacation villages, and recreational places have increased too much. III. Concerning the Contradiction of the Current Tightness of Funds In the past few months, the state has several times in succession injected large amounts of currency, used mainly to support the normal production and operation of key industries and key enterprises, key development of the railroad, coal, and petroleum industries, the purchase of such agricultural products and byproducts as grain and cotton, and good performing foreign trade purchase and export production enterprises. This is helpful in alleviating the contradiction of the tightness of funds widespread in the previous period. But the fact that several areas presently reflect a shortage of funds still is a pronounced problem and the cry for an increased supply of funds is extremely strong. Why is it that with the state putting so much money in circulation several sectors still generally feel that the "blood supply" is inadequate? On the surface, there is a problem in the total supply of funds and a more intense influence from market restraints: 1. Channels for social funds are changing and the overall supply of funds is shrinking. In the first half of the year before the central government implemented strengthened macroeconomic control measures, there were six channels for regions' funds: Bank loans, short-term interbank loans, raising funds, non-bank credit, bonds, and foreign funds. But since the second half of the year, this situation has changed greatly. Short-term interbank loans and raising of funds have been stifled, they have stopped issuing bonds, and non-bank credit is strictly controlled. In addition, the repayment of short-term interbank loans has caused the overall supply of funds to society to clearly shrink. It is estimated that for the year, social credit funds for other than state banks will be reduced by upwards of 100 billion yuan from the previous year. 2. Market circulation is not smooth and fund sedimentation is increasing with a corresponding decrease in the currency in circulation, aggravating the the tight situation in the supply and demand of funds. Beginning in August, along with the changing market supply and demand circumstances, the industrial production and sales ratio has declined somewhat and overstocking has clearly risen. In addition, arrearages among enterprises are becoming increasingly acute, further aggravating the tightness of enterprise funds. 3. Some newly added loans are being used for such expenditures as supplementing tax revenues and paying off water and electric fees. From analyzing the deep-seated causes, the present tight money is an inevitable reflection in the current period of enterprises' for a long time in the past disregarding the capabilities of their funds and resources, wantonly competing to invest and in many ways pushing in and seizing their own circulating funds, along with slow adjustments in the structure of savings and low efficiency in the use of funds. Strengthening macroeconomic controls only serves to set it off and causes the contradiction to appear by being concentrated. As regards enterprise automatic circulating funds, because enterprise operating mechanisms still have not been converted, self-development capabilities and self-restraint awareness are not strong, and automatic circulating funds are constantly being seized and diverted, leading to a decline in the share of automatic circulating funds from year to year and a great weakening of the ability to withstand market risks. Once the money supply is tightened, tightening of enterprise funds is unavoidable. In the 1983 national budget, state industrial enterprise automatically circulating funds made up 55 percent of the circulating funds quota. By the end of 1992, it had declined to 21.4 percent, and nearly 80 percent of funds relied mainly on bank loans. The factors influencing the constant decline in the share of enterprise automatically circulating funds are: First, multiple extrusions and nibbling have caused automatically circulating funds to run off. Quite a few newly established or expanded enterprises have not proportionately arranged for corresponding underlying circulating funds for their investments or they have not arranged for enough. Some even rely on diverting circulating funds and construction enterprise advances to wantonly compete for projects. Some automatically circulating enterprise funds also are used to dilute losses found in successive years' appraisals of fixed assets and circulating funds. The second thing is that they have not been promptly replenished. Some enterprises even divert funds for use in speculating on real estates and stocks. In addition, high rising inflation also eats away some funds. As regards the adjustment of the structure of enterprise reserves, because they have been influenced by numerous factors such as unclear property rights relations, unsound social guarantee systems, and the vertical and horizontal separation of localities and departments, it is difficult for enterprises to get state guarantees for selecting the superior and weeding out the inferior and good or bad operations and gradually enduring the difficulty of adjusting reserves. Enterprises that have fallen into losses and whose funds are the tightest yell the strongest. In addition, the low efficiency of the use of funds to a certain extent aggravates the current tightness of funds. The problems described above should be resolved by intensified reform, a sound legal system, and stronger controls.
