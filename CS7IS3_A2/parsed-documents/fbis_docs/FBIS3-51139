I see a very solid and strong future for the revolution, considering the support of the great majority of our people and the great deal of optimism that exists, to continue to confront difficulties, PCC Central Committee member Jorge Lezcano told PRENSA LATINA. Lezcano, first secretary of the PCC in Havana, explained that although the same basic economic factors that created conditions in 1993 will continue this year, the country will have a few more advantages and opportunities. According to Lezcano, we have the experience of having confronted and overcome a year as difficult as 1993, we know what to do to confront the problems that arise, and we have become better organized in facing the special period. I believe all of this will work in our favor, he underlined. The Special Period in Times of Peace is the name given to the measures Cuba has had to adopt to confront the consequences prompted by the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union -- nations with which Cuba sustained 85 percent of its trade. In addition to the abrupt loss of its main trading partners, the island has had to confront the hardening of the U.S. blockade, which has been in effect for more than 30 years. Meanwhile, Lezcano said, there are other factors that will differentiate the situation between both 12-month periods, and he recalled that the prolonged electricity cuts and the paralysis of the factories in the capital city and the rest of the country had started in 1993. We have started January 1994 with all factories operating, albeit with limitations, but nevertheless operating and with less stringent electricity cuts scheduled than in 1993, he noted. According to Lezcano, this year should also yield the expected positive results, especially in terms of savings and the optimal use of resources because of the new system of state land cultivation called Basic Cooperative Production Units (UBPC). The new system establishes that plots are given to the associates in usufruct for an indefinite amount of time. They also receive soft loans to acquire working equipment and are the owners of the crops they produce. It is estimated that those measures will propitiate a food production increase, he added. The UBPC's started operating last October and currently exist in almost all the former state farms. The party leader also pointed out that one of the positive factors expected for this year is an improved sugarcane harvest. Last year, the harvest yielded 4.2 million tons of sugar -- the lowest since 1963. Lezcano pointed to favorable elements in the international sphere and, among others, he mentioned the considerable decrease in oil prices, which will help the country because it imports almost all the fuel it uses. For these reasons, among others, he maintained, we assert that, although there will be difficulties and problems, the work perspectives for our people and for the revolution are somewhat better than they were in 1993. This leeway allows us more possibilities to get ahead.
