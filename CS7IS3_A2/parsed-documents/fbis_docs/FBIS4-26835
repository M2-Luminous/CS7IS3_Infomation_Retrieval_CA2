The conference set forth: This year, the province should attain the target of reducing 456 million yuan in deficits based on the deficit figure of last year. The decrease rate is 11.7 percent. The conference also urged all localities across the province to conscientiously implement the central policy on grasping favorable opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding the scale of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability; to make positive efforts to halt deficits; and to realize the 1994 targets for halting deficits and increasing profits. The conference urged that all localities should emancipate the mind, find breakthroughs from enterprises' bankruptcy and, by extensive exploration of ways, rely on reform to change mechanisms and enhance vitality, rely on science and technology to speed up the pace of transformation and enhance strength, rely on management to enhance internal strength and tap potentials, rely on policies to optimize the environment and expand external strength, and carry out the overall improvement policy to make real headway in halting deficits. The conference maintained: Last year, the province made noticeable achievements in halting deficits. The budgetary industrial, grain, forest industrial, commercial, foreign trade, and agricultural production enterprises suffered 2.06 billion yuan of deficits during the year, a drop of 839 million yuan or 33.9 percent from the figure of 1992. Viewing the economic operation situation in the first five months of this year, we know that there are great difficulties in realizing the 1994 target for reducing deficits. The conference set forth: All localities should expand the dynamics of the property right reform, balance the relations of property rights, and solve the problems cropping up due to unclear property rights and indefinite rights and responsibilities. Enterprises should optimize their existing assets and increase economic results. The conference especially stressed: We should have the daring to make a breakthrough and make bankruptcy become a kind of mechanism for halting deficits. The enterprises that are hopeless in halting deficits and those whose assets cannot compensate for their debts should declare bankruptcy according to the law governing bankruptcy and on the premise that the work in all domains has been well handled. The conference also discussed the province's manuscript on relevant policy regulations on helping enterprises halt deficits. Preferential policy regulations on creating both internal and external conditions for helping money-losing enterprises halt deficits have been stipulated in this manuscript.
