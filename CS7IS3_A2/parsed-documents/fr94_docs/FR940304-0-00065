FR940304-0-00065 FR940304-0-00019 Clermontia peleana was first collected by John Lydgate at Hamakua, island of Hawaii, and listed as an unnamed variety of C. gaudichaudii by Hillebrand (1888). Rock later collected a specimen of the taxon near Kilauea, the volcano home of the Hawaiian goddess Pele, after whom he named the species (Rock 1913). Other names by which the species has been known include: Clermontia gaudichaudii var. singuliflora (Rock 1919b), C. singuliflora (Rock 1919b), C. gaudichaudii var. barbata (Rock 1919b), C. clermontioides var. singuliflora (Hochreutiner 1934); C. clermontioides var. mauiensis, a superfluous name (Hochreutiner 1934); and C. clermontioides var. barbata (St. John 1973). In the most recent treatment of the species (Lammers 1991), two subspecies of C. peleana, ssp. singuliflora and ssp. peleana, are recognized. Clermontia peleana of the bellflower family is an epiphytic shrub or tree 5 to 20 ft (1.5 to 6 m) tall which grows on 'ohi'a, koa, Cheirodendron trigynum ('olapa), and Sadleria spp. (ama'u). The alternate, stalked, oblong or oval, toothed leaves reach a length of 3 to 8 in (8 to 20 cm) and a width of 1.2 to 2 in (3 to 5 cm). Flowers are single or paired, each on a stalk 1.2 to 1.8 in (3 to 4.5 cm) long with a main stalk 0.3 to 0.7 in (0.8 to 1.7 cm) long. Five small green calyx lobes top the hypanthium (basal portion of the flower). The blackish-purple (ssp. peleana ) or greenish-white (ssp. singuliflora ) petals, 2 to 2.8 in (5 to 7 cm) long and 0.3 to 0.5 in (0.8 to 1.3 cm) wide, are fused into a one-lipped, arching tube with five down-curved lobes. Berries of ssp. peleana are orange and 1 to 1.2 in (2.5 to 3 cm) in diameter; berries of ssp. singuliflora are unknown. This species is distinguished from others of the genus by its epiphytic growth habit; its small green calyx lobes; and its one- lipped, blackish-purple or greenish-white corolla (Lammers 1990, 1991). Historically, Clermontia peleana ssp. peleana has been found only on the island of Hawaii on the eastern slope of Mauna Loa and the northeastern and southeastern slopes of Mauna Kea. Today, the taxon is found near Waiakaumalo Stream, by the Wailuku River, near Saddle Road, and between the towns of Glenwood and Volcano. The six known populations, which extend over a distance of about 12 by 5 mi (19 by 8 km), are located on State- and federally-owned land and contain a total of approximately eight known individuals (HHP 1991b1 to 1991b7). Clermontia peleana ssp. singuliflora was formerly found on the island of Hawaii on the northern slope of Mauna Kea and on East Maui on the northwestern slope of Haleakala, but the taxon has not been seen in either place since early in the century and is believed to be extinct (HHP 1991c1 to 1991c3, Wagner et al. 1990). This species typically grows epiphytically in Montane Wet Forests dominated by koa, 'ohi'a, and Cibotium spp. and/or Sadleria spp. (tree ferns) at elevations between 1,740 and 3,800 ft (530 and 1,160 m) (HHP 1991b1 to 1991b4, 1991b6, 1991b7, Lammers 1990, 1991). Associated species include 'olapa, Melicope clusiifolia (kolokolo mokihana), and Scaevola chamissoniana (naupaka kuahiwi) (HHP 1991b1; Warren L. Wagner, Smithsonian Institution, pers. comm., 1992). The major threats to Clermontia peleana are habitat disturbance caused by feral pigs and illegal cultivation of Cannabis sativa (marijuana), roof or black rat ( Rattus rattus ) damage, flooding, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing individuals (Bruegmann 1990, Center for Plant Conservation (CPC) 1990). A sterile specimen of Clermontia pyrularia was first collected on Mauna Kea, island of Hawaii, during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841 and was named Delissea obtusa var. mollis by Gray (1861b). Later, Hillebrand (1888) collected fertile specimens of the taxon and named it C. pyrularia, referring in the specific epithet to the fruits, which are sometimes shaped like those of Pyrus (pear). Clermontia pyrularia of the bellflower family, a terrestrial tree 10 to 13 ft (3 to 4 m) tall, has alternate toothed leaves 5.9 to 11 in (15 to 28 cm) long and 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5 cm) wide with winged petioles. A cluster of two, three, or sometimes up to five flowers has a main stalk 1.1 to 2.4 in (2.8 to 6 cm) long; each flower has a stalk 0.3 to 0.8 in (0.8 to 2 cm) long. Five small green calyx lobes top the hypanthium. The white or greenish-white petals are covered with fine hairs, measure 1.6 to 1.8 in (4 to 4.5 cm) long, and are fused into a curved two-lipped tube 0.2 to 0.3 in (5 to 8 mm) wide with five spreading lobes. The orange berry is inversely ovoid or inversely pear-shaped. This species is distinguished from others of the genus by its winged petioles; its small, green calyx lobes; its two-lipped flowers with white or greenish-white petals; and the shape of its berry (Lammers 1990, 1991).
