Papazyan said: I think the ARF must publicly clarify its position on this member because the Armenian security organs must know whose political views Isagulyan expressed--his own or ARF's. If they are party views, then the Armenian Justice Ministry must open a serious investigation into the ARF's programs and decide on the legality of the party. It would be logical to expect parliament to express its position on a member. Regrettably, this is not the first time a deputy of the Armenian Supreme Council has issued overt or covert threats or calls to topple the government in an illegitimate way. Sadly, our parliament has never shown enough strength to react to or condemn such behavior by a member. The case is already extremely bizarre. An open call for terror and bloodshed by a deputy cannot go unpunished. Any self-respecting parliament would have stripped a deputy of his mandate for such a statement. I think that this time around parliament has no right to remain silent. As for the calumny directed against the Armenian foreign minister--who does the orator have in mind? He has mentioned no specific name. The previous foreign minister was also appointed by the same authorities. In that case too the calumny would have been as disgusting. Isagulyan must be brought before the court. If he made his fiery revolutionary rhetoric in a feverish moment or under the influence of alcohol or drugs or if he is suffering psychological trouble -- his statement does leave that impression -- this should represent extenuating circumstances for Garnik Isgulyan, as long as this is confirmed by an authorized medical group and made public. Personally in such cases I try to persist despite my heavy workload and regardless of the personal worth of the author of calumny. If we aspire to a law-based state we must realize that each of us must persist so that laws in the Republic can finally take effect, Papazyan concluded.
