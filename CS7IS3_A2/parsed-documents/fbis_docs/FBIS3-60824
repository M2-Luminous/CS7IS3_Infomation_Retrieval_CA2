The leaflet, which was distributed on 25 December, also says: "There will be no peace without the expulsion of the settlers from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The intifadah must be kept at a high level, and painful blows must continue to rain on the settlers. The circle of jihad between us will grow, and we shall threaten their security night and day through all possible forms of struggle." The Fatah Hawks group in the Hebron region, which is considered "Abu-Jihad's [Khalil al-Wazir] fortress," devoted its leaflet, entitled "A Call for Steadfast Struggle and Confrontation Against the Settler Gangs," to issuing various instructions to the population with regard to the struggle against the settlers, with the emphasis placed on intifadah-style activities. The Fatah Hawks declared that 1 January, Fatah Day, will mark an intensification of the battle against the settlers. Detailed instructions were given on how to assist local residents who live near the settlers in their struggle. Wealthy residents were asked to contribute funds to support these residents and the Hebron Fatah organization. Property owners were asked to take 25 percent off the rent they charge in light of the difficult economic situation in the area. Town residents were asked to increase their presence in the Cave of the Patriarchs to prevent the Jews from taking over. The Fatah Hawks have also forbidden town residents to park their cars in the center of town, "so that our squads will have an easier job carrying out their operations (against the settlers working nearby)." As in the first leaflet distributed by the Fatah Hawks approximately two weeks ago, this leaflet also calls for "national unity" and coordination between Fatah and the organizations that oppose the peace process: Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The two leaflets call for a fundamental organizational reform in Fatah activity and demand the expulsion of "suspicious elements who spread corruption in the organization's ranks and cast aside its principles, values, and history in order to empty Fatah of all content." [passage omitted] Palestinian sources in Hebron expressed the assessment that the activity of the Fatah Hawks reflects the positions of the hardliners in the organization, who call for military activities and are represented by 'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad Jihad, the heads of the organization's "western sector" mechanism. This faction of Fatah regards Abu-Jihad, 'Arafat's deputy who directed the armed struggle in Israel and was murdered in 1988, as its spiritual mentor.
