As direct investment to North Korea is difficult due to the nuclear inspection issue, domestic firms are vigorously pressing ahead with processing-on-commission trade -- a form of indirect investment -- according to the businesses concerned. Samsong Product Company has decided to increase by 30 percent the amount of products manufactured by processing-on-commission, which reached $2.5 million last year. In addition, it has decided to expand orders for export to third countries, including Japan, under this form of trade. Preparing for the ROK Government's possible authorization of a visit to North Korea within this year, Samsong has set up plans to send technicians to instruct North Korean workers on the advanced technology necessary for processing-on-commission trade for high-quality goods and to increase goods manufactured by processing-on-commission. In 1993 Daewoo purchased 100,000 man's suits made by Sinsong Trade Company using processing-on-commission and has mapped out plans to expand processing-on-commission trade to higher quality clothes.
