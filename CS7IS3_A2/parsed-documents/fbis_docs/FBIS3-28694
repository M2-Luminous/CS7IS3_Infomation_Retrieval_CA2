The forecast 2.4 percent growth target for the year starting April 1 marks the lowest since the government set a target of 2.5 percent in fiscal 1974 on a real gross national product (GNP) basis. The latest EPA forecast is much higher than the less than 1 percent projected by most private think tanks. It represents the agency's perception that the economy will shift to a full-fledged recovery track by the end of the next fiscal year. The 2.4 percent growth comprises a 3.0 percent rise in domestic demand and a 0.6 percent shrinkage in external demand, the officials said. They said the agency forecasts a current account surplus for the year of 13.8 trillion yen, against the 14.4 trillion yen projected for the current year. Consumer prices are forecast to rise 1.5 percent and wholesale prices 0.2 percent. The GNP growth projection for this fiscal year was revised down to 0.2 percent from initially projected 3.3 percent, the officials said. The projections, reported to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday, will be finalized at a meeting of cabinet ministers responsible for economic matters on Thursday.
