During the two-day meeting, members discussed the termination of the Hong Kong British authorities' last Legislative Council, two municipal councils, and district board. Members unanimously believed that the Hong Kong British authorities' administration over Hong Kong will end on 30 June 1997, that the legal basis enabling them to maintain their power will also disappear, that the original political structures embodying their administration will as a matter of course terminate at the same time, and that neither can the Hong Kong British authorities' administration continue to exist after 30 June 1997 nor do the Hong Kong British authorities have the right to make any decision on the continued existence of these structures after 30 June 1997. In addition, the subcommittee meeting studied and discussed the election system for the first Legislative Council and district organizations of the Hong Kong SAR. It has been learned that the fourth and fifth meetings of the PWC's GAS will be held in Beijing from 28 to 29 January and from 24 to 26 February, respectively.
