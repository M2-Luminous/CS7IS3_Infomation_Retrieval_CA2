Dr. Navarro, what is your opinion of the letter sent hours ago by Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff to Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin on a diplomatic protest note sent by the U.S. Department of State to the Colombian Government complaining about the attitude of our nation's top prosecutor? Good morning. [Navarro] Good morning. I think the prosecutor general is right in his conflict with sectors of the U.S. Government and Congress because I think the attitude of placing all the blame on us, which was assumed during the Reagan and Bush administrations, prevails again in the United States. I think the prosecutor general has complied with legal norms; he has in no way violated the law. The prosecutor general did not draft the Penal Procedure Code; the government and the Congress did. Thus, [words indistinct] only enforcing it. I think the prosecutor general has been mistreated. I think the summit of governors, which began in Popayan yesterday, should defend the dignified and sovereign position assumed by the prosecutor general. I do not know whether the government is somewhat caught up between [words indistinct] and the need to defend its judicial system. What is indeed true, however, is that the summit of governors [words indistinct] must support the prosecutor general and reject the discriminatory and unfair treatment of him by U.S. authorities.
