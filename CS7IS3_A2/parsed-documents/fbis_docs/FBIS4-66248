On the basis of the presumption that the GNP will grow 9 percent, the industrial production 15 percent, the agricultural production 4 percent, the urban and rural residents' incomes 24 percent, the total investment in fixed assets 13 percent and all other economic targets are fulfilled as planned, the total amount of retail sales in 1994 would reach 1.57 trillion yuan, up 18 percent over 1993. If price increases are factored in, the actual percentage would be approximately 7.3 percent, of which the amount of retail sales for consumer goods would grow approximately 19 percent and the capital goods for agriculture approximately 10 percent. We estimate that the sales of major commodities will be as follows: Grain Preliminarily we estimate that China's total grain output will be 451.79 million tons. A balance between supply and demand will be basically achieved on the grain market with a slight over-supply. However, structural imbalance will remain existent. This year, the price for purchasing farm products will steadily move upwards in general. The increase will not be excessively high this year, because last year's price was already relatively high. The price increase is not expected to exceed 10 percent. As for specific varieties of grain, the situation of wheat shortage has been alleviated. The supply of wheat will exceed the demand slightly. Due to the readjustment of the import policy and the introduction of the single foreign exchange rate, the market price is expected to go up on a small scale. The prices of millet and soybean will remain strong because of the continuous expansion of millet and soybean exports and the increasing demand of such farm products on the domestic market. The price of soybean is expected to rise only slightly, while that of millet will be relatively higher. The supply of paddy rice will be slightly insufficient, because the area planted with paddy rice was dropping every year and its output declined on a large scale. It is possible that the situation of rice shortage may reappear in some areas. Price increase may be relatively high, and there is an inkling of such price increase. The price of oil-bearing crops may rise on a large scale this year due to low inventory and dwindling output. Cotton. This year's demand for cotton is about 4.5 million tons. The supply and demand of cotton in China are relatively stable. Cotton is mainly used in light industry, textile industry, cotton for wadding, exports, cotton reserve and other uses. A balance has been basically achieved in the exports and imports of cotton in recent years. The use of cotton for wadding and other uses is basically stable. The supply and demand for cotton in 1994 are mainly dependent on cotton production and how much cotton will be used by textiles and other light industrial products. After the 10 percent increase of the cotton-purchasing price in 1989, the effective supply of cotton has increased. The higher cotton price and the rise of the production costs for textile products have greatly prevented the textile industry from blinding expanding. However, since nearly one-third of the capacity in textile industry is idling, the supply and demand of cotton have become stable. The export of cotton textiles remains basically stable. Due to the limits imposed by the international quota, it is difficult to increase exports in this connection. On the other hand, the domestic cotton price is relatively higher. The advantage in exporting cotton and silk products is notably declining, and it is rather difficult to compete with others on the international market in this connection. In recent years, there have been no major breakthroughs in developing cotton varieties and production technology. The average per-mu yield of cotton is basically between 50 and 60 kg. If the area planted with cotton in the whole country is maintained at the present level of about 90 million mu, the output of cotton will be approximately 4.8 million tons. Thus, the total supply and demand of cotton are expected to strike a balance in the country. Sugar The supply of sugar may fall short of demand this year. The main reasons are as follows: A gap is formed in the supply of sugar in the world, and sugar prices skyrocket on the international market. In recent years, major sugar-producing countries in the world such as Cuba, Thailand and India reported reduced sugar production, while sugar consumption is rising. The amount of sugar to fill this gap is about 2.84 million tons, causing the sugar price to go up. However the demand of sugar-consuming countries and districts is growing. In 1993, Russia was expected to consume 7.5 million tons of sugar, but it only produced two million tons itself. It needed to import a large amount of sugar. Under the influence of the supply and demand of sugar in these countries, tremendous changes have taken place in the relations between the imports and exports of sugar in China. China has become a purely sugar-exporting nation from a purely sugar-importing nation in 1991. According to customs statistics, a total of 1.06 million tons of sugar were exported and 250,000 tons of sugar imported between October 1992 and April 1993, leaving a net export of 810,000 tons of sugar, up 710,000 tons over the same period in the previous year. In addition, the sugar reserve in stock is dwindling, and the area planted with sugar-bearing crops is shrinking. The supply of sugar is expected to be scant in 1994. The sales of articles of daily use will be basically at the same level as before. The demand for bicycles, wrist watches, sewing machines and aluminum wares will be somewhat greater. The sales of other articles of daily use will be about the same or slightly weak. However, products of higher grades will be in great demand. Consumers will prefer products of higher quality, new designs and better features. Particularly they will prefer stainless steel cooking utensils and electric appliances. They will tend to buy more high-quality perfumed soap and cosmetic manufactured by Sino-foreign joint ventures. For bicycles, consumers prefer to lighter, smaller, more convenient ones with variable gear-shifts. The sales of mountain bicycles will notably increase. There will be an over-supply of sewing machines on the market, and the inventory would increase. The sales may somewhat go up slightly when new models appear on the market. There will be an over-supply of wrist watches, and the inventory would increase. The supply and demand of soap, toothpaste, detergent, aluminum pots, thermos and other articles of daily use will level off. Due to the increase of varieties and reasonable prices, utensils made of plastic material will register a steady growth. There will be little changes in the sales and marketing of canned goods, after their prices bottom out. The export of toys will rise, but not much efforts are being made in pushing domestic sales. There is a large potential to sell toys domestically. The general trend in the sales of enamelware has changed. Now, the supply exceeds demand instead of the supply falling short of demand several years ago. The market demand will drop, because the enamelware products are gradually being replaced by their plastic counterparts. The sales of durable goods with low inventory in cities will increase such as motorcycles, air conditioners, video tape recorders, video cameras, computers, high-quality audio equipment and health care products. The demand of such products will drop in medium-sized and small cities, but the total demand of such products in the whole society will grow. The market for refrigerators will flourish. The prospect in exporting more electric fans is good, although the domestic demand for such fans is decreasing. In short, the total demand for electric fans is rising. The demand for air conditioners and ceiling fans will increase, while that for table electric fans will level off. The demand for color television sets will increase slightly. More color television sets will be sold in medium-sized and small cities and flourishing rural areas instead of large cities. The demand for table-model recorders, imported pocket-sized radio sets and boom boxes with CD players will increase. Stereo equipment in the 2,500 yuan price range will become popular. In addition, there will a good market for electric heating shower equipment, kitchen exhaust fans, microwave ovens, rice cookers, food processors, electric ovens, air purifiers, heating equipment for health care and other home appliances. This forecast is made on the basis of the following reasons: 1. The macro-economy is being developed healthily, and the supply of commodities is continuously increasing. According to a preliminary estimate made by a relevant department, the total value of commodity supply for 1994 will reach 1.655 trillion yuan, and the supply of commodities will exceed demand by approximately 55 billion yuan. 2. There will be a steady growth of residents' income. If factors such as the gradual increase of government employees' salaries and its influence as well as the price adjustment of major rural products are taken into consideration, this year's growth rate of residents' actual incomes is expected to be higher than that in the last year. The workers' wage is expected to increase 21.8 percent, slightly higher than the 21.6 percent in the previous year. The per-capita peasants' net income will be close to 1,000 yuan with its growth rate exceeding 13 percent (12.2 percent in the previous year). 3. There will be more investments in capital construction. The total amount of investment in fixed assets in 1993 is expected to reach 1.15 trillion yuan, up approximately 46 percent over that in 1992. It is estimated that this figure will reach 1.3 trillion yuan in 1994, up about 150 billion yuan over 1993. 4. There will a reasonable growth in institutional purchases. The rate of growth in 1993 is expected to be approximately 25 percent. The expenditure of social groups for consumer goods will still go upwards. 5. There will be more currency issued this year as compared with the last year. The total amount of currency issued in 1993 is expected to be between 29 and 38 percent higher than that in 1992. The amount issued in 1994 will be higher than that in 1993. 6. The sales of some commodities will decline. Due to considerable fluctuations in the exchange rate, the delay in re-entering the GATT, the large-scale price increases and the relatively low interest rate for deposits, some residents rushed to buy imported or domestically manufactured high-quality home appliances and jewelry made of gold during the first half of 1993. These purchases, which were ahead of season, will push the price of such commodities down this year.
