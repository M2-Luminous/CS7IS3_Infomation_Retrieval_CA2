Leaders of the five groupings stressed that the coalition is of a confederation character and that there are proper conditions at present to form a conservative and liberal camp, as time will act to the advantage of such a camp. Leader of the Conservative Party Aleksander Hall said that the formation of such a camp will decide whether the Right in Poland will score a success. He stressed that his party is determined to form a strong right-wing centre in the coalition. The SND was set up in April 1992. At present the party has about one thousand members.
