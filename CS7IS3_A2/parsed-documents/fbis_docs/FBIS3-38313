In its statement, the Greek Embassy says that the Greek prime minister never expressed, either directly or indirectly, any hint regarding the honesty of their cooperation or any lack of mutual briefing. Therefore, it adds, the relevant reports are pure fantasy. The statement finally adds that with this opportunity the Greek prime minister once again expresses his particular respect for Kliridhis.
