"Events show what an excited state Russia's political circles are in at present. The Civil Accord Treaty [Dogovor o Grazhdanskom Soglasii] will help to bring political passions in our country under control." The situation which developed in the State Duma 27 April in connection with the murder of a deputy, and the nervousness and political hullabaloo which reigned in the Duma, is further evidence of how much civil accord is essential to us all, he emphasized.
