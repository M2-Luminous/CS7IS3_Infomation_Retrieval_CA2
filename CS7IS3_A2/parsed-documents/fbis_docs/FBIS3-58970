Venizelos] [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis will not participate in talks on the so-called confidence-building measures nor in proximity talks on this package as proposed by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. According to information received by I SIMERINI, President Kliridhis told the UN envoys Joe Clark, Gustave Feissel and John Paul Kavanagh, who presented him with a copy of the official reply letter of the Turkish Cypriot side, that, "this cannot be considered a positive answer on the package of confidence-building measures." The same sources told I SIMERINI that the UN officials asked President Kliridhis to set aside the terms and conditions raised by Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas so that talks may begin immediately. "Consider that the terms have not been set and that a the issue of the confidence-building measures will be resolved during the talks," the UN envoys insisted. But the president was not convinced. Things will certainly be clarified today when the UN secretary general's envoys again meet with President Kliridhis and Denktas. [passage omitted]
