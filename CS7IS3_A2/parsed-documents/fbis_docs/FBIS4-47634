FBIS TRENDS-20May94-Russia Zyuganov Sees Broad International and Domestic Conspiracy Zyuganov Sees Broad International and Domestic Conspiracy Against Russia SUMMARY Gennadiy Zyuganov, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) outlines his view that Russia is the target of a broad and centuries-old conspiracy in his book Derzhava (Great Power), a collection of his essays and interviews with him, published in January 1994. He sees the main forces behind the conspiracy today as Zionists, capitalists, and Western nations, especially the United States. Their plot is carried out by agents in Russia, who in recent years have included former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Since the plotters and their agents have successfully employed a strategy of successively defeating opposing forces in Russia by luring them into violent confrontations such as those of August 1991 and October 1993, Zyuganov believes that "patriots'' can defeat Yeltsin and the anti-Russian plotters only trough nonviolent, legal opposition and by uniting behind an ideology that fuses elements of Russian nationalism and communism. Zyuganov has consistently expounded these themes of a broad plot against Russia and the need for a nationalist-communist fusion to counter it since 1992, when he became a leading force of the anti-Yeltsin opposition. These themes are not unique to Zyuganov and the CPRF, however, for other opposition leaders, including Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, have cited the existence of an international plot against Russia and articulated an ideology that combines nationalism with elements of traditional Soviet communism. END SUMMARY According to Zyuganov the great plot was hatched more than a thousand years ago, at the dawn of Russian history, by malevolent forces determined to subjugate Russia, which they see as the main obstacle to their plans for world domination. Zyuganov blames this plot for all the horrors and suffering, such as the Great Purges of the Thirties, that have afflicted Russia throughout its history. In his view, those behind the plot have used witting agents and manipulated unwitting fools inside Russia to undermine Russia's economic and social structure by orchestrating economic chaos, political unrest, and social upheaval. Behind the Plot While Zyuganov sometimes explicitly accuses the United Nations and the United States of being instigators of what he describes as recurring attempts to destroy Russia in the current era, at other times he is less explicit and lapses into mystical rhetoric about the secretive roots of the plot. Although he uses Soviet style anti-capitalist rhetoric, his depiction of the plot appears to be drawn from the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion, allegedly a blueprint for world domination by the Masons and Jewish Elders now acknowledged as a forgery concocted by the Czarist secret police. The Protocols, which have been repeatedly reprinted by ultranationalist media in post Soviet Russia, warn of a strong President installing a new constitution and accumulating personal power for the benefit of his unseen patrons, the Jewish-Masonic plotters and a rapacious capitalist class, ever prepared to sell out the Motherland to enhance the power of the hidden hand behind the great plot. (See Box 1) Zyuganov explains both the Bolshevik revolution and the disintegration of the Soviet Union as products of this plot and its efforts to subvert Russia. During the revolution, russophobes and internationalists among the Bolsheviks perverted the struggle of honest Russians against the rapacious capitalist class and instituted a Soviet dictatorship that kept Russia in subjugation. According to Zyuganov the good features of the Soviet era--the victory over Fascism or social protection for children, for example--were due to the selfless qualities of the Russian people and the patriotic Russian elements within the communist party. The bad features--the cruelty and bureaucratism of the system, for example--were the work of the plotters and their witting and unwitting agents. He sees the breakup of the Soviet Union as a move by the plotters and "agent" like Gorbachev and Yeltsin to keep the USSR from obstructing the establishment of a new world order under U.S. domination. Interpretation of Recent Events In a section of Derzhava titled "The Algebra of Politics" (published in FBIS USR 94-003-L, "Zyuganov on Russian 'Catastrophe"'), Zyuganov applied his conspiracy theory to the attempted coup of August 1991 and Yeltsin's clash with the Supreme Soviet in September-October 1993, seeing both events as the skillful elimination of opposing forces in Russia by the plotters and their agents. Describing both as examples of "virtuoso use" of the natural flow of events and the "method of controlled explosions," Zyuganov alleges that the plotters used the clashes to remove from the Russian political arena "all forces capable of impeding the country's integration into the single supra-state system of the 'new world order.'" According to Zyuganov's interpretation of the fall 1993 clash, Yeltsin took advantage of his almost complete control of the country's power structures to deliberately provoke a confrontation with the Supreme Soviet during 1993 in preparation for defeating and ousting them. "All who were 'against' democratic extremism" gathered under the banner of the Supreme Soviet, but they were completely and decisively defeated. Among the few positive facets of this crisis, Zyuganov says, was that certain extremist organizations that had afforded the "democrats" a pretext for the "dirtiest and most unbridled accusations against the patriots" were "swept from the political stage." Zyuganov's Current Strategy Zyuganov concludes the "Algebra of Politics" with an assertion that "the present antipopular regime" will inevitably collapse under the pressure of an increasingly hostile populace if the opposition does not repeat the mistakes of the past and refuses to be drawn into a violent confrontation. As a result of the 1991 and 1993 clashes, he claims, more people have become aware of the "real nature of the present authorities" and are convinced that Russia can be saved only by "the unification of all healthy forces based on our centuries-old national-state, spiritual, moral, and religious values." Arguing that the Yeltsin regime can hold on to power "only by intensifying the dictatorship", Zyuganov argues that the opposition must pursue a peaceful, nonviolent path that will provide no pretext for the use of force against it. "If it is compelled to exist for any length of time under the conditions of peaceful, nonviolent development and legal stability, [the Yeltsin regime] will inevitably be swept away by the opposition." Nationalist-Communist Fusion A main element of Zyuganov's strategy for defeating Yeltsin and the plotters is his effort to unite the opposition under an ideology that fuses Russian nationalism and communism. He rejects Marxism-Lenninism's traditional international focus in favor of an explicitly Russo-centric version of communism. Indeed, despite his long career in the communist apparatus, which included a stint as an ideologist with the CPSU Central Committee, the views he expounds in Derzhava make clear that he is not a proponent of communist ideology's official internationalism. Zyuganov views the communist era as a continuation rather than a break with Russian history, but an era flawed because the Russian people suffered at the hands of the Russophobes within the communist party. According to Zyuganov, the Russian people, ever altruistic and selfless, suffered more than all the other nations of the Russian-Soviet empire as they were required to sacrifice their interests for the good of all. Although he rejects some aspects of the communist era, Zyuganov sees many of its features as positive continuations of Russian spirit and achievement. In his view, the USSR continued Czarist Russia's powerful spiritual legacy, its collectivist spirit, and ideological consensus, which enabled the communist rank and file and the common people to build a powerful, feared, and respected state, which became an industrial society, repulsed the Nazi invaders, launched powerful rockets, and looked after the old and the sick. Zyuganov sees the effort to use these common positive elements from the Russian imperial past as the basis for a revival of Russia, a revival that should be lead by undogmatic, patriotic communists who are willing to work with the Church and other traditionalist elements. Proceeding from this identification of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, Zyuganov calls on all "patriots," that is, those who want Russia to inherit the USSR's great power status, to unite to achieve that goal. The Two Parties Within the CPSU Central to Zyuganov's fusion of nationalism and communism is his view that the Soviet Communist Party was divided internally between two philosophically antagonistic parties: the party of "our country" ("nasha strana")--made up of populists and patriots--and the party of "that country" ("eta strana") made up of internationalist, cosmopolitan, and mercenary elements, coming largely from among ethnic minorities. According to Zyuganov, the party of "our country," the party of rank and file communists and men like Marshall Georgiy Zhyukov (hero of the Great Patriotic War) and Cosmonaut Yuriy Gagarin, was fundamentally patriotic and Russian. It never lost its affection for Russian tradition and its sympathy for the common man, in whose name the Great October Revolution was made. In Zyuganov's view, the party of "our country" saw the particular talents and spiritual qualities of the Russian people, rather than dogmatic adherence to Marxism- Leninism, as the essential element in the construction of the Soviet Union and its socialist system, which, for all its shortcomings, achieved much that is worth preserving. Zyuganov holds the party of "that country" responsible for all the black pages of Soviet history, due, at least in part to its strong non-Russian composition. He cites the influence of the Jews Leon Trotsky and Lazar Kaganovich, and the Georgian Lavrenti Beria (but not the Georgian Stalin). Zyuganov sees these non- Russians as incapable of drawing on Russian traditions which were alien to them. Indeed, he views them as Russophobes with accomplices among the mercenary, careerist elements within the party, elements he says were exemplified in the late Soviet period by figures like former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Relationship to Other Nationalists Despite ideological and political divisions among Russian Ultranationalist groups, Zyuganov's notion of an international plot against Russia is shared in some form by virtually all these groups. LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and other nationalist figures (See Box 2) frequently make reference to Western-Zionist (in the sense of the "Zionism" of the Protocols, that is, as a world-wide Jewish conspiracy) attempts to destroy Russia and have wielded terms like "agent of influence" to describe those they consider ideological enemies. Such politicians seem to agree in viewing the Soviet period as merely one stage in the unbroken chain of Russian history. Box 1 The Protocols of the Elders of Zion The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, concocted by the Czarist secret police to encourage ultra-nationalist resistance to reform of the Czarist system, were published in a widely circulated edition in Russia in 1905 by the court printers at Czarskoye Selo, and later at the print shop of the Troitse-Sergeyeva Lavra, one of pre-revolutionary Russia's foremost monasteries. The Protocols ostensibly are the records of meetings of the Elders of Zion, a secret Jewish society allied with the Masonic order and dedicated to establishing world rule by the elders. Nationalist fanatics saw the Protocols as proof that not only the revolutionary movement, but capitalists and reformers as well, were agents of a world-wide conspiracy to destroy the Czarist order. The Protocols have found a ready audience among oppositionists today, and they have been reprinted and commented on countless times in the opposition press. Reports of opposition gatherings regularly report the sale the Protocols to participants. All references are to the version published in Molodaya Gvardiya No. 10, 1993: "Our watchwords are force and hypocrisy . . . we must not shrink from bribery, deception and treachery . . . on the path to world domination . . . around the world the words 'liberty, equality, fraternity,' are attracting whole legions of our blind agents." p.134 "The role of the press is to order up the necessary demands, to pass along the plea of the people's voice, to express and create discontent . . . it [the press] will be in our hands." p.135 "Having created by all the underground means available to us, with the help of our gold, all of which is in our hands, a general economic crisis, we will throw whole crowds of workers out on the streets simultaneously in all the countries of Europe. p.138 "We must undermine faith, to take the very principle of God and the spirit from the lips of the gentiles and exchange everything for a simple arithmetic of accounting by material demands . . . all feelings toward the Motherland and religion will be displaced by cosmopolitan institutions." p.139 "They [the gentiles] will be forced [by perpetual crisis] to turn over international power to us . . . to form a supergovernment." p. 141 "Through speculation all of the world's money will wind up in our hands, and that will force all of the gentiles into the ranks of the proletariat." p.142 "We have serving us people of all opinions, of all doctrines . . . monarchists, . . . socialists, and all kinds of utopians." p.146 "From liberalism is born constitutional government . . . the president will be taken from among our creatures, our slaves." p.149 "We will supply our own opposition . . . which will present itself as our antipode . . . our actual opposition will, in spirit, accept this opposition as their own." "[In order to undermine traditional morals] we have created mindless, filthy, disgusting literature." p.157 A footnote states: "The participation of Jews in the creation and distribution of this type of literature is well known." "The Russian autocracy is the single serious enemy for us in the world, if the Papacy is not taken into account." p.158 "When it becomes necessary to strengthen strong security measures, we will arrange simulations of disturbances and manifestations of discontent." p. 166 END BOX 1 BOX 2 Other Opposition Figures on "Plot" Against Russia Claims of international Zionist or imperialist conspiracies against Russia are prominent features of the ideologies of most Russian ultranationalist groups. The mainstream Russian media have noted the commonality of conspiracy theories among the movements, as illustrated by the following account of the first meeting of General Aleksandr Sterligov's Russian National Assembly, from a Moscow Mayak radio account: "What unites these people? After all, one can see monarchists, nationalists, KGB staffers, engineering and technical personnel, along with many military and communist figures in the hall. So, in the view of these patriots, international forces embodied by the International Zionist Organization, the World Jewish Congress, and some other organizations are destroying Slavic statehood through the United Nations, the CSCE, the EC, and NATO." (12 June 1992) From an ITAR-TASS report on the same meeting: "Addressing the delegates, [nationalist writer] Valentin Rasputin said that 'Satanic forces are experimenting on Russia,' which is 'surrounded by domestic and foreign devils,' and that 'Russia cannot recover from the blows it received from the democrats' . . [Russian National Assembly Chairman] Aleksandr Sterligov said that Russia's foes are 'working on destroying Russia' and added that 'the goals of American imperialism to demolish Russia have been achieved' . . . Yeltsin and his accomplices have reached their objective to weaken Russia and now they can 'board their plane and fly off to their Western values.'" (12 June 1992) Direct statements from ultranationalist groups themselves also cite the existence of conspiracies against Russia as in this appeal by military officers to the Russian Supreme Soviet: "The destruction of the USSR has been carried out through the joint actions of imperialism, Zionism, and internal reaction." (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 March 1993) From an interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: "The United States is the evil empire, the nucleus of hell, which is behind the beginning of every war . . . .1 spit on the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They are criminals, CIA agents' They have trying to introduce their system everywhere and at all times . . . the Anglo-Saxon model under the ideological influence of Jerusalem." (Warsaw, Sztandar Mlodych, 1 February 1993). From an interview with the Russian Orthodox Church's Metropolitan Ioann of St. Petersburg: Reporter: "During the past 50 years it has been declared repeatedly that the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' is a literary falsification. Ioann: I think this way: there is a saying that the cap burns on the thief. If these Protocols are forged, then what are the Zionists worried about? Of course it is difficult to determine who wrote them, but the program is already in operation. . . Reporter: Do you believe in the possibility of a world conspiracy against Russia? Ioann: It is not just possible, there is one. . . Zionism is founded not on religious domination but on the golden calf, on domination on a global scale." (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 16 April 1993) According to a 27 July 1993 Interfax report on a conference of the oppositionist National Salvation Front: "A number of nationally-minded parties' have left the NSF . . . . [Russian National Republican Party leader Nikolay] Lysenko claimed that certain unnamed members of the NSF [which includes Communist Party Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov] were 'obsessed' with a 'Judeo- Masonic conspiracy'." END BOX 2 Appendix A Unless otherwise noted, all quotations below are from Derzhava Continuity of Russian/Soviet History The communist party has behaved differently toward the Church at different times in its history, from harsh opposition to cooperation during the Great Patriotic War. . . . I see no reason to repeat old mistakes . . . . We [CPRF] are for freedom of conscience to such a degree, that believers have the right to join our party without any sort of limitations. p.8 Life forces us to greater wisdom. . . . We should look at our own history and understand the meaning for the world of the thousand year history of Russian statehood . . . from century to century we were inspired by the labor and the achievements of our forebears in building a great power. . . . Our main, primary duty is to re-establish this holy connection [with our past]. p.13 An empire, a great power, they [the democrats] tell us, means an all-powerful bureaucracy . . . [it means] censorship, the absence of elementary rights. . . . This is a lie! Empire is the historical and geopolitically stipulated form of development for the Russian state . . . it is many different . . . peoples, connected by a single general and higher culture. . . . From ancient times, Russia recognized itself as the successor and preserver of the imperial heritage. 'Moscow is the third Rome' . Russia is the continuation of the universal imperial tradition. p.15 It [the national unity of imperial Russia] found expression in the formula "Autocracy, Orthodoxy, Narodnost [national roots]." p.15 The revolution of 1917 was the natural result of the general crisis . . . Autocracy gradually was transformed into a regime of all-powerful, cosmopolitan bureaucrats . . . [which had] divided the supreme power from the people. p.18 Having united the "red" ideal of social justice . . . and the "white" ideal of national . . . statehood [Russia will have] the might [necessary to reestablish] our . . . Fatherland! p.33 The Russian people . . . are the preservers of Russian statehood, its main bearer and defender . . . the free development of . . . peoples . . . who have connected their historical fate with Russia must become the cornerstone of Russian state policy. p.41 Conflict of the Two Parties Within the CPSU In fact, there were two parties . . . [during] the Soviet period, and a fierce, but quiet struggle, between them took place. . The first was the party of "our country," the party to which . Zhukov and Gagarin belonged . . . the largest part of ordinary functionaries and administrators belonged to it . . . but there was a second party in the Soviet Union--the party of "that country," . . . for whom "that country," and "those people" were merely the arena for the realization of their own . . . ambitions and . . . reckless social experiments. It was the party of Trotsky and Kaganovich, Beria, . . . Gorbachev and Yeltsin, Yakovlev and Shevardnadze. Its legal successor today is "Demrossiya." p.66 I joined the party of . . . Zhukov . . . each person must bear personal responsibility for their own actions, and the effort [by the Yeltsin administration] to portray 40 million people, people who were members of the party, as state criminals--this is political genocide directed against the Russian people, and that cannot be allowed to happen again. p.7 [During the revolutionary period of 1917 and after] heroism and treachery . . . patriotism and Russophobia poured forth in one fiery torrent . . . among the victors. . . . [There were] various approaches to the future of the country . . . for some, Russia, regardless of her new name [the USSR], was . . . the Fatherland, the beloved native country . . . but for others she was simply . . [a platform] for the "permanent" revolution, a proving ground for new world cataclysms . . . for inhuman experiments . . . a reserve of resources and "human material." The first group endeavored to reestablish the destroyed, paralyzed economy . . . to modernize the economy, build new factories, and resurrect the armed forces. The second group . . . cruelly destroyed hostages by the thousands . . . [and] organized the concentration camps. . . The interparty struggle of these two groups . . . went on for many long decades . . . and decisively predetermined the dramatic events of the last few years. p.19 [During World War II] for communists there was one privilege, to be the first raised up in battle, to be the first to be shot if captured. . . . During that period there was [an internal-party] decision to turn away from doctrinal myths, from Russophobia and the . . . anti-Church campaign. . . . [During the] "Khrushchev thaw" all of the haters of Russia were able to . . . freeze the process of Russian national rebirth which had only just begun. p.21 The Great Plot Against Russia A. Historical Roots From "The Russian Question" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 3 July 1993): To a large extent, the West does not understand us. It is afraid of our might as a world power. It has a self-interest in weakening, dismembering, and, if possible, enslaving Russia . . . [efforts to do so span] a period of more than a thousand years. The Western states and the transnational banking and financial corporations are, in the final analysis, the obedient relayers of thee aggressive and irreconcilable anti-Russian policy . . . an independent, self reliant Russia, [represents] in the modern world, the chief hindrance on the path of creating a "New World Order," that stipulates the formation of supernational agencies of political, economic, and military leadership. That maniacal idea has an ancient history that is closely linked with the development of secret political societies, religious sects, and mystical dogmas. But it was not until the end of the 20th century that the idea received the fundamental possibility of practical realization as a result of the achievements of scientific-technical programs and the objective processes of global economic integration. B. Current Manifestations If you look over the program of the International Monetary Fund . . . you will find that the essence of it amounts to one thing--to make our economy non-competitive--first [they plan to] destroy fundamental science. . . . From the point of view of America, I understand their interest [in such a program]. From our point of view, this is nothing more than colonial democracy. . . . We live on one planet, on the same cosmic ship, which is flying through space at great speed, and if we violate the balance of equilibrium in something, and a narrow, American elite gets it into their heads to form a new planetary system of a one-party nature, and thereby establish a new dictatorship, a world order, then we are waiting for, in our own time, a Macedonian, Napoleonic, Hitlerian order. [Such an order] is unnatural. pp. 8-9 [Technological changes after the second world war make possible, for the first time in history] effective coordination of the development of world civilization in all the most important parameters. . . . It is not surprising that this development has caused the sharp activization of trans-national, cosmopolitan forces, who are attempting to realize such possibilities in the concrete geopolitical form of a world superstate. This superstructure must, by the logic of its own elaboraters, gradually eliminate sovereign national states. . . . [These efforts] are proceeding from a single ruling center. The practical work of the creation of such a center began long ago. p.23 The developed capitalist states are prepared to support the idea of the creation of the "New World Order," within which they will strengthen their own leading role. . . . [Within the New World Order] certain regions will prosper, while the development of others will be artificially frozen. Is it necessary to clarify in which group Russia will be under such a "division of labor." p. 23 [Under conditions of a division of labor there must be a] planned reduction [of population] . . . of peoples "without prospects" . . It is easy to do it by regulating the conditions of life without need of concentration camps or gas chambers. In Russia, in any event, for two years . . . the population has been dropping, and this is a concrete example of how economic "reforms" can regulate demographic processes. p.25 Our own "time of troubles" has obviously revealed the fact of a crisis of Russian national consciousness. The collapse of the Soviet Union convincingly has shown that the denationalized ideology of the "stagnation" period was not able to resist the destructive, anti-state activities of Russia's enemies. . . . The nationalist regimes of the periphery were able to form and survive thanks to two factors: the betrayal by the ruling clique of the interests of the Russian people and the apathy of a significant part of the Russian majority, which found itself indifferent to the fate of their own countrymen who were "abroad." p. 29 "De-Russification" is being carried out by the current regime . . . by the order of, and under the control of, world-wide "centers of influence." p.29 I have studied documents of the State Department of the USA and the CIA, which were directed toward the destruction of our country and requested the Constitutional Court, where they [the government] were trying to portray the CPSU as a criminal organization, to publish them. Let everyone know who is who and what are their true plans. p.38 The experience of the last few years proves the lie of the idea of division of powers . . . it is necessary to subordinate the executive power to the legislative and liquidate the institution of the presidency. p. 69 The executive authority has deprived itself of legitimacy, having . . . violated the . . . Constitution . . . the results of the [December] referendum have no legal force . . . a so called opposition bloc, that of Shakray, is being formed for the purpose of the formation of a dictatorship of the Anglo-American type. . . . All of this, down to the last detail, was thought out and considered for the purpose of deceiving the people. p.75 From "Appeal to the Citizens of Russia by the National Salvation Front Organizing Committee" signed by Zyuganov, among others: We are convinced that the tragedy that has befallen our country is the result of a deliberate anti-people policy by the ruling elite. . . . The foreign masters of our new rulers are going around Russia telling us what to do and how to live (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 1 October 1992). Opposition Strategy Why should we communists take part in the elections? First of all so that we, together with our people, who have been decieved [by the Yeltsin regime], can try to take advantage of the small possibility [opened for us by the elections] for liberating the people from deception. p.75 In brief, this set of methods [used by the Yeltsin regime to destroy the opposition] could be formulated as follows: "DIVISION--CONFLICT--DEADLOCK--EXPLOSION--COLLAPSE." The seed of division is introduced. . . . The rival factions are artificially polarized. . . . This is followed by political deadlock and then a severe crisis, in the course . . . of which the "enemy" political grouping is liquidated. There is no future for the present anti-popular regime, however. IF IT IS COMPELLED TO EXIST FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF PEACEFUL, NONVIOLENT DEVELOPMENT AND LEGAL STABILITY, IT WILL INEVITABLY BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE OPPOSITION. The present "elite" can hold on to power only by intensifying the dictatorship. Increasingly new conflicts and social unrest are needed as a pretext for this. p.63 (AUTHOR: ALLENSWORTH.
