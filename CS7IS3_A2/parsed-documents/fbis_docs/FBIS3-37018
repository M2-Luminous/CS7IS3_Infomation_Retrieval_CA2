DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil Assesses the Military Adventure That Is Being Prepared"] [Text] In recent days a propaganda campaign directed against North Korea has been surging ahead strongly in the West and on the other side of the ocean. In terms of its scale and tone it is commensurate with what happened on the eve of the ill-starred Desert Storm. Numerous voices are to be heard saying that it is necessary to "punish" the DPRK and "crush" it by military might. The reasoning is the traditional pharisaical reasoning: shouts about some threat to peace in Northeast Asia supposedly stemming from this small socialist state. Our correspondent met with Comrade Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, and asked him to answer questions connected with these extremely alarming circumstances. [Turchenko] Comrade Son Song-pil, there can be few people now who would doubt that when the world policeman shouts "Stop thief!" this is nothing but a propaganda smoke screen to conceal from public opinion the machinations going on behind the scenes. Where is the dog buried in this instance? [Son] In Japan. A powerful nuclear reactor was started up in that country a few days ago. Japan has become capable of producing nuclear weapons. Capacities for the production of 800 tonnes [figure as published] of plutonium a year have been commissioned. In terms of this indicator the Japanese have emerged into third place in the world after the United States and France. On Japanese territory now there is 1.6 tonnes of plutonium, plus it has 2.9 tonnes abroad. Up to 50 tonnes is being forecast by the start of the next millennium. That would be enough to provide 6,200 nuclear weapons. In addition, Japan possesses ICBM's capable of carrying them. In the past North and South Korea signed a declaration on turning the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear-free zone. We are working to extend this status to the whole of Northeast Asia. But if Japan becomes a nuclear power, that will pose a tremendous threat to the Korean Peninsula, and the said declaration will lose all meaning. Such a militarist step will encourage other countries in the region, including ours, to take appropriate measures. We are convinced that the world community must show vigilance and halt this process in a timely manner. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on this 4 February. But, instead of exerting appropriate influence over Japan, the United States raised a propaganda ballyhoo over our country, accusing it of what the Japanese ought to have been accused of. The DPRK, however, has neither the intention nor the material potential to produce nuclear weapons. [Turchenko] This propaganda ballyhoo does not seem to have been raised just to cover Japan's militarist aspirations. Are there any other aims? [Son] There are several. When the Soviet Union existed, the Americans had military bases in South Korea on the pretext of a supposed threat from the USSR. Now that pretext has fallen away. Now they make a bugaboo out of North Korea so as to provide at least some reason for a military presence in Northeast Asia. Another aim is connected with the long-standing U.S. desire to destroy our socialist state. In order to create a propaganda base for the use of military force, they accuse us of allegedly not only having long-range missiles ourselves but also selling them to Near East countries, thereby destabilizing the situation. Basing themselves on these propaganda fabrications, U.S. militarist circles insist on military sanctions against the DPRK. I wish to emphasize: Our armed forces are built on the principle of self-defense and threaten no one. On the contrary, proceeding from the essence of the socialist system, the DPRK strives to strengthen peace by all means. It is, however, the firm will of the people and the Army to uphold the country's sovereignty. We are ready for any surprise attack and are always true to our position: to respond to dialogue with dialogue, and to war with war. [Turchenko] How real is the threat of an attack on the DPRK, and what do you see as the time frame of this sinister prospect? [Son] The United States is already taking specific steps to this end. In recent days, for example, intensive work has been under way to site U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea. Unfortunately, I have to state that an attack might be made at any moment. [Turchenko] Of course, the entire world community is obliged to prevent such a development of events, but the primary duty lies with the countries with which you have treaties of mutual assistance. Please name them. [Son] We have such treaties, including treaties in military spheres, with China and the USSR. Russia is the successor to the USSR, and our treaty has not lost its force. [Turchenko] How did the Russian authorities react to the DPRK Foreign Ministry's 4 February statement? [Son] The Russian Federation Foreign Ministry told us that it would study it, but there has not yet been an official reaction. In this connection I must emphasize the following. The maintenance of peace is undoubtedly the common concern of all countries. The more people who are found to help us at a difficult moment, the better. But it is not always possible to count on anyone in the business of upholding sovereignty. Our people and our Army are ready for very determined actions. If we are attacked, the whole people will be mobilized and together with the Army will rise to the motherland's defense. Let those who are planning aggression in North Korea ponder that.
