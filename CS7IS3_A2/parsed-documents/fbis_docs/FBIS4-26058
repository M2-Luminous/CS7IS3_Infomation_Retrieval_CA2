Of this amount, the central government collected 9.055 billion yuan, and the local government 5.748 billion yuan -- the ratio between them was 61.17 percent to 38.83 percent. The revenue increases, progress of tax collection, and proportion of the central government's revenue are all larger or quicker than the country's average. According to the State General Administration of Taxation, since the new tax system was introduced, Shanghai has not witnessed any worrisome fluctuations or big increase in prices. As a result, people are free from anxiety, and the market is brisk. This has laid a foundation for the increase of industrial and commercial taxes. Tax departments at various levels in Shanghai promptly and effectively trained tax collectors and managers in various ways and tested their knowledge of the new tax system. While compiling reference materials on the new tax system for enterprises, tax organs gave special lectures or explanations on such difficult points as taxes included in the calculated prices; taxes not included in the calculated prices; taxpayers; and those whose tax obligations have yet to be fulfilled. Such training and publicity created favorable conditions for the smooth implementation of the new tax system and increase of revenues. In tax levying and management, Shanghai Municipality made conscientious efforts to have general taxpayers understand the need for the value-added tax and to supply special invoices. The municipality appropriately adjusted the way in which it used to levy and manage taxes. It also strengthened its management of tax returns and invoicing. Since the implementation of the new tax system, more and more enterprises have reported on the invoices they issued. This has effectively guaranteed their payment of taxes. Shanghai Municipality also strengthened its examination of tax payment receipts and its coordination with banks in order to ensure that all tax payments go to the state treasury. At the same time, the municipality also stepped up its work of destroying old tax payment receipts and set strict limits on invoices issued by enterprises. This was aimed at ensuring the correct use of new tax payment receipts and the accurate collection of taxes. Since 1 January this year, Shanghai Municipality's tax departments have taken measures to strengthen their control and screening of invoices and tax payment receipts. All the tax payment receipts issued in the first quarter of the year have been checked, and the accuracy of using and filling in such receipts has also improved. As of the end of April, special invoices issued by 64,700 general taxpayers were checked, accounting for the 72.2 percent of those special invoices which should be checked. Also checked were 5,758,100 special invoices involving the added-value tax, 531,000 of which were questionable, accounting for 9.22 percent of the checked invoices. While implementing the new tax system, Shanghai Municipality has cracked down on those issuing forged invoices. The municipal inspection and auditing group, and district inspection and auditing detachments took joint action in cracking down on the production and selling of forged invoices in several places in the city. Forged invoices were put on display to enable people to recognize them. In coordination with public security and procuratorial departments, the tax office in Zhabei district on 11 March raided Xinkezhan and two other places where illicit selling of forged invoices was rampant, and discovered more than 30 people peddling such invoices. Public security personnel arrested eight of them and confiscated over 1,000 forged invoices of various kinds.
