He made the remark in an interview given to NHK in Hiroshima today. [Begin recording] [Blix] We have sent a letter to the DPRK asking to let us be able to complete [nuclear inspections] as soon as possible. If this is not accepted by the DPRK, then, of course I have to report that to the Security Council. [Unidentified NHK reporter] We would like to hear the deadline. When is the deadline for the procedure? [Blix] That should be before the end of ... around the end of April. [end recording] Following a failure to complete an inspection in North Korea last month, the IAEA brought this case to the UNSC on 22 March. But the UNSC just issued a presidential statement calling for North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections due to China's opposition to hardline policies against North Korea. Director General Blix's remarks indicate his view that, depending on North Korea's attitude, the issue should be brought again to the UNSC later this month. In that case, the UNSC will have to consider more compulsive measures, such as economic sanctions.
