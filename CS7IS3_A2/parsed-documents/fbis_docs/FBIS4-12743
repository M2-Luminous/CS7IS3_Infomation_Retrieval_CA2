In a news conference today, Shahaq said several topics were discussed in this session, including security matters upon which an agreement is now very close. He noted that some issues within the framework of the Security Committee have not yet been resolved, saying: We will resume the negotiations in Cairo next week to continue discussing these issues. Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations with the Palestinians, said agreement was reached with the Palestinian side to postpone some issues until after signing the executive agreement on Gaza and Jericho on the condition that negotiations on these points will be resumed after the signing. On issues that are still under discussion between the two sides, he said issues concerning the Palestinian legal jurisdiction in civil affairs, as well as other matters, have not yet been discussed. He affirmed that agreement on security corridors and water will be reached before signing the accord and that the antiquities question has actually been resolved. As for taxes, he said: We are waiting for an agreement to be reached by the economic committee, currently in session in Paris. Agreement is expected to be reached on fiscal jurisdiction before signing the accord. He explained that there will not be more than five or six issues that will be deferred until an accord is signed; most of them are civil affairs and some may be related to civil affairs that are linked to security aspects. He said that agreement was also reached on the size of the Palestinian police force, the total number of which will be 9,000; 2,000 from inside Gaza and Jericho and 7,000 from abroad. He added that 6,000 of the Palestinian policemen who will come from abroad will enter Gaza and Jericho directly after the signing of the "executive agreement" and the other 1,000 will enter three months after the agreement is signed. As for the security measures inside Gaza and Jericho, he said, we are very close to reaching an agreement on them. He expressed hope that the negotiations will be completed within a few weeks; otherwise, they will encounter difficulties, as has been happening since the start of the talks. Commenting on the Palestinian detainees, Shahaq said the Israeli side explained to the Palestinians everything about the detainees who will be released, to what factions they belong, and when the release will take place. He added: We will not allow the release of detainees from the Hamas movement, because they are against peace and their leaders and representatives in Amman had announced their responsibility for the recent 'Afula incident in northern Israel. He went on: Also, those who have carried out operations after 13 September, the date when the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed, and those responsible for operations in which Israelis were killed will not be released. He noted that this issue will not be discussed further. Concluding his news conference, Shahaq said: The negotiations were hindered in the past not because of us but because of many other reasons and we have to complete the negotiations as quickly as possible.
