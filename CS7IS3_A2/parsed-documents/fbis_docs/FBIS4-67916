FBIS4-67916 "jptnd011___94039" JPRS-TND-94-011 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 21 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA IRAN IAEO Officials on Nonproliferation, Bushehr IAEO Officials on Nonproliferation, Bushehr LD2104114094 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran First Program Network in Persian 0700 GMT 21 Apr 94 LD2104114094 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran First Program Network Persian BFN [Studio interview with Dr. Reza Amrollahi, vice president for atomic energy and director of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, IAEO; Engineer Dr. Mashayekhi, IAEO international affairs adviser; and Dr. Mohammad Reza Ayatollahi, Iranian representative at the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA; by unidentified announcer and citizens in the weekly phone-in program ``In Line With The People, In Step With Officials'' -- live] [Excerpts] [Passage omitted including quotations from Khamene'i and Khomeyni about the futility of nuclear weapons] Announcer: Could you please answer the question which was posed on whether the hostile propaganda of western media has had any negative effect on the course of the activities of the Atomic Energy Organization [AEO] and what steps are being taken to confront all that propaganda? Amrollahi: We are witnessing a psychological war in the world by the news media of certain countries. If you watched CNN a few days ago you would have seen that a CNN correspondent came and asked one of the officials of our country -- I think it was Mr. Kharrazi [Iran's permanent ambassador] in the United Nations. He said: First, you have purchased submarines? Second, You have increased your defense budget. Third, you have nuclear capability. In other words, they have a number of presuppositions. It does not matter what the answers are. They only wish to instill certain ideas in the minds of their listeners. We see this very clearly. At least, I and all my colleagues feel this with all our being that they are not after finding out the truth. They only wish to indoctrinate those who are unfamiliar with our works, those in foreign countries, and wish to tell them that Iran wishes to do this or that. I wish to ask a few questions of those who make such insinuations: Have we not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? Are we not a member of the IAEA? Do we not accept the nuclear treaty of the IAEA [as heard]? Why does the usurping Zionist regime not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? Why does it not accept the IAEA's nuclear treaty? Why do they not ask such questions of the latter? This shows that they have some ulterior motives, and they wish to insinuate certain things in the minds of the people abroad who are not in our country and who are not reached by our mass media. In brief, let me say that such hostile propaganda will have no effect on our work. However, I do not deny that they will influence the minds of the people who have nothing to do with us and who live outside our borders. [passage omitted answering a question about a small number of solar energy reactors which are planned for some remote villages outside the electricity grid]. Announcer: There was a question about the use of nuclear energy in Iran. Amrollahi: See. All our people know more or less that our most important aim is to complete our nuclear reactor which we have, which is incomplete. Eighty percent of its work is completed, and by today's estimate more than $10 billion has been invested in it. In my view, in any country where there is such an investment in a project eighty percent of which has been completed, any sane person would try to complete it so as to generate electricity by it. We have made this huge investment, and the whole world knows that a nuclear reactor only produces electricity. This is what we are after. Our country is short of electricity and the best return on our investment is to complete it and to make use of it. Let me also answer the other question which was asked about who is completing it. Unfortunately, the Germans fell short in this connection. They did not help and did not finish this project. They have kept us waiting for 14 or 15 years. Finally, we signed a contract with Russia. Work has been started for some time and they are finishing it. [passage omitted on history of nuclear energy in Iran]. Announcer: Dr. Amrollahi, when do you think the Bushehr reactor will be completed? Amrollahi: God willing, according to the talks which we have with the Russians, it will be definitely completed in less than four years and will produce energy. Announcer: Concerning [nuclear] disarmament -- although of course we cannot call it disarmament, let us say about nonproliferation -- Dr. Ayatollahi and Dr. Mashayekhi can you please tell us something in this connection? Ayatollahi: [passage omitted on the dangers of nuclear weapons for the environment, the use of atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the nonproliferation treaty; asserting that not only the countries which do not have nuclear weapons should not produce them, but the big powers which also have them should get rid of them]. Concerning this western propaganda and the motivation behind that propaganda, all our nation, every hezbollahi member of the society knows the truth. However, let me refer to just one reason behind all this propaganda. This is my own personal analysis, and I may be able to produce some evidence for what I am saying. After the collapse of the former Soviet Union the American spy agency [CIA] was made bankrupt. This is why you see the CIA director going to the U.S. Senate and beginning threats against the Islamic Republic of Iran. He engages in this propaganda claiming that the Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing a policy for the production of nuclear weapons and that Americans should be vigilant. There he is trying to save himself from bankruptcy, he wants to prevent the closure of his organization, he wishes to safeguard the budget of his organization, and wishes to safeguard his own prestige. At the same time, he wishes to initiate a new propaganda line that the Islamic Republic of Iran poses a threat. Yes, Iran objects to the western democracy which is following a domineering policy in the world in such an absurd way. It questions that system and threatens it with its logical arguments. The whole world knows this. However, in an attempt to cast aspersions on the Islamic Republic of Iran and to distort the truth and achieve their goals at least in the short term, they are engaged in this propaganda. Let me also say that we do not pay any attention to all this propaganda. It will not have the slightest effect upon the decisions of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iran's nuclear industry. We know that their propaganda is flimsy and no one will believe them. The IAEA is the only official international agency which is composed of various nations and the Islamic Republic of Iran is also an active member. That organization expresses its views. We have also announced truthfully and bravely that we are not after such a policy. From the outset we have believed that the policy of [acquiring] nuclear weapons is wrong and we will not pursue a wrong path. If you are suspicious and have some evidence for your suspicion, come and inspect. We have no objection. So far, they have also come. We have invited them. They have come and inspected and have admitted and confessed [that Iran does not have nuclear weapons]. The admission of this official organization as an international authority as regards the nuclear industry is sufficient for us, even though western media engages in all sorts of propaganda. Unidentified citizen: I would like to ask a question about the role played by the country's Atomic Energy Organization in supplying our electricity requirement? I would also like to ask what happened to the Bushehr nuclear power station, and will it boost the power generation when it is completed? Mashayekhi: Bushehr nuclear power station comprises two 1250 megawatt units. It was started by the Germans before the revolution and it was 85 percent complete during the last days of the Shah's regime. Unfortunately it was abandoned by the German side. [passage omitted giving reasons for interruption of the project during the Iran-Iraq war]. Today we are trying to reach an agreement with the Russian Government to complete the project. Of course work has started already and the Russians are studying the project so as to install their own equipment. God willing we will then see completion of the first project during the coming years. We can probably begin the operation of our first nuclear power station in four years time. Announcer: God willing. Is it economical to depend on nuclear energy in Iran? Mashayekhi: The world has answered this question already. You witness that most of the world countries are today striving to expand their nuclear power stations to generate electricity. Fossil fuel pollutes the environment and will run out. The world in the 21st century will have to face the problem of generating its electricity requirement by nuclear power. We are also one of those countries which should make the necessary investment today. [passage omitted]. The Supreme Energy Council has approved that we should supply 20 percent of the country's energy requirements by nuclear power stations. Amrollahi: I wish to conclude the discussion by mentioning something about our proposal for the creation of a nuclear free-zone. The Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing this proposal every year and has been doing so for a number of years. It is appropriate to mention here that the regional countries are siding with us gradually on this issue. The only real saboteur of this proposal is the regime occupying Jerusalem. May God's peace and mercy be upon you all.
