FBIS4-67618 "jptep002__l94021" JPRS-TEP-94-002-L JPRS Epidemiology 1 December 1993 LATIN AMERICA BRAZIL Spread of Meningitis Seen Epidemic in Rio Spread of Meningitis Seen Epidemic in Rio 94WE0144C Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 1 Dec 93 p 19 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94WE0144C Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese CSO [Article by Gloria Santos: "Authorities Acknowledge Meningitis Epidemic"] [Text] Health authorities admitted yesterday that meningococcal meningitis has become epidemic in Rio de Janeiro State, and they are now talking to the Ministry of Health about importing Cuban vaccine for a mass immunization drive during the early months of 1994. According to the experts, Rio de Janeiro is the municipality where the situation is most disturbing, but the state's superintendent of community health, Jorge Mixo, is now studying the need for immunization in other municipalities in the Rio de Janeiro Lowlands, where there is also a high incidence of the disease. The conclusion that an epidemic exists was presented to the Ministry of Health at a meeting the day before yesterday in the afternoon, at which time the state's figures since 1990 were analyzed. This week the state is going to provide an emergency budget of 6 million cruzeiros, without going through the bidding process, to reequip the laboratory at the Sao Sebastiao Hospital in Caju, which is responsible for the tests that classify the disease by type. Next Monday the Municipal Secretariat of Health will provide the ministry with a review of the incidence of the disease this year [1993] and recommend that immunization be extended to adults up to 20 years of age. Mary Baran, the municipality's coordinator of epidemiology, says that although the disease is more prevalent among children, it is necessary to immunize adults so as to "break the chain of infection," since the bacterium is harbored in the throats of from 10 to 15 percent of the population. The two secretariats have not yet decided how many doses must be imported, but the experts already know that the 5 million doses ordered by the Ministry of Health from Cuba (that being the remaining amount in a contract signed in 1990) will only be enough to immunize the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Situation Worse This Year From January through 24 November 1993, 2,209 cases of meningitis and 499 deaths were recorded in Rio de Janeiro State. Of that total, 725 individuals (32.5 percent) had meningococcal meningitis and 148 of those (29.6 percent) died. That situation exceeds the maximum limits as estimated at least four years ago -- the average had been 800 cases since 1990. But according to experts, the situation has been disturbing since 1986, when a significant increase in cases of type B meningococcal meningitis began showing up. In the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, the situation is more serious this year because of the lightning speed with which the disease has been developing, according to Mary Baran, an epidemiologist in the municipal secretariat. "The disease has been developing at lightning speed. Whereas we used to have up to 72 hours in which to treat the patient and prevent aftereffects, people this year have been dying within 24 hours," Mary says. The experts cannot yet explain the reason for that phenomenon. No cases were recorded in the municipality yesterday. Jorge Mixo, state superintendent of community health, acknowledged that the secretariat was having difficulty monitoring the state because the municipal secretariats were not sending in data daily. Jorge also announced that he had sent a circular to the 82 municipalities asking for a situation report on an urgent basis so as to be able to evaluate the need for immunization and the target population and order the doses from the Ministry of Health. The vaccine must be administered in two doses to ensure immunization. Cremerj Private Clinics Charged With Selling Vaccines The Rio de Janeiro Regional Council of Medicine (Cremerj) has begun an investigation into charges that private clinics are selling Haemophilus influenza type B vaccines that have expired and storing the medicine improperly. The investigation will also determine who is responsible for publication in the newspapers last week of an advertisement which, according to council director Abdu Kexfe, is confusing the public regarding the type of meningitis vaccine available in the clinics. Yesterday Cremerj notified clinic owners and sales representatives for the vaccine against the type of meningitis caused by the Haemophilus influenza type B bacterium to make depositions on the 8th. The council is publishing in today's newspapers a notice explaining the types of meningitis and the available vaccines. In surprise inspections conducted by the Noel Nutels Laboratory on Monday, irregularities were found in two clinics. The Urgil immunization clinic in Lagoa was ordered closed, and Climuno in Copacabana will have to prove that it was authorized to import the vaccine and that conditions in the clinic are sterile. At Urgil, vaccines that had expired were found, and the medicine was not being stored properly. Controversial Experiment The Cuban vaccine against type B and type C meningococcal meningitis is the only one in the world with effectiveness levels exceeding 75 percent. Even so, use of the vaccine in Brazil has caused divided opinions among experts in the public health field. It was tested in our country for the first time in 1989, when there was an outbreak of the disease in Sao Paulo and 2 million children were immunized. Studies of the immunizing capability of the medicine were started after that, with the vaccine being tested in seven states: Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina, Parana, Sergipe, Amapa, and Rio de Janeiro. There is disagreement among the institutions that analyzed those studies. Whereas the Brazil-Cuba Commission concluded that the estimated effectiveness was 82 percent for all types of meningococci and 79 percent in the case of type B, other institutions questioned the vaccine's immunizing capability. One member of the commission, physician Eduardo Azeredo Costa, explains that the controversy arose because of the different conditions under which each state used the vaccine.
