(ii) A laboratory shall be considered independent only if it meets the criteria specified in §80.65(f)(2)(iii). (iii) In order to be considered United States-based, the laboratory must be a United States corporation engaged in the business of gasoline sampling and testing, or an individual who is a United States citizen who is engaged in the business of gasoline sampling and testing in the United States.

This report shall include a description of the method used to determine the identity of the refinery at which the subject gasoline was produced, that the subject gasoline was not mixed with gasoline produced at any other refinery, and a description of the gasoline's movement and storage between production at the source refinery and ship loading. (v) The refinery-of-origin sampling and testing required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is in addition to the sampling and testing required at the port-of-entry under §§80.65 (e) and (f). (3) The importer shall meet the sampling and testing requirement, under §80.65(f)(1)(i), whereby an independent laboratory samples and tests each batch of imported gasoline. (4)(i) The results of testing of the batch sample collected at the refinery-of-origin under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, when compared to the results of testing of the batch sample collected at the United States port-of-entry under §80.65(f)(1)(i), must for each parameter be within the range specified for the parameter under §80.65(e)(2)(i); (ii) The volume determination for the batch at the refinery-of-origin under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, when compared to the volume determination for the batch at the United States port-of-entry under §80.65(f), must be within # 1% where such volume determinations are corrected for temperature and density; (iii) The ship identified under paragraph (d)(2) of this section must be the same ship that is used to transport the gasoline on arrival at the United States port-of-entry; and (iv) The refinery-of-origin, volume, shipment date, and ship name under paragraph (d)(2) of this section must be confirmed by the attest engagement under paragraph (f) of this section. (e) Attest requirements. (1) The attest engagement required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be conducted by a United States-based CPA in accordance with the procedures specified in §§80.126 and 80.127. (2) The CPA shall: (i) Obtain a gasoline inventory reconciliation analysis for the current year from the refinery which includes reformulated gasoline, RBOB, conventional gasoline, and other non-finished gasoline petroleum products, whether imported into the United States or not; (ii) Test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations contained in the analysis; and (iii) Agree the beginning and ending inventories to the refinery's perpetual inventory records. (3) The CPA shall: (i) Obtain a separate listing of all tenders during the current year of reformulated gasoline produced at the refinery for use in the United States, such listing to include the date the tender was transported from the refinery, the method of transportation of the tender from the refinery to the point of ship loading, the identification of any storage of the gasoline prior to the point of ship loading, and the name and country of registration of the ship used for transporting the gasoline from the refinery to the United States; (ii) Test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations contained in the listings; (iii) Agree the listing's tender volumes to the gasoline inventory reconciliation in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and (iv) Confirm that the gasoline comprising the tender was not mixed with gasoline produced at any other refinery between its production and ship loading. (4)(i) The CPA shall prepare a report on the attest engagement summarizing the procedures performed and the findings in accordance with the §80.125(b), and shall include in the report, for each tender of reformulated gasoline, the volume, date shipped, and ship name and country of registration. (ii) The CPA report for each calendar year shall be submitted to EPA not later than May 31 of the following year. (5) In order to be considered a United States-based CPA, a CPA firm must be a United States corporation, or an individual CPA must be a United States citizen who is a licensed CPA in the United States.
