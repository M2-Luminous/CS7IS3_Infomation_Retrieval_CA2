It is an important event that deserves our fullest attention. It is important because it has a bearing on our country's future. It is important because, henceforth, it will determine our multilateral and bilateral relations with our foreign partners to a certain extent. [passage omitted] The international finance community's attitude clearly shows the confidence it places in our country and its acknowledgement of your efforts. I solemnly wish to thank the IMF on your behalf. My dear compatriots I wish to salute the courage you have shown in accepting and enduring the sacrifices imposed on you. You have shown a high sense of responsibility in difficult circumstances. As you can see today, those sacrifices were not in vain. We are therefore on the right path but we should not relent in our efforts. I expect the administration to further mobilize its efforts to implement the reforms which still seem necessary. [passage omitted] If we keep inflation -- which was inevitable following the CFA franc devaluation -- at a reasonable level, there is a good chance that we will get out of the crisis and that our future will be promising. I must point out that no matter how much aid we receive from our friends and foreign partners, the success of our recovery program will depend mainly on ourselves. Let us look around us. All countries -- big or small, rich or poor -- are facing problems and are quite naturally giving priority to their own needs. The time-honored development strategies that have been used since independence are out of date. We must henceforth concentrate more than ever on the task of national reconstruction, relying first on our own strengths. There is therefore no denying that Cameroon cannot be tempted by external adventurism. Although there is no question of giving up our sovereignty over the least portion of our territory, our attitude remains that of moderation and conciliation. Can Africa, which is already torn by several conflicts, really accommodate new disputes between sister countries? Our continent needs peace in order to achieve development and that also holds for Cameroon. We will do everything in our power to ensure that the gains achieved in all sectors over the past years will not be jeopardized. Of course, a lot more remains to be done to achieve our goals, but we are about to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Let us put our energies together. Let us be imaginative and work harder. By so doing, I am sure we will overcome our current difficulties and strengthen our people's hope for a better future. Long live Cameroon.
