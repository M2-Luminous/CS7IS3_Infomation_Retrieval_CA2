FR940830-0-00062 FR940830-0-00013 Response: HUD would like to clarify by explicitly adding the example to the regulation that the establishment of a preventive maintenance system or improvement of an existing system is already an eligible management improvement. The Department strongly encourages HAs to establish a preventive maintenance system or improve an existing system to assure that the modernization-funded physical improvements are sustained. A preventive maintenance system must provide for regular inspections of building structures, systems and units and determine the applicability of work eligible for operating funds (routine maintenance) and work eligible for CGP funding (non-routine maintenance). Comment: Two commenters opposed the increase to 20% because of their belief that the majority of modernization funds should go to property improvement. They asserted that the CGP was becoming another HUD social program and stated there were wastes in the area of management improvements. Some commenters requested that the Department reconsider and give the proposed incentive to all standard and high performing HAs. It was also recommended that subparagraph (f)(1)(iii) should clarify that there is an exception to the 20% threshold by a cross-reference to (m)(1). Clarification was requested whether a HA must be an over-all high performer, mod-high performer, both or either. Response: In response to the comments, HUD has decided to increase the cap on management improvements from 10% to 20% for all HAs and to completely remove the cap for PHAs designated as both over-all high performers and mod-high performers under the PHMAP. HUD does not agree that increasing the allowable management improvement limit moves the CGP towards becoming another ``HUD social program''. Many management improvements are geared towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of a HA's operations and are necessary to sustain the physical improvements. It should be noted that the direct delivery of social services is an ineligible CGP expenditure. Experience has shown that physical improvements without appropriate management actions often are not sustained, thereby wasting federal dollars. HUD will continue to strongly suggest that HAs use management improvement funds for resident training and has retained this suggestion in ยง968.310(m)(1). Comment: One IHA commented that there is no equality as to how ACA reviews are conducted at the HUD level since some reviews are not conducted on site, leading to determinations which may not be accurate. Two IHAs suggested that the criteria for IHA high performers should be stringent enough that only the best managed IHAs be classified as high performers, and that all areas of IHA management and operations should be evaluated. They suggested the following criteria: (a) The IHA must have a final ACA score of 90% or above for two consecutive years, including the FFY that funds are being requested, and (b) the IHA must be current on all implementation schedules for action CGP and CIAP grants. Two commenters suggested that HUD consult with interested parties to set guidelines for high performers. Response: HUD does not agree with the suggestions that ACA scores be used to determine whether an IHA qualifies as a high performer. The ACA is to be used to highlight areas where training or technical assistance may be needed, identify IHAs with potential problems, and determine functional areas where reviews are needed. HUD has decided to delay implementation of the incentive for high performing IHAs in order to maximize the opportunity for consultation with interested parties. HUD will invite public comment on the criteria to be used to determine high performers when the revised Indian Housing regulations at 24 CFR part 905 are published as a proposed rule. Administrative Costs Comment: HUD limited HAs to no more than 7% of their annual grant for administrative costs in account 1410, excluding any costs related to in-house lead-based paint or asbestos testing, in-house A/E work, or other special administrative costs required by State, Tribal or local law, unless specifically approved by HUD. An additional 2% of the annual grant may be spent on costs related to travelling to the HA's developments for CGP-related business, as specifically approved by HUD. Eighteen comments were received on this provision. Most of the comments urged HUD to raise the cap to 10%. Most found the current 7% to be insufficient to fully administer the modernization program. For example, one commenter indicated that in a high cost area, the expenses for a construction manager and clerk of the works, with benefits, exceed the 7% cap. HUD was advised that even HAs which operate in a limited geographical area often require overnight travel and pay a premium for administration because of the need to operate over several telephone area codes. HAs which have highly active, very organized Resident Advisory Councils and Resident Management Corporations have higher administrative costs because of increased level of outreach, planning, consultations and discussions. Similarly, HAs that operate joint ventures with residents also experience increase administrative costs. Others noted that the present 7% cap does not reflect the spiraling increase in health benefits, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance premiums for administrative workers, increase in complexity and resulting staff time to comply with HUD's regulations, and increase in expenses associated with transitioning from the CIAP model to CGP. Commenters recommended that the word ``in-house'' be deleted, and that any costs related to lead-based paint or asbestos testing be excluded from the 7% total. Another commenter emphasized the administrative burden that lead-based paint and asbestos abatement imposes on HAs. Nearly every rehabilitation and remodeling activity in public housing developments now requires the work of environmental consultants for lead-based paint and/or asbestos testing and abatement. The oversight and administration of these contracts is very time- and resource-intensive. Some commenters requested examples of areas where the Field Offices could approve higher limits. HUD was asked to clarify the issue of administration of force-account labor. It was requested that the regulation state that administrative costs associated with force account labor used in relationship to resident training programs are eligible management improvement costs. NAIHC noted that IHAs with force account labor incur additional administrative costs because they need more warehouse space to house their materials, more administrative staff to process the paperwork, and more financial management staff to assure records are up-to-date. In addition, development staff spends more time overseeing the entire program. They recommended that the administrative cost limit be set at 10%. One commenter suggested that like management improvements, standard and high performing HAs be allowed to exceed the 7% level without prior HUD approval. Retaining the additional 2% for CGP travel-related expenses received approval, but it was recommended that it should not be limited to commercial vendors because some legitimate overnight travel may be conducted by private or PHA-owned automobiles. Some commenters suggested that the additional 2% should include some factor related to miles traveled in relationship to density of developments.
