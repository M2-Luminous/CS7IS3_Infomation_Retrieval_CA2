This has been revealed by the February poll of the Mannheim research group dealing with elections. It was carried out among 2,000 citizens in the east and west for the political barometer of the ZDF. A total of 82 percent of Germans in the old and 76 percent in the new laender believe that wage increases should be renounced at present if jobs can be saved in this way; 13 percent of west Germans and 20 percent of east Germans favored wage increases irrespective of the impact on the labor market. Against Strikes Against this backdrop, little support for strikes in the metal working industry is noticeable in the west (in the east, the question was not asked for reasons of time): Only 25 percent would approve of efforts by the trade unions to achieve their demands through strikes; 70 percent opposse it. This clear rejection is noticeable among supporters of all parties. At 42 percent, the largest degree of approval of strikes has been observed among Green voters. The general political atmosphere has changed in different ways in eastern and western Germany in February. Above all, it is remarkable that the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] has for the first time since the 1990 Bundestag elections dropped below the 5-percent mark in both eastern and western Germany. The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] is clearly winning support in western Germany but losing in eastern Germany. Nationwide, it would receive 35 percent (4 percent more than in January). For the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the mood in the east and west has deteriorated. It has lost 2 percent and stands now at 42 percent. The FDP can rely on 4 percent (- 1 percent). Alliance 90/The Greens are losing slightly in the west and clearly winning in the east. At present, they can rely on 11 percent support (+ 1 percent). All the other parties together received 9 percent (- 1 percent), including the Republikaner at an unchanged 2 percent and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] at 4 percent, as in January. These figures represent the current political mood in Germany. If a new Bundestag were elected at this point, the German citizens would attach more significance to long-term fundamental political convictions. Without taking into consideration the current mood, the question "For which party would you vote if the Bundestag elections were held next Sunday," revealed the following picture: CDU/CSU 37 percent (+ 1 percent), SPD 39 percent (no change), FDP 6 percent (no change), Alliance 90/The Greens 9 percent (- 1 percent), and other parties 9 percent (no change), including the Republikaner at 4 and the PDS at 3 percent. Thus, at 48 percent, a coalition between the SPD and the Greens would enjoy a parliamentary majority in February. Good Rating for Bluem Satisfaction with the work of the government further increased in eastern and western Germany -- measured on the basis of a scale reaching from + 5 (very satisfied) to - 5 (very dissatisfied): Figures improved from - 1.2 in December to - 1.0 in January and to - 0.9 at present. The achievements of the SPD as opposition in Bonn, however, showed a less favorable trend -- 0.2 in December 1993, 0.1 in January, and 0.0 in February. Not only the government but the chancellor personally are being assessed better than four weeks ago. Nationwide, Helmut Kohl received a rating of - 0.3 following - 0.4 in January. Norbert Bluem also improved his rating -- from 0.5 to 0.6. The overall assessment of Theo Waigel has clearly deteriorated -- from - 0.4 to - 0.7, and that of Wolfgang Schaeuble from 1.0 to 0.7. The rating for Rita Suessmuth has slightly deteriorated from 1.0 to 0.9. Little Sympathy for Rau Klaus Kinkel received 0.4 percent (0.5 percent in January). Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whom the population still considers one of the most important German politicians, was the most popular figure in eastern and western Germany in February: He scored 2.5 percent (after 2.6 in January). Rudolf Scharping's popularity has again declined slightly (December 1.3 percent, January 1.1 percent, February 1.0 percent). Johannes Rau suffered a severe setback: His rating declined from 1.9 to 1.4. The approval rating for Regine Hildebrandt, the Social Democrat minister from Brandenburg, who is only known to 57 percent of the population, deteriorated slightly from 1.7 in January to 1.6 in February. Who should be chancellor of Germany? The share of those who would like to leave everything unchanged has again increased in February. In December, 31 percent wanted Helmut Kohl to head the government, in January 34 percent, and in February 36 percent. However, the majority still voted in favor of his challenger Rudolf Scharping. The number of those who do not know has further decreased from 18 percent in December to 15 percent in January and 13 percent in February. Support for Scharping is clearly greater in the east than in the west. For Kohl, it is the other way round. When asked about the desired president, the population prefers Johannes Rau after the official nomination of Roman Herzog as the candidate of the CDU/CSU: A total of 25 percent would like him to succeed Richard von Weizsaecker; 12 percent support Roman Herzog and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and 5 percent Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. Every third German is still undecided on this issue. The general economic situation in eastern Germany was assessed slightly worse in February than in January: A total of 54 percent (52 percent in January) consider the situation bad; 43 percent believe that it is partly good and partly bad, and 3 percent think that it is good. As far as competence for a solution to the economic problems in eastern Germany is concerned, an SPD-led government is considered clearly more capable of achieving that than the present coalition. A total of 35 percent of east Germans consider the Social Democrats more capable of overcoming the crisis; 21 percent trust in the present government, and 11 percent assess both as the same. Yet nearly a third (32 percent) do not think anything of this alternative. Bad Marks for the European Union A far-reaching adaptation of living conditions in the east to the level of the western laender has so far not been achieved in the view of the population (91 percent). The assessment is slightly more optimistic in the old laender. The west Germans are also more confident about the question of when the adaptation will largely be completed; 31 percent believe that a maximum of five years will be required, 47 percent think that this process will last five to 10 years, and 16 percent believe that it will take even longer. In eastern Germany, every fifth citizen expects the adaptation to be completed in five years' time; 56 percent consider a period of five to 10 years necessary, and 23 percent consider more than 10 years necessary. Four months before the next European elections, a negative assessment of the European Union prevails: Only 15 percent believe that membership in the European Union brings more advantages than disadvantages for the German population; 45 percent think that advantages and disadvantages outweigh each other, but 35 percent see more disadvantages. In the east, the assessment is even more unfavorable than in the west. Moreover, most Germans (72 percent in the west and 73 percent in the east) feel that they are not sufficiently informed about the European Union. In view of the skeptical assessment of the European Union, the majority of Germans favor settling problems by individual states. A total of 73 percent believe that, above all, the governments of the individual countries should adopt measures to curb unemployment. Those polled expressed similar preferences concerning economic development: A total of 61 percent want the government to deal with this issue. As far as the fight against crime is concerned, 55 percent favor initiatives by their own government. Only in the sphere of foreign and security policy does a majority want a European-Union-wide solution.
