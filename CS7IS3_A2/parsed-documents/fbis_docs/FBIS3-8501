What are your ideas regarding cooperation with your coalition partner, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]?" [HZDS weekly] EXTRA SLOVENSKO No. 9 asked Jan Slota, the new SNS chairman. [Slota] There exists a treaty regarding this issue, signed by the former SNS chairman. No one from our party has cast doubt on this treaty thus far so we continue to act in its intentions. This is not to say, however, that we are "subordinating ourselves" to the HZDS or that we represent some platform within the framework of that movement. For example, we have fundamental reservations about Defense Minister Andrejcak. We support the HZDS also with regard to the referendum. I am convinced that a minimum of 12 to 14 percent of nationally aware Slovak "diehards" live in Slovakia. These people must be persuaded that we are not hopping [from one extreme to another] but that we stick to our line and pursue our target. [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] You have proclaimed the return to national principles. Could you explained that in greater detail? [Slota] We proceed from the priorities of the SNS, which are, first and foremost, securing the independence and defense capability of the Slovak Republic at any price. This is the Army's assignment. Unfortunately, many of the highest positions in the Army are held by officers of Czech or Hungarian nationality. Apart from that, the soldiers are poorly trained. Another priority is education, a sphere in which the assertion of the national principle ranks last. After all, it is immoral when citizens of the state-forming nation are being assimilated on the sovereign territory of the Slovak Republic! And, at long last, there is culture. It is abnormal when we support from the state budget the publication of press in Hungarian, which is incessantly spitting on this Republic. Let us wake up, Slovaks! [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Will you contest the elections independently or together with the HZDS or, possibly, with the Christian Social Union? [Slota] This can only be decided by an SNS congress. I can only express my personal opinion. It is 100 percent sure that we will obtain substantially more votes than in the last elections. It goes without saying that we are interested in nationally oriented forces--in particular, gaining seats in parliament--lest we have a Hungarian-Bolshevik parliament. That would mean our end as a national republic. [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] After your election as SNS chairman, you declared that Zhirinovskiy was an interesting personality and that time would show what was going on in Russia. The world is dissociating itself from him, however.... [Slota] Why should it dissociate itself? Zhirinovskiy is a deputy to the Russian parliament and 40 million Russians voted for his party! One can only have reservations about some of his statements. When someone speaks four languages, including Turkish, he cannot be a madman. [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Would you be able to invite him to Slovakia? [Slota] I would not want to comment on that. [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] What are your ideas regarding cooperation with Prime Minister Meciar? Do you think you will come to an agreement? [Slota] I think that, essentially, there exists no reason for us not to talk constructively. This does not mean, however, that somebody will be there just to fill the numbers.... There is much common ground between us, where our thinking is identical.
