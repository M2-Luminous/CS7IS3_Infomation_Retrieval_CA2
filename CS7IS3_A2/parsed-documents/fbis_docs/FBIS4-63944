As DIENA was informed by Maris Krumins, chief of the department for registration of mass information media and social organizations in the Ministry of Justice, this is not a large number, in comparison with the total number of registered organizations. Thus far, the Ministry has registered 763 social organizations, 134 foundations, 306 sports organizations, and 35 political organizations. Registration was denied on 19 July 1993 to the Latvian Communist Union [LKS] headed by Igor Lopatin, on the grounds that activities of a communist party in the Latvian Republic are forbidden. On 9 August 1993, registration was also denied to the Latvian Union for Protection of Veterans [LVTAS], whose leader is Alberts Lebedevs. This organization was established, after the activity of the Council of War and Labor Veterans, which took an active part in the August coup, was forbidden on 10 September 1991. The LVTAS statutes state that it is a social organization uniting, on a voluntary basis, war veterans, retired and reserve officers, and Russian Army military personnel as well as civil staff of the military facilities, residing permanently in Latvia, and their family members. This organization also was a collective member of the Baltic Region Officers Union, which in turn is a member of an Russian officers association forbidden in Russia. On 12 August 1993 the veteran organization applied to the court with a complaint against the Ministry of Justice, for refusing it registration. Until now, two court sessions have been held, and the third is due in late May. At their third annual conference on 19 March of the current year, the veterans mentioned as their main goal the registration of their organization. The organization is still active and comprises 3,300 members, as DIENA learned at the conference. The Ministry of Justice has also declined to register the recently established "League of the Apatrids [people without homeland]" [LAL]. The Minister of Justice Egils Levits states in the refusal that inhabitants who are not Latvian citizens cannot carry out political activities in the Latvian Republic. Nonetheless, LAL is setting as its goal the stimulation of the activities of the noncitizens in Latvia. In their appeal, they say that the goal of LAL is to integrate the noncitizens in Latvia and to serve as their representative. At the meeting on 9 May, LAL disseminated a poll with the names of the candidates for the representative organ of the League. Besides the above mentioned organizations, the Ministry of Justice refused to register a similar veteran organization in Liepaja, the 11th regiment of dragoons organized by lieutenant Mihail Ustinov, and the club for breeding "Gladiator" guard dogs. Also the organizations bearing the same name as those who already have been registered have been refused registration -- the second Liberal Party, and the second Latvian National Independent Movement.
