Muslim, Christian Clerics Call For National Unity A 1,500-word report on page two by Ibrahim Nasr and Mustaf Yasin notes that mainstream Muslim and Christian clerics have issued a call for national unity. According to the report, a seminar on religious thinking and citizenship was held in the Anglican Church in Heliopolis attended by Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub, Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd, a former information minister and an "Islamic thinker," and Reverend Samu'il Habib, head of the Anglican community. Minister Mahjub is cited saying: "Egypt has never known fanaticism or differentiated among its people on religious grounds." Abu-al-Majd notes: "Egypt is at a crossroads, the same one facing the Arab and Islamic worlds." He elaborates on the vulnerability of the Egyptians, Arabs, Muslims, and Third World people following the collapse of the old world order and the rise of the "new international order" and recommends a return to religious values to achieve stability and strengthen the nation. Rev. Habib offers 10,000 seedlings to "be planted around the al-Azhar mosque in affirmation of the unity of the people of Egypt and the cohesion of the nation's strands." He makes other charitable offers but is cited no further on any political or religious affair. Writer Praises Muslim-Christian Seminar A 600-word "Ramadan is Blessed" column by Majid Salim on page 10 hails the seminar of Muslim and Christian clerics and their call for national unity and denounces those who want Islam or religion to play a marginal role in society. Salim opens his columns with these words: "Divide religions and rule. This is the slogan raised by the heirs of communism and the negators of religion, those who want to drive religion into the sidelines and then cut it off completely on the pretext that it is merely a link between man and God and has nothing to do with relations among members of society." Salim then argues that the solidarity shown by Muslim and Christian clerics proves those "negators of religion" mistaken. Seminar Emphasizes Religious Education 'AQIDATI carries extensive reportage on its own "convoys" or religious seminars. A 5,000-word report by Mamduh al-'Ashri, Musa Hal, Nazih Fudah, and Mahmud Fudah across pages four and five records the proceedings of a seminar held at the Special Teachers College in Minyat al-Nasr. Most of the discussion is religious, although Chief Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf makes a reference to a particular threat to the country's future. He says: "I am confident that the hostile values [al-qiyam al-mu'adiyah] that do not want Islam to prosper or Egypt to stand on its feet know that Egypt's youths are the basis of its future, so they attempt to deal a fatal blow to those youths through drugs, sex, and extremism." He advises religious education as a way to educate the youth and revive the country's fortunes. Forces of "Modern Islamic Trend" Outlined Islamic writer Muhammad 'Imarah dedicates his 900-word "Islamic Views" column on page seven to a discussion of "The Forces of the Modern Islamic Trend." He notes: "In the year 1368 of the hegira, 1948, the Muslim Brotherhood group in Egypt entered its first, minor, crisis. In 1954, it entered its second, major, crisis." 'Imarah does not elaborate on the difference between the two crises, but he states that the crisis (not specified) "replaced conventional modes of thinking -- particularly among the youths -- with the mentality of tension. Among the ranks of those who lived through it, the crisis (not specified) created claws to protect the Islamic body. The feelings of anger, rejection, and protest found voice in the publication of "Milestone on the Road" by martyr Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966). This was followed by the emergence of factions shunning society and seeking to change it through violent means. These factions were united in judging Islamic societies, regimes, and governments as being atheist and pre-Islamic." 'Imarah adds that the trend for "rejection and anger and protest" spawned three strands: The first strand, which 'Imarah dubs "the claws," is composed of those who believe in violence and jihad. Another strand, which 'Imarah dubs "the brain," comprises those who call for reviving the Islamic tradition. This second or "traditionalist" strand began with Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838-1897) and focused on intellectual propagation. A third strand, which is expressed in general popular anger, is what 'Imarah calls "the body." 'Imarah provides no further insight into the positions and tactics or future strategy and prospects of these strands and gives no examples of the main representatives of the three strands on today's Egyptian and Muslim scenes. India's Treatment of Muslims in Kashmir Denounced Writer 'Adil Dayf dedicates a 300-word column on page 20 to denouncing the Indian Government for its harsh treatment of the Muslims in Kashmir. Muslims in Germany in Need of More Mosques, Schools The only interview in this issue is with a German Muslim freelance journalist, Muhammad Haytham 'Ayyash. In the 2,000-word interview on page 20, 'Ayyash notes that there are 4.5 million Muslims, mostly from the Turkish community, living in Germany who can do with more mosques and schools.
