Answering a question on the issue, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that this adverse behavior by Greece, which came at a time when the realities behind the PKK terrorist organization's terrorism is better understood and banned in Europe, throws light on Greece's mentality as it concerns Turkey. Ataman said: It is obvious that Greece never gained and never will gain anything from an approach that treats Turkey's enemy as its friend. Opening a terrorist bureau in Athens is against Greece's agreement regarding fighting terrorism as stipulated by international provisions. It is extremely disconcerting that Greece, which has itself been target of various terrorist organizations, is backing another terrorist organization. Ataman noted: The Greek ambassador was called to our ministry in view of the developments in Athens. We described the incident as a hostile act, conveyed our reaction, and submitted a request that Greece abide by international requirements.
