It is commonly said that their efficiency is low and they lack vitality. There are two kinds of sides. The majority hopes that deeper reform will make enterprises owned by the whole people develop prosperously because they recognize that such enterprises are the backbone of socialism. It goes without saying that, without this backbone--the mansion of socialist modernization, a small room or even a tent could not be raised. However, in society there also is a minority of people, some of whom have been affected by public opinion, others who stack up bills (including foreign currency) to put in banks or safety deposit boxes for future private development. Still others originally had an antagonistic attitude towards socialism, thus they do their utmost to slander ownership by the whole people. These people either thoroughly wreck ownership by the whole people or else they swallowed sleeping pills and cannot be awakened. On 15 December 93, the "Wide Angle," a special 50th edition of JINGJI RIBAO, printed an article entitled "Ownership by All = Ownership by None." Even without reading the contents, the title tells the author's intent. In relating the reasoning as to why "ownership by all = ownership by none," use is made of one of Hegel's phrases, "absolute brightness equals absolute darkness." This proves the author's partiality towards Hegel's "absolutist concept," but unfortunately, although Hegel was a master dialectician, he was ultimately an idealist. His philosophy is immersed with an absolute idealist system. That author's "ownership by all = ownership by none" namely is that absolute ownership is equal to absolute non-owner ship. However, through motion changes, the internal contradiction in Hegel's "absolutist concept" naturally will turn to face this elevated idealist principle applied mechanistically. Marxists will not approve of Hegel's "absolutist concept." The author's mechanistic use also is an arrow shot at nothing. Moreover, Hegel's philosophy and China's present economic system are totally unrelated. Slapping the two together does not illustrate the author's erudition. The author's article in JINGJI RIBAO naturally is not a simple attempt to express himself as a follower of Hegel but one to mix ideologies, ultimately getting rid of the economy owned by the whole people so as to be able to attain his goal of ownership by noone. However, unfortunately, the author just talks nonsense and has not even grasped the connotation of ownership by the whole people. After the entire country was liberated, we did not accept the Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital or imperialist, feudalist property, turning it into ownership by the whole people. Via three great socialist transformations, the majority of private capital-run enterprises became joint public and private operations and then were owned by the whole people. These economies owned by the whole people are the state's most important sources of finance. Their proportions of total financial income were, 1950, 33.4 percent; 1952, up to 58.1 percent; 1953-1957, the First Five-Year Plan, approached 70 percent; during the "Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Five-Year Plans," more than 85 percent; and from 1981-1985, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, they fell to around 78.2 percent (above figures from DANGDAI ZHONGGUO CAIZHENG [CONTEMPORARY CHINESE FINANCE], Volume 2). The several trillion yuan turned over by enterprises or units in the ownership by the whole people system were not actually divied up to all the masses but all were used for economic construction, social and cultural education, national defense, administrative controls, and so on. Even primary school students all know that China's economy, culture, education, science and technology and military affairs, not to mention socialist construction, could not have developed without them and might have thoroughly collapsed. At that time, China really was about to become a society "where all had nothing"; China could only have become a land of foreigners. Therefore, we offer advice to Hegel's follower: It is better to begin with common sense. Taking a famous person's idealist few words to cheat ourselves and others is useless. The author said, "What is the result of everyone having rights to state property? No one is truly responsible." Where does such talk come from? An enterprise's party committee secretary or chief must be responsible for state property, for the workers of his own plant, and be responsible to the state and the law. There may be some party committee secretaries or chiefs who have lost their positions and caused losses to state property, but this is not equivalent to no one being responsible for state property in all enterprises. According to the author's view, it will not do for "everyone to have authority." It will only be fine if state property is given to individuals in private ownership. Therefore, the view taken by this author actually is a kind of privatization theory which existed as early as several years ago. To clarify a point, big mistakes were made in our past economic work. Regarding financial expense allocation, there were some errors or shortcomings but they were of no direct relationship to implementing a system of ownership by the whole people. Steadfast opposition to implementing and protecting a system of ownership by the whole people essentially is opposition to implementing and protecting socialism. At a deeper level, it also is opposition to our regime which we seized from reactionary rulers in China to destroy imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, bullying and oppressing the people's power and their property. The road which such opposition could take is exceedingly clear.
