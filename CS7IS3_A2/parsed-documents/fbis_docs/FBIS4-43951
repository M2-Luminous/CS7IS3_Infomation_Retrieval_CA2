Quoted in an article by Mats Knutson in SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 3 June, Peter Esaiasson of the Central Statistical Bureau points out that no party in history has ever overcome such a deficit. His colleague Soren Holmberg believes, however, that the lead might be an advantage for the government, enabling it to campaign as the de facto opposition, "something that is always easier in a campaign." He believes that the Social Democrats would also have an easier time mobilizing their own supporters if they had a slightly smaller lead. Holmberg claims that the government's reelection chances will be better if the Christian Democrats clear the hurdle needed for parliamentary representation but the Left Party and the Green Party do not; all are hovering around the 4-percent cutoff. "Then the margins between the government [Moderates, Liberals, Center, and Christian Democrats] and the Social Democrats will be only a few percentage points."
