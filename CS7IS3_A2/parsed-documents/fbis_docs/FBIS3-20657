The new objectives for these two steps were recently stated by the Northeast Electric Power Group's director general Huang Jinkai [7806 6855 0418] during a meeting with reporters. The Northeast China Electric Power Group will build 10 power plants distributed through the Heilongjiang coal-fired power base, the Eastern Nei Monggol coal-fired power base, and the railroad center and port power bases in Liaoning and Jilin, giving these three areas newly installed capacities of 12 million, 36 million, and 17 million kW, respectively. In addition, it will use the water resources of the region to build large and medium-size hydroelectric stations, including the Songjiang River cascade and the Lianhua power plant, and will carry on vigorous, safe development of the hydropower resources of the main channel of the Heilongjiang River, which forms the Sino-Russian border. This extraordinary scale of electric power construction will also include nuclear power plants with capacities of 10 and 8 million kW and a pumped-storage power plant. In addition, extensive refitting of existing high-coal-consumption older generator sets will be carried out, and as an adjunct to electric power construction, a 500-kV power grid covering the entire region will be built. Huang Jinkai stated that in order to carry out the above conceptions, the Northeast China Electric Power Group will follow the general principles of "a world orientation, extensive cooperation, mutual benefit, and joint development," and will engage in various types of economic and technical cooperation and exchange with domestic and foreign friends in an extensive range of activities in order to expand the influx of funds, technology, equipment, and management experience into China and to strengthen its electric power capabilities. The Northeast China Electric Power Group, an electric power consortium, has a fixed capital of 26.7 billion yuan; its subordinate organizations include the Jilin Province Electric Power Corporation, the Heilongjiang Province Electric Power Corporation, 48 generating plants and 33 power delivery companies. At the end of 1992, the total installed power generating capacity in the Northeast China power grid, which the group operates, was 25 million kW. North China Electric Power Corporation By the year 2000, it is expected that the North China region will need an output of between 251 and 278 billion kWh of electricity each year, which presupposes an installed generating capacity of between 45 and 50 million kW. To meet this need, the North China Electric Power Group has decided to add to its existing 25 million kW of capacity an additional 17 fossil-fired plants with a combined capacity of 35.5 million kW, several hydroelectric plants with a combined capacity of up to 1.08 million kW, and a pumped-storage power plant with a generating capacity of 1.4 million kW. This grand program was revealed at a recent meeting by the North China Electric Power Group's director general Jiao Yian [3542 2011 1344]. In the near term the North China Electric Power Group plans to carry out construction projects representing a total of more than 600,000 kW of capacity, including: stage 2 of the Shalingzi power plant, stage 2 of the Ji Xian power plant, the Dou He No 2 power plant, and the Handan power plant in Hebei; stage 2 of the Datong No 2 power plant in Shanxi; and the Daqi and Daihai power plants in Nei Monggol. Jiao Yian stated that North China's electric power industry still falls somewhat short of the world state of the art in its technical and management standards and that in order to implement its grand development objectives, it will have to engage in extensive mutually beneficial economic and technical cooperation with many organizations in China and abroad. As a consequence, the North China Electric Power Group will enthusiastically welcome domestic and foreign friends who wish to build power plants in the North China region on a single-proprietorship basis or to initiate power industry development with sharing of benefits on a joint-capital or cooperative basis or by providing loans; the group will also engage in cooperation and exchange in the technical sphere and in various types of technological and labor cooperation on various projects abroad. The North China Electric Power Group is one of the five large electric power groups that were created in China at the beginning of 1993. It is a large enterprise consortium that unites electric power production, design, construction, adjustment and testing, equipment manufacture and repair, research, and education and training organizations, along with diversified organizations. It has 250,000 employees, 63 power plants, 4 site surveying and design institutes, 19 electric power construction companies, 5 electric power research organizations, 11 electric power equipment manufacturing or repair enterprises, and 12 schools of various types. The North China Power Grid, which it operates, supplies electric power to Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Nei Monggol, covering a total area of 1.47 million square kilometers and serving 120 million persons. Central China Power Corporation In the wake of the world-renowned Three Gorges project, during the next seven years the Central China power system will also build close to 10 hydroelectric power stations and more than 30 other generating plants in Hubei, Henan, Hunan and Jiangxi, so that by the end of the century the system's installed capacity will have doubled to about 50 million kW. This prospect was revealed by Liu Jinlong [0491 6855 7893], director general of the Central China Electric Power Group, during a recent interview in Beijing. The Central China Electric Power Group, a large consortium composed of more than 180 power generation, power delivery, construction, equipment manufacture and repair, design, research, and educational organizations in Hubei, Henan, Hunan and Jiangxi, operates the Central China electric power grid, which supplies electric power to these four provinces; its coverage is 730,000 square kilometers. By the end of 1992, the system's total installed capacity was 24 million kW, and the annual output of electricity reached 113.5 million kWh. In order to achieve these goals by the year 2000, Liu Jinlong stated that the Central China Electric Power Group will warmly welcome friends in all fields, both from China and from abroad, who wish to invest in the Central China region or to engage in technical and economic cooperation. In addition, a nuclear power plant program for the region covering the period through 2020 was announced at a recent Central China power system long-range planning meeting. According to the development program for the entire Central China power system, nuclear power development will begin in Jiangxi before the year 2000 and a 1.2-million-kW nuclear power plant will be built by 2010. Subsequently, two 3-million-kW nuclear power plants will be built in Jiangxi and Hunan by 2020. The installed nuclear power generating capacity in the Central China system will then be 7.2 million kW; but this figure will still represent less than 5 percent of the total generating capacity in the grid. The Central China power system, one of China's major power systems, covers the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and Jiangxi, with a total area of 730 million square kilometers. Its current generating capacity is 25.45 million kW and its annual output of electricity is 116.1 billion kWh.
