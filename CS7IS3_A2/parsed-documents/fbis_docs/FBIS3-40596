Its Soviet-made MIG planes are involved in so many accidents that the Indian pilots call them flying coffins. In contrast, the standards and safety of Pakistan's Air Force have long been regarded as one of the world's most efficient. During the last few years, the number of accidents in the Pakistan Air Force has also increased (The latest accident occurred a few days ago, when a Chinese-made airplane fell in a canal). When the series of accidents in our Air Force increased, I decided to do some reading as a part of my research and also discussed the issue with some experts. Why are accidents in the Pakistani Air Force increasing? This is an entirely separate issue, and suffice to say that during my investigation, I had the opportunity to read a voluminous book written on the Pakistani Air Force. It is about 600-700 pages long and contains the history of our Air Force. There were many photographs and other details in the book, and I was pleasantly surprised that Christian officers and Christian young men in other ranks have sacrificed their lives with a smile on their faces while serving in the Pakistan Air Force. Seeing the greatness and depth of their emotions, I felt my emotions were not as strong as theirs. If my information is correct, I can fearlessly say that the people and the government have not done much for the Pakistani Christians who have done a lot for the Air Force. These Christians have been treated a little better than untouchables in Islamic society. They have demonstrated an admirable love for our nation. I wish we had paid attention to their love and, learning from our own religion, had done something to alleviate the problems faced by the mistreated Christian society. Now, if that had happened, a major part of these Christians would be leading better lives. There is no doubt that we have forgotten the teachings of our religious prophets. Because of our neglect of the Christian population, the United States, Western intelligence agencies, and foreign Christian missions had the opportunity to work with the Christians here. Because of our 45 years of complacency, some vested interests have risen among the Christians. We do not have a dearth of such elements among Pakistani Muslims, who wait for signs from abroad. At a time when the United States and other Western powers are jointly trying to ensure that none of the Islamic countries gives up its Western style of living and presents a challenge to them, we should think about the issue of our treatment of the minorities here. The minorities should also consider that they do not become instrumental in efforts to weaken Pakistan's Islamic character. Basically there are three minorities in Pakistan. There are the Christians, which I have already mentioned. There are Hindus, who have some influence in Sindh. There are also the Qadianis, who are so much opposed to the majority religion of our country that it is impossible to expect any constructive relationship with them. The reader may recall that the minorities have opposed the efforts to include religion on identity cards in the campaign to displace the Nawaz Sharif government. Some of these minorities have become very active. Let us ignore this debate over whether inclusion of religion on identity cards is appropriate or not. There were two major reasons for the minorities' efforts to oppose it: First, to keep the Pakistani government on a secular footing as much as possible; second, to weaken a government that tried to give itself the Islamic color. At present, some religious parties have held demonstrations in support of the inclusion of religion on identity cards. The diplomats from the United States and some other Western powers supported the stand of the minorities openly. Thus, the opposing groups that were formed included the United States of America, Western powers, the PPP [Pakistan People's Party], and minorities, all on one side, and some political parties on the other. In which direction are our minorities headed? The latest indicator was the day when the leader of the House was elected. Two Senate members of minority groups refused to take the oath of allegiance according to Islamic ceremonies. The present federal government of Pakistan is riding on the shoulders of these minorities, who consider Pakistani ideology to be interfering in their religion. The latest aspect of this retrogression is that, at a time when the minority members refused to take the oath of allegiance according to Islamic rites, the members of Pakistan's Islamic Front were leaving the House. They failed when they had to do something. May God bless Maulana Fazal-ul Rehman that he countered the argument offered by the minority members and finally convinced them. I do not want to draw some "dangerous" conclusions from this analysis. If regression is not stopped, then dangerous results will emerge automatically. All I want to do is identify this scenario. Not only minorities, but also a major political party in Pakistan, are supporting a two-nation theory, and those who should defend it have disappeared. There should have been someone whose voice we could hear, so that it could give us some courage.
