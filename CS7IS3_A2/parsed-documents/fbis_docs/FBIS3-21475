In the face of foreign competition, domestic private investment has increased [as published] without any compensating increase in foreign investment. All of this has fueled an unemployment crisis which has [also] been caused by the fact that the state has given up its role of providing employment. Unemployment is considered to be the most important problem from which Morocco suffers. This problem rapidly became worse in the early eighties and has continued to become worse during the nineties. The underlying reason for the problem goes back to the manner in which the restructuring policy has been applied in Morocco since 1983. The policy had the aim of restoring equilibrium to both the nation's domestic and foreign finances. It was also behind the push to have the state give up numerous job slots considered to be normal and natural even in liberal economies and to give up protecting the national economy, both in the face of foreign competition and with regard to social gains for the working class. The rate of unemployment went up for three basic reasons. The first reason was Morocco's open-door policy with regard to foreign countries. What this meant was that the doors were opened for foreign goods and services to be imported instead of having an increase in Morocco's exports, because our potential to produce and export goods had not risen to a level that could allow us to deal with foreign competition either on the technical or technological level or in terms of the nature and cost of our production. This liberal trade policy caused many Moroccan firms to go out of business, lay off many of their workers, or shorten their work hours. As a result, the rate of layoffs and level of unemployment both increased. The Moroccan companies were no longer able to employ as large a work force as they had, much less create new positions. Opening the doors of the economy in this fashion caused the economy to be oriented more toward the exchange of goods rather than the production of goods. This created what could be called a "bazaar economy," meaning an economy of buying and selling goods, without any production taking place, and an economy oriented toward the consumption of foreign goods without any domestic production or involving only domestic production that was very weak in terms of both quantity and quality. So the liberalization of imports, without protection for the economic foundation of our domestic manufacturing and agricultural production, caused the rate of layoffs and unemployment in the production sectors to increase. The second reason for the unemployment, due to the policy of restructuring and related to the first reason above, is that our economy was impelled to become what has been known for years as an unregulated or unstructured economy. This type of economy was encouraged because our economy embarked upon a policy of restructuring and because it will be part of the GATT agreements that will be signed in Marrakech in mid-April. As a result of this, our economy has entered into a framework of intense international competition on all levels, including the areas of cost of production, manner of production, and production efficiency. These factors have impelled numerous firms to leave the regulated sector and enter the unregulated sector. The reason for this is that, in the unregulated sector one can pay wages that are so low that they do not even come up to the level of the minimum wage, which is "theoretically" guaranteed by the state. Also, in this sector, one can avoid paying taxes, and the workers are given no social benefits, which they are supposed to receive. No contributions are paid to the national social security fund. Of course, this situation also applies even to some of the establishments operating within the structured economy. Another characteristic of the unstructured sector is that it does not provide for guaranteeing continued employment, because foreign competition leads to an increase in the rate of layoffs, and the rate of hiring new workers is subjected to external factors. This rate, in any case, remains circumstantial rather than being structural, because the establishments both lay off and hire workers whenever they so desire. Usually there are more layoffs than there are jobs created. The Moroccan economy has become oriented toward being an unregulated economy that employs an uneducated work force. This explains why the figures published by the Directorate of Statistics show that the level of unemployment for holders of diplomas is higher than that for persons having no qualifications. Another characteristic of this sector is that it pays very low wages and is usually oriented toward employing women or children. This is something that has begun to become alarmingly widespread in nearly all the developing nations, especially those in Africa. Also, it is a trend that has begun to lead to the spread of numerous demographic phenomena, which are evident, for example, in the fact that the populations have stopped progressing and are going back to previous demographic growth levels. The number of children is increasing, whereas the average life expectancy is decreasing, because children who work during their early years usually are exposed to illnesses, accidents, and numerous ailments, shortening their life spans. This is something that causes social and demographical problems, and consequently economic problems. The third reason for the increase in the unemployment rate is the decrease in the rate of domestic investment, without any compensating foreign investment. Whoever says that foreign investments have increased is mistaken, because when we compare foreign investments made between the years 1982 and 1992, we notice that the increase has not taken place to the degree quoted by official speeches. In fact, the increase during this period of time has not gone over 4 percent. This fact becomes even clearer if we take into consideration a series of factors such as the decrease in the value of the dirham, domestic inflation, and foreign inflation. This has led to an increase in the prices of numerous goods and equipment that we used to purchase before the beginning of the eighties. The same 1982 investment, in terms of value, has become of far less value in real terms in 1992. The fourth reason or factor is the appearance of what has come to be called the unemployment of young people who have graduated from educational institutions and have degrees. This new phenomenon is a result of the fact that the state has given up its role of providing them with employment. Until 1982 the organs of public administration provided from 40,000 to 50,000 jobs each year. But then the restructuring policy began to be applied, and since this policy stipulates, among other things, that the state be downsized and the budget deficit be reduced by means of reducing public expenditures, the state has decreased its volume of employment, starting in 1983, down to between 12,000 and 15,000 jobs per year. Judging from the overall situation that characterized the above-mentioned 10-year period, it is clear that there was a difference of between 200,000 and 250,000 jobs provided in the seventies as opposed to the eighties. This clearly explains the reasons for the widespead unemployment among the ranks of our young people. These young people cannot get jobs unless the state undertakes its role of providing employment, particularly in fields that are experiencing a large gap [in the number of positions filled]--such as the field of education on all levels and the field of public health, which is considered to be one of the most impoverished fields both on the regional and international levels. The employment of young people with degrees brings up the issue of the restructuring of our system of education and of programming its subjects in order to make the education more capable of providing young people with new opportunities to obtain jobs. This issue has become all the more relevant because the government has given up providing young people with employment, on the one hand, and because, in addition to this, the world economy has begun to demand that employees have skills and qualifications that are no longer provided by our system of education. The four above-mentioned factors are what have led to a widespread high rate of unemployment in Morocco. The manner used in the attempt to mitigate the severity of unemployment in general and unemployment among our young people in particular has proved to be of limited effect, because employing young people either directly or indirectly in establishments created especially for this purpose has not led to the results hoped for. Since 1991, not more than 45,000 young persons have received jobs, whereas the goal was to create 100,000 jobs for young persons holding degrees in 1991. And since 1991 the size of this group of unemployed persons has grown because additional graduates from institutes and colleges since 1991 have increased the ranks of the unemployed. In general, whether the matter concerns Morocco or other countries, the policy of restructuring has led to a decrease in employment because the policy was based on reducing the cost of labor and has caused the state to decrease its investments after the national economies of these nations were liberalized. Since the European economies are still dominant, since their export capabilities are greater than those of the backward nations, and since their production costs are lower in comparison to those of the backward countries, this has led to an increase in unemployment. In addition to this, Morocco occupies a special place within this general orientation. Morocco has experienced a noticeable decrease in its national income--down 3 percent in 1992 when compared with 1991. Furthermore, this income is characterized by the fact that there is a great discrepancy in how it is distributed among the various groups of people in our country. There is a vast difference between the income of the low-income groups and the high-income groups. Proof of this can be seen in the realm of public employment where the highest official wage is as much as 70 times greater than the lowest official wage. This discrepancy in income, in addition to the meagerness of the average income, has caused the domestic market to continue shrinking. And this has caused both Moroccan and foreign investors to cease investing in this market. The absence of a domestic market is also a factor that can be added to the above-mentioned factors, which indicate that the rate of unemployment in Morocco will increase in coming years. Poor incomes do not help create a broad consumers' market. The absence of such a market means that there is no incentive for investment, and a lack of investment results in the lack of creation of jobs which, in turn, results in the spread of unemployment, impoverishment, and thus entry into a vicious circle. As for fiscal rectification, which was one of the hoped-for goals of the policy of restructuring, results in this regard have been unsatisfactory. Let us disregard the fact that there has been a decrease in the rate of public expenditures, leading to a decrease in the number of government jobs and to a decrease in the public debt from 11 percent of the national income in 1982 down to less than 2 percent at the present time. Let us disregard all of this--and it is something which the state has always been able to do in view of the fact that it has began to rapidly reduce its expenditures on employment, health, education, and the protection of consumer capacity of the low-income working classes by means of cutting the revenues of the budget fund. Disregarding all of this, it is nevertheless true that our foreign debt has not decreased from what it was in 1982. That year the foreign debt was an estimated $13 billion, and in 1992 the value of the debt went up to where it amounted to about $22 billion. All of our financial and social efforts have not led to a decrease in the foreign debt. In fact, the opposite is true. The debt has increased in scope, because the actual policies that have resulted in this debt have not changed and are continuing as before. Concerning the balance of trade, the policy of restructuring and the reduction [in value] of our national currency in the form that this has been done since 1982/83 have not led to a decrease in the trade deficit. Statistics coming out of the Office of the Budget themselves confirm this view, because exports amounted to only about 53 percent of imports in 1982, and the situation was still the same in 1992. The level of imports has been much higher than the level of exports. What this means is that Morocco has come to [export] more actual natural resources than it exported in 1982, because the value of our exports has either decreased or not increased sufficiently to keep pace with world inflation, whereas the prices of the goods we import from other nations have increased greatly. The reason for this is that the nations and companies who export these goods have control when it comes to setting the prices, and the consequence has been that Morocco is now exporting more goods at lower prices and is importing fewer goods at greater cost than we were importing in 1982. One should add to this the fact that the imbalance in the national income, the tax policy that has been followed since 1983, especially the policy followed with regard to customs duties and the value-added tax, has resulted in the fact that many of the luxury items that are imported are sold at prices that, in some cases, are nearly the same as the prices of basic items. This is something that becomes obvious when we see the imported luxury cars that are cruising around on our streets and roads. Also, we are importing a series of luxury appliances that the national economy could do without if we had a wise economic policy for controlling imports and protecting our national potential. Even in the field of tourism we have seen that the devaluation of the dirham really has not changed anything. Income from tourism has been steadily declining since the mid-eighties, and foreign investments themselves have not increased as much as was anticipated by the economic production policy.
