FR940627-0-00134 FR940627-0-00019 In addition to establishing cost-sharing mechanisms, F/FA manufacturers will also need to develop agreements concerning the division of responsibilities among group members for meeting the specific requirements of the registration program. EPA expects the participation of industry trade associations in the formation of groups and management of these activities. These associations should be able to establish ``third-party'' mechanisms whereby individual manufacturers can enroll their products in appropriate groups while minimizing the extent to which confidential data must be revealed. Each manufacturer needs to determine whether the grouping and cost-sharing advantages outweigh the possible competitive risks involved. In general, F/FA manufacturers should be able to determine the appropriate groups for their products without EPA involvement, according to the grouping criteria specified in this final rule, and to enroll their products into those groups. However, EPA recognizes that some Agency involvement might be needed in some special cases. When appropriate, based on EPA's discretion, the Agency will provide limited guidance for those manufacturers needing assistance with the application of the grouping criteria to their specific products. Manufacturers of F/FAs registered prior to the effective date of this rule are required to notify EPA within six months after the effective date of this rule if they intend to comply with the rule as part of a group and, if so, to identify the person or entity which is organizing the testing (see Section XII.A). In this case, groups of producers would organize prospectively to complete the same program requirements for their similar products and cost-sharing arrangements could be reached in advance of testing. Manufacturers of F/FAs not registered prior to the effective date of this rule are expected to conduct the required testing individually, unless they certify to EPA that they intend to rely on data to be submitted (and/or previously submitted) by an existing group or individual manufacturer of a similar registered product. The certification needs to include assurances that the original submitter has been notified (see Section XII.A for notification requirements) and that the manufacturer intends to comply with reimbursement as provided in this rule. Under the reimbursement provisions in this rule, there will be a fifteen years ``reimbursement period'' for the original submitter (individual or group) to obtain reimbursement from those manufacturers that rely on previously submitted data. This period has been lengthened from the originally proposed five years in response to public comments. V. Base Fuel Specifications and Formulation Requirements In this final rule, EPA is establishing chemical and physical specifications to represent base fuel formulations for each defined fuel family. EPA has adopted the method proposed in the reformulated gasoline rulemaking (56 FR 31176), which uses sales-weighted averages of fuel survey data to determine national average chemical and physical parameters, to establish base fuel specifications for gasoline and diesel. Because comparable survey data are not available for alternative fuels, the base fuels for the alternative fuel families are based on CARB definitions and limited survey information. The generic base fuel formulations will function as archetypes of the F/FAs in each fuel family and will serve as the test substance or group representatives for the baseline group(s) for the respective fuel family. The use of consistently formulated base fuels will facilitate the comparison of the emission and health effect test results from the many fuel and fuel additive products within each fuel family. The base fuels will also serve as the fuel substrates into which additives undergoing evaluation will be mixed prior to emission generation and testing. Tests conducted on the emissions of the base fuel will then serve as controls against which tests on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture will be compared. In addition to defining chemical and physical parameters for each base fuel, EPA is also specifying the allowable additive(s) to be included in the base fuel. EPA recognizes that commercial fuels typically contain additives to control fuel quality and enhance fuel performance, as well as to help in fuel production and distribution. Ideally, in order to better isolate the health effects associated with a particular additive or fuel, the base fuel would not contain additives unless they were the actual test subjects. However, several bulk additive types are common to most of the fuels within a given fuel family, and these should arguably be included as part of the base fuel. As a practical matter, it would be difficult in some instances to find a fuel that did not contain certain additive types used by refiners to facilitate production or distribution. EPA is thus requiring that base fuels contain a limited complement of the additives which are essential for the fuel's production or distribution and/or for the successful operation of the test vehicle/engine throughout the mileage accumulation and emission generation periods required under this rule. Since additives may have a substantial effect on emissions, for purposes of standardization it is important to specify the additive types which are to be contained in the base fuels. However, the selection of the specific product within each specified additive functional category is left to the formulator of the base fuel and/or the manufacturer responsible for the testing. Unless otherwise restricted, the presence of trace contaminants does not preclude the use of a fuel or fuel additive as a component of a base fuel. Additive requirements for each defined base fuel are discussed in the following sections. Additives used as base fuel components are to be added at the minimum treatment rate needed for effective performance. In contrast, additives to be tested must be mixed in the base fuel at the maximum in-use concentration recommended by their manufacturers. 19 When a fuel additive is tested, any additive normally contained in the base fuel which serves the same function as the test subject additive must be removed from the base fuel formulation. For example, if a corrosion inhibitor is to be tested, this test additive would replace the corrosion inhibitor normally included as a component in the base fuel. This substitution requirement may preclude the use of certain multi-functional additives as base fuel components (in the case where the subject additive serves one of the functions of the multi-functional additive), since it would not be possible to replace a portion of a multi-functional additive with the test subject additive. 19 Special provisions related to the testing of additives are discussed in Section VI.F. Note: The specifications in the following sections describe the base fuel(s) for each fuel family, which serve the test fuel functions discussed above. These base fuel specifications are not the same as the criteria which permit F/FAs to join the baseline group within a fuel family. The baseline group criteria are provided in the preceding section of this preamble.
