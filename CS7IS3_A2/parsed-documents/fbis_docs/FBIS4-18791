FBIS4-18791 "drweu069_p_94006" FBIS-WEU-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 GREECE Foreign Minister Views EU Lawsuit Over FYROM Foreign Minister Views EU Lawsuit Over FYROM NC0904165594 Athens ATHENS NEWS in English 9 Apr 94 p 3 NC0904165594 Athens ATHENS NEWS English BFN [Excerpts] Preparing for a week of intense diplomatic activity, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias yesterday reiterated the government's defiant disregard for Wednesday's [6 April] "sad" decision by the European Commission to take Greece to the European Court of Justice unless its sanctions on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] are lifted within a week. Mr. Papoulias spoke to reporters after briefing President Konstandinos Karamanlis on the latest developments over the Skopje issue, the likelihood of having to withstand the threatened EU [European Union] legal action, and Monday's planned talks of UN mediator Cyrus Vance in separate sessions with Greek and Skopje officials. "The government has no reason to worry about the Commission's flawed decision," Mr. Papoulias said, relegating the EU ultimatum against Greece as "no different from other unpraiseworthy initiatives like those which enhanced the dissolution of Yugoslavia." But he commended last week's shuttle diplomacy between Athens and Skopje by U.S. special envoy Matthew Nimetz, which the Greek foreign minister described as "very useful." He did not rule out Mr. Nimetz's resumption of his efforts next week, in conjunction with a possible progress in Mr. Vance's mediation talks in New York. [passage omitted] Regarding the legal action against Greece by the EU, Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told reporters: "The procedure which the Commission seems to have chosen, is one which has never been used before within the Community. The aim of such proceedings would be to establish whether a member-state is abusing its right to impose sanctions on a third country, for reasons of national security, public safety or international tension that endangers peace." Mr. Venizelos stressed that, if the Commission finally initiates these proceedings, it would take no less than a whole year to reach a court ruling. Further, the spokesman emphasised that such legal action would not be in the form of criminal proceedings. "The EU Court only offers an opinion on a possible violation of EU law, without further legal consequences. There is no penalty, and, certainly, the levying of fines is no easy matter either," Mr. Venizelos said.
