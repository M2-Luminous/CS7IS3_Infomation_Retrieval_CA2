On 10 February, REUTER inaccurately reported on the stance of Leonid Kravchuk on the possible bombardment of Bosnian Serb military positions around Sarajevo. In particular, REUTER claims that the Ukrainian president said that he does not see any alternative to the onset of air attacks on the Serbian positions sanctioned by the United Nations. In connection with this, REUTER reported on the evident change in the Ukrainian president's previous position on this issue. This does not correspond to reality. The statement from the press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers cites the entire text of Kravchuk's interview with REUTER. This text shows that President Kravchuk confirmed REUTER's supposition that the stances of Ukraine and Russia, which are opposed to air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs, are close to each other. In addition, Leonid Kravchuk stated that, in general, this is not the first time the stances of Ukraine and Russia have been close to each other. I am convinced that our stances on such international issues as strengthening global peace, the social protection of people and their human rights and freedoms, and on other international issues were, are, and will be close. We will cooperate and coordinate our policy with Russia, said Leonid Kravchuk. Answering a question as to who -- NATO or the UN Security Council -- will decide on the bombardment of Bosnian Serbs, Leonid Kravchuk definitely spoke in favor of the UN Security Council, because the issue under discussion is connected with a forceful invasion. Next, Leonid Kravchuk said: I admit this option when there is no other way out, when blood is shed and people are dying. Simply put, my hair stands on end when I hear the reports of how people, including children, are dying there, in what terrible conditions they are living, and how much has been destroyed. Both the land and people's soul are devastated. If there is no other way to stop this nightmare, we have to use other approaches, however, this should not be the decision of a single country, this should be a decision made by the entire international community. I always favored and still favor this option. [Words indistinct], however, there are international organizations -- the United Nations and its Security Council, the EC, and others. This issue should be resolved by the highest level international organizations. Therefore, you can see that the REUTER report does not at all correspond to what Leonid Kravchuk really said. The press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers is authorized to denounce the REUTER report as totally changing the gist of the Ukrainian president's remarks.
