FR940721-1-00051 FR940721-1-00013 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 227 [Docket No. 940793&hyph;4193; I.D. 060994A] RIN 0648&hyph;AG37 Sea Turtle Conservation; Shrimp Trawling Requirements AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would allow non-Federal entities to apply for, and NMFS to issue, permits for the incidental take of threatened species of sea turtles consistent with section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Existing regulations provide for the issuance of an incidental take permit for endangered sea turtles. DATES: Written comments must be received by August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposed rule, and requests for copies of the Environmental Assessment (EA) for this proposed rule, should be addressed to William W. Fox, Jr., Ph.D., Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Heather Weiner, Endangered Species Division, (301) 713&hyph;2319; Doug Beach, Protected Species Program Coordinator, NMFS Northeast Regional Office, (508) 281&hyph;9254; or Charles A. Oravetz, Chief, Protected Species Program, NMFS Southeast Regional Office, (813) 893&hyph;3366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background All sea turtles that occur in U.S. waters are listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. Kemp's ridley ( Lepidochelys kempii ), leatherback ( Dermochelys coriacea ) and hawksbill ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) turtles are listed as endangered. Loggerhead ( Caretta caretta ), green ( Chelonia mydas ) and olive ridley ( Lepidochelys olivacea ) turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding populations of green turtles in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and the breeding population of olive ridley turtles on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which are listed as endangered. In 1990, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) completed a review of the biology of sea turtles and the causes and extent of their decline. The NAS concluded that incidental capture in shrimp trawls without turtle excluder devices (TEDs) is by far the leading cause of human-induced mortality to sea turtles at sea, but that collectively, activities in the non-shrimp fisheries constitute the second largest source of mortality. The study identified finfish trawls, seine nets, pompano gillnets, and various passive fishing gear, such as sink gillnets, weirs, traps and longlines, as potential sources of mortality to sea turtles. Because threatened sea turtles are often incidentally taken in state coastal fisheries, NMFS established a regulatory framework that requires the use of TEDs on most shrimp trawls and allows NMFS to impose measures with respect to shrimp trawl and other fisheries to protect sea turtles, such as the use of limited tow times, the requirement to carry observers, and the closure of certain areas (57 FR 57348, December 4, 1992). Under this framework, measures are implemented as temporary restrictions, which is a time-consuming, repetitious, and short-term means to accomplish conservation measures for sea turtles. For example, NMFS has implemented many temporary restrictions allowing the North Carolina shrimp fishery to comply with tow-time limits as an alternative to using TEDs in areas of high algae concentrations (see 58 FR 48975, September 21, 1993).
