Irina Khakamada also thinks that the policy of the government and the Central Bank of Russia is primarily geared now at stabilizing today's financial structure, and then at increasing the state control and flexible maneuvering within the already set rules of the game. An official statement about the possibility of restructuring the Central Bank of Russia into a federal reserve system came last week from Aleksandr Lifshits, head of a group of experts under the Russian Federation president. This is not a matter of xeroxing the U.S. Federal Reserve system, which makes it possible with the aid of a flexible adjustment of the discount rate and the supply of money in circulation to avoid abrupt inflationary changes in the economy. However, according to the economists and bankers behind presenting this idea to the top power echelons, a federal reserve system, if formed in Russia, would make it possible, on one hand, to end the Central Bank of Russia monopoly, and, on the other, to put in place civilized forms of internal hard currency settlements. It is no surprise therefore that the given idea, which is so far just an idea, has provoked more than a burst of temper among Central Bank chiefs. (According to some information, Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, suggested to the unruly bankers, who had put forward this idea at a conference in the State Duma budget, taxes, and prices committee, that they "wash themselves in blood"). The prospect of weaker monopolist positions on the Russian financial market made Central Bank chiefs conduct a preemptive campaign to explain that the federal reserve system idea is corrupt and totally out of keeping with the specific Russian character. According to reports from informed sources, mutual understanding was reached.
