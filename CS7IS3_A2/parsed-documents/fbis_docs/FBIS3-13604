Two UN ceasefire resolutions were adopted at the end of the Gulf war in February 1991, calling on Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction and to allow UN aid organisations free access across the country. General Secretary of the main Iraqi opposition alliance Iraqi National Congress (INC), Dr. Ahmad Shalabi, told AFP: "The Iraqi regime is every day further away from implementing resolution 688" on allowing UN organisations access to carry aid programmes. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz began a new effort Wednesday to persuade the United Nations to lift the oil embargo imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In talks with French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee, this month's Security Council chairman, 'Aziz called for an end to the embargo on Iraq since his country had complied with UN resolutions on disarming. Shalabi, speaking from his headquarters in Salah al-Din, said a proposed option to lift the embargo only in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq would be "problematical." He said any such proposal would "raise strong opposition from Turkey's side" because of Ankara's continuing conflict with Kurds living in southeast Turkey. He added that Turkey was the base for the UN operation Provide Comfort set up at the end of the Gulf war in February 1991 to provide allied air cover for the Kurds in northern Iraq. Kurdish leaders meanwhile said it would be a positive step if the UN lifted sanctions on northern Iraq. The Security Council is expected to decide Thursday or Friday to keep the sanctions locked on Iraq, due to its view that Baghdad has not met all council resolution requirements, diplomats said. Still a majority of the council's 15 members including France, China and Russia have asked that the council acknowledge Iraqi progress on disarmament, western diplomats said.
