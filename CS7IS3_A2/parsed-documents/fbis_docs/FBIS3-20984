According to Professor Christopher Llewellyn Smith (Great-Britain), who will succeed Professor Carlo Rubbia as CERN director on 1 January 1994, the cost of this giant proton-proton collider, which will be 10 times more powerful than the CERN's present electron-positron ring, the LEP (Large Electron-Positron Collider), is estimated at 2.23 billion Swiss francs (nearly 9 billion French francs [Fr]). If it is approved by the board during the first half of 1994 (the decision should be made in April), construction of the LHC might start in 1995 and be completed in 2002. The expenditures concerning the project were included in the CERN 10-year plan for 1995-2005. Pr. Llewellyn Smith said that member states might increase their participation and mentioned the possibility of both intellectual and financial contributions from non-members, such as the United States now that the SSC [Superconducting Super-Collider] project has been abandoned, which "complicates the decision." In fact, a few weeks ago, the U.S. Congress refused to go on with the construction of the SSC--a project similar to the LHC but still more gigantic and powerful--which was deemed too costly (total cost: about $11 billion). People in Geneva estimate that, as a result, "thousands of physicists, in particular U.S. physicists, will be tempted to come and work at the CERN" if the LHC is built. France is in favor of building the collider, which will be set up above the LEP, in the 27-km-diameter ring under the French-Swiss border. Early in November, Russia expressed its intention to contribute to the construction. In addition, Switzerland recently announced that it would grant the CERN a loan of 34.4 million Swiss francs ($23 million) for the construction of a new building that might provide an additional 876 work stations. Every year, 6,000 scientists from all over the world (including already an increasing number of Americans) come to the CERN, which has a permanent staff of 3,000. For over 10 years now, the CERN has been the leading particle physics laboratory in the world. Building the LHC would enable it to retain its rank and to make new discoveries, several of which have already been predicted by theoreticians, for instance that of Higgs' boson. The CERN board also approved the laboratory's 1994 budget, which amounts to 924.1 million Swiss francs, compared with 951.67 million Swiss francs in 1993.
