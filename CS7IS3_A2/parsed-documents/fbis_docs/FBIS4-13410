FBIS4-13410 "drnes076_l_94007" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Further on IDF Preparations Further on IDF Preparations TA1904084494 Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew 19 Apr 94 p 1 TA1904084494 Tel Aviv DAVAR Hebrew BFN [Report by On Levi] [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is completing preparations for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreements. The General Staff believes the agreement will be signed on 5 May. The evacuation and redeployment plan can be implemented in three different ways. It provides for a speedy evacuation lasting only 24 hours, one lasting a week, and a lengthy evacuation process that will last for up to three months. The Southern Command expressed satisfaction with the speed at which the preparations are proceeding and believes that it will be ready to carry out the plan on whatever date is determined. The Defense Ministry recently completed contracts with all the Gaza Strip settlements for the security forces to enter the settlements and use empty structures there. The only Gaza Strip settlement with which no agreement has been signed is Netzarim, but the Southern Command believes that one will be signed in the coming days. Senior Southern Command sources praised the cooperation with the Gaza settlement leaders and said that all the obstacles and misunderstandings that prevented the Army's entry have been removed. Under instruction from Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, the IDF is currently concentrating its efforts on concluding the building of an electronic fence along the demarcation line. Eight contractors won a tender to build the fence, which is expected to cost 150 million shekels. The IDF believes the fence will be completed by early 1995. Until the fence is completed, the IDF is deploying large forces along the new lines, and dozens of electronic measures have been set up to prevent movement to and from the Gaza Strip as long as there is no fence. The Southern Command's engineering units and the IDF Logistics Branch are preparing the ground where the forces will be deployed once a decision is made to implement the Gaza agreement.
