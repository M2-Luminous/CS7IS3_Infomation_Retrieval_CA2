Iran's ambassador told journalists about his view of the role of the press as a means of rapprochement and mutual understanding, saying its functions are "to reflect reality as it is, on the basis of truth." Complaining that previous reports about Iran very often have not corresponded to reality, the ambassador gave the media representatives a brief history of his country and a report on the state of its economy. Devoting particular attention to oil as an export item, Rasul Eslami denied the claim that all profits from oil exports are being used to purchase weapons. He also analyzed and criticized the former Iranian regime and discussed the Iran-Iraq war and the state's path of development since the Islamic revolution. As for Iran's policy in regard to Kazakhstan and the other former Soviet republics, he said that that policy is to help those states along the path of independent development. The visit to Kazakhstan by Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani (who during his 10-day trip will also visit Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan) is a reciprocal visit after last year's trip to Iran by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The delegation includes minister of foreign affairs Ali Akbar Velayati, minister of economics and finance Morteza Mohammad-khan, minister of roads and transport Akbar Torkan, and other ministers. Iran's delegation of representatives will include approximately 100 individuals, among them public officials, members of the government, bankers, industrialists and businessmen. Mr. Rafsanjani will be accompanied on the trip by his wife and daughter (incidentally, Miss Rafsanjani is chairman of the Iranian Women's Association). During the visit there are plans for visits to Almaty and Karaganda, as well as discussion and signing of a number of documents in the areas of economics, politics, cultural cooperation and education. In the opinion of Rasul Eslami all this will serve to reinforce and expand the agreements reached during Nursultan Nazarbayev's trip to Iran. No specific economic cooperation projects were mentioned. However, the ambassador did invite everyone to a special exhibit by the Islamic Republic of Iran that is currently in Almaty and which should provide a complete picture of the capabilities of Iran's heavy and light industry and of 80 different companies. The ambassador promised to open Iran's borders to Kazakhstan's products so they can reach the world market. The same will be true of oil and gas when they reach the Persian Gulf. In short, the ambassador is convinced that by reaching the Persian Gulf Kazakhstan will be able to gain access to the world market. An enticing prospect. As is the two sides' stake in it.
