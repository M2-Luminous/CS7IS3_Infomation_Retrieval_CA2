One can say that the Majles measures in this regard are unprecedented in the past 15 years. The reduction in the expenses of the government and government organizations, the fight against ostentation and extravagance, better supervision over government and public organizations and companies, the emphasis on reducing foreign exchange commitments and the prohibition on increased prices for public goods and services can be considered the most important measures enacted by the Fourth Majles. The implementation of the First Five-Year Plan plan was done with economic pressures on the low-income classes. Although these pressures came from investment in some basic infrastructure in Iran's economy, since sufficient measures were not taken beforehand to support the oppressed classes and no thought was given to fixed incomes, its continuation in the old way created many problems for the deprived. Wage and salary increases did not keep up with inflation, and the most important law to support the consumer was never prepared for enforcement during this plan. Without carefully assessing the effects and consequences of the decision to increase the prices of public goods and services, prices increased with or without the approval of the Economic Council. Unfortunately, in some cases the reasons for these increases were not explained to the people. The question is not whether these increases were the required amounts or were made carefully with consideration for the probable effects and consequences. The issue is, before these kinds of decisions are taken some thought must be given to supporting the oppressed and the poor, as the real owners of the Islamic revolution, and to preventing them from coming under pressure. It was on this basis that Note 25 in the budget bill was controversial among the Majles deputies. Ultimately, after debates and expert studies in the Majles, increases in the prices of oil by-products (such as kerosene, gasoline and gas oil) were rejected and raising the price of electrical power for 96.3 percent of household consumers (up to 500 kilowatts) was accepted. The other items in this note were approved with adjustments. Emphasis on reducing foreign exchange commitments in the year 1373 is another of the characteristics of the budget bill approved by the Majles. Due to excessive imports, sometimes of consumer goods, and the emergence of a trade deficit, the nation's commitments increased. The lack of appropriate management for the aforementioned commitments created worries among the people, and this is the main cause of fluctuations in the prices of goods and services, and especially the foreign exchange rate on the free market. (1) By the end of the current year this situation led to about $30 billion in commitments, $15 to $20 billion in debts and $10 to $11 billion in suspended debts for Iran's economy. The exalted leader His Holiness Ayatollah Khamene'i emphasized: "taking the necessary measures for keeping the country away from foreign borrowing and efforts to break free of current commitments" (4) [as published] as one of the policies governing the compilation of the Second Five-Year Plan. In its study of the 1373 budget, the Majles gave attention to implementing the order from the exalted leader. The first measure the Majles took was to make budget approval a two-consultation procedure. Thus, more realistic revenue levels were approved and the amount of revenues from oil exports, which was set by the government at $11.84 billion, was reduced to $10.154 billion. In the second consultation, based on this same revenue level, government expenses came down. The designation of expenses at the level of approved revenues will not prevent other expenditures from taking place if the nation's foreign exchange revenues increase. The second move by the Majles was to cut $1.6 billion out of the foreign exchange commitments at the end of the year 1373 compared to the first part of this year, which was set in the government's bill at $1 billion. The third move was that the foreign exchange reserves account, which was being kept at the Central Bank without authorization from the Majles, was put in order by the Majles deputies. It was decided that 15 percent of the revenues from the sale of oil would be deposited in this account at the official rate and would be used solely to pay foreign exchange commitments. Based on this measure, the government has no right to spend funds from this account except for this purpose. Of course other expenditures may be made with Majles authorization. Footnotes [.sup]1.[/] Late in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] the rate for the dollar on the free market was 2,610 rials [R], and it increased to R2,700 by late in the current year. With Iran's agreements with Germany and Japan, this rate has dropped to R2,310 today. [.sup]2.[/] Paragraph D, Note 11, Policies Governing the Second Five-Year Plan [15 Mar pp 1, 16] [Part 2] [Text] The management of foreign exchange resources was not really done well during the First Five-Year Plan. Under the First Five-Year Plan authorization was given for up to $29.9 million in new commitments for specific projects.[.sup]1[/] Although no definitive opinion can be given in this regard, based on the preliminary estimates, $10 billion and at best $15 billion of the commitments created were in accordance with the designated projects under the Five-Year Plan. The Plan and Budget Organization has the definitive figures. Unfortunately, in violation of the law, this organization has not yet announced its report on the plan's performance[.sup]2[/] to permit documentation of the figures. Therefore, the government did not intend to make $30 billion in commitments in every area, and the claim that the figure 30 was deliberately chosen is correct, but its uses were not in accordance with the Five-Year Plan. Second, most of the outstanding debts are usance and short-term debt, although in the measures approved under the Five-Year Plan, usance purchases in this form were not to have taken place. It must be noted that $10 billion in outstanding debt in an economy like Iran's, which has rich wealth, cannot cause problems. For this reason, the approach taken to this issue by the West is more political than economic. Many countries have several times the amount of debt that Iran has, but nothing is even mentioned about them. In any case, the outstanding debts are something that happened in the past, but since this was not managed well by the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs and the Central Bank, the problems came with it. The reduction in government expenses and anchoring government companies can be said to be the most important characteristic of the 1373 budget bill. After the reduction in the oil revenues ceiling in the first consultation, which was necessarily followed by a reduction in government expenditures, some government organizations did not cooperate as required. Others took a position against this Majles decision.[.sup]3[/] At the same time the respected deputies, despite the lack of cooperation from some of the government's experts and representatives, themselves made new decisions concerning the government companies using expert studies, and one might be able to say that implementation of these revolutionary decisions in the government companies will become general.[.sup]4[/] One of the problems with regard to these companies is that the real number of them is not given in the budget bills. By the end of the year 1371 [20 March 1993] 2,221 companies had been identified, of which 900 are clearly government companies.[.sup]5[/] Thanks to the inept management of the Plan and Budget Organization, the number of government companies was announced as being approximately 400 units.[.sup]6[/] The surprising thing is that even of this number that was confirmed, all did not submit their figures for inclusion in the budget bill. In the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget bill, of 424 government companies, banks and profit-making institutions affiliated with the government, 284 units submitted their figures.[.sup]7[/] Despite the fact that these companies draw from general revenues all of their profits are not deposited into the Treasury, yet their losses are imposed on the budget. Because the government and public companies have more privileges than other companies, one does not compete with them on equal terms. The law is not even enforced in many of these companies. The 8,750 reports on failure to obey the law and the 1,066 management violations in 1,567 companies and government and public institutions support this claim.[.sup]8[/] Among the reasons there is a budget deficit every year is these very government and public companies. With their extravagance and ostentation, they impose the costs of their uneconomical management on the budget. The budget deficit was to have been reduced to zero in the year 1372, but this problem still remains. According to the preliminary estimates from the Plan and Budget Organization, by the end of the current year [20 March 1994] the budget deficit will be R2,139.[.sup]9[/] If we add to this figure the R2,500 billion in Treasury imprest funds and the R3,400 billion in banking facilities these companies received, the scope of the problem becomes clearer. In the 1373 budget the Majles made some very good decisions on government companies and public institutions. No matter how good the decisions are, however, if they are not implemented or if they do not have good executive officials, all the efforts of the Majles and the government will be wasted. Therefore it is considered necessary to deal with the violator, regardless of his rank.[.sup]10[/] Footnotes [.sup]1.[/] These projects and the amount of their commitments consist of $10 billion in buybacks, $2.2 billion for petrochemical projects, $3.2 billion for the Pars gas fields, $3 billion for the Karun 3, Jariani, Chahar Karkheh and Gavmishan dams, $1.5 billion for the Haft Tepeh, Karun and Kesht complexes and the sugarcane industries, $7.5 billion for investment in the 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] budget law and $2.5 billion to create added value through the construction of machinery and equipment to produce goods and implement domestic projects. [.sup]2.[/] Note 34 of the First Five-Year Plan Law: The Plan and Budget Organization is required to exercise continuous supervision over the operations of the executive organizations and to submit a report to the government and the Majles commissions every six months concerning the progress of operations and their conformity with reaching the designated goals in the Five-Year Plan. [.sup]3.[/] After the approval of the first consultation on the budget bill and the setting of a cap on revenues, Mr. Mohammad Khan, minister of economic and financial affairs, again asked the Majles to bring the 1373 budget into conformity with the government's bill (RESALAT 11/17/1372 [6 February 1994]). [.sup]4.[/] Some of the decisions the Majles took with regard to the government organizations and companies were the requirement to submit a budget for 16 government and public companies to the Majles for approval, the prohibition on expanding the organizational facilities of government companies, the absolute prohibition on purchasing nonessential and nonadministrative supplies, the absolute prohibition on paying designated funds to employees working abroad, the prohibition on printing calendars, annuals and advertisements offering congratulations and condolences, the prohibition on buying or renting private aircraft, the prohibition on creating representative and administrative offices outside the country, the prohibition on using government vehicles outside office hours, and the prohibition on ostentation. [.sup]5.[/] Report from the Supreme Supervision Council in the National Auditing Organization, Tir 1372 [22 June-22 July]. [.sup]6.[/] Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani: The number of government companies is 400 units. Some 2,000 units have not yet been statistically proven for the government. (RESALAT 9/30/1372 [21 December 1993]) [.sup]7[/] and [.sup]8[/]. Report from the Supreme Supervision Council in the National Auditing Organization, Tir 1372. [.sup]9.[/] According to the latest estimate from the Plan and Budget Organization, the deficit in the general budget for 1372 is R2,139 billion, an increase over the R1,077-billion deficit in the 1371 budget deficit. IRNA (RESALAT 12/18/1372 [8 March 1994]) [.sup]10.[/] In Part 1 of this editorial the price of the dollar at the end of the year 1372 was given incorrectly. The correct price is R1,610.
