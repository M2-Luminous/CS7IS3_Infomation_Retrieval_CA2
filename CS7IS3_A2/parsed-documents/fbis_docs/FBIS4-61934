He noted that all the candidates, according to preliminary information, had collected the 100,000 signatures, required to be registered as presidential candidate. According to the same source, two would-be candidates have asked the central commission to give them more time to collect the needed signatures, but were refused. According to the legislation in force, a presidential candidate had to collect the needed signatures before 6 May. Moreover, he had to collect 100,000 "autographs" in 18 regions and not less than 1,500 in each of them. Leader of one of the Ukrainian Rukh organisations Larisa Skorik voluntarily gave up the race. According to some reports, she plans to campaign for Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukrainian president still wants the presidential elections to be put off to a later date. In addition to a large group of MP's [members of parliament], his stand is backed by the right-wing centrist parties and movements. Kravchuk plans to hold a closed meeting with them today. It is not difficult to guess that they will work out the tactics and strategy for the session of the new Ukrainian parliament, which is to open on 11 May.
