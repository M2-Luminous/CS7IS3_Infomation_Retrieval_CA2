The spillway channel is about 800 feet long, 45 feet wide, and from 6 to 30 feet deep. The (4) impoundment is about 5.6 miles long, and has a gross surface area of about 1,514 acres (AC), a gross storage capacity of 57,345 acre-feet (AF), a usable storage capacity of 20,614 (AF) and a normal pool headwater elevation range of 2,113.10 to 2,128.10 feet msl. There are no power generating units at this facility and therefore, no diversion canals or penstocks. Searsburg The Searsburg facility consists of (1) an earthfill dam structure about 50 feet high and 475 feet long with a 137 foot long concrete gravity spillway, with a crest elevation of 1749.66 feet msl, topped with 5-foot flashboards (from May 1 to October 31), (2) intake and penstock with (a) wood stave conduit 8 feet in diameter and 18,412 feet long, (b) steel differential surge tank 50 feet in diameter and 34 feet high, and (c) steel penstock 6.5 feet in diameter and 495 feet long. Bond Brook, which enters the Deerfield River at RM 58.6, is diverted into the 8-foot diameter wood stave conduit, (3) a powerhouse containing one vertical Francis hydroelectric unit with a nameplate capacity of 4,160 kW, (4) an impoundment, about 0.9 miles long, a gross storage capacity of 412 AF, a usable storage capacity range of 67 to 197 AF, and a normal pool elevation range of 1746.66 to 1754.66 feet msl, and (5) appurtenant facilities. Harriman The Harriman facility consists of (1) an earthfill dam 215.5 feet high and 1,250 feet long, (2) a storage reservoir, 9 miles long, having a surface area of about 2,039 AC, a gross storage capacity of 117,300 AF, a usable storage capacity of 103,375 AF (from elevation 1405.66 to 1491.66 feet msl), and a normal pool headwater elevation of 1449.70 to 1491.66 feet msl; (3) morning glory spillway, with sixteen gates, at a sill elevation of 1491.66 msl, topped with 6-foot-high flashboards, and (4) an intake tunnel and penstocks which convey water to the powerhouse by means of two-eight foot diameter valves. Water is conveyed through these valves to the powerhouse via (a) a 12,812-foot-long, 14-foot-diameter concrete lined horseshoe shaped tunnel, (b) a steel differential surge tank 34 feet in diameter and 184 feet high, (c) and three steel penstocks 9 feet in diameter and 620 feet long. The (5) powerhouse contains three vertical Francis hydroelectric units with a total hydraulic capacity of 1,600 cfs, and a nameplate capacity of 11,200 kW each, as well as appurtenant facilities. Sherman The Sherman facility consists of (1) an earthfill dam which is 110 feet high and 810 feet long, with a crest elevation of 1129.66 feet msl; (2) a 179-foot-long concrete gravity spillway, with a crest elevation of 1103.66 feet msl, topped with 4-foot-high flashboards which operate year-round; (3) a concrete and brick intake structure and penstock which conveys water to the powerhouse via a concrete conduit 98 feet in length with a cross-sectional area of 142 square feet, and a steel penstock 13 feet in diameter and 227 feet long; (4) an impoundment, about 2 miles long, having (a) a surface area of about 218 AC; (b) a gross storage capacity of 3,593 AF; (c) a useable storage capacity of 1,359 AF; and (d) a normal pool headwater elevation range of 1104.66 to 1107.66 feet msl. There are no diversion canals or tunnels associated with the Sherman Development. The (5) powerhouse contains (a) one vertical Francis hydroelectric unit with a capacity of 7,200 kW, and (b) other appurtenant facilities. Deerfield No. 5 The Deerfield No. 5 facility consists of (1) two dams. The Deerfield No. 5 Dam, is comprised of (a) a concrete gravity spillway about 35 feet high and 90 feet long, with a top elevation of 1,109.66 feet msl, topped with 8-foot-high hydraulic steel flap gates which maintain a normal reservoir elevation of 1027.66 feet msl, and a (b) concrete intake structure, consisting of two 8-foot wide by 7.75 foot-high sluice gates, with a sill elevation of 1002.28 feet msl, and a single 12.5 foot by 13-foot intake gate with a sill elevation of 1008.16 msl. There is a small diversion structure on Dunbar Brook which is a concrete gravity structure approximately 12 feet high and 160 feet long. The Deerfield No. 5 facility contains (2) conveyance sections of tunnel, concrete conduit, and canal totaling 14,941 feet, as well as (3) a steel penstock 10 feet in diameter and 400 feet long. The (4) impoundment is about 0.75 miles long, having a surface area of about 38 AC, a storage capacity of 118 AF, and a normal pool headwater elevation range of 1022.66 to 1026.66 feet msl. The (5) powerhouse contains one vertical Francis hydroelectric unit with a nameplate capacity of 17,550 kW and a hydraulic capacity of 1,250 cfs. The minimum turbine flow is 500 cfs. The (5) switchyard is located on River Road across from the Bear Swamp Visitor's Center and contains appurtenant facilities.
