Now only Neuquen, Rio Negro, and Cordoba Provinces have not signed the pact yet, although it is believed that the forthcoming days or hours will be decisive for them to also join the fiscal pact. The pact was signed by President Carlos Menem; the Economy and Public Works and Services Minister, Domingo Felipe Cavallo; Interior Minister Carlos Federico Ruckauf -- all of them representing the national government; and Catamarca Province Governor Arnoldo Anibal Castillo. The document says that the national government is pleased with the decision of Catamarca Province to join the fiscal pact for employment, production, and growth as evidence of the will to adopt harmonious policies to achieve the common goal for national economic growth and the reactivation of the regional economies. These are the main subjects being discussed at the top-level meeting here in Chapadmalal. We will continue reporting from Mar del Plata concerning this important meeting between governors and the national cabinet that obviously is being headed by President Carlos Menem.
