It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: "Our party achieved solid unity and cohesion a long time ago. Not resting content with this, however, it has continued to work hard to strengthen the single-hearted unity of the whole party around the leader, so that it maintains unbreakable unity and cohesion, without any vacillation even in the present complex situation." Referring to immortal feats performed by the dear leader in the struggle to strengthen the unity and cohesion of the WPK in every way, the article notes: Of primary importance in his great leadership feats is that he has made it possible to firmly defend the tradition of the proud singlehearted unity and glorify it through generations. From the first days of his leadership over the chuche cause of building the party he has subordinated all the party work and activities entirely to the work for firmly defending and exalting the tradition of singlehearted unity established by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song when he started the Korean revolution. Today when many parties of the world which had boasted of their long history have collapsed, not defending the tradition of unity, the WPK is firmly defending the tradition of singlehearted unity established in the initial period of the revolution. Herein lies the distinguished greatness and wise leadership of the dear leader. What holds an important place in his great leadership feats is that he put forward the slogan of modelling the whole party on the chuche idea and has victoriously organized and led the struggle for its realisation, thus turning the WPK into an unbreakable integrated whole of one ideology and purpose. Thus, the organisational and ideological might of the WPK has increased immensely and a new change has taken place in the ideological and moral traits of the party members. Today the entire party members think and act in accordance with the party's ideology and purpose at any time and in any place with the firm stand and view that they know nothing but the chuche idea, the revolutionary idea of the party. What holds a brilliant place in his immortal leadership feats is also that he has made the whole party an entity of loyalty and filial piety, which is pervaded by unfailing loyalty to the party and the leader, with his great benevolent politics. Regarding the idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" as his maxim from his early years, he always firmly believes in his revolutionary soldiers and people and spares nothing for them. What holds a brilliant place also in his great leadership feats is that he has made sure that the work for strengthening the unity and cohesion of the party was conducted in close combination with the struggle to effect a great upswing in all domains of the revolution and construction and, thus, its indestructible vitality was demonstrated powerfully in practice. In particular, the dear leader has seen to it that the whole party and the entire people vigorously conducted mass movements. This is a great contribution made by him to further strengthening the might of unity and cohesion of the party and effecting revolutionary changes in socialist construction. The immortal feats of the dear leader who has exalted the might of singlehearted unity of the WPK on the highest level with his extraordinary intelligence, tested leadership and popular politics of warm love and trust in only 30 years which can be regarded a moment in the long history of the revolutionary movement, will shine forever with the victorious advance of the Korean-style socialism.
