FR941110-0-00038 FR941110-0-00016 In §488.151, we proposed to define ``abuse'' as physical, psychological, or verbal interaction with a facility resident, including, but not limited to, ill treatment, physical violation, and/or other disregard of an individual which could cause or result in mild to severe, temporary or permanent mental or physical injury, harm, or, ultimately, death. ``Neglect'' would mean a failure, through inattentiveness, carelessness, or omission, of an individual, to provide timely, consistent and safe services, treatment, and care to a facility resident. ``Misappropriation of resident property'' would mean the deliberate misplacement, exploitation, or wrongful, temporary, or permanent taking or use of a facility resident's belongings or money, or both, without the resident's consent. Sections 1819(g)(1)(C) and 1919(g)(1)(C) of the Act, as added by OBRA '87 and amended by section 411(a)(5)(C) of Public Law 100&hyph;360 (MCCA), require the State, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of nursing facilities, to develop a process for the receipt and timely review and investigation of allegations of neglect and abuse and misappropriation of resident property by a nurse aide of a facility or by another individual used by the facility in providing services to residents. These sections also provide, after notification of the allegations, for the State to provide the opportunity for a hearing to the individual against whom an allegation has been made; and if the allegations are confirmed, for the State to notify the individual, the nurse aide registry, and the appropriate licensure authorities if applicable. In §488.185 (Action on complaints of neglect, abuse, and misappropriation of property), we proposed regulations that would implement these provisions. H. Investigation of Complaints of Violations of Federal Participation Requirements and Monitoring Compliance In §488.182 (Investigation of complaints of violations: Investigations and monitoring), we proposed that the survey agency be required to conduct surveys as frequently as necessary to ascertain compliance with the Federal requirements of participation or to confirm the correction of deficiencies under the cited circumstances. The proposed regulations would also incorporate the provisions of sections 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4) of the Act that a State may maintain and use a specialized team to identify, survey, gather, and preserve evidence and to administer appropriate enforcement remedies against substandard facilities. I. Disclosure of Survey Information At §488.175 (Disclosure of survey information), we proposed regulations to implement sections 1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act, as added by OBRA '87. We proposed at §488.175 to accept oral as well as written requests for information and to charge the public for the cost of retrieval, reproduction, and mailing information in accordance with regulations under the Freedom of Information/Privacy Act. The disclosing entity (HCFA, the survey agency, or the Medicaid State agency) would respond within 10 days with the requested information, if releasable and already available, or with an interim response explaining whether the information is releasable and when it will be available for release. OBRA '90 specified which information is releasable and when it is available for release. Sections 1819(g)(5)(A) and 1919(g)(5)(A) of the Act provide that each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public information concerning all surveys and certifications of NFs and SNFs, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction. We proposed to implement this provision at §488.175(d)(3).
