Is It Reality?"] [Text] The defense and security of the country has been defined by the government of Latvia as one of the priorities of state policy. In any case the incident with the arrest of the Russian generals, which threatened to develop into an interstate armed conflict, aggravated this problem. This was reflected in the draft state budget for 1994 in which additional capital was appropriated for defense needs. This money was also supposed to be used to buy weapons. DIYENA has information that the representatives of the appropriate military structures are holding such negotiations with weapons dealers of Israel and the Czech Republic. However, the production of weapons, including automatic combat weapons, can be set up in our country in a month, but it has become clear that such an expert evaluation and the basic financial calculation have not been made in the highest echelons of power. The situation is complicated by the fact that as yet there is no definite plan for arming the military structures in the state, although they are receiving weapons. Plans to buy weapons abroad apparently arose from the lack of knowledge on our own potential or from the incompetence of certain state officials. Buying weapons abroad is not simply more expensive, it is much more expensive. And it is not only the automatic rifles and pistols themselves but the high price of the ammunition for them. There is no sense in proposing Russian weapons to state structures now; that requires preliminary negotiations, the consent of Russia's government (which is very problematical), and so forth. In Russia the price of an AK-74 automatic rifle fluctuates from 220 to 190 dollars. While the firm EFA is already operating on the Latvian market on a legal basis with a license from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Latvia (the only one so far) and can supply essentially the same rifle (5.45, 5.56, or 5.65 caliber, for NATO ammunition) at 140 dollars apiece. The same can be said for pistols. Even now hunting guns such as the Sayga and Tigr carbines are offered to wholesale clients at prices lower than Russian ones. According to preliminary evaluations, it is more prestigious and profitable to reorient this firm to producing domestic weapons stamped "Made in Latvia." It is no problem for the firm to launch production in cooperation with Russian weapons makers. Especially since around 40 percent of the components can be produced locally. The EFA firm, according to official information, is already the owner of a packet of documents on several types of weapons. So creating a Latvian military-industrial complex is completely realistic, given the good will of the government and the Sejm. As for the quality of future output, the world renown of the Russian weapon can serve as its guarantee. For the fact is well known that an absolute majority of special units of the armies of NATO member countries were indeed armed with the Russian weapon. As for the need to create our own military-industrial complex, there can be no two opinions about it--the export of weapons has always been a profitable state business. In an interview on this topic, the responsible leaders of the military structures evaluated the situation which has taken shape in contradictory ways. The deputy commander of the Defense Forces of Latvia, Yevgeniy Bogdan, on the one hand, is certain that the important thing is to obtain a state order for arming the Latvian army, but such an order cannot be placed with EFA, in particular, since there is no money. It is a vicious circle. The minister of internal affairs, Girt Kristovskis, does not reject the possibility of placing a state order. Moreover, he assures us that if a private firm's weapon is competitive, including the price range, weapons for the Defense Forces and the police could be entrusted to it. But even so, from the state's standpoint, the minister does not see any savings here. So just who is ultimately able to provide an expert analysis of what is beneficial for the state? Should we obtain those weapons needed to arm the army and the police at a higher price abroad or from Latvian producers--at a lower one? Should we buy them, spending millions of dollars, or receive these same millions by selling them?
