Kim told the Labor Ministry to do its best to make this year the first year of labor-management cooperation" and make efforts to keep the peace in industrial relations and encourage low wage demands. "Pay raises reached 12 percent in stagnation last year. This pace of increase will weaken the competitiveness of industry," Kim said. The ministry should see to it that unions obey the law when they exercise their rights and encourage district labor administration offices to do their best to prevent industrial disputes, Kim said. It should also study the welfare of workers, including the expansion of stock-sharing for employees and of housing for workers, he said. Preventing industrial accidents is important because of respect for human life and stabilization of occupation, he said. "Enterprisers should have the mind that they are putting their own children to work," the president said. In a separate briefing session later in the day, Kim instructed the Communications Ministry to make creation of a super high speed information network, the communications system of the future, its top priority project in 1994. "Carry out the matters of primary concern, including selling stocks of communications businesses and selection of the business that will take the second cellular phone project justly and without any suspicion," he ordered. He instructed the ministry to internationalize the communications industry and privatise communications companies to introduce competition in the field, most of which is currently state- controlled.
