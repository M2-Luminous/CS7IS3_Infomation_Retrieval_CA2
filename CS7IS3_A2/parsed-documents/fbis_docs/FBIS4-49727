According to an official from the region's communications department, Ningxia is now cobwebbed with 8,300 kilometers of highways. The region's 292 towns and townships all have access to modern highway transportation. Meanwhile, the number of highway bridges has more than doubled. Highways and bridges, particularly the three bridges across the Yellow River, China's second largest, have greatly eased Ningxia's transportation tension. Better transportation has greatly enhanced Ningxia's market circulation. The region's rich coal, farm and sideline products have kept flowing towards the economically developed areas while construction and industrial materials from other provinces have helped modernize the region. At present, seven large transportation projects are being built with the help of the state. The 1200-meter bridge in the region's capital of Yingchuan, the most up-to-date bridge across the Yellow River, is expected to be put into operation next month. Other projects include the construction of a first class highway from Yingchuan to Guyaozi and the renovation of the second class highway from Yingchuan to Pingliang. The effort is expected to bring the total length of highways to 9,700 kilometers in six to seven years.
