FR940603-0-00131 FR940603-0-00029 One commenter suggested that NCUA should be able to put a credit union for which it is seeking a merger partner into temporary conservatorship, which would allow public notification and bidding from interested credit unions. In addition, this commenter stated that current merger procedures were left to the discretion of each regional office and suggested NCUA give serious consideration to standardizing procedures which would give all credit unions an opportunity to bid. Four commenters suggested allowing community credit unions to merge with occupational, associational, or multiple group credit unions while still continuing to serve the former fields of membership of both credit unions. Two commenters requested that with respect to mergers, the final IRPS should clarify that when a state chartered credit union is merged into a federal credit union, the federal credit union would be allowed to retain the merged state chartered credit union's select employee groups, regardless of operational area, in order to assure the vitality of the federal credit union after the merger. Another commenter agreed with this suggestion and would expand it to all mergers, including mergers between federal credit unions. 2. NCUA Board Decision The NCUA Board agrees that operational area limitations should not be an obstacle to merger of credit unions in distress situations, and believes this was Congress' intent in giving NCUA emergency merger authority. The Board has therefore interpreted Section 205(h) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1785(h)) to permit authorizing as emergency mergers what have become known since IRPS 89&hyph;1 as distress mergers. For the reasons stated earlier, however, the Board does not believe that the operational area limitation should be discarded entirely or that exercise of NCUA's conservatorship authority should become a standard part of the merger process. C. Removal of Groups 1. Comments The proposal clarified NCUA's policy on the removal of groups from a federal credit union's field of membership. Four commenters agreed with the clarification. One of these commenters suggested allowing the removal of a group when it does not respond to a federal credit union's repeated attempts to contact them. 2. NCUA Board Decision The final IRPS incorporates this suggested change. D. School Systems 1. Comments The proposal clarified that employees of different school systems and different government units do not have the same primary sponsor. Therefore, the addition of the employees of a particular school district by a federal credit union serving employees of an adjoining school district would have to be done under the select group addition procedures. Three commenters concurred with this clarification. Two commenters disagreed with this proposal. They believed that school employees in different school districts may share the same common bond and they should be added under the common bond procedure. 2. NCUA Board Decision The final IRPS deletes discussion of school systems. They will be analyzed under general common bond policy. In the vast majority of cases, different school systems will be considered different common bonds. E. Industrial Parks 1. Comments The proposal suggested modifying existing policy to permit field of membership expansions to include all employees of office complexes, industrial parks, shopping centers and similar establishments upon request from the leasing agent or similar authoritative figure. No overlap protection would be given to the expanding credit union and exclusionary clauses would be used to prevent injury to those credit unions serving a portion of these employees. Sixteen commenters favored this proposal. One commenter believed NCUA needs to identify other contacts beside the leasing agent. Three commenters opposed this modification. One commenter stated that if NCUA adopted this modification, it should ensure that no overlap protection was given to the expanding credit union and that exclusionary language was incorporated into the bylaws of the expanding credit union to prevent possible injury to other credit unions which served the same employees. One commenter stated that this modification would cause numerous overlaps in fields of memberships. 2. NCUA Board Decision The Board has decided to adopt this proposal with a modification. Although the proposal stated that exclusionary clauses would be used to protect overlapped credit unions, the Board believes that the member, in such cases, should have the ability to use the credit union which best serves his/her needs. In many cases it might be the industrial park type credit union that is more attractive to the individual. Therefore, in general, no overlap protection will be given to the credit union with the industrial park or similar complex in its charter. However, the regional director may, for safety and soundness reasons, provide overlap protection or require exclusionary clauses to prevent significant economic injury to other credit unions serving a portion of these employees. Although NCUA has not specifically identified parties other than the complex leasing agent or owner, the final IRPS provides sufficient flexibility in this matter. F. Outside Vendors 1. Comments The proposal provided guidance on the safety and soundness concerns NCUA had with a credit union using outside parties, insurance agents and car dealers, among others, to recommend select group expansions. Three commenters approved of this addition. One commenter stated that this guidance should be expanded to include discussion of indirect lending. 2. NCUA Board Decision The final IRPS includes the discussion on outside vendors and has been expanded to include indirect lending.
