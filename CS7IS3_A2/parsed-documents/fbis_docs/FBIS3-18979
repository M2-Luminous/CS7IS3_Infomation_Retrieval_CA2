An institutional government? [Maroni] I believe so. We are open to all plausible options. It will all depend on the figures that emerge from the polling booths. [League Secretary] Bossi said so yesterday: "The League and Forza Italia will form a government on their own, if the numbers are sufficient." If, on the other hand, they are not, we will never join forces with [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Fini, and therefore... [Passalacqua] Therefore what? [Maroni] I think that it is unlikely that the League and Forza Italia will obtain enough support to form a government on their own and, therefore, if we cannot do so with Fini, and we cannot form a government with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] or Communist Renewal either... then an institutional government may be the most viable option. [Passalacqua] What do you mean "we cannot form a government with the PDS"? [Maroni] Exactly what I said: We cannot form an organized government with the PDS. [Passalacqua] Will the institutional government be similar to Ciampi's government? [Maroni] Yes, I believe so. Personally speaking, I am against institutional governments. [Passalacqua] It was you, however, who launched the idea during an interview with LA REPUBBLICA. [Maroni] If need be, I will go ahead with such a government, but I will do so unwillingly, because I realize that it will be blocked by opposition vetoes. However, if the alternative is to hold new elections immediately, let us at least form this sort of government. [Passalacqua] For what purpose? [Maroni] Modifying the electoral law to make it 100 percent uninominal, reducing the number of deputies from 630 to 475. [Passalacqua] Meaning? [Maroni] If there is no choice but an institutional government, we must hold new elections, but not, say, just two months later. Let us do something positive, let us amend the electoral law by introducing a straight uninominal system for everybody, but getting rid of the proportional quota, which implies amending the Constitution. [Passalacqua] What will happen then? [Maroni] We must have everyone's support. [Passalacqua] I have the feeling that the MSI and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi are not very much in favor of this formula. [Maroni] If it is an institutional government, then it must enjoy everyone's support; otherwise, it is not an institutional government. Berlusconi and the MSI have said no, but it al depends on what such a government is called upon to do. If the prospect is holding elections with a straight uninominal system and voting directly for the prime minister, then everyone is agreed or can agree, in my opinion. [Passalacqua] You seem to be neglecting federalism in your plans. [Maroni] The MSI is light years away from this position. Forza Italia supports an important point which is that of fiscal federalism. This is not the full solution, but it is a first step. Federalism is not an instant process, the important thing is to get started. [Passalacqua] What if the institutional government were only supported by the progressives? [Maroni] It would no longer be an institutional government, but something different. When someone gets excluded, a political choice is being made. [Passalacqua] What, however, if someone decides to exclude himself? [Maroni] If that were to happen, I do not think that we could form an institutional government: It would be up to us and the Left. At that point, a left-wing minority government would be preferable. However, I must say that perhaps Berlusconi has not fully understood what an institutional government is. He is afraid that it might only mean a genuine executive power, with the PDS as part of it, governing the economy. An institutional government is something different. It is the expression of a parliament that decides to go back to the ballot boxes. [Passalacqua] And, in the event of a left-wing minority government, what would the League then do? [Maroni] It would be in the opposition. [Passalacqua] Who should be the prime minister of an institutional government? [Maroni] Not a politician, but someone guaranteeing the balance of forces. [Passalacqua] Is this the only possibility that the League can envisage for the next parliament? [Maroni] This is what I envisage in the event that the next parliament fails, that is, if we do not succeed in forming a League- Forza Italia majority. [Passalacqua] If you do, who would be the prime minister? [Maroni] Not me, I hope. It would be very hard on Italy -- I only really get going after midday. [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? The other day Bossi ruled him out... [Maroni] As a matter of fact, he did. But we also believe that the people have the last word. [Passalacqua] So we have to wait and see who wins in the proportional round? [Maroni] Something along those lines. [Passalacqua] It seems clear enough: Berlusconi will win. [Maroni] Not necessarily. You are thinking in terms of national percentages, we think in terms of geographical areas. If the League wins the first place in the north, this will carry some weight. [Passalacqua] What is the state of your current relations with Berlusconi? [Maroni] Well, I am in charge of relations with Berlusconi, and they are good. [Passalacqua] You always seem to be squabbling, though... [Maroni] My relationship with him is good, although he is worried about these differences because he thinks they may cause us to lose votes. [Passalacqua] Will you still stay together after the elections? [Maroni] I think so.
