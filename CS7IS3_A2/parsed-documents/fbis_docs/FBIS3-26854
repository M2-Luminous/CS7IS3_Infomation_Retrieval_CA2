In his speech, Mayor Huang Ju emphatically noted: We should regard the work of maintaining sustained economic development and social stability as an important matter and create a favorable environment for deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development. We should conscientiously do a good job in various aspects of work to make sure that Shanghai's economy will continue a good momentum for development this year. Huang Ju analyzed the current situation at the meeting and said: This is a crucial year for us to implement the guidelines in the "decision" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to advance the reform by establishing a socialist market economic system. This is also a decisive year for all Shanghai citizens to bring about "a change every year and a significant change in three years." Taking a look at the situation in January, we have had a good beginning: The economy continued to maintain the momentum for sustained, rapid, and healthy development and all important measures for reform, opening up, development, and the stability arranged at the beginning of this year proceeded smoothly. The work on distribution in rural areas is being carried on in full swing, and the prevention of epidemics is firmly under control. All kinds of preparatory work for market supplies during the Spring Festival are basically in place, and a revenue-sharing system between the municipality and districts and counties has been preliminarily determined. Other tasks are also proceeding properly. Speaking on the work for February, Huang Ju stressed: Under the favorable conditions, we must remain sober-minded, pay special attention to the national macroeconomic trend, and attach importance to and overcome difficulties. Proceeding from the realities in Shanghai, we should work earnestly to properly resolve difficulties and problems in the operations of the economy. Then Huang Ju put forward measures for tackling problems in opening up markets, enterprises' capital and economic returns, foreign investment and trade, and other fields. In the meantime, Huang Ju proposed that it was necessary to adhere to the unified arrangement of the state in comprehensively and earnestly implementing the important reform in financing, taxation, banking, foreign trade, and investment which has been determined by the central authorities. The work of instituting the revenue-sharing system between the municipality and districts and counties should be continued thoroughly and meticulously. The work within districts and counties should also be stressed properly, and all departments and units must take the overall situation into account and help one another like people crossing a river in the same boat, so as to constantly improve this reform, inspire the enthusiasm of both the municipality as well as districts and counties, and really put this system into practice with satisfactory results. Huang Ju stressed: Under the condition in which greater action will be taken to promote the reform of the economic system this year, we must do a good job in linking up the old system with the new one, and ensure a timely and smooth transition toward the new system, so that there is no fracture and disorder in the transition. We should minimize the influence of the replacement of the old system with the new one on the operations of economy to ensure sustained, rapid, and stable economic development [chi xu kuai su wen ding fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 4489 1353 4099 1455] in Shanghai in the first quarter of this year. Huang Ju said: Shanghai is enjoying social stability, and the basic conditions are good currently, but some new contradictions and problems also exist. Governments at various levels must make greater efforts to handle well the relations between reform, development, and stability. They should treat social stability as an important matter, proceed in their work meticulously and conscientiously, create a favorable environment for deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development; and make sure that the great number of Shanghai citizens will enjoy a happy traditional holiday in the atmosphere of stability and peace. To this end, we must first step up the rectification and management of social order to maintain public security and stability. While continuing our efforts to strictly crack down on crimes, we should strengthen the comprehensive management of social security and earnestly remain on our guard before and after the festival. Leaders at various levels should persist in going right to the forefront to organize the implementation of security measures for safe production, construction, and transportation; ensuring heat supplies; and forestalling fires, explosions, and poisonings; as well as continue to improve the emergency measures against thick fog, blizzards, and frost during the holidays. They should seriously organize the two-week campaign of straightening out the municipality's traffic, appearance, and environment to greet the Spring Festival. Departments in charge of municipal affairs and traffic management should spare no effort in bringing traffic under strict control; all districts and counties should firmly sweep away those taking up streets and setting up stalls at random and other violations of rules; and all major streets, residential areas, and commercial outlets should conscientiously carry out the measures of maintaining and ensuring a clean Shanghai. Second, we should make meticulous arrangements to ensure market supplies during the holidays and step up the construction of the "vegetable basket" project, particularly the construction of the "green vegetable project." Under the current conditions of a better shopping environment and more abundant supplies of commodities on the market, we should particularly pay attention to the demand of various levels, facilitate the masses' consumption during the holidays, and enhance the supervision of commodity prices and the management of food hygiene. Third, we should persist in properly carrying out the campaign of showing concern for the poor by seriously implementing the measures of resolving their problems and helping them and doing some helpful deeds for them in a down-to-earth manner. Governments and leading cadres at all levels must assume the responsibilities of leadership to ensure safety. In conclusion, Huang Ju said: This is a crucial point for deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining the current stability. We must seize the opportunity, concentrate our efforts on these tasks, make serious arrangements, quietly immerse ourselves in hard work, and never relax in striving for a good beginning in all aspects of work and for further progress in the work within this year. Vice Mayor Meng Jianzhu relayed to the meeting the guidelines of the national conference on the "vegetable basket" and grain, cotton, and oil project. Also attending the meeting were Vice Mayors Zhao Qizheng, Xie Lijuan, Xia Keqiang, Sha Lin, and Gong Xueping, and persons in charge of various commissions, offices, and bureaus under the municipal government, as well as district and county governments.
