The president characterized the results of his meetings in Canada and the United States as "very good." Upon returning to the country, he said: "The decision for Argentina to join NAFTA has practically been made," but "everything depends on the invitation." Menem said his meeting with Bill Clinton was "very important," characterizing his meeting with former President George Bush as "very friendly and informal." Menem said that pressure from the United States for the approval of a patents law will decrease in the near future. Menem said the government "will insist" that ruling party legislators approve the draft bill that it will submit to Congress soon. The Tango 01 plane that brought the president back to the country landed at 0630 at the military section of the metropolitan airport. Travelling with Menem were, among others, his daughter Zulema, Military Household Chief Jorge Rearte, and Media Secretary Raul Burzaco. During a brief news conference, Menem said: "A decision for Argentina to join NAFTA has practically been made," but "everything depends on the requirements or the invitation." Haiti Menem reaffirmed that Argentina will contribute to the political and economic embargo against Haiti, and that the country will send more troops to the area "if they are required for maintaining the peace." Menem added: "Congress will have to approve the decision" if Argentina is required to participate in an attempt to reinstate democracy in the Caribbean state through armed intervention or an invasion. Patents Menem said that "pressure" to approve a pharmaceutical patents law "will decrease in the near future." The president added: "The situation created by the U.S. demands has been practically overcome" following his meeting with Clinton. "In the future, the dialogue will be more fluid, and we will insist that legislators pass the draft bill with the amendments we will submit at the appropriate time," Menem said. Postponement Menem said: "The economy and labor ministers only gave their opinions" on the issue of postponing the deadline for choosing a pensions system, adding that it was an "outrage to move for a political trial just because they made comments about a bill." The president stressed that ministers made an "assessment" of people who might be temporarily incorporated into the Retirement and Pension Fund Managing Companies if by the end of the month they have not chosen a system, adding that ministers have not decided anything because "the person who will decide on the matter is the president of the Republic." "I do not think a minister can be tried in Congress just because he gave his opinion on a draft bill that has not been approved yet," Menem said.
