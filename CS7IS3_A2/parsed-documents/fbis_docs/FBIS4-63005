But with the formation within the president's office of a council on personnel policy -- whose membership includes the chairmen of both houses of the Federal Assembly -- this situation has changed, Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists today. The journalists asked him to comment on the resignation of Sergey Shakhray and to explain how this might affect policy on interethnic problems. [Shumeyko] I only hope that with Yegorov's appointment to this post all these problems can move on from the phase of theoretical assessment to the phase of practical solutions, quite independent of the interests of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]. [Suntsov] New Minister Nikolay Yegorov hails from the same area as Vladimir Shumeyko. He is Shumeyko's man. Vladimir Shumeyko commented on this positive fact. He said that he had participated in the formation of the government on one single occasion, in December 1992. On that occasion, on instructions from the president, he helped Viktor Chernomyrdin draw up the government list. [Shumeyko] Since then I have not taken part in the formation of the government. As far as my relations with the president are concerned, they are exactly as close as they need to be in order to facilitate joint work on affairs of state. [Suntsov] Journalists also asked about the possibility that former Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov, who is now a deputy in the State Duma, might become chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. That is unlikely to happen in the near future Vladimir Shumeyko said. The chairman of the Federation Council feels there is no need at the moment for emergency measures to boost the economy. Only culture and science need active support from the authorities, he said. Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists about bills sponsored by the government and Federation Council that envisage assistance for newspapers and publishing houses. Whereas the government plans to reduce profits tax by 50 percent and VAT to 6 percent, the Shumeyko draft proposes the abolition of all levies on the press, except for commercial and pornographic publications.
