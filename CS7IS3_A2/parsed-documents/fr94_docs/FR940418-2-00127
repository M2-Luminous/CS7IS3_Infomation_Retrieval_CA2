FR940418-2-00127 FR940418-2-00073 The Index will be maintained by the Amex and will contain at least thirty component stocks at all times. Pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b), the Amex may change the composition of the Index at any time in order to reflect more accurately the composition and track the movement of the Hong Kong stock market. Any replacement component stock must also meet the component stock listing and maintenance standards as discussed above. If the number of Index component securities in the Index falls below thirty, no new option series based on the Index will be listed for trading unless and until the Commission approves a rule filing pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act reflecting such change. At the close of the market on February 28, 1994, the average closing price of the component stocks of the Index was HK$30.70 (US$3.97), with the highest price stock closing at HK$114.00 (US$14.76) and the lowest price stock closing at HK$5.85 (US$0.76). On that same date, of the thirty component stocks included in the Index, four closed at prices lower than HK$7.50, or approximately US$1.00. As of February 28, 1994, the total market capitalization of the Index component stocks was US$222.214 billion. 17 17 Based on the February 28, 1994 exchange rate of HK$7.726 to US$1.00. C. Calculation and Settlement of Index The Hong Kong Option Index is a capitalization-weighted index the value of which is calculated my multiplying the price of each component security (in Hong Kong dollars) by the number of shares outstanding of each such security, adding the sums and dividing by the current Index divisor. The Amex has set the Index level at 202.628 at the close of the market on March 10, 1994. The Amex calculated the Index level by taking the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index, which was at a level of 506.57 on March 10, 1994, and multiplying it by 0.40. 18 18 See amendment No. 2, supra note 3. When the Amex first proposed listing and trading options based on the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index, the Amex intended to use the same index level as that used for warrants on that index. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33308, supra note 4. Currently, the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index is at a level of about 500. See Amendment No. 2, supra note 3. Because the HKSE does not operate during the Amex's trading hours, the Amex calculates the Index once each day based on the most recent official closing price of each Index component security as reported by the HKSE. The Amex will administer the Index, making such adjustments to the divisor as may be necessary in light of stock splits, stock replacements, or other corporate actions which would cause a discontinuity in the Index value. The Index value is being published through the Exchange's market data system and will be made available to vendors. 19 19 For a more detailed description of Index pricing, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33036, supra note 5. D. Expiration and Settlement The Exchange's proposed options on the Index are to be European-style ( i.e., exercises are permitted at expiration only) and cash-settled. Standard option trading hours for broad-based index options (9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. New York time) will apply. Options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an option series will normally be the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (normally at Thursday). Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day. The exercise settlement value for all of the Index's expiring options will be calculated based upon the most recent official closing price of each of the component securities as reported by the HKSE on the last trading day prior to expiration.
