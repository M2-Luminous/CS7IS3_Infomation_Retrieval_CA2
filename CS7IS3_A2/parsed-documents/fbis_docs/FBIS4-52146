The source told KYODO NEWS SERVICE the embassy has not confirmed any contacts between Ozawa and Russian politicians at least during the day but said he is unsure whether they were made at night. "Only his wife (Kazuko) and bodyguard accompanied him," he said. "The embassy was told that he came here to investigate the political and economic situation." "However, in actuality, he appears to have come here for the sake of sightseeing and to take a rest," he said. Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito and the arch ally of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. He is credited with playing a key part in sweeping Hata to power. In March 1991, Ozawa, then secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, flew to Moscow for talks with then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on such issues as the dispute on the sovereignty over four Russian-held islands off Japan's northern shore.
