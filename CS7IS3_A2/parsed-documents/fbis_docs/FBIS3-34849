Afghan Reconcilian Committee Chairman Jalaloddin Haqqani told AL-HAYAH yesterday that the truce in Kabul "will begin at 0500 Tuesday [15 February] and will last for four days." Haqqani, who heads a committee consisting of some 100 commanders and ulema, added: "We have, from both sides, written assurances of adherence to the cease-fire and cooperation for the sake of probing the main causes of the crisis." Asked by AL-HAYAH if the cease-fire would also apply to the Uzbek forces against whom the Afghan president declared jihad and refused to agree a cease-fire with, Haqqani said: "There will be a cease-fire between the camps of Rabbani and Hekmatyar." He reaffirmed that both parties to the conflict had agreed to a truce. Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar told AL-HAYAH that "the Higher Coordination Council has agreed to a cease-fire provided it is used to find a mechanism for the settlement of the current crisis, as follows: Unconditional resignation of the president (Rabbani), declaration of Kabul a demilitarized zone, removal of the armed units from it within a week, and the formation of a provisional government within two weeks." [passage omitted] Haqqani made an appeal through AL-HAYAH to the Islamic governments and organizations to provide urgent aid for the Afghan capital. Emotionally, he said: "The situation is extremely tragic, with scores of families without shelter, clothes, or food. The Muslims must help in this critical period."
