FR940927-2-00106 FR940927-2-00072 2. The alleged problem appears to be the result of improper maintenance and repair, rather than a manufacturing defect. 3. The Cougar transmission dipstick, dipstick tube, and sealing system are typical of other peer vehicles. 4. If an owner uses reasonable care and follows the manufacturer's instructions in the vehicle's owner manual, the seal on the transmission dipstick will prevent spillage or escape of transmission fluid. 5. There is no evidence that the transmission dipstick will not stay in place once properly inserted into the tube. However, the dipstick could be left loose by an inattentive owner or mechanic, regardless of the presence of a retaining device. In consideration of the available information, it is concluded that there is not a reasonable possibility that an order concerning the notification and remedy of a safety-related defect in relation to the petitioner's allegations would be issued at the conclusion of an investigation. Further commitment of resources to determine whether a safety-related defect trend exists does not appear to be warranted. Therefore, the petition is denied. Authority: 49 U.S.C. 30162; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. Issued on: September 22, 1994. William A. Boehly, Associate Administrator for Enforcement.
