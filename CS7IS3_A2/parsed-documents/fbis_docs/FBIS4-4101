Patten added, however, that his door remains wide open for talks with Lu, who heads the Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, despite the shrill Sino-British row over greater democracy in the British colony which reverts to China in 1997. Lu has avoided coming to Hong Kong since January 1992, in a pointed reminder to London of Beijing's contempt for Patten's decision to press ahead with pre-1997 electoral reforms without China's blessing. "Today, director Lu Ping has written to say that his schedule is so busy in Hong Kong that he won't on this occasion be able to visit and to have discussions," Patten told local reporters. However, the governor -- who last met Lu in Beijing in late 1992 -- added that the tone of Lu's message appeared to suggest that a meeting might yet be possible at some later date. "I'm prepared to cross any street, open any door, shake any hand and talk to anyone if it's in the interests of Hong Kong," the governor added. Lu will be in Hong Kong for next week's introduction of Bank of China banknotes in the territory, and for meetings of two sub-groups of the Preliminary Working Committee, a Beijing-appointed body that is paving the way for the resumption of Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Lu is also to make a major speech to Hong Kong businessmen next Friday.
