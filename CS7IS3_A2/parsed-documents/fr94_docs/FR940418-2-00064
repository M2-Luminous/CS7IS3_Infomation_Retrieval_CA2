FR940418-2-00064 FR940418-2-00024 3. Williams Natural Gas Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;338&hyph;000] Take notice that on April 6, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;338&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to install a tap, measuring, regulating and appurtenant facilities to deliver transportation gas to Mercado Gas Services (Mercado) in Texas County, Oklahoma, under WGN's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;479&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, WNG seeks authorization to install a 2-inch tap on the Guymon-Blackwell 26-inch pipeline and construct measuring, regulating and appurtenant facilities in the Northwest Quarter (NW/4) of Section 28, Township 5 North, Range 16 ECM, Texas County, Oklahoma. WNG says that the gas delivered by WNG to Mercado would be used in a hog processing plant. WNG states that the annual volume delivered is estimated to be approximately 31,400 Dth the first year and would remain constant over the next five years. WNG submits that the peak day volume is estimated to be 400 Dth and would also remain constant for five years. WNG states that the total volume to be delivered to Mercado would not exceed the total volume authorized prior to this request. WNG further states that this change is not prohibited by an existing tariff and it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries specified without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers. WNG says that the estimated cost of construction is $19,790, which would be reimbursed by Mercado. WNG indicates that Mercado would also reimburse WNG for associated income taxes. Comment date: May 23, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing. G.

If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
