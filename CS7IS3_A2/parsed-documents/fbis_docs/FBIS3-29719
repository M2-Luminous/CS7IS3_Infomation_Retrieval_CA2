"Clearly, (Super) 301 is, as is well known, an option," White House Counselor David Gergen said, referring to the lapsed trade law that allows Washington to take a strong hand in retaliating against unfair trade practices. Gergen, speaking briefly with a group of Japanese reporters, said Clinton has yet to make a decision on what measures Washington will take following the collapse of top-level trade talks. The president "will sit down with his advisers in the next few days to talk about that," Gergen said. Clinton collided head-on with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in a meeting in Washington last Friday on ways to reduce Japan's trade surplus and open up Japanese markets to foreign goods. Clinton vowed Thursday to pursue an aggressive policy to open markets he described as the "most closed" among industrial nations. While gearing up for a new offensive in increasingly acrimonious trade disputes with Tokyo, the Clinton administration also took steps this week to sell its trade policy directly to Japanese business leaders. Gergen said the White House invited half a dozen top Japanese business executives to meet with senior Clinton aides Tuesday to send a message to Japan that Washington is not seeking "numerical quotas" in promoting imports to Japan. "We hope that they can help more people in Japan understand the administration's position was not (after) numerical quotas. We had a good discussion about that," Gergen said. Among the Clinton aides who attended the hourlong meeting were White House National Economic Council Director Robert Rubin and his Deputy W. Bowman Cutter, Treasury Deputy Secretary Roger Altman and White House Economist Alan Blinder. The Japanese business executives, led by Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Japan's Fuji Xerox Co., were in Washington for a meeting with a U.S. business group involved in trade with Japan.
