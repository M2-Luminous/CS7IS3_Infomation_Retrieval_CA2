Regarding the recommendation that the files on people arrested by the Honduran Armed Forces be opened, he said: [Begin recording] [Santos] I am going to tell you something: Leo Valladares never said that. Valladares said that at one point he requested some information that definitely reached him a little late. That is what I understand. [Unidentified reporter] But when he says he would rather have you provide this information, this tacitly means that you did not want to give the information to him. [Santos] Look, there was an exchange of some letters. I understand that his letters were answered by Colonel [Herbert] Munguia and by the general auditor of the Armed Forces. Some information was provided to Leo Valladares by the chief of the Armed Forces. [end recording] The public relations director was asked whether the Armed Forces are willing to provide information regarding the possible participation of Armed Forces members in cases of missing persons. [Begin Santos recording] Look, there is something basic in all of this. We definitely understand and acknowledge the work of Leo Valladares. If there have been some misunderstandings, I think it has been strictly due to a lack of communication. I understand this is a report that was presented to the Honduran president by the human rights ombudsman. Valladares has compiled a large amount of information, and he requested that legal steps be continued to once and for all resolve the problem of missing persons. We, the Armed Forces, are waiting to see the report. I think it would be hasty on my part to give you an official opinion on the report because I know that you are just now reporting on it. We are obviously part of this country's Executive Branch, and legal channels must be followed. We will wait and see what the courts will do, because they are the appropriate institutions to deal with this. [end recording] Santos Aguilar justified the current Armed Forces chief's absence from the country. He left yesterday before this report was presented. In the report, he was mentioned as head of Battalion 3-16 in 1984. [Begin recording] [Santos] Like I said, if General Discua is not in the country, well... [pauses] As members of the military, we divide our activities into two groups to avoid neglecting our responsibilities in the country. I understand that the commander in chief was here up until yesterday, which was the day when the individuals who were to take over today reported for duty. At this time, General Andino, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is acting as head of the military institution. On another topic, I heard Leo Valladares' recommendation on the appointments of some officers. You can be sure that whenever any individual is summoned by the courts, the Armed Forces will have nothing to hide. [Reporter] When you say the Armed Forces are under the Executive Branch, does this mean that the next administration will have to decide whether those who led these battalions are responsible for the cases of missing people? [Santos] No, I am not saying that. I am speaking about strictly legal aspects. The Armed Forces are part of the country's Executive Branch and appropriate channels exist through the president for specific situations. [Reporter] As members of the Armed Forces, how willing are you to turn over to the courts individuals who are linked to the cases of missing persons? [Santos] Let us wait and see what the courts of justice say in this regard. [end recording]
