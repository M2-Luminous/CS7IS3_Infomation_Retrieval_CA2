FBIS4-10670 "drlat073_a_94015" FBIS-LAT-94-073 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Caribbean Cuba State Licensed Taxi Drivers Interviewed State Licensed Taxi Drivers Interviewed FL1304160494 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 2300 GMT 12 Apr 94 FL1304160494 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Second of a series of reports by journalist Carlos Santana Ojeda on unlicensed private taxi drivers in Havana; date not given -- recorded] [Text] [Santana] Yesterday, I presented the reasons and means of operation used by drivers of private cars who taxi for tourists. Today we will hear from their counterparts. We will hear the feelings of the Turistaxi drivers with whom I spoke to learn how they are affected by the illegal activity of these so-called pirates. [First taxi driver] A lot. They are affecting our work. [Santana] Why? [First driver] Because they do whatever they want and charge less than we do. It affects us in regard to the fare because our fare is higher. When the tourist sees that we charge 15, and that they charge five or seven, they go with them, as can be expected. [Santana] How is it with prices and distances? [First driver] Our distances are gauged by a taxi meter, which begins with one peso or one dollar. Each kilometer is 35 cents. [Santana] Are you also a taxi driver here, comrade? [Second taxi driver] Yes. [Santana] How much are you affected by their activities? [Second driver] I would say our business is affected by 50 percent in one day. [Santana] Do many tourists use your services? [Second driver] Well, this tourist who is approaching us, for example, is Mexican and is being controlled by these illegal drivers because he has come to Cuba several times. That tourist likes to visit the prostitutes, and since he has been here before, already has directions. As a matter of fact, they even pick him up at the airport. We can no longer count on that tourist's business. [Santana] According to some interviews I had yesterday, these illegal drivers say they give better service to the tourists. Is that true? [Second driver] That is not true because we are prepared. We have even been trained. We are at the political level in language and tourism. We have gone to school for that. [Santana] Is the tourist more secure with you than with those illegal drivers? [Second driver] You want to know if the tourist is safer with us? With us, the tourist's life is insured. If anything happens to the tourist while he is with us, he has no problem because his life is insured. Furthermore, if the car breaks down, within seconds he has another car because we have a plant. These cars are new and are much more comfortable than those of the illegal drivers. [Santana] Do you wait for the tourist to come to you or do you go to the tourist? [Second driver] Well, we are lined up in front of the hotel. When the tourist leaves the hotel, he can see our cars, which are right in front of the hotel. What happens is that the illegal drivers enter the lobby. If he can enter, he controls the tourist and we can no longer count on that tourist. As a matter of fact, this type of illegal activity, which has increased lately, has, or we believe has, a contact in the hotel. They enter the hotel, make contact with the tourist, make an offer to the tourist, which is half of what we charge. The tourist does not think about accidents or any other situation, that if anything were to happen they would not be able to claim anything from the state. On the other hand, if they are in one of our taxis, they can demand insurance from the state. Besides, we are professional drivers who are prepared for this type of work. [Santana] How do you think this situation can be resolved -- by lowering the fares of the taxis? [Third taxi driver] We believe the state must take measures regarding this situation. What kind of measures? Not by fining Cuban pesos because after making the conversion, if they are fined 100 pesos, it is $1. I therefore believe they should be fined in hard currency because they are working with hard currency. The first time, they should be fined $50; and the second time, their car should be confiscated. There are many problems here regarding the problem with cars. [Santana] In this case, how would the problem be solved if this action were not taken? [Third driver] The problem of our fares is already being analyzed. It is being reviewed to be more competitive. [Fourth taxi driver] I believe our fares are a little high in comparison with capitalist countries. The tourism that comes here is generally from Latin America. In Canada, for example, a tourist is charged a high fare, but the salaries and the living standards of those countries is superior to Latin American countries. [Santana] Has this been discussed? [Fourth driver] Yes, all this was mentioned at the workers parliament. [Santana] How do you and how will you defend your work from the illegal drivers? [Fourth driver] We have already spoken to them and told them they cannot work here because it is affecting our work and is affecting the state. While we see them around here, they are going to have serious problems with us. We are not going to allow that here. [Third driver] I wanted to point out that the problem that our comrade mentioned of lowering the fares -- because they are a bit high -- does not mean that they are going to be lowered to compete with those illegal drivers, because in this case there is no competition. We are a serious activity and they are people who are not serious in this aspect. Furthermore, they push propaganda. They tell tourists: Do not ride in those cars because they are too expensive and [words indistinct] by the police. They even do that. It is unfair and incorrect. [Santana] Well, that is the opinion of the drivers of Turistaxi regarding the activity of the so-called pirates. But what do the tourists and the people on the street think about this? That will be covered in our next report. Thank you.
