General Burlakov's Press Conference"] [Text] "The former political leaders of the ex-USSR -- Gorbachev and Shevardnadze -- signed in October 1990 understandings on pulling out the Western Group of Forces [WGF] without giving a thought or consideration to the future of tens of thousands of families of officers who had no apartments, and who are to return to their country," Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the WGF, stated today in a press conference in Berlin. He pointed out that despite the difficulties involved in pulling out history's biggest group of forces located on the territory of a foreign country to their homeland in a short time frame, this "uniquely complex" task is being tackled according to an agreed schedule. To date, 90 percent of servicemen, military hardware, and supplies have been withdrawn to Russia. The main problem, according to the WGF chief commander, remains as before a considerable -- up to 40 percent -- lag in the construction of housing for WGF servicemen in Russia behind the rate of the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany. The commander in chief did not hide his dissatisfaction with and great anxiety at the fact that the total number of apartments in Russia for WGF servicemen yet to be completed is 47,000. That includes, in almost equal shares, the housing that was supposed to be constructed with 7.8 billion Deutsche marks (25,000 apartments) and with the money provided from the budget of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry (22,000 apartments). Another problem is the rising crime around WGF garrisons in Germany: Attacks on Russian servicemen by emigrants "of all stripes," as the chief commander put it, and from German neo-Nazi hooligans, have not stopped.
