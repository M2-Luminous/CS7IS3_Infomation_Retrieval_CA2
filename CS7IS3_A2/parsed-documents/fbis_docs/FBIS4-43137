Wilson represents one side of U.S. policy: the good will to improve the world (by modeling it, if possible, along the lines of the U.S. example). What Clinton represents is still uncertain. In any case, it is not the other side of U.S. world policy -- the tough superpower policy, oriented toward its own interests. Given his predisposition as a left-liberal Democrat, Clinton should rather be counted among the idealistic school; in reality, the characteristic feature of Clinton's foreign policy line is probably the absence of any foreign policy line. So far, he has exercised the leadership role that his office unavoidably forces on him with reticence and almost with indifference. He hesitates to use the power of the United States seriously -- even if the matter at hand is a serious threat. Obviously, Clinton has real problems with power. The explanation for that lies in his background as a member of the anti-Vietnam generation. His formative years were characterized by the disproportionate, senseless, and ultimately unsuccessful use of U.S. means of power. Clinton experiences the abuse of U.S. power, not its use for a just cause. The experience of the D-Day celebrations this week may have had a bit of a correcting effect. One cannot think of any more honorable cause in history than the defeat of a real empire of evil, as Hitler's Germany was. Without the United States this would not have been possible, and Stalin, too, would have had to accept an arrangement with Hitler. The question is how important Europe still is for Clinton's administration. Assurances, also in his speech in Paris, are one thing, real inclinations and interests are another. Clinton's people have repeatedly announced a shift of their focus from Europe to Asia. This need not yet worry the Europeans; the focal points of this administration are constantly shifting. On the other hand, the "ad-hoc-ery" of Clinton's team is certainly extremely worrying. Whenever the Americans believed that they could neglect Europe, things developed toward a disaster. In World War I, the Americans saved Europe from a German victory. Their fresh troops, who reinforced the completely exhausted English and French troops on the Western Front, prevented the success of the last great German offensive. In 1918, the United States withdrew, however, from Europe into total isolation -- to the detriment of Europe, which succumbed to the unchecked aggression of Hitler's Germany and had to be liberated again with enormous sacrifice. This time the U.S. leadership was smarter: It not only supported reconstruction with its Marshall Plan, but also repulsed the Soviet attempts to take in those countries where the Red Army was not deployed: In 1948, the Berlin blockade, military support for the anticommunists in the Greek civil war, support for Tito's anti- Moscow course, financial support for the democratic parties in France and Italy; in 1950, support for the anticommunist forces at the half-hearted putsch attempt in Vienna and eastern Austria; in the late 1950's and early 1960's, the repulsion of various crises in Berlin; in the late 1970's, rearmament against the threat of Soviet intermediate-range missiles. The U.S. shield kept the Russians out and -- what is perhaps more important -- prevented the Soviet Union from being able to force the free Europeans into submission by means of a military threat. The U.S. interests certainly played a role in this: If the Soviet Union had received full and unhindered access to Western technology and Western capital through an intimidated West Europe, it would not have lagged behind so enormously in its development. The internal collapse could have been prevented or at least delayed for a long time (the USSR was able to survive as long as it did only through extensive industrial espionage). Basically, even Stalin and his successors were not so interested in getting West Europe physically under the control of the Red Army. They would have been satisfied with turning West Europe and, above all, West Germany into a client state, included in the Soviet system of exploitation. It was in the Americans' strategic interest to prevent the Soviet Union from grabbing West Europe's potential and thus from becoming a far more dangerous rival. And today it is in the interest of the United States to prevent the same thing from happening in connection with Russia. The question is whether the path that Clinton is taking in this connection, namely integrating Russia as much as possible into European policy, is the correct one. In Bosnia, Russia has already been given a veto right. Perhaps things could not have been done differently. However, Clinton's readiness to extend the so-called NATO Partnership for Peace to Russia is being viewed with concern. During his visit to NATO headquarters, Russian Defense Minister Grachev tried to bring NATO under the supreme authority of the CSCE, which would mean a de facto veto right for the Russians over NATO. It would be, as Henry Kissinger warns, "the emasculation of NATO, which has been a goal of Russian foreign policy for 45 years." Clinton's seeming readiness to give Russia special status in NATO is alarming, not only to tough Realpolitik experts like Kissinger but even more so to the East European reform states, which finally want to get out of Moscow's sphere of influence. This is so important because NATO is the decisive and almost only institutional link between the United States and Europe. If NATO becomes a watered-down association with a Russian veto, then one has to be extremely worried about everything that D-Day meant 50 years ago.
