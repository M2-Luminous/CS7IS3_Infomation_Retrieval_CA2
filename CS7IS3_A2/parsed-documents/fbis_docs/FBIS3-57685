Speaking about Russian-Lithuanian trade and economic relations at a news conference in Vilnius on Thursday, Slezevicius also expressed "regret that Moscow has so far failed to respond to our note on the enactment of the agreement on most-favoured nation status in trade which was signed in November last year during Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Vilnius." The Lithuanian premier also said that the talks on Russian military transit from the Kaliningrad region to Russia through Lithuania are moving very slowly.
