FBIS3-48891 "dreas020__a94034" FBIS-EAS-94-020-A Document Type:Daily Report 31 January 1994 ANNEX Japan * Ministry of Foreign Affairs Officials Profiled 942B0017A Tokyo KANKAI in Japanese Oct 93 pp 116-127--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0017A Tokyo KANKAI Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by KANKAI editorial staff] [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is now being buffeted by tumult from at home and abroad. Internationally, along with the end to the East-West Cold War, the building of a new international order is becoming a pressing issue. At home, the 1955 order centering on both the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) has ended and an effective method is being sought to proceed with foreign policy under a ruling coalition composed of eight parties. The following is an introduction to the officials that are proceeding with Japanese foreign policy under the most difficult set of circumstances since the war. Minister and Parliamentary Vice Minister On 1 August, MOFA carried out its greatest structural reform since the war. The two pillars of structural reform were the abolition of the United Nations Bureau along with the establishment of the General Foreign Affairs Policy Bureau and a change of the mantle for the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau into the International Information Bureau. Along with this, personnel changes were carried out on a ministry-wide scale for the most part, including those overseas. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Tsutomu Hata is leading MOFA in this difficult situation. As the head of the Shinseito Party, he contributed to the victory of the non-LDP forces in the general election and the establishment of a coalition administration centering on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He personally denies it, but according to those around him, it is said that he desired the appointment to foreign minister at an early date and ultimately fulfilled his desire. He presents a slightly different foreign policy ideology from that of foreign ministers of the LDP regime era. For instance, he advocates expressing general responsibility for World War II and refraining from visits to Yasukuni Shrine on the 15 August anniversary of the end of the war. The parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs, who assists the foreign minister, is Shozo Azuma of the Komeito. It is said that the appointment of the parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs from the Komeito was due to the strong desire by that party and the desire was realized with the appointment of Azuma. Ironically, his electoral district is the Tokyo No. 6 District, the same area as former parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs, Koji Kakizawa, and it can be called a personnel change due to an awareness of activities in the era of Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Kakizawa. Administrative Vice Minister, Deputy Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Chief of Protocol Supporting the two politicians, Tsutomu Hata and Shozo Azuma, are Administrative Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Kunihiko Saito (passed foreign service exam in 1957, same for below) and the following foreign service officers: Saito, the administrative vice minister following previous Vice Minister Hisashi Owada, has superior ability that was noted early on in his career. He normally followed after Owada and studied his foreign policy methods, as he was councilor for the Treaties Bureau when Owada was director of that bureau and was deputy vice minister for foreign affairs (in charge of political affairs) when Owada was administrative vice minister for foreign affairs. However, Saito's foreign policy methods are a contrast to Owada's. For example, Owada diligently looked over documents himself and corrected them in ink in small letters. As opposed to Owada who was not satisfied unless he participated in everything himself, Saito is a rare type among recent senior officials,who " leaves the work to subordinates but takes the responsibility upon himself." Naturally, Saito is popular among subordinates. In his days as director of the Treaties Bureau, once Diet deliberations had stopped as a result of his replies and when the evening came, he left the office promptly. As might be expected, his subordiantes were flustered at that. It is a fact that the sense of tension in the ministry in the Owada era has dissolved with the appointment of Saito, and the atmosphere has become animated. There is obviously a lot of anxiety under a composite administration, but he does not seem perturbed, saying "The continuation of foreign policy is included in the consensus of the eight parties, and I am not worried at all. I am confident that policy decisions will be made so as not to lose opportunities." Following No. 1 Saito on the administrative side are the two No. 2 deputy vice ministers for foreign affairs, Hiroshi Fukuda (1959) and Koichiro Matsuura (1958). Fukuda is in charge of political affairs, and Matsuura is in charge of economic affairs. These two are called "vice minister class." After serving as private secretary to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone (at the time) and director of the Treaties Bureau, Fukuda served abroad as ambassador to Malaysia for about two years and nine months. The major jobs for the deputy vice minister for foreign affairs in charge of political affairs are consulting with the vice minister class of major countries and preparing discussions on political issues at summits. His schedule is rather hard and among senior councilors, for example, some are forced to retire from overwork due to consecutive trips abroad. Experience as a private secretary to the prime minister and director of the Treaties Bureau is useful in the administrative work of a deputy vice minister for foreign affairs, but nevertheless, a hiatus of two years and nine months is big. Therefore, he currently is receiving discourses on each topic from administrative authorities. For the present, it seems that preparations for the Japan visit by Russian President Yeltsin, scheduled for the middle of October, will be the test case. Matsuura scored further points by shepherding the success of the Tokyo Summit in July. After enjoying hiking in the Northern and Southern Alps on a brief summer vacation, he will undertake U.S.-Japancomprehensive economic talks from September on. With this as his final job, he will be transferred to an ambassadorship in the European area at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994. The chief of protocol, Junichi Nakamura (1957), also will be transferred to an ambassadorship after the Europe visit of the emperor and empress in September. It has been informally decided that his successor will be Makoto Watanabe (1958), director of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The private secretary to the minister of foreign affairs is Yoichi Nishizawa, who is young, but enjoys confidence of Hata.. Lately, there is the trend in MOFA for the minister's secretary for political affairs to become the private secretary to the minister of foreign affairs. Kaoru Ishikawa (1971) substantially serves as private secretary in handling the private secretary administrative work of the foreign minister. He was appointed from the position of chief of the First West Europe Division, and there had been a move for his appointment in the era of the previous Foreign Minister Kabun Muto. However, just when he had begun making his rounds of greetings, the former appointee was retained in his post by the voice of authority of former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe. He was thoroughly prepared for his appearance this time. He is a second-generation foreign service officer following his father who served as ambassador to Kuwait. He resembles his father in both spoken and written eloquence. Another person who handles the private secretary administrative work of the foreign minister is Kazuhiro Fujimura (1982), a young foreign service hopeful with a promising future. Next, let's look at the new major foreign affairs lineup after the August personnel changes by bureau. Minister's Secretariat The director of the Secretariat is Sadayuki Hayashi (1959). He had the strong trust of the previous vice minister, Owada, and will be promoted to deputy vice minister for foreign affairs in charge of economic affairs, the successor to Matsuura, at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994. It is said to be "a parting present personnel change" by Owada. Since he has a sincere personality and is the type who carries out instructions silently, he is highly rated by superiors. Saito also cited "Hayashi's remaining in his post for at least a half year" as a condition for accepting the vice ministership. The press secretary, who is the spokesman for MOFA, is Kisuke Terada (1961). He was appointed from the position of director of the Central and South American Affairs Bureau, and because of his experience as private secretary to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, chief of the Press Division, and councilor in charge of the press and public relations, he has many acquaintances among the press-related people at home and abroad. He is perhaps the most suitable person for the position. His ambition is modestly "not to have misreadings by press-related people," but he knows the vital points of the job. Incidentally, Terada is an expert in Spanish. He even has the ability to serve as an interpreter for heads of state conferences. Moreover, he is also skillful respectively in English, which every foreign service officer can speak, and in French due to his wife's being French. The press secretary for foreign affairs has a news conference with foreign special correspondents in Tokyo twice a week in the news conference room on the third floor of MOFA, and the birth of a press secretary proficient in languages has been favorably received by foreign reporters. The general councilor in charge of the Diet is Atsushi Hatanaka (1964). It seems that there is considerable confusion on Diet measures because the LDP has become an opposition party, a "strong opposition party" has appeared, the ruling party is a coalition of eight parties, and the SDPJ, which had been far from the government foreign affairs, security, and defense policies up to now, has become a party in power. The councilor in charge of the press and public relations is Sadaaki Numata (1965). He is an expert in English and previously served as an interpreter at U.S.-Japan summit conferences. Like Terada, foreign special correspondents in Tokyo have come to rely on him. The chiefs of the major divisions in the Minister's Secretariat are Rokuzen Nishimura (1966), chief of the General Affairs Division; Shotaro Taniuchi (1968), chief of the Personnel Division; and Ichiro Fujisaki (1968), chief of the Financial Affairs Division. Among them, Nishimura is a foreign service officer who joined MOFA from Sophia University and was appointed chief of the General Affairs Division after serving as chief of the Press Division and counselor for the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau. At MOFA, the chief of the General Affairs Division, Minister's Secretariat, is a "pivotal" post in charge of coordination with the prime minister's official residence and the various ministries and agencies. There will be many instances when he is appointed to a bureau director position in the future. In his days as counselor for the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau, Nishimura achieved results by undertaking, without sleep or rest, the problem of fund cooperation ($13 billion) for realizing peace and security in the Gulf region. Japan went so far as to increase taxes to implement the fund. He has become the personal adviser on foreign affairs for the prime minister due to school ties with Prime Minister Hosokawa. It has been a characteristic of Nishimura that in undertaking foreign policy problems, he has tried to make a fresh approach that is different from ordinary foreign service officers' approaches. Insofar as Taniuchi served as a private secretary in the days when Nobuo Matsunaga was administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, he is an affable person and also does his work well. Having passed the foreign service test in 1968, he probably is a future candidate for vice minister, along with Hitoshi Tanaka mentioned later (chief of the General Affairs Division, General Foreign Policy Bureau). Fujisaki is the son of Kazusato Fujisaki, former director of the MOFA Treaties Bureau, who served as a supreme court justice. There are many second-generation foreign service officers within MOFA. Chikahito Harada (1973), who became chief of the Press Division in the August personnel changes, was a selection that upset the expectations of many people. Previously, a senior foreign service officer of the division chief class has been appointed the chief of the Press Division. Since Harada, the youngest of the division chiefs, was appointed, those within MOFA were surprised. Before returning as chief of the Status of U.S. Forces Agreement Division of the North American Affairs Bureau at the MOFA, Harada served as secretary in charge of public relations at the Japanese Embassy in Russia and was popular among the Japanese press corp in Moscow. In his days as chief of the Status of U.S. Forces Agreement Division, he sought understanding and cooperation in the maintenance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty while exchanging drinks with the mayors of cities, towns, and villages embracing U.S. military bases throughout Japan. He was familiar with "the scene,"a rare attribute for a foreign service officer. This record of performance was seen in his appointment to chief of the Press Division, which taxes one's nerves due to the association with press-related people. Harada's language of expertise is Russian. The Japan visit of President Yeltsin in October probably will be the first opportunity to show his skill. General Foreign Policy Bureau The August structural reform was inaugurated with a flourish of trumpets. MOFA has been a vertical administration with the Asian Affairs Bureau, North American Affairs Bureau, and European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau, but the reason this bureau has been established is to deal with international situations that are rife with fluidity, by developing horizontal, comprehensive foreign policy. Behind this is the reflection that vertical administration was a disaster and a swift response was impossible at the time of the 1990 Gulf war. The first director of the bureau is Shunji Yanai (1960), who served as the first director general of the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters in the era of the previous Miyazawa administration. This bureau created the draft of the foreign policy portion of the general policy speech delivered by Prime Minister Hosokawa in the special session of the Diet. This bureau also was in charge of the policy of taking general responsibility for World War II that has been advocated by Foreign Minister Hata. Furthermore, this bureau has begun to make the draft for Prime Minister Hosokawa's general discussion speech at the ordinary general session of the United Nations. Novel ideas, in addition to ample knowledge of internationl law, are sought in the officers of the bureau, but the best fitted was Yanai who served as director of the Treaties Bureau and was concerned with the first full-scale UN peacekeeping operation [PKO] for Japan. Yanai looks back on his year as director general of the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters as "having continuous application to everday problems." His hobby is being a Sunday carpenter and he apparently makes furniture. Councilor Yoshikazu Nogami (1965) was known internationally for his activities in the multinational conference on peace in the Middle East during his previous job when he was councilor for the Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau. He is viewed as a talent most appropriately appointed to the General Foreign Policy Bureau (at MOFA abbreviated and called Soseikyoku) where new ideas are needed. The major division chiefs are the aforementioned Hitoshi Tanaka (1968), chief of the General Affairs Division; Yoichi Otabe (1973), chief of the Planning Division; Sumio Tarui (1970), chief of the Security Policy Division; and Mototake Yoshikawa (1973), chief of the UN Policy Division. Tanaka is "an able man" who served in the past as the senior administrative official of the First North America Division and chief of the Second North America Division. There is the feeling that MOFA heads chose talented men such as Yanai, Nogami, and Tanaka to produce results in this new bureau. Asian Affairs Bureau It was traditionally the most rightwing bureau before the inauguration of the General Foreign Policy Bureau, but it has yielded that position with the birth of the General Foreign Policy Bureau. The bureau director is Tadashi Ikeda (1961), an expert on China. Since the time of his appointment, it has been said that he was appointed so that the historical visit to China by the emperor and empress could end successfully. The China visit of both their majesties ended without incident as expected and his popularity within MOFA quickly rose. Some call for him to be the next director of the Secretariat disregarding Yukio Sato, director of the North American Affairs Bureau, who is highly recommended by some to be the next director of the Secretariat. During his days as a minister in Thailand, he had contacts with officers of the Pol Pot faction in the jungle near the Cambodian border. He has increased his fans in MOFA by his sincere courtesy without the unapproachableness that is apt to exist in foreign service officers. The councilor is Yukio Takeuchi (1966) who served as private secretary to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa (at the time). The counselor is Akimoto Takano (1966) who served in the handling of the private secretary administrative work for Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe (at the time, now deceased). The division chiefs are Seiji Kojima (1971), chief of the Regional Policy Division; Shigeru Nakamura (1972), chief of the Northeast Asia Division; Yoshio Nomoto (1971), chief of the China Division; Tadamichi Yamamoto (1973), chief of the First Southeast Asia Division; Keiichi Hayashi (1973), chief of the Second Southeast Asia Division; and Yasuaki Tanizaki (1974), chief of the Southwest Asia Division. Among these, Nomoto was appointed from his position as chief of the General Affairs Department (Taipei) of the Exchange Association with Taiwan. In the previous MOFA personnel changes, it would not have been considered because of concern for China, and it can be called a sign that Japan's foreign policy on China has changed from "outward formality" to "inward feelings." Yamamoto's outstanding English capability and superior diplomatic abilities that were demonstrated in the series of Cambodian problems have received a high rating inside and outside MOFA. North American Affairs Bureau The bureau director is Yukio Sato (1960), the ablest man in MOFA. The prospects are that he will be promoted to director of the Secretariat at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994. At MOFA, the Economic Affairs Bureau stands at the front line in the economic area of U.S.-Japan relations, but Sato directed talk preparations for the opening of the first talks between the U.S. and Japanese heads of state for the Hosokawa administration in New York in the latter part of September. The councilor is Ryozo Kato (1964), and the chiefs of the major divisions are Toshiaki Ozawa (1972), chief of the First North America Division, and Shinichi Nishimiya (1975), chief of the Second North America Division. Kato is a future candidate for vice minister. Central and South American Affairs Bureau The bureau director is Kiyohiko Arafune (1961), who was called back from his position as ambassador to Nicaragua to replace Terada, who became press secretary. He has had a broad range of work and friendly relationships, being temporarily transferred to the Finance Ministry and serving as head of the Nagoya Customshouse, and it seems to have become a plus in his career as a foreign service officer afterward. The counselor is Shinya Nagai (1967), and the chiefs of the major divisions are Akira Miwa (1974), chief of the First Central and South America Division which covers South America, and Masuo Nishibayashi (1974), chief of the Second Central and South America Division which is in charge of Central America and part of South America. European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau The bureau director is Issei Nomura (1962), an expert on Russia. It seems his ability will be evaluated by whether or not he will be able to make the official visit to Japan by Russian President Yeltsin in the middle of October the first step in the resolution of the pending northern territories problem. The councilor is Shigeru Tsumori (1964), and a major division chief is Tsuneo Nishida (1969) who transferred to the Russian Division from chief of the Press Division. Nishida is an expert in English and it is unusual to appoint a chief of the Russian Division who does not speak Russian. There is a strong view that it is an expression of MOFA's desire to handle foreign policy on Russia using a new concept. Yasuo Saito (1970), who handled private secretary administrative work for the previous foreign minister, is the chief of the First West Europe Division which is in charge of France and Germany, etc., and Akitaka Saiki (1975) is the chief of the Second West Europe Division which is in charge of Great Britain, etc. Saiki is known as a "forceful foreign service officer." Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau The bureau director is Takaya Sudo (1961), an Arabist. Although he was appointed after serving as councilor for science and technology, he should be quite satisfied with the appointment as an expert. For the time being, the big job will be preparations for the "Africa Development Conference" to be held under the sponsorship of the Japanese Government in Tokyo in October. The counselor is Toshinori Shigeie (1968) who returned to the home ministry after serving as a minister to the United Nations. The chiefs of the divisions are Hideo Tanaka (1970), chief of the First Middle East Division which has jurisdiction over Egypt and Israel, etc.; Toshihiro Okuda (1974), chief of the Second Middle East Division which is in charge of the Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia; Kensuke Tsuzuki (1974), chief of the First Africa Division; and Hisao Yamaguchi (1974), chief of the Second Africa Division. Shigeie, who has had experience as chief of the Security Division, North American Affairs Bureau, etc., is greatly trusted by high-ranking officials, but it seems that his actions will be the key to deciding the value of the bureau. Economic Affairs Bureau The bureau director, Kazuo Ogura (1961), along with classmate Minoru Tanba (director of the Treaties Bureau), is an elite foreign service officer. of whom it was said from early on, "Ogura or Tanba will become administrative vice minister for foreign affairs." He has both written and spoken eloquence and the articles that he contributes once in a while to the "Foreign Affairs Forum," the public relations magazine of MOFA, almost always are popular inside and outside the ministry. The councilors who assist Ogura are Kazuo Asaumi (1961) and Nobuyasu Abe (1966). Asaumi is the son of former Ambassador to the U.S. Koichiro Asaumi, and formerly served as interpreter for U.S.-Japan heads-of-state talks. Abe worked hard and rendered distinguished service behind the scenes in the economic area for the success of the Tokyo summit in July. The general affairs counselor, who also can be called the director of the Secretariat for the Economic Affairs Bureau, is Yoshiki Mine (1967). The chiefs of the divisions are Kojiro Shiojiri (1972), chief of the First International Economic Affairs Division which is in charge of trade with the European Community (EC) and economic integration, and Koro Bessho (1974), chief of the Second International Economic Affairs Division in charge of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). The other division chiefs are a galaxy of able men. Japan took the lead role at the Tokyo summit, and it was agreed to conclude successfully the Uruguay Round (new multilateral trade negotiations) within the year, but it will be a test case of the Economic Affairs Bureau whether or not this can be realized. Economic Cooperation Bureau Hiroshi Hirabayashi (1962) was appointed bureau director after serving as a minister to the United States in the August personnel changes. He immediately displayed his skill in the Cambodian postwar reconstruction problem, etc. In his days as minister to the United States, he appeared on U.S. television, etc., and as a result of his blunt speeches that were disagreeable to U.S. ears, it seems that he was kept at a distance. When he believes it to be true, he speaks out without reserve. From the standpoint of a friend, there is no person with such dependable fighting power. The councilor is Shohei Naito (1965). During the Gulf war, Japanese in Kuwait became hostages of Iraq and he worked hard without sleep or rest for their release. The counselor is Hideaki Ueda (1966). Originally, he was in Russian service, and economic cooperation has been a different field, but he has been cheerfully carrying out his work, including trips to Central Asia, ever since his appointment. For the chiefs of the major divisions, Nobuichi Kitajima (1970) is the chief of the Planning Division, which can be called the secretariat of the Economic Cooperation Bureau. He is one of the few foreign service officers in MOFA who came from Keio University, but he has melded into the ministry so well that officers in the ministry who do not know from what university he came are surprised and say, "Did he come from Keio University?" In the days of his former job as chief of the First International Organizations Division of the Economic Affairs Bureau, he worked hard on arrangements for the Uruguay Round and was deeply trusted by Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe (at the time). The chief of the Technical Cooperation Division is Mitsuo Sakaba (1972). Due to joining the ministry from Yokohama City University, it seems that human relations were difficult for him at first. However, he is deeply trusted by his subordinates for his quiet and refined style of work. In addition, Shigekazu Sato (1973) is chief of the Loan Aid Division and Masahito Kodera (1975) is chief of the Grant Aid Division. On the occasion of the visit to China by the emperor and empress, Kodera contributed to its success by working devotedly behind the scenes as senior administrative officer of the China Division in the Asian Affairs Bureau. Treaties Bureau The bureau director is Minoru Tanba (1961). The director of the Treaties Bureau has important jobs such as responding in the Budget Committees of both the House of Councilors and the House of Representatives and attending conferences with Russia, with whom a peace treaty has not been concluded. Tanba is extremely popular with the LDP opposition party and therefore it looks like that he need not to worry about being bullied by "the strongest opposition party in history." He is an expert on Russia and previously has been known as a hardliner on Russian policy, but recently, he has a touch of consideration for the U.S. and European position of support for Yeltsin and much more flexible. The councilor is Hiroharu Koike (1965), who is working at the home ministry for the first time in a long time, after serving as a minister of the Japanese Government mission at the United Nations. The lineup of division chiefs are Ichiro Komatsu (1971), chief of the Treaties Division; Kenjiro Moji (1974), chief of the International Conventions Division; and Tetsuo Ito (1972), chief of the Legal Affairs Division. International Information Bureau The bureau director is Haruhiko Shibuya (1962). He slid over horizontally from the position of director of the United Nations Bureau, which was abolished along with the inauguration of the General Foreign Policy Bureau. Previously, as councilor of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the time when the crew of the Fujiyama Maru No. 18 was released by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), he traveled together with Ichiro Ozawa (currently acting secretary general of the Shinseito) to take charge of the crewmembers in Pyongyang. When the special plane landed at Haneda, the television [broadcast] that was relayed showed Shibuya who was mistaken for a released crewmember. He has many fans at MOFA with his polite manner and honest personality that are not common in a foreign service officer. The councilor is Kiyohiko Nanao (1965). It previously seemed that his specialty field was economic foreign policy, but since serving as a minister to South Korea, he also has become strong in the political field. The division chiefs are Makoto Mizutani (1970), chief of the International Information Division; Akio Suda (1970), chief of the First Analysis Division; and Hiroyuki Kishino (1974), chief of the Second Analysis Division. Other The chief of the Cultural Affairs Department is Takayuki Kimura (1961). The weight occupied by cultural exchange in Japanese foreign affairs has been increasing year by year, but actual results steadily have been produced in diverse fields such as Japanese language education abroad, cooperation for Japanese research, introduction of Japanese culture abroad, and cooperation in the preservation of cultural heritage. Assisting Kimura and substantially working on cultural foreign policy are the three, Councilor Takashi Nakamoto (1965), Osamu Shiozaki (1972), chief of the First Cultural Affairs Division, and Nobutaka Shinomiya (1973), chief of the Second Cultural Affairs Division. Nakamoto has served as private secretary to director of the Secretariat, Takao Fujinami (at the time) and is one of the hopeful leading foreign service officers with expectations for the future. Appreciation for the existence of the Consular and Emigration Affairs Department is increasing more and more along with Japanese living and traveling abroad. There also should be some people among the general public who have been assisted by the department once or twice. Chief of the department is Yoshihisa Ara (1961) and the counselor is Norio Hattori (1967). Previously at the time when there were many hijacking incidents by the Japanese Red Army, the counselor of the Consular and Emigration Affairs Department was appointed under careful instruction beforehand about the possibility of being exchanged for hostages. Speaking of that, Ryohei Murata, the current ambassador to Germany, had experience in that post. He remembers the episode on the occasion of the Kuala Lumpur incident when he was exchanged for hostages and passed the time by solving crossword puzzles in the aircraft together with the enemy, the Japanese Red Army. In the same department is the Foreign Nationals Affairs Division whose workload has expanded in both quality and quantity with the rapid increase of foreigners coming into Japan recently. The experts from Division Chief Akio Egawa (1974) and on down are tackling the surge of visa applications. An organization that is substantially the same as a department is the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Councilor Organization. The head is Akira Hayashi (1963), and the counselor is Yoshitaka Kawamura (1967) who was transferred from the Asian Affairs Bureau. There are two divisions and two offices in the organization. The chief of the Arms Control and Disarmament Division is Takeshi Nakane (1973), and the chief of the Scientific Affairs and Nuclear Energy Division is Yukihisa Amano (1971). Waiting for Nakane is the issue of creating the draft for the nuclear test ban treaty, etc. Chief of the International Social Cooperation Department is Kojiro Takano (1963). In his days as chief of the General Affairs Division of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), he directly faced the incident of the murder of a JICA expert by antigovernment guerrillas in Peru, and his memories of skillfully dealing with the difficult problem are fresh. In his new post, he handles highly contemporary problems such as UN administration and finance, human rights, refugees, drugs, and wildlife protection. It probably should be viewed as facing a chance to make further strides. The counselor is Itaru Umezu (1967), who has had experience as the consul in New York. For division chiefs, Yuji Kumamaru (1974) is chief of the United Nations Administration Division and originally was an expert on China. Chief of the Human Rights and Refugee Division is Toshio Kunikata (1975), and chief of the Global Scale Problems Division is Toshiki Kanamori. Kanamori is a temporary transfer from the Finance Ministry. His proficient language capability gives him the advantage. In addition, the councilor in charge of inspection is Takao Kawakami (1960). He is the former director of the Economic Cooperation Bureau, but the opinion is strong that he will be appointed chief of the Cabinet Foreign Policy Councilors' Office some day. The ambassador in charge of international trade is Nobutoshi Akao (1960). He bears the heavy responsibility for reaching an agreement within the year in the Uruguay Round. The ambassador in charge of negotiations on normalizing relations between Japan and North Korea is Tetsuya Endo (1957). He is a classmate of Vice Minister Saito and also is in charge of Asian Pacific cooperation. Japan-North Korea negotiations never have been held since Endo became in charge of them, and it is not certain whether or not he will be able to put a period to the last postwar disposition of Japan. In so far as North Korea has been awkward as a negotiation partner, it seems that he has faced his crucial moment as a foreign service officer. As director of the Foreign Service Training Institute, Shintaro Yamashita (1957) is in charge of training young foreign service officers. As general guidance officer, Yuji Miyamoto (1968) helps Yamashita. Among the foreign service officers temporarily transferred to other ministries or agencies, Sakutaro Tanino (1959) is the chief of the Cabinet Councilors' Office on External Affairs. He is an expert on China, has obtained overwhelming support from the China school within the ministry, and many have anticipated that he will be appointed deputy vice minister for foreign affairs after Saito is promoted to vice minister. Hisami Kurokochi (1957), who is known as the oldest forceful foreign officer, serves as the chief of the House of Representatives Committee on the Foreign Affairs Research Office. The second secretary general of the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters is Katsunari Suzuki (1961), the previous director of the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau. He immediately made an inspection tour of the scene in Cambodia. Yoshiyuki Sadaoka (1973) is the counselor for the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters and supports Suzuki. In addition, Kazuyuki Hiraoka (1953) is the director of the state guest house, Kiyoshi Kadotani (1948) is the lord chamberlain of the household, Azusa Hayashi (1968) is chief of Police Headquarters, Iwate Prefecture, and Masaji Takahashi (1960) is director of the Immigration Bureau, Ministry of Justice. The president of JICA is Kensuke Yanagiya (1948). He is famous for taking a part in the nuptials of the Crown Prince and Masako. JICA director Makoto Watanabe (1958) soon will return to the home ministry and is scheduled to be appointed the post of Chief of Protocol. Also from MOFA are Shinichiro Asao (1950), director of the Japan Foundation, and Toshijiro Nakashima (1948), Supreme Court justice. Overseas Establishments Finally, let's mention the major ambassadors among the foreign service officers who are serving in overseas establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, Toshio Goto (1953) is in South Korea, and Michihiko Kunihiro (1954) is in China. Goto has been a consul in South Korea in the past, has served as director of the Asian Affairs Bureau, and is most suitable as ambassador to South Korea. Kimio Fujita in Indonesia and Hiroaki Fujii in Thailand both passed the foreign service officer exam in 1955, and are fellow rivals. Along with Koji Watanabe, ambassador to Italy in the same 1955 group, they are called the triumvirate of vice minister candidates. In Australia Kazutoshi Hasegawa (1956) who served as private secretary to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone (at the time). In the North American region, Takakazu Kuriyama (1953) is in the United States. It was rumored that Hisashi Owada, previous administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, would be appointed ambassador to the United States and it seems that Kuriyama has difficulty doing the job, but he will continue until at least the end of 1994. Noboru Nakahira (1953) is in Canada. In his previous appointment, he served as ambassador in charge of Japan-North Korea negotiations. Turning an eye to the European region, Sumio Edamura (1951) is in Russia. He will retire after the visit to Japan by President Yeltsin in October and Koji Watanabe will take his place. Hiroshi Kitamura (1952) is in Great Britain, Atsuhiko Yatabe (1951) is in France, and Ryohei Murata (1951) is in Germany. In the Middle East and African region, Taizo Watanabe (1956) is in Egypt, Hiroshi Ota (1959) is in Saudi Arabia, and Takeshi Ohara (1960) is in Iran. In charge of international agencies, Yoshio Hatano (1952) is at the United Nations, Yoshitomo Tanaka (1955) is at the Disarmament Conference, and Yoshiyasu Sato (1957) is at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Sato is from Hitotsubashi University. He is strongly trusted by his schoolmate, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, and if Foreign Minister Watanabe had continued on, it is said that he would have been appointed vice minister instead of Saito. Among these ambassadors, Kitamura and Hatano are scheduled to be replaced in the near future, and the personnel changes for successors probably will be a topic of conversation.
