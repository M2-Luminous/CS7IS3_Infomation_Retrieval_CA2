Today, the Railway Technical Research Institute in partnership with Tokai Passenger Railway Co. (JR Tokai) and the Japan Railway Construction Corporation are gaining the cooperation of Yamanashi Prefecture and are proceeding with full-scale construction. Construction Status The three business partners and Yamanashi Prefecture sponsored a series of local informational meetings in a total of 18 districts in the six cities and towns (Sakagawa-mura, Yatsushiro-cho, Misaka-cho, Ootsuki-shi, Tsuru-shi, Akiyama-mura) situated along the Yamanashi test track. Explanations on the environment, safety, and compensation for the land required were repeated over 300 times. These efforts were linked to results, advanced the securing of approval for site entry in all the districts by the end of September 1992, and made possible construction of the 42.8 km test track. Today, site negotiations are under way in the districts where surveying has been completed. With local understanding and cooperation, we closed contracts for site acquisition in the zone from Misakayama to Tsuru-shi and Ootsuki-shi on the eastern side. In addition, we are commissioning construction in the tunnel zone in the nine sites that cross both cities. With the exception of one site, excavation work is beginning. In cleared zones as well, construction preparations are continuing for facilities like car bases. This civil engineering work is being performed under the auspices of JR Tokai and the Railway Corporation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Commissioned Tunnels | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tunnel Name |Length and Contractor |Notes | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(1) Sasako Tunnel |5,760 m |Excavation divided into 3| | | | sites (west, central, e-| | | |ast) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Ootsuki-shi) |Railway Corp. | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(2) Hatsukari Tunnel |460 m |Preparing for excavation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Ootsuki-shi) |Railway Corp. | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(3) Takagawa Tunnel |3,940 m |Excavation divided into 2| | | | sites (west and east) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Ootsuki-shi and Tsuru-s-|Railway Corp. | | |hi) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(4) Kuki Tunnel |3,930 m |Excavation divided into 2| | | | sites (west and east) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Tsuru-shi and Ootsuki-s-|JR Tokai | | |hi) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(5) Asahi Tunnel |1,790 m |Excavation from starting | | | |side | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Tsuru-shi) |JR Tokai | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tests To Be Performed at the Yamanashi Test Track In order to reach the goal of the realization of a practical maglev railway at the Yamanashi test track, the following items will be verified through testing. (1) Verification of safety and comfort at a steady, fast speed of 500 km/h (2) Verification of reliability and durability of the superconducting magnets, the cars, the ground facilities, and the equipment (3) Verification of structural standards like the minimum track radius (R = 8000 m) and the steepest grade (40%) (4) Verification of required spacing (5.8 m) between the track centers for passing (5) Verification of car's performance with respect to the tunnel's cross-sectional area and changes in pressure inside the tunnel (6) Verification of performance of the branching equipment (7) Verification of environmental soundness (8) Establishment of a control system for multiple trains (9) Verification of the operating maintenance system and the maintenance standards (10) Verification of the control system between transformer substations (11) Pursuing economy and understanding construction and business costs Test Track Facilities Base facilities have been provided, for example, the command center that plays a central role during the running tests, the power transformer substations that supply power at variable voltages and variable frequencies in the surface propulsion coils, the car lot for storing low noise two-car trains that are low noise trains with little running resistance, and test platforms. On lines with multiple tracks in the same direction, the GTO inverter that is used as the power transformer has 38 MVA per system (3 units set up for triple power). The propulsion coils running along the guideway carry a voltage of 22 kV. During the initial planning period, the GTO inverter was a 20 MVA class inverter and the voltage of the propulsion coils was 11 kV. But as plans to develop larger capacity and higher voltages proceeded, equipment closer to commercial standards was set up and used in the running tests. The progress of test track construction was described earlier and the initial plan is about one year behind schedule. As a result, based on the initial objective of beginning tests when construction ends, the 18.4 km zone from Sasaki in Ootuki-shi (Koufu side) to Asahisoshi in Tsuru-shi (Tokyo side) is given precedence as a priority construction zone. This zone is included in the base facility described earlier. Running tests will begin at the end of 1994, a year later than scheduled in the initial plan. But the advantage is fast acceleration traveling that is designed in the improved standards for the facilities explained earlier can be established. Except for the final verification of stability and durability when the train is running, the essential goal of implementation in mid-1997 stands. Outside the priority construction zone, consultations on the land required are being actively pursued. Conclusion Tunnel excavation work and equipment design and manufacture have been in progress since 1991. The project team composed of the Railway Technical Research Institute, JR Tokai, and the Railway Corporation plans to proceed with construction on the Yamanashi test track and further technical development. Therefore, basic systems, facility specifications, and test plans will be advanced substantially. Although the acquisition of required land was delayed by one year, to avoid hindering the Basic Technology Development Project and the Yamanashi Test Track Construction Project, I would like to focus our best efforts and move forward in realizing the plan.
