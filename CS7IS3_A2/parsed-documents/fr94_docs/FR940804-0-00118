FR940804-0-00118 FR940804-0-00024 When an attorney for the government communicates with a represented party pursuant to one or more of the exceptions listed in section 77.6, or with a represented person pursuant to section 77.7, the communication is nevertheless subject to the restrictions of this section. Paragraph (a): Deference to Attorney-Client Relationship Federal courts have recognized that it is improper for an attorney for the government to disparage counsel for the represented party or otherwise to seek to disrupt the relationship between that party and his attorney. See , e.g. , United States v. Morrison , 449 U.S. 361, 362, 367 (1981); United States v. Weiss , 599 F.2d 730, 740 (5th Cir. 1979); id . at 740&hyph;41 (Godbold, J., specially concurring). This paragraph codifies those basic principles by prohibiting communications that: (1) attempt to elicit information regarding lawful defense strategies; (2) disparage the represented party's counsel; or (3) otherwise improperly seek to disrupt the attorney-client relationship. These prohibitions apply in every phase of criminal and civil enforcement investigations and proceedings. However, the paragraph also accommodates an important exception to this prohibition. Courts have held that a government attorney may not permit legal proceedings to go forward if he or she is aware of a conflict of interest between a represented party and his or her lawyer. See United States v. Iorizzo , 786 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1986). Under this circumstance, the attorney for the government ordinarily should move to disqualify the lawyer involved, if legal proceedings have already commenced. If it is not feasible to move for disqualification or otherwise challenge the representation, this paragraph allows an attorney for the government to communicate with the represented individual for the limited purpose of apprising the represented individual of the perceived conflict. However, any substantive discussion of the subject matter of the representation is permissible only insofar as it is authorized by some other provision of this rule. In order to ensure that this provision is used only in rare circumstances, the rule requires prior authorization for such communications from the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General or a United States Attorney. The authorization should be in writing if at all possible. Furthermore, before providing approval, the authorizing officer must find: (1) a substantial likelihood of a conflict; and (2) that it is not feasible to obtain a court order on the matter. One organization commented that judicial approval, or at least approval by a designated Assistant Attorney General (rather than by a United States Attorney), should be required before an attorney for the government may apprise a represented party or person of any perceived conflict of interest. Another organization and an individual commented that attorneys for the government should never be allowed to inform a represented individual of a perceived conflict of interest, and, instead, should be required to move to disqualify counsel and leave it to the court to adjudicate any conflicts of interest. The Department believes that there will be circumstances in which it will not be feasible to obtain a judicial order challenging the representation (especially prior to the filing of charges), or when the exigencies of the situation may make it impracticable to obtain prior authorization of a judicial officer or an Assistant Attorney General. In such circumstances, and when a high-level Department official, such as a United States Attorney, determines that there is a significant likelihood of a conflict of interest between a represented individual and his or her attorney, it is better that the represented person or party be apprised of the potential conflict of interest than be left uninformed. Accordingly, the Department has decided to leave this paragraph unchanged in the final rule. Paragraph (b): Attorney-Client Meetings The attendance of an undercover agent or a cooperating witness at lawful meetings of an individual and his or her attorneys is ordinarily an improper intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. The courts have recognized, however, that such attendance occasionally will be required when the operative is invited to participate and his or her refusal to do so would effectively reveal his or her connection to the government. See , e.g. , Weatherford v. Bursey , 429 U.S. 545, 557 (1977); United States v. Ginsberg , 758 F.2d 823, 833 (2d Cir. 1985); United States v. Mastroianni , 749 F.2d 900, 906 (1st Cir. 1984). As the First Circuit has noted, a contrary rule ``would provide the defense with a quick and easy alarm system to detect the presence of any informants, simply by inviting all known associates of defendants to a supposed defense strategy meeting.'' Mastroianni , 749 F.2d at 906. Attendance at such meetings, however, intrudes into the attorney-client relationship and impairs the right of the defendant to a fair trial. Accordingly, this section provides that undercover agents or cooperating witnesses may participate in such meetings, but only when requested to do so by the defense and when reasonably necessary to protect their safety or life or the confidentiality of an undercover operation. See Weatherford , 429 U.S. at 557. However, even when an undercover operative's attendance at such a lawful meeting is authorized to protect his or her cover and safety, any information acquired regarding lawful defense strategy or trial preparation may not be communicated to government attorneys or otherwise used to the substantial detriment of the represented party. See Weatherford , 429 U.S. at 558; Ginsberg , 758 F.2d at 833; Mastroianni , 749 F.2d at 906. As a safeguard, this rule provides that such information should not be communicated to the attorneys for the government or law enforcement agents who are participating in the trial of the pending criminal charges.
