FBIS4-44955 "jpnea030___94010" JPRS-NEA-94-030 JPRS Near East & South Asia 21 April 1994 NEAR EAST EGYPT Workers Express Their Understanding of Privatization Workers Express Their Understanding of Privatization 94LD0060A Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic 21 Apr 94 p 5 94LD0060A Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH Arabic CSO [Article by Hani Salih: "Workers Do Not Know"] [Text] New phrases have invaded workers' lives. They now have to deal with words heard for the first time, such as privatization, stocks, employee unions, etc. Citizen understanding and conviction about any new phrase or situation is undoubtedly the first guarantee of the experiment's success. In the past the experiment of the private sector suffered from lack of comprehension by many. How are employees now receiving these terms that are new to their lives? How are they dealing with them? Have they indeed understood them? Has anyone attempted to explain them to them? 'Abd-al-Mun'im Isma'il (age 54), senior overseer, said he had heard much about the business sector laws, but understood nothing about them. "The company has voluntarily begun deducting part of the price of shares, but we are asking whether it is for our benefit and what their system is." Answering himself, he said: "The trade union committees and company officials should have explained to employees the importance of buying these shares and what guarantees will be provided to workers, because the employees feel afraid of privatization, and the union committee has no part in the matter." He said that he nevertheless approved of buying shares, but that it ought to be done from conviction. Trading Workers' Shares Yusri 'Abd-al-'Aziz, senior overseer, asked: "Can an employee-purchased share be traded on the stock exchange? Has the share been registered in my name or not? An employee ought to be allowed to sell and buy, so that he feels the real benefit of owning the share. The rules and regulations for stock ownership ought to be announced among employees." He warns about a new buyer's pressuring workers in order to buy their shares when they take ownership of the company. He also asks what rate of return these stocks will have. These things should be completely clear to the employees. Decision To Invest--Whose Responsibility? Hamsah 'Abd-al-Mun'im Kilani, female employee of the Egypt Oils Company, said: "A share means a new kind of security. Employee investment in stock purchasing ought to be voluntary and not compulsory, because the owner of capital has the right to decide freely whether to invest by buying shares within the company, outside it, or through the stock market." She asked: "When we think of recouping the price of the share, can its value be converted immediately? At what price? Or shall we be told to wait until the end of the fiscal year?" Hanan al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Khaliq, a female employee, said that privatization was a word frequently used in recent years, but she did not know its meaning. However, she believes that the employee ought to own part of the shares of the company in which he works. This will strengthen loyalty and affiliation. Workers should be able to understand the terms of negotiation with new buyers. Things Not Understood Salah 'Abd-al-Maqsud, a member of the elected board of directors of al-Nasr Automobile Company, said that a union of shareholding workers has been formed and announced. Government policy is to give workers ownership of a portion of the stock of the company in which they work. Offering a company for sale has not received sufficient explanation; the majority of workers do not understand it. It was recently announced that a company could be sold by a number of means--sale by the administration, by stock purchase, or lease to utilize capacities. He said these matters were not understood and unclear because there was a lack of information. Although it was government policy and a shift from a directed system to a free economy, workers must participate in this stage. He declared that he as a worker did not object to the company's new buyer. "But we ought to be informed about these proceedings and their reason from the opening of bidding until the sale is closed. The length of the selling process causes anxiety for the workers and affects the company's contract commitments with buyers of goods or importers of components." He said that any new buyer must not reduce workers' wages and incentives. He must fully utilize productive capacity and employ the work force without neglecting it. Workers must be represented in the negotiating procedures as an observer to guarantee their rights. Interest, Rights Nasir Kamil Sulayman, decoration technician in the planning division of al-Nasr Automobiles, asked whether purchasing stocks would benefit the workers, and why the worker did not represent himself when buying the stock. He said that it was the first time he had heard about the shareholders' union. Worker stock ownership would safeguard their rights in the face of buyers and strengthen the sense of affiliation, but these things had to take place with full conviction and complete clarity. 'Ali Sa'id Gharib, senior overseer at the bus factory, said that an employee's salary would not permit him to buy any shares, even though ownership of company stock was necessary to strengthen the employee's sense of affiliation with the factory. He said that he understood nothing the media was publishing about privatization. He asked whether it was some state secret. He said that the company had 10,000 employees, although no more than 3,000 were supposed to be working in it. The employees were not against discharging part of the work force, provided they were compensated appropriately and that it was clearly announced instead of being covered up. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mubarak said that one should not announce policies that were not implemented. For example, it was announced that vacations and foreign travel were being granted to government employees, while at the same time some companies were refusing to renew these vacations. He asked why there was this contradiction and whose interest it served. Al-Husayni Muhammadi Mansur, secretary of the Union of Worker Shareholders at the Coca Cola Company said that workers had recently realized the importance of forming the union to confront the new buyers. They had deducted 3.8 months from their dividends and 100 pounds from their savings for the purpose of buying shares. He asked whether the Union of Worker Shareholders would have a voice in the board of directors proportional to the shares they had obtained. Sa'id Fathi, the trade union committee's representative on the Coca Cola board of directors, said that the holding company ought to sell shares to the employees immediately, regardless of the new purchasers. Selling to Egyptians is better than to foreigners, and the company's selling shares is better than selling them by auction. He explained that the trade union committees at the company's factories had been educating workers about the need for cohesion and for regarding the company's interest as above any personal consideration. Workers must realize the importance of the coming period. They will have to change their behavior and increase production, as is happening in private sector factories, so that the new buyers find no opportunity to lay off any worker after the period stipulated for no layoffs. Full Responsibility Engineer Mamduh 'Abd-al-Halim al-Sharqawi, head of the Turah factories division of the Starch and Glucose Company, said that the operating style was different in the business sector from what it was under the public sector law--through better monitoring of production expenses and greater decisionmaking responsibility for factory leaders, along with full responsibility and greater ability to compete with imports. Never Heard of Shareholders' Union Muhammad Shibl, a member of the trade union committee at the Starch and Glucose Company, said: "We never heard about the union of worker shareholders until after the [company's] general meeting decided to deduct two months of dividends [paid to workers] for the purpose of buying shares and promised to subsidize the price of the shares by two similar months." He said that worker purchase of shares in this manner was encouraging, because the return on shares in profitable companies was higher than interest in banks. He said that 80 percent of the workers had participated in shareholder development and had bought shares. Sale to Foreigners Rejected Hijazi 'Abd-al-Rahim (age 58), senior overseer at the Starch Company, said he had gone to work at the company before nationalization, in the days of foreign owners. He indicated that working with foreigners was very difficult, because it meant no security for workers when they were sick or incapacitated. He therefore preferred selling to Egyptians. In the end they are our brothers: they love their fellow countrymen, and will not easily treat them carelessly. A diligent worker should not fear the new management; however, they want guarantees against dismissal.
