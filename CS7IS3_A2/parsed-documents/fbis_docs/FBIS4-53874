As much as 70 kilograms of plutonium stuck to equipment at Donen's plutonium fuel plant (located in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture). There are 17 airtight containers, called glove boxes, in the fuel plant. To prevent possible radiation contamination, operators wear rubber globes and operate the equipment installed in the containers while standing outside. Plutonium adhesion occurred inside the glove boxes. Blackish plutonium reportedly could be seen stuck to pipes and other equipment. Of the 17 containers, large amounts of the plutonium, 60 percent of the total amount, was accumulated in two containers containing equipment to harden powder plutonium into fuel pellets, and another container which contains machines to grind the pellets to a unified, standard size. Currently the container which contains the largest amount of adhered plutonium is not in use. However, because of strong radiation, observers studied the containers through a thick glass wall. As a result of this, no plutonium inside the containers was visible to the naked eye. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) asked the fuel plant to reduce the amount of adhered plutonium. Measurement error is within plus or minus 10 percent and 70 kilograms of plutonium is involved in this case. Therefore nobody would notice even if enough plutonium to produce an atomic bomb was missing. Many other countries are concerned about the case and foreign media from nine countries sent representatives to see the containers.
