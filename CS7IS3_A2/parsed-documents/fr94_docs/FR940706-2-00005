FR940706-2-00005 FR940706-2-00003 National School Lunch, Special Milk, and School Breakfast Programs; National Average Payments/Maximum Reimbursement Rates AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This Notice announces the annual adjustments to: (1) The ``national average payments,'' the amount of money the Federal Government provides States for lunches and breakfasts served to children participating in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs; (2) the ``maximum reimbursement rates,'' the maximum per lunch rate from Federal funds that a State can provide a school food authority for lunches served to children participating in the National School Lunch Program; and (3) the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program for Children. The payments and rates are prescribed on an annual basis each July. The annual payments and rates adjustments for the school lunch and school breakfast programs reflect changes in the Food Away From Home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The annual rate adjustment for milk reflects changes in the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products. These payments and rates are in effect from July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert M. Eadie, Chief, Policy and Program Development Branch, Child Nutrition Division, FN, USDA, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, (703) 305&hyph;2620. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.553, No. 10.555 and No. 10.556 and are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule related notice published at 48 FR 29114, June 24, 1983.). This Notice imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are subject to OMB review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This action is not a rule as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act. This Notice has been determined to be exempt under Executive Order 12866. Background Special Milk Program for Children _Pursuant to section 3 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1772), the Department announces the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program for Children. This rate is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. For the period July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995, the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to a nonneedy child in a school or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program is 11.00 cents. This reflects no change over the current reimbursement rate because the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231) from May 1993 to May 1994 (from a level of 120.6 in May 1993 to 121.1 in May 1994) did not change significantly enough to trigger a change in the reimbursement rate. As a reminder, schools or institutions with pricing programs which elect to serve milk free to eligible children continue to receive the average cost of a half-pint of milk (the total cost of all milk purchased during the claim period divided by the total number of purchased half-pints) for each half-pint served to an eligible child. National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs _Pursuant to section 11 of the National School Lunch Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1759a), and section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1773), the Department annually announces the adjustments to the National Average Payment Factors and to the maximum Federal reimbursement rates for meals served to children participating in the National School Lunch Program. Adjustments are prescribed each July 1, based on changes in the Food Away From Home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. The changes in the national average payment rates for schools and residential child care institutions for the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995 reflect a 1.7 percent increase in the Price Index during the 12-month period May 1993 to May 1994 (from a level of 142.9 in May 1993 to 145.3 in May 1994). Lunch Payment Factors _Section 4 of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1753) provides general cash for food assistance payments to States to assist schools in purchasing food. There are two section 4 National Average Payment Factors for lunches served under the National School Lunch Program. The lower payment factor applies to lunches served by school food authorities in which less than 60 percent of the lunches served in the school lunch program during the second preceding school year were served free or at a reduced price. The higher payment factor applies to lunches served by school food authorities in which 60 percent or more of the lunches served during the second preceding school year were served free or at a reduced price. To supplement these section 4 payments, section 11 of the National School Lunch Act provides special cash assistance payments to aid schools in providing free and reduced-price lunches. The section 11 National Average Payment Factor for each reduced-price lunch served is set at 40 cents less than the factor for each free lunch. As authorized under sections 8 and 11 of the National School Lunch Act, maximum reimbursement rates for each type of lunch are prescribed by the Department in this Notice. These maximum rates ensure equitable disbursement of Federal funds to school food authorities. Breakfast Payment Factors _Section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 establishes National Average Payment Factors for free, reduced-price and paid breakfasts served under the School Breakfast Program and additional payments for schools determined to be in ``severe need'' because they serve a high percentage of needy children.
