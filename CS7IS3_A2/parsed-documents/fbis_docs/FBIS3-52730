In these new times, everything is open, there are no barriers and no brakes. Several days ago, as the citizens of Israel were anxiously listening to accounts of the Cairo encounter between the Israeli foreign minister and PLO representative Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], the media again announced, citing a "soothing" statement by the head of the FADC's intelligence branch: "A majority of the residents of the territories support 'Arafat." Those who took pains to make this announcement in such a manner must have had good reasons to try to calm the public in view of the rising doubts, the uncertainty, the growing mistrust of the government announcements. I do not discuss the FADC sessions as a rule, and I have even requested that others refrain from disclosing my remarks at these sessions. But a situation has arisen in which the government makes cynically selective use of the information it receives from intelligence elements, and there is therefore no alternative but to present a fuller picture. I trust the military censor to delete anything that can be really detrimental to state security. Recently all the intelligence elements have been repeatedly reporting on 'Arafat's negotiating stands. In general, they believe that 'Arafat has firmly adhered to his stands since the beginning of the negotiations, not budging from them one bit. And this is what the intelligence elements are saying: -- As far as 'Arafat is concerned, the agreement should lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, at the end of the process. Anything that serves this purpose is acceptable to him. Whatever does not, is rejected by him. -- In the matter of the border crossings control, the struggle is not over "Palestinian dignity versus Israeli security." The struggle is over external manifestations of Palestinian sovereignty versus Israeli security. Even if 'Arafat's demands on the matter of dignity are satisfied, the crisis will not be resolved without Israeli concession on the matter of external manifestations of sovereignty. (Israel has in the meantime given in on both the sovereignty and security issues.) -- 'Arafat demands guarantees for future stages of the process without linking that to him meeting the government's expectations from the agreement. The process and every implemented stage thereof are irreversible. This is not an experiment after which, if it fails, the situation can be reversed. -- A prolonged dialogue resulted in an agreement between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], which stated: The two organizations will not fight each other either in Gaza, Jericho, or any other place. This is the authoritative stand of the Israeli intelligence services. -- Hamas will be incorporated in the Palestinian establishment that will come into being after Israeli evacuation. Negotiations are already under way for the inclusion of Hamas in the Gaza city council (proportional to their strength, which is about 40 percent of the Strip versus 50 percent Fatah and 10 percent Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine). They will presumably be incorporated in every Palestinian self- administration branch, including the police. Hamas-initiated terrorist operations will continue even if and when its members join the Palestinian establishment. In all the contacts between the two organizations, Fatah has never demanded that Hamas discontinue its terrorist activities against Israel. The intelligence elements believe that, during the interim period, terrorism is expected to intensify in Judaea and Samaria, and in other places in Israel. Fatah and its leader, 'Arafat, regard terrorism an important tool in the political process. Knowing the Israeli public's sensitivity to terror victims, 'Arafat hopes to extract additional concessions from Israel with the help of intensified terrorism, There is no Fatah agreement that, after the evacuation, Israeli security forces will be allowed to carry out preemptive acts when Israel has information regarding preparations for terror activity. Fatah will also not allow the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to pursue the perpetrators of terrorism. -- The PLO will not revoke the Palestinian Covenant which calls for the destruction of Israel, even in the future. -- 'Arafat does not intend to distance the PLO from the terror organizations which have always opposed the agreement ("the rejectionist front"), and which call for the intensification of activity against Israel. Furthermore, he does not sanction them. -- After the IDF evacuation, it will be impossible to identify or supervise those who carry guns. The Palestinian forces will be armed with assault rifles, machine guns, and armored vehicles. -- Even if Israel learns, in advance, of an intention to shell Sederot from the Gaza area, or Kfar Sava from Qalqilyah, the only option at our disposal will be an appeal for the PLO interference. Fatah continues perpetrating terror acts, such as the recent incidents: the murder last weekend of the immigrant Anatoliy Kalasnikov, may the Lord revenge his blood. The stabbing of Yuval Golan in Adorayim two days ago, perpetrated by a Fatah man who was released from jail, upon a Fatah request, 10 days earlier. He probably was a new recruit with the Palestinian police, as was one of the murderers of Hayim Mizrahi from Bet El.... All of this has been reported to the members of the FADC, but not published. This was no accident, because they are putting out a smoke screen. Possibly, some Jews want to be cheated. Our history has witnessed terrible times when the leaders of the ghettos and many of the Jews there acted this way (I find it hard to judge this because I was not there), and the results are known. Nevertheless, it is important that we know the truth which is often being hidden from us. It is essential that we know that there is nothing left of the government's grounding assumption before the agreement is implemented. Let no one later say: "We had no idea." Everything is in front of us.
