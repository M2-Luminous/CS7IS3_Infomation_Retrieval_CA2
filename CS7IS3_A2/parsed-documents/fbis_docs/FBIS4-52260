The meeting, attended by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil and other government and party officials, also decided to study measures to be taken when the efforts through dialogue fail, officials said. The meeting confirmed the position that the government respects the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s decision on the technical issues of the inspection of the North Korean nuclear sites and observation of the replacement of fuel rod of the five megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon in North Korea. But if North Korea replaces the fuel rod without observation of the IAEA, suspension of the North Korean-U.S. talks is inevitable, the meeting reaffirmed the position. The government and the ruling party discussed another issue of the North Korean loggers. The senior officials decided to have close consultation with the Russian Government on the North Koreans who escaped from the Siberian logging camps to solve the problem in an early date. They will study ways to invite international organizations to intervene in the problem in an effort to prevent possible diplomatic trouble with Russia. Meanwhile, the government and the ruling party will reject the North Korean proposal to replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty with the United States alone, according to officials. They reaffirmed that the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should continue to exist.
