Wages and all types of bonus payments in the republic are now being strictly linked to the amount and quality of labor. By doing this, the leadership of Kazakhstan hopes to stop the practice of adjusting money payments to cover inflation. The new procedure for payments is compulsory for all enterprises. Inspection bodies have been given the right to withdraw from consumption funds any unmerited sums that have been paid out and to transfer them to local budget revenues.
