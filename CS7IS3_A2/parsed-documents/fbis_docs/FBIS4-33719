The following is a report from the international airport in Pudahuel by Arturo Harlem: [Begin recording] [Harlem] Good afternoon. Chilean Foreign Minister Figueroa stated that Chile has not set any deadlines for joining Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. He added, however, that Chile is very interested in achieving an agreement in this regard. Upon his arrival from Brazil and Argentina, Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa stressed that Chile's entrance to Mercosur will have a great impact at the regional level: [Figueroa] As the foreign ministers have already stated, our entrance in Mercosur will have a great political and economic impact. If the negotiations are successful, it will result in important commercial benefits in the short term for all those countries encompassed in this agreement. [Harlem] Figueroa also stated that the Chilean proposal had been warmly accepted by Mercosur countries. According to this proposal, Chile will be a Mercosur partner, and not a full member, because Chilean customs tariffs are substantially lower than those enforced in Mercosur countries. Commenting on other issues, Foreign Minister Figueroa reasserted that the Chilean Government has no plans to discuss the landlocked issue with Bolivia. [end recording]
