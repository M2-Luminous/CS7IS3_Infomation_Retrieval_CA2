Cavallo thus minimized the impact of the remarks he made on 9 May [as received], in which he emphasized that Chile "has all the conditions for joining" Mercosur. Cavallo's proposal thus admits free trade zone negotiations by Mercosur, on one hand, and Chile on the other. The finance minister admitted that it would be difficult for Chile "to join Mercosur, as it would probably introduce uncertainty into the tariff issue, an area in which Chile has been very successful with its own policies." Cavallo said that during the meeting with his Chilean counterpart Eduardo Aninat he discussed "the real progress in trade and in all other kinds of relations between Argentina and the other member countries of Mercosur." Cavallo said that free trade negotiations might be the most suitable path, but the two countries are also working on others, including "our geographical integration through the Andean passes, feasibility studies for transport projects, energy integration projects, and improvement in our countries' investment climates." Regarding the latter, Cavallo said that an agreement might be reached with the signing of a mutual investment protection treaty which would eliminate current obstacles. During a news conference with Chilean journalists, Cavallo ardently defended the scheme of a fixed foreign exchange rate, a mechanism that was dropped by Chile because of the poor results obtained. He stressed that "Argentina does not have a single currency requirement" but a free choice system, adding that this assures us that governments "will not devaluate" the peso. Cavallo also reiterated that in 1994 the country will have an inflation rate of "3 percent or less," and forecast that Argentina will close the year with a significant economic growth rate. Asked whether some social groups are paying the price for the adjustment, Cavallo said that social explosions such as the one in Santiago de Estero were made "against corruption and bad provincial administrations, and not against the convertibility plan." "People have not reacted against the economic plan because they realize the benefits of stability and growth," the minister added. Cavallo said that the proof that Argentina offers favorable conditions is the fact that "more than 200,000 foreigners" had emigrated to the country in the past few years. The minister added that public support was evident in the 1991, 1993, and 10 April 1994 elections. Cavallo concluded by saying that the Justicialist Party will again win the presidential election in 1995.
