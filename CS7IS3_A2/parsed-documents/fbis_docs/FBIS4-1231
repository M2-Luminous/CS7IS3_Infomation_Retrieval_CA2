Dr. Buthelezi said at an election rally near Piet Retief in the Eastern Transvaal that the IFP's struggle for freedom had just begun. Dr. Buthelezi also warned that if the ANC-SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance gained more than 50 percent support in the election, it could scrap the present interim constitution. He said that a bleak future would await South Africa because federalism, the kwaZulu-Natal region, and other provincial powers would disappear.
