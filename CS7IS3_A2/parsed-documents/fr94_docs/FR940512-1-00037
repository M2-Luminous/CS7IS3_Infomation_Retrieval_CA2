FR940512-1-00037 FR940512-1-00010 These proposed staffing requirements, which are in §§365.6 and 365.7 of the existing regulations for the SILS program, are consistent with section 504 of the Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;336, 42 U.S.C. 12101&hyph;12213), and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88&hyph;352, 42 U.S.C. 2000d&hyph;2000d&hyph;6). These proposed staffing requirements have proven useful in the past, and centers have identified staff development as a significant area of need. Proposed §364.28 would implement the statutory requirement that a State must incorporate into the State plan required by section 704 of the Act any new methods or approaches for the provision of IL services to older individuals who are blind that are developed under a project funded under chapter 2 of title VII of the Act. A DSU would be required to incorporate into and describe in the State plan any new methods or approaches that are developed under a project funded under chapter 2 of title VII of the Act that the DSU determines to be effective. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to proposed §364.30 that would require service providers to provide information about the CAP in formats that are accessible to individuals who seek or receive IL services. Proposed §364.40(a) would incorporate the statutory provision that makes any individual with a significant disability eligible for IL services under the SILS and CIL programs. In addition, proposed §364.40(b) would make it clear that any individual could seek information about IL services under these programs and request referral to other services and programs for individuals with significant disabilities, as appropriate. Proposed §364.41 would require the State to provide an assurance that eligibility requirements are applied in a nondiscriminatory manner and that no State or local residence requirement will be imposed for IL services. The purpose of the prohibition on a residency requirement is to ensure continuity of services if an individual moves from one State to another during the time he or she is receiving IL services. Proposed §364.41 is consistent with section 101(a)(14) of the Act regarding the prohibition on residency requirements for VR services. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has specified additional information that would have to be included in the statement of the objectives that would be required by proposed §364.42. The Secretary believes that the statement of objectives required by section 704(d) of the Act should reflect the importance of this part of the State plan to the State IL services programs and address the overall goals and mission of the State's IL programs and services, the various priorities for services and populations to be served (including the priorities established by centers pursuant to section 725(c)(4) of the Act), the types of services to be provided, the financial plan for the use of Federal and non-Federal funds to meet the objectives in the State plan, and how funds received under sections 711, 721, and 752 of the Act will further the objectives in the State plan. Proposed §364.43(b) would incorporate the statutory requirements in section 704(e) and (f) of the Act. Section 704(e) of the Act requires that the State must provide IL services to individuals with a significant disability with Federal, State, or other funds. Proposed §364.43(b) would permit a State to meet its statutory mandate under section 704(e) with Federal, State, or other funds. Proposed §364.43(e) would incorporate the statutory requirement in section 725(b)(2) of the Act that, in the determination of eligibility, if a State contracts with or awards a grant for the general operation of a center, it must delegate to the center all functions related to the determination of eligibility for services. If a State contracts with or awards a grant for the provision of specific IL services to individuals, the State may choose either to delegate to the IL service provider all authority for the determination of eligibility for these services and for the development of an IL plan for individuals receiving these services or to retain this authority. Proposed §§364.50 through 364.56 would impose post-award conditions on the State and its subgrantees or contractors regarding the processing of referrals and applications (§364.50), determinations of eligibility and ineligibility (§364.51), initiation and development of an IL plan (§364.52), maintenance of consumer service records (§364.53), prohibition on durational limitations for IL services (§364.54), compliance with standards for service providers (§364.55), and procedures for the protection, use, and release of personal information (§364.56). Proposed §§364.51, 364.52, and 364.53 would incorporate sections 704(e) and 725(b)(2) of the Act. In addition, proposed §364.53 would be consistent with the proposed indicators of what constitutes compliance with the evaluation standards in section 725(b) of the Act.
