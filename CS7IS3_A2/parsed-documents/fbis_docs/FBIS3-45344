"The plan is part of the government's much-publicized `southern strategy' to strengthen economic ties with Southeast Asia," Sheu explained. "It is devised to provide more assistance to Taiwan entrepreneurs in their business and investment activities in the region," Sheu noted. "By doing this we hope our manufacturers will divert some of their investment from Mainland China to Southeast Asian nations and thus help reduce Taiwan's growing economic dependence on the mainland," Sheu said. Under the plan, Sheu said, the government will seek to eliminate investment barriers and expand bilateral trade and technological cooperation with ASEAN member states and Indochinese countries. In the initial stages, the plan will target Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia, he explained. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, while Indochinese countries include Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Sheu said government research units will intensify study of economic activities, investment climate and trade regulations in Southeast Asian nations, and delegations will be organized to visit the region to collect first-hand information. The economics ministry will help local manufacturers find suitable sites to accommodate production facilities and distribution centers in Southeast Asian countries, Sheu noted. The ministry will also make good use of the international economic cooperation and development fund to boost economic relations with Southeast Asian countries. In addition, the ministry will hold regular trade consultations with its Southeast Asian counterparts to resolve bilateral trade issues and work out possible cooperative projects. Over the next three years, Sheu said, the government will invite influential Southeast Asian finance officials, bankers and business leaders to visit Taiwan. "The move aims to help Taiwan businessmen with interests in Southeast Asia get loans to finance their operations there," Sheu noted. The government will also ask Southeast Asian countries to simplify visa procedures for Taiwan businessmen and set up a "Taipei desk" in their government investment offices to offer information and counseling services for Taiwan investors. Sheu said the plan will be sent to the Executive Yuan for deliberation and approval. A special committee formed by high-ranking officials from related government agencies will meet every three months to check the plan's progress, he added.
