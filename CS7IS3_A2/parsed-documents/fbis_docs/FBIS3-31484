Reportedly, Mr. Dimitrov informed the SDS parliamentary group about his intention yesterday, commentaries on the issue appeared in today's press. The SDS leader made a special statement claiming misinterpretation of what he had said. His intention prompted a series of explanations by representatives of the SDS. In his statement Mr. Dimitrov described the adoption of the Judiciary Organization Act on Tuesday as an "open communist counter-revolution." "The SDS chairman's walking out of parliament, backed by the SDS parliamentary group, can be interpreted as a clear signal of our readiness to react strongly if the act enters into force. Until that time the parliamentary SDS must go on fighting," Mr. Filip Dimitrov said. Several SDS organizations has recently proposed that the SDS MP's walk out of parliament to provoke early elections. In 1991 the SDS precipitated the elections taking a similar step. By Tuesday, the day on which the SDS top leadership holds its regular meetings, the coalition had not taken a stand on a possible boycott of parliament. Representatives of several influential SDS parties, including the Democratic Party and the Radical Democratic Party, let it be understood that they did not agree with walking out of the National Assembly. Local analysts believe that the unity of the coalition, which already suffered a serious split in 1991, is questionable. Some of the MP's, opposing the SDS walking out of parliament now, took part in the 1991 parliamentary boycott. In their view, such an act now would be in vain. This afternoon a number of representatives of the coalition came out with statements commenting on the SDS leader's intention to walk out of parliament. It became clear that Mr. Filip Dimitrov did not actually walk out of parliament, but intends to do so backed by the MP's of the SDS parliamentary group in protest against the communist counter-revolution in parliament, as he put it. SDS MP Zlatka Ruseva (affiliated to the Democratic Party) said that Mr. Dimitrov's decision was a personal one. "We are going to consider some variants of action, Mr. Dimitrov's variant is one of the possible ways of action, but the decision is to be made at a general meeting of the SDS leadership and the SDS parliamentary group," MP Nikolay Khristov, deputy floor leader of the SDS parliamentary group, told reporters.
