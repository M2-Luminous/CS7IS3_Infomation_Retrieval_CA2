He stayed longer than planned. In no time at all, the head of the diplomatic mission had called important ministry officials and managers. The chairman of the foreign trade commission of the German Association of Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) met them the very next day. According to Messer, a year ago such a prompt response "would have been unthinkable." This exceptional service is soon to become the rule. The chancellor and ministers, diplomats and association representatives, all want to help the shaken German export industry. While formerly the entrepreneurs of the Federal Republic were "always individual fighters," as Tarun Das, chief of the Indian Industry Association, recalls, "they now regularly bring along their politicians." Only rarely does a firm from Germany still risk the leap into a new foreign market. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt says that politicians must "actively support" German enterprises in conquering foreign markets. According to Helmut Kohl's chief economist, promoting the export industry will be at "the very top of the priority list" until the end of the legislative period. The days are past when German politicians displayed a noble reserve and praised the advantages of free trade at international conferences. In the future, says Rainer Haungs, the economic spokesman of the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] parliamentary caucus, who himself has a medium-sized business, the government and associations "will interfere more than previously." Ludolf-Georg von Wartenberg, chief manager of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), summarizes the new trend, where worldwide competition by enterprises has long been supplanted "by competition of nations." The secret model: the Japanese. They have always concentrated on concerted action in foreign trade. As Japan researcher Hanns-Guenther Hilpert of the Munich Ifo-Institute for Economic Research found out, Tokyo has very purposefully "supported" expansion of Japanese enterprises "in the growth markets in Southeast Asia." The result: In 1993, Japan achieved an export surplus of $56 billion in trade with its neighbors--more than with the United States. By contrast, Germany's share in global exports dropped from 11.3 to 10.2 percent in the past years. In the booming developing countries of Southeast Asia alone, the Japanese invested 58 billion German marks [DM] per year, the Germans a mere DM2 billion. German corporation managers are alarmed that all trading nations are meanwhile re-arming. U.S. President Bill Clinton only recently declared exports to be the most important goal of foreign policy. As an internal strategy paper of the U.S. Department of Commerce states, "we have had good experiences due to aggressive government support." Now the Germans want those, too. They promote foreign [trade] fairs, establish joint offices and trade centers--and travel. Above all, travel. Last year, Rexrodt twice visited the People's Republic of China. Chancellor Helmut Kohl added to his Japan trip a quick visit to South Korea. And even Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his colleague in the Environmental Ministry, Klaus Toepfer, promoted German enterprises abroad: Kinkel in the rising Vietnam market, and Toepfer during a visit to the former trade hub of the Near East, Lebanon. Bonn also intends to support the export industry financially, much more so than to date. Thus Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured industry of support for the Asia-Pacific Commission of German Industry (APA) established last year. As it did recently at the first international conference in Bangkok, APA is looking for new ways to improve the presence of Germans in the world's Number One growth market. Under the aegis of the land-owned Suedwestdeutsche Landesbank (SuedwestLB), in the spring of 1995 a German House will open its doors in Singapore, and will not only provide consultation and contacts to medium-sized businesses, but also offices and machine shops. This new Bonn activity is surely important, and the many travels, congresses, and seminars are well-meant. But it is not yet certain by far whether the new joining of ranks between politics and industry will be successful. German export policy is still lacking sensible financing tools, and the laender are often competing with each other beyond the German borders. The enterprises themselves must "recognize their opportunities," says Otto Graf Lambsdorff, FDP [Free Democratic Party] economics spokesman. Although political pressure is appropriate, it cannot substitute for the lack of competitiveness. The government's new activism is not even well-received by the enterprises. After the recent flops on large orders, such as those of the ICE [Intercity Express] consortium in Texas and South Korea and of Dasa in refurbishing the Saudi airfleet, German enterprises continue to feel left in the lurch, despite all the chancellor's and ministers' travels. An exclusive poll by the Ifo-Institute among 704 enterprises and managers for WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE showed that over half of industrial enterprises have a low opinion of the Federal Government's foreign trade policy. German enterprises, be they medium-sized or on the top floor of German industry, demand of the government, above all, better financing conditions. Of the top managers polled by the Ifo-Institute, 70 percent plead for interest subsidies when it concerns the new markets in East Asia, Latin America, and India. How it could work in the future was demonstrated by Siemens with the subway order in Canton, China. The electric/electronics corporation procured for its partners, short of foreign exchange, a loan financed half and half with German budget funds and via the capital market. Siemens now hopes for similarly favorable financing in the race for expansion of the commuter transport system in Shanghai. Siemens managers calculate that--if low interest rates continue--the German export industry in 1994 alone could finance orders worth DM1.5 billion with cheap development aid credits. Upshot of the calculations: "That has a stimulating effect on the employment situation." True, Minister Rexrodt rejects the close linking of development aid to export orders and hence refuses his approval of respective industry applications. But pressure from industry is growing. The top corporations are annoyed that countries such as Japan and France support their exporters with much more generous credit assistance. Not only large enterprises feel the subsidy race. For example, a North Rhine-Westphalian machine builder had no chance in China with an order worth 23 million [as published] because the Dutch competition could offer it at half the price. The reason: The Chinese received 45 percent of the export value as a present, in the form of development aid. Small businesses in particular suffer abroad from the darker sides of German federalism. The land rulers and their economics ministers not only compete with Kohl and Rexrodt, but also fight each other fiercely. Just recently, Bavaria presented itself at the technology fair in Bangkok as the 13th largest export country of the world. Baden-Wuerttemberg's Minister President Erwin Teufel traveled with over 100 enterprise representatives to China--no Western visitor before him had ever taken along that many. Even Saarland's Finance Minister Hans Kasper went on a selling tour in the People's Republic and garnered orders worth millions for Saarland enterprises. Especially piquant: The Saarberg subsidiary Interplan, and the mining subcontractors Walter Becker and Preinfalk not only beat out the Japanese, but also the competition from North Rhine-Westphalia. Such particularism, argue the members of the Asia-Pacific Commission of German Industry heatedly, must finally stop. In the future, the activity of the Federal Government, laender, and industry must "be bundled and implemented purposefully." And if at times it does not work out, as with ICE, says Johannes von Thadden, head of the foreign trade chambers at DIHT, then "we will react quite flexibly." Since TGV has been beating ICE in many markets, the German Foreign Trade Chamber organizes purchasing seminars in Paris with the French manufacturer--so that German enterprises at least have a chance as ancillary suppliers.
