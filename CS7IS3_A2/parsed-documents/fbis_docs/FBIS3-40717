There was a significant increase in the votes for the Janata Dal. It will not be easy for the Congress (I) to form another government or win the 1995 general election . It is very likely that Shiv Sena will take over the Bombay Corporation again. It appears that the Muslim voters have not forgotten the destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992 and the destructive riots that followed it. That is why they did not vote for the Congress (I) candidates. Almost 100 percent Muslim votes went to the Janata Dal candidates. If we compared the results of the general elections held two years ago with these bye-elections, we will find that the votes for the Janata Dal have almost doubled. In Dharawi, the Janata Dal candidate received 3388 votes. Similarly, in Tulsiwadi and Nayagaon, they received more than 1400 votes compared to the 800 votes received last year. The backward classes also did not give all of its votes to the Congress (I) because of the change in nomenclature. They did not only not vote for the Congress, but did not give full support even to Savita Jitia (Tardev), a Dalit candidate representing coalition of the Congress and Republican Party of India. The number of the Dalits in that district was more than half. The Shiv Sena leaders are overjoyed at this victory and the Congress (I) leaders have started to accuse each other. The unhappy group of Congress councilors is ready to come out in the open against Ramanand Lad, the leader in the Corporation. Veteran city councilor R.T. Kadam is leading this group of young councilors. He himself is also in the race for becoming the mayor. Mr. Lad has lost some prestige because of the defeats of Congress candidates, especially in Dharavi. Ramanand Lad (the future mayor) was given the responsibility of making sure that the Congress (I) candidate from here wins. It will be difficult for the Congress (I) to have its candidate as the mayor. The Shiv Sena has increased its number of seats from 67 to 71 after winning four more seats. The number of Congress members is 109 now. The number of the joint opposition has increased to 110. These numbers clearly indicate that there will be a lot of bartering during the next mayoral elections in March 1994. Looking at the committed supporters of Shiv Sena, and the Muslim and Dalit voters who are unhappy with the Congress (I), it is clear that the Shiv Sena might win the majority in the next election. The Muslims knew that voting for the Janata Dal was indirectly voting for the Shiv Sena. Still, they did not vote for the Congress (I). Mr. Gunwant Seth, a Congress worker who visited homes for votes during the election, said that the Muslim voters expressed distrust in the Congress (I) in these words, "We can give the key to our house to Shiv Sena people, not to the Congress (I). The Congress (I) leaders are blaming these reasons, bogus votes, lack of committed workers, and the fact that the major leaders did not take this election seriously for their defeat.
