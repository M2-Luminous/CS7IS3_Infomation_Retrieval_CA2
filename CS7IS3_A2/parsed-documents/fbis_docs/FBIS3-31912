In addition, the possibility of also making such payments at branches of the government-intervened bank on 29 and 30 January is being analyzed. Esperanza Martino, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] president, has said her organization has deposited funds into the BCV to settle Banco Latino debts with small-savings account holders. Those who have accounts with less than 100,000 bolivares--that is, about 326,000 accounts--will be paid during the first phase. Meanwhile, those account holders who have up to 1 million bolivares must wait until Fogade makes a 60-billion bolivar deposit. Meanwhile, Colonel (Numa Coz Briceno), Metropolitan Police Intelligence Division chief, has said a large-scale operation will be conducted beginning 28 January around Banco Latino branches to protect depositors from possible holdups.

[Unidentified reporter, interrupting] I beg your pardon. [Martino] 60 billion bolivares. [Reporter] In addition to the 25 billion bolivares? [Martino] In addition to the 25 billion bolivares. We are procuring funds to make them available to the BCV. I want to tell you that we are maintaining a perfect relation with the BCV, and we are working together. I think we will have good news for account holders. [end recording]
