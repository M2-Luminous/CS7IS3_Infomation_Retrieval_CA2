FR940831-2-00119 FR940831-2-00089 The Exchange also is amending Rules 451(b)(1) and (2), which deal with what soliciting material the member organization receiving proxy information shall transmit and when such transmission shall occur. As amended, Rule 451(b)(1) provides that the member organization may transmit, with soliciting material, a request for voting instructions and a statement to the effect that, if such instructions are not received by the tenth day before the meeting, the proxy may be given at discretion by the owner of record of the stock, provided that such statement may be made only when the proxy soliciting material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser at least fifteen days before the meeting. As amended, Rule 451(b)(1) also provides that when the proxy soliciting material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser twenty-five days or more before the meeting, the statement accompanying such material shall be to the effect that the proxy may be given fifteen days before the meeting at the discretion of the owner of the record of the stock. Rule 451(b)(2), as amended, provides that, instead of the material submitted under Rule 451(b)(1), the member organization may transmit with the soliciting material a signed proxy indicating the number of shares held for the beneficial owner and bearing a symbol identifying the proxy records of such member organization, and a letter informing the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser of the necessity for completing the proxy form and forwarding it to the person soliciting proxies in order that the shares may be represented at the meeting. The Exchange also is modifying two Supplementary Material provisions to Rule 451. Supplementary Material .10_Annual Reports_is being amended to provide that annual reports shall be transmitted to beneficial owners or to beneficial owners' designated investment advisers under the same conditions as those applying to proxy soliciting material under Rule 451 even though it is not proxy soliciting material under the proxy rules of the Commission. Supplementary Material .60_Duty to transmit even when requested not to_currently provides that proxy material must be sent to a beneficial owner even though such owner has instructed the member organization not to do so. The Exchange is qualifying the provision so that proxy material must be sent even though the beneficial owner has instructed not to do so, unless the beneficial owner has instructed the member organization in writing to send such material to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser. The Exchange also is adding provisions for a beneficial owner's designated investment adviser to Rule 452_Giving of Proxies by Member Organization, Voting procedure without instructions. As amended, the Rule provides that a member who has transmitted proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owner of stock or to an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for the beneficial owner and has been designated in writing by the beneficial owner of such stock (``designated investment adviser'') to receive soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner and solicited voting instructions in accordance with the provisions of Rule 451, and who has not received instructions from the beneficial owner or from the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser by the date specified in the statement accompanying such material, may give or authorize giving of a proxy to vote such stock, provided certain enumerated conditions are met. The Exchange is making two changes to Rule 452 Supplementary Material .10_Giving a Proxy To Vote Stock. As amended, paragraphs (1) and (2) state that a member organization may give a proxy to vote stock provided that: (1) It has transmitted proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owner of stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser in accordance with Rule 451 and (2) it has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner or from the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser by the date specified in the statement accompanying such material. The remaining condition in paragraph (3) is unchanged. Rule 465_Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material_currently provides that a member organization, upon request by a company, and when furnished with copies of interim reports of earnings or other material sent to stockholders, and satisfactory assurance that it will be reimbursed by such company for out-of-pocket expenses , shall transmit such reports of material to each beneficial owner of stock of such company held by the member organization and registered in a name other than the name of the beneficial owner. The Exchange is qualifying Rule 465 by adding the following to the end of the Rule: ``unless the beneficial owner has instructed the member organization in writing to transmit such reports or material to a designated investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner.'' The Exchange states that the proposed rule change will not diminish a beneficial owner's rights to receive proxy related materials and to vote proxies. Rather, it will give beneficial owners the option to designate their investment adviser as the person to receive such materials and to vote proxies. The Exchange also believes that the changes will enable member organizations to comply with customer desires concerning transmission of proxy materials and proxy voting. III. Discussion of Comments The Commission received five comment letters recommending approval of this proposal. In its comment letter, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. (``Sanford'') strongly endorses the NYSE's proposed rule changes relating to voting of proxies and transmission of proxy and related issuer material. 8 Sanford states that for many years those clients for which it acts as an investment adviser, managing accounts and purchasing securities, have requested that it vote proxies and receive annual reports and other related materials in connection with the securities they own. Sanford asserts that its clients find it incomprehensible that they may give Sanford the power to determine the securities to be bought and sold but are not able to give them the ability to vote their proxies. 8 See letter from Roger Hertog, President, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated January 27, 1994. Sanford asserts that when clients open an advisory account they often do so in order to obtain the professional money management services of the adviser and because they have determined that they do not have the time, expertise, or desire to handle their own investments, and they often do not want to be responsible for proxy voting or to receive voluminous issuer reports. Sanford also asserts that such clients have no need for issuer materials since they have already determined that the adviser is to have authority to make investment decisions. Sanford believes that since such advisory clients frequently have little familiarity with or knowledge of specific securities, they are often ill equipped to vote proxies from such issuers.
