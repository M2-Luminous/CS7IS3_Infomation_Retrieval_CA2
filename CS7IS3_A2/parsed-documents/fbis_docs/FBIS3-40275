The meeting was attended by Jovan Zebic, the deputy prime minister of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], Nikola Stanic, the coordinator of the team of experts for monetary reconstruction and economic recovery of the FRY, Momo Pejic, the governor of the National Bank of the RS, Misa Jandric, the head of the Center for Development at the FRY Government, several ministers in the governments of the RS and the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], and a number of scientists, businessmen, and bankers. Apart from the essential features of the measures, most of the attention centered on future relations between Yugoslavia and the RS and RSK, and how monetary reconstruction will affect them. Speaking about the unification of the monetary system, Stanic underlined that agreement must be reached on two key issues because the flow of goods, capital, and people on both sides of the Drina [river dividing Serbia proper and the Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina] must be completely free in the economic sense, while unification, due to the climate in international relations, should be carried out on the basis of agreements concluded between the three governments. Stanic proposed that groups of experts from all three Serb states be formed for several important areas. The governors of the national banks should become members of the board of the Yugoslav National Bank, and groups should also be formed for coordinating the fiscal system, customs, and customs protection toward third countries, as well as for coordinating regulations on foreign capital.
