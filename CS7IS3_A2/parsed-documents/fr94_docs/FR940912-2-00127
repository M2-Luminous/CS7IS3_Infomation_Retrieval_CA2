The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Exchange has revised certain fees associated with the activity of Designated Dealers 4 as it relates to their transactions on the CSE. The revisions became effective on the date the fee change was filed with the Commission. The changes are as follows: (1) Designated Dealer base fees are reduced from $0.01125 per share to $0.0075 per share; (2) member proprietary trades are increased from $0.015 per share to $0.02 per share; (3) no fee will be imposed for transactions in tape B securities; 5 (4) the minimum average per share for a Designated Dealer is reduced from $0.0047 per share to $0.0046 per share; and (5) the second level of fees for Designated Dealers that preference transactions has been reduced from $0.0018 per share to $0.0015 per share. 4 A ``Designated Dealer'' is defined as a proprietary member who maintains a minimum net capital of at least the greater of $100,000 or the amount required under Rule 15c3&hyph;1 of the Act, and who has been approved by the Securities Committee to perform market functions by entering bids and offers for designated issues into the system. See CSE Rule 11.9(a)(3). 5 The Exchange stated that Tape B securities are American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') listed securities. 2. Statutory Basis The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular, in that it is not designated to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers and in general is designed to protect investors and the public interest. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.
