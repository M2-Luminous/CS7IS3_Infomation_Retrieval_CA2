The counties will pioneer economic development and social security reform in the next three to five years as a pilot project for national growth, a State official said in an interview with CHINA DAILY over the weekend. They will serve as a case-study for authorities reviewing the on- going national rural reforms. The programme is based around the concept of making rich counties richer and allowing poor counties to climb out of poverty, said an official from the State Commission for Economic Restructuring (SCER). Experts and government officials will provide specialist advice and help solve problems emerging from local reforms, the SCER official said. Each model county will have a special fund from its province or city to ensure smooth development of reform. These counties are scattered in ten [as published] provinces such as Zhaodong in Heilongjiang, Haicheng and Wafangdian in Liaoning, Huanghua in Hebei, Gongyi in Henan, Guanghan and Fuling in Sichuan, Xuanzhou in Anhui, Yangxin in Shandong, Shanyin in Shanxi, Changshu in Jiangsu, Zengcheng in Guangdong and Shunyi in Beijing. Seven of them are in affluent river delta areas or in regions adjoining big cities while the rest lay in inland and mountainous regions. By China's standards, five of them are considered "developed," six are "moderately developed" and the other two are "less developed." "We choose those counties because they represent the actual conditions in this country, where levels of economic development differ greatly in different regions," the official said. County-owned enterprises will be encouraged to switch either to a shareholding or shareholding co-operative system. Some of them will diversify to include related industrial production to enhance market competition. The key parts of social security reform will be establishing solid health insurance plans and pension funds. Local labour markets will also be developed to guide the flow of the surplus rural workforce, according to the official. Reform of local science and education will be carried out in line with the local economic development. Capital drawn into the pilot counties from overseas investors as well as other provinces should be used to cultivate natural resources, the official said. These pilot counties will continue to push reform of local governments to serve the region's economic development. The official said SCER will help hammer out a monitoring programme to oversee the reform process in these counties. The project's evaluation will be thorough and objective and reflect the implementation of the reforms. Information exchanges in these model counties should be enhanced to distribute their experiences. The SCER official stressed each county will be able to carry out individualized reform measures.
