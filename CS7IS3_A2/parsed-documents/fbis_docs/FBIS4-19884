New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert said that the visit has been neutral--neither positive nor negative--and this has caused some optimism in the Greek delegation. Mr. Evert noted that we have received more pressure on the Bosnian and Turkish issues and that the Greek prime minister did not succeed in convincing the Americans to put pressure on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. He added: I believe that tomorrow's meeting between Mr. Karolos Papoulias and Mr. Cyrus Vance will be important; we will see how the situation develops. Mr. Evert concluded: It is a colorless visit with compliments and nice speeches, but I have not as yet seen any results. Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said: Despite the dangerous concessions and serious vagueness that appeared at yesterday's news conference, I would not like to make my positions known in public so long as the country's prime minister is abroad. I will wait for his return and his briefing of the opposition. Mr. Samaras concluded: The only thing I can say now is that I am deeply concerned. Former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis made a statement today referring to the question of Skopje's name. He said: Nobody can deny that it is better to be named North Macedonia or New Macedonia rather than plain Macedonia. There is no doubt about this. As soon as Mitsotakis' statement became known, New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert responded: New Democracy's positions are known and firm. The Greek Communist Party has assessed that the prime minister's visit to the United States marks and seals Greece's full submission to the U.S. aggressive and warlike policy in the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. This policy aims at converting this region, at any cost, into a zone of U.S. interests and influence. Commenting on the statements by the Greek prime minister and the U.S. President, the Coalition of the Left and of Progress Party points out, among other things, that excessive expectations are being cultivated once again about the development of our national issues for reasons of domestic consumption. Unfortunately, the party statement adds, Mr. Papandreou's belated pro-American turn continues to be based on self-illusions about the role and aims of the U.S. policy on the Balkans.
