Regional fighting renewed on Thursday after two Georgian battalions supported by armor had tried to break through tunnels in Kodor Pass. A deputy Abkhazian defence minister described the attack as well- prepared but Abkhazian troops stepped in quickly to suppress it. Two Georgian tanks were destroyed as well as one artillery piece and one rocket launcher. Several Abkhazian soldiers were injured. The Abkhazian defence ministry fears a possible attack on Abkhazian positions amid reports of Georgian troop concentration along the Ingur river separating the two sides. In the meantime, head of Abkhazia's pro-Georgian government Zurab Erkvania told our correspondent in Tbilisi that the Abkhazians burnt down the village of Nabakevi in the Gal region.
