In a joint press statement, the first to be issued on the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations concerning ways to implement autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, the two delegations said they discussed three major issues during their committee meetings. They discussed the Security Committee, the Civilian Affairs Committee, and the Detainees Committee. The statement said that regarding security issues, the two delegations focused on security measures in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho areas, the planning, size, and deployment of Palestinian security forces, and some other related issues. The statement added that the Security Committee discussed historical sites, communications, land registration, and civil registration. The statement cited the two delegation heads saying they were satisfied with the progress made during this round and had hopes of making further progress at future meetings in Cairo. They expressed their gratitude to President Husni Mubarak, the Egyptian Government, and the Egyptian people for their warm hospitality and their constant assistance to the negotiators. Dr. Nabil Sha'th, speaking at a news conference following the statement's release, announced that much was achieved in the past two weeks and that only a few issues remain unresolved. He said this will need two, or at most three, weeks to complete. Sha'th added that it is difficult to specify a date for the prospective meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to sign the final agreement. He explained that setting a date depends on many issues connected with the two men's prior engagements. Sha'th asserted that determining the numbers in the Palestinian police force does not pose a problem and will be discussed when the issue is submitted to 'Arafat and Rabin. He asserted that the statement issued today has special significance because it is the first joint statement about the Palestinian-Israeli Gaza-Jericho negotiations. He noted that this reflects both sides' commitment to implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Sha'th said the two sides have made progress in connection with most of the issues pertaining to the transfer of the civilian authority. Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq said he totally agrees with Dr. Sha'th that real progress was made in the past two weeks, noting that the two delegations will seek to finalize agreement on other issues next week. He asserted that last week's negotiations were useful, noting that the two sides are now very close to an agreement. Regarding the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, Shahaq said: We are negotiating so that the withdrawal will take place in line with the agreement between the two parties. The withdrawal will not take place unless the negotiations are completed. Sha'th said the next round of negotiations in Cairo will involve meetings of all the committees, noting that talks are also under way to draw up the draft of the general agreement. Regarding the Israeli commitment to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho by 13 April, Sha'th remarked that this is a very important date, adding: We are doing our best to complete the negotiations so that the commitment to withdraw on the specified date will be fulfilled. Sha'th added that in connection with the Palestinian detainees, the Palestinian side is seeking to obtain a general amnesty for all former strugglers. On the work of the confidence building committee, Shahaq said the committee discussed all the relevant issues, especially Palestinian detainees. Sha'th said work during the current round of talks was based on maps and agreements were reached on the size of the Palestinian police force [as received], the border and the vicinity of the Israeli settlements, and security measures on roads and at the border. Sha'th said other security points, such as security at sea, in the air, on the coast, and on the road between Gaza and Jericho remain to be agreed upon during next week's talks. He said agreements on many other daily concerns for Palestinians, such as registering the lands of Palestinian absentees, state land, historical sites, communications, and telecommunications, have been reached. There was also an agreement on a Palestinian radio station, a television station, and ground contacts with communication satellites, Sha'th said. He said all this will allow the Palestinian authority and the Palestinians, from the beginning of the Palestinian authority, to contact Palestinians abroad, the Arab world, and the outside world through the radio and television stations. He said the general 15-point agreement, which constitutes a preamble for the civilian, security, and other appendices, will be finalized and negotiations on the general amnesty agreement will be completed. Dr. Sha'th said the Palestinians sensed no Israeli attempt to obstruct the negotiations. Indeed, he explained, the talks were objective and positive. He expressed satisfaction with the progress of the talks this week and last. He noted that the two sides are working seriously to reach an agreement as soon as possible. Sha'th reiterated that the size of Jericho will be determined in the upcoming meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Shahaq said the release of the Palestinian detainees will take place when an agreement is reached. He stressed that those detained after 13 September 1993, the day Israel and the PLO signed the Declaration of Principles in Washington, will not be released. On the participation of Rabin's policy adviser Ya'qov Neriah in the talks, Sha'th said the entire delegation represents Prime Minister Rabin, who is responsible for the results of the negotiations. Neriah's participation, he said, adds positively to the composition of the Israeli delegation. Sha'th stressed the importance of a general amnesty for all Palestinian detainees before signing an agreement on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord.
