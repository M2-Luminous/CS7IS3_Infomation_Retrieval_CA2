This was reported by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. The prime minister's office denies that Yitzhaq Rabin plans to travel to Morocco. The prime minister and the foreign minister had planned to leave for Morocco immediately after the signing of the Israeli- Palestinian agreement in Cairo on 4 May, but the visit was canceled at the last moment. It now appears that only Mr. Peres will visit Morocco.
