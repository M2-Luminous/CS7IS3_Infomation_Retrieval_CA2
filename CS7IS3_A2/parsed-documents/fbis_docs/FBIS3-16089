According to him, the resignation was due to the fact that a foreign ministry's official laid off because he had worked for seven years for the KGB had been reinstated by Chechen President Johar Dudayev. However, observers said the real reason for the resignation was the government's resolution on significant reduction in the number of the foreign ministry's personnel (up to 14 people).
