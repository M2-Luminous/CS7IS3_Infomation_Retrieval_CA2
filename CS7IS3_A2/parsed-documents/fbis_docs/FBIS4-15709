A statement by the Ukrainian Navy's press service says that the hydrographical vessel Cheleken left the port of Odessa overnight and is at present heading for Sevastopol. The press center says that Ukrainian border guards were prevented from boarding the ship by armed Russian sailors who had allegedly been ordered to open fire in the event of any action measures by the Ukrainian side. Interfax asked the Black Sea Fleet headquarters to clarify the situation. The headquarters said that the incident is linked to the fact that Ukraine has stopped financing the navigational services in the Black Sea and, since by treaty they are meant to be funded by Kiev as well by Moscow, Russia cannot and does not intend to finance the services at its own expense.
