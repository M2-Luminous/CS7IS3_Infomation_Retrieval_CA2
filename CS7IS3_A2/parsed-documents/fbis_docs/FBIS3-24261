Judging from the operational data of daily monitoring of prices by state statistical organs, the past month was not as bleak as January. The inflation rate was substantially lower. If you remember, at that time the level of inflation was 22 percent, growing by 6-7 percent a week at times. But during the first two weeks in February, the inflation index was 4 percent, and in the second half of the month--no more than 2 percent. The general inflation index was 109.9 percent, and since the start of the year--134.1 percent. The prices of paid services rose most markedly for us. Their rates rose substantially faster than prices for food and industrial goods. This did not occur suddenly and according to predictions will not end soon. This February the prices for paid personal services rose by 14.3 percent, while they rose by 9.4 percent for food items and by 10 percent for industrial goods. In the list of cities of Russia being studied, Moscow went from 35th to 33rd place in terms of higher prices. Here the cost of the group of the 19 most important food items rose by 4,388 rubles [R] and now totals R45,400. In St. Petersburg the group now costs R42,600, which was 13.3 percent higher than in January. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

The simplest food items rose in price at a fast rate this time; these are the items our old folks, children, and low-income persons live on. During the month the price of vegetables rose sharply--by 22 percent; of dairy products--by 19 percent; and of groats and macaroni products--by 16 percent. The price of fish products and animal fat rose by 13 percent. During the month the prices of the following items rose least of all: fruit--by 4.1 percent; vegetable oil--by 3.6 percent; and sugar--by 1.1 percent. Vodka got 1.4 percent cheaper. In both stores and at markets prices mostly rose for the very same goods, which attests to the objectivity of the processes. But the rise in prices for vegetables at markets was higher and totaled 25 percent. But then prices for fish, milk, and eggs rose substantially less at markets. In all, prices for foodstuffs have risen as follows since the start of the year: for dairy products--by a factor of 1.6; for vegetables--by a factor of 1.5; and for baked goods, animal fat, and salt--by a factor of 1.4. The average cost for the group of 19 for Russia as a whole on 28 February was R41,300. But there are substantial differences. For prices of organized trade, the figure is R39,800, but for market prices it is R54,100 [unclear]. There has always been only one answer to the eternal question, "Where is it best to live": "Somewhere else." But even so... Look at the map of Russia. It is divided into parts and colored in different tones. Darker--inflation is higher than the average Russian level, the brightest part--inflation is lower than the average Russian level. The average between them is the average Russian level plus or minus 1 percent. The gap between the maximum and minimum cost of the group in various cities of the country is a factor of 3.4. The Volga Region is one of the "cheapest" regions, but within it there are differences in prices. Thus, in Ulyanovsk the group of 19 items costs R24,100, while next door, in Tolyatti--R54,400. The most expensive cities in terms of the cost of the group of most important foodstuffs remain the cities of the Far East region, Magadan (R97,000), Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (R83,800), and Vladivostok (R83,300). Inflation Indexes for Economic Regions of Russia in February 1994 Where Should You Go for a Suit? The city of Rubtsovsk, of course. There in January a man's suit (two-piece) cost ten thirty-ninths the price in Vorkuta. And by the end of February the gap had increased even more and now equals ten forty-ninths the price. Barely one-fifth. For Russia overall, prices for nonfood goods rose by 10 percent. Last month the price of fuel rose the most--by 55 percent, of medicine--by 23 percent, of synthetic laundry detergent--by 22 percent, and of wallpaper--by 20 percent. Prices for shoes and tobacco products changed the least--by 7 percent. That is the analysis of the month's prices made by the Center of Economic Market Conditions under the Russian Federation government. What Things Cost Abroad Germany Bread is expensive in Germany. One kilogram costs roughly 2.5 marks, which in our money equals about R2,000. But if you compare it with earnings, bread costs Germans less than it does us. Did the price of bread rise after reunification? Yes, many times over, roughly 8-fold. And right after the reunification of Germany, on 1 July 1990. Common money was introduced and right away free prices. The next day, one might say. Did the prices of other goods rise to the same degree? No, the price of bread rose most of all. Because in the GDR bread used to be almost free, the government subsidized the baking of it. Prices for domestic goods are like this. One can buy a television for 500 marks. That is 3 days work for an average paid specialist. The televisions, it is true, are from Taiwan, and small and their service life is 3-4 years. But their quality is pretty good. There are, of course, televisions for 10,000 marks too. That is two and one-half months work for a specialist. Different sums, different quality. The difference is 20-fold. In our country practically all televisions are from Taiwan or similar countries. But their cost is not 3 days work for a specialist but 2-3 months work. And only if the specialist has a pretty good job. The average wage of a specialist in the former East Germany is 3,100 marks. That is 75 percent of the West's. Inflation In Finland 1 loaf of white bread costs approximately 8 marks and sugar costs just as much. Butter costs an average of 34 marks for a kilogram. Milk is 4-5 marks. Fresh meat, not frozen, is about 80 marks, the worst, about 40 marks. Half a kilogram of granulated coffee costs 10-12 marks. Convert prices to the mark's rate and you will be convinced that the absolute price levels have not been reached yet. Our earnings are a different matter. They are not yet comparable.
