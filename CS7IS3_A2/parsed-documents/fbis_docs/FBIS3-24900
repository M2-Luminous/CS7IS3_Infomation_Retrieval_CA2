"Nobody is going to prevent us from completing our historic mission or from running the full course -- not those who perpetrate violence, not those who left us in the lurch at the negotiation table when we needed them, not those who now want to boycott and threaten," he said. Addressing the 2,000 delegates to the party's federal congress at a public meeting at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park, Mr de Klerk said there was no turning back. "We will keep negotiating, before the election and after the election. We are prepared to make reasonable adjustments but will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed. "Any attempt to create anarchy will be resisted with all our might." He said the ANC [African National Congress] would cast the country back into the dark ages. "It is a party secretly controlled by communists, militants and extremists. They are quiet now, but they will shout loudly if the ANC wins control. "Mr Mandela jokes that the next president might not come from the ANC, but it will be no joke if it is (SA Communist Party chairman) Mr Joe Slovo or Mrs Winnie Mandela." The ANC had spelt out its plans but would not keep its promises, he said. "It cannot. It does not know how to and it has never done so. "Mr Mandela and his party are searching for a new species of flora to finance its promises -- its called the money tree and banknotes grow on it to pay for the ANC's promises," said Mr de Klerk. "I wish the ANC luck in their search, but I don't think they'll find anything because the money tree and the ANC Manifesto are both fantasies. "Only fools believe in money trees and I do not believe the South African people are fools." He promised the NP would stand by its supporters in the townships throughout the election campaign. The NP's opponents should know there were no no-go areas for Mr de Klerk or the NP. The party's voice would be heard. The party's message was simply that it could be trusted, said Mr de Klerk. "In the face of the ANC's arrogant belief that it is going to win, I want to tell Mr Mandela that this is an election, not a coronation. The people have not yet spoken. The power is theirs, not yours." Other parties wanting to put the ANC in its place should stop wasting energy by fighting the NP as well.
