Now NEC has developed a high-wattage, high-efficiency klystron with an output of 100 kW and an efficiency of 76%, the world's best, as the top-of-the-line model of this product series. Because the electron beam bunching efficiency is dramatically improved in this klystron, for two of the seven cavity resonators we used higher harmonic cavity resonators coupled to the 2nd harmonic. We also selected a relatively small perveance and optimized the positions of the various cavities. Furthermore, along with high power, this klystron features excellent power resistance and output stability, and it is lightweight, compact, and has a long product life. This article describes points that were given special consideration during the design stage in developing this klystron and the properties that were obtained. 1. Introduction Recently microwaves are being used in industry for heating, drying, baking, sintering, etc., and in fields such as medicine, environmental protection and energy. The microwave sources in these microwave power systems must have high output, high efficiency, and high reliability. Magnetrons that have been used up till now have a low maximum single-tube output of about 15 kW, and they are also relatively short-lived. Klystrons, on the other hand, have a large single-tube output, excellent frequency stability, and are better in terms of lifetime as well, so klystrons have received a great deal of attention as replacements for magnetrons. In response to these needs, NEC has already developed high-efficiency klystrons with outputs of 30 kW and 80 kW (jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) in the 2.45 GHz frequency band.[.sup]1[/] To answer the need for greater power and higher efficiency, NEC has developed the world's first klystron that features a high output of 100 kW, an efficiency of better than 75%, and a long product life. This product is discussed below. 2. Design Policy In designing the high-efficiency klystron with a high power output of 100 kW, we made a comprehensive design of the main parts--the electron gun, high-frequency circuit and collector--on the high-precision CAD developed in house at NEC. The following points were given special consideration during design. (1) Cooling We planned to use the same water-cooled format for the collector that we used in the 30 kW and 80 kW klystrons, but because the power loss at the collector would be increased to about 150 kW, it would be necessary to use a large volume of water to cool the collector, and if we did not change the collector structure, the pressure loss in the cooling system would be too great. Moreover, it was also necessary to reduce pressure loss so we could make the device more compact. Therefore, we studied designs for the klystron collector cooling system that would allow us to maintain cooling efficiency while holding pressure loss in the cooling system to a minimum. (2) High Voltage Resistance We decided on a relatively small perveance in this klystron, so that meant the beam voltage would be quite high. Therefore, we had to consider ways to maintain the voltage resistance of the electron gun. (3) Beam Shape It is essential to obtain a uniform, rod-shaped beam with laminar flow in order to maintain stability during high-output operation. Therefore, we studied the electrode shape and magnetic circuit shape to realize the proper beam shape. (4) High-Frequency Circuit We designed the length of the high-frequency circuit based on the electrical circuit lengths of the 30 kW and 80 kW klystrons. Furthermore, to hold down heat generation in the drift tubes that accompanies such high output, we optimized the shapes of the drift tubes. Generally, if we increase the OD and the wall thickness of a drift tube, the cavity impedance R/Q will drop. As a result, our target efficiency is difficult to realize. Therefore, we considered how to make the R/Q value the same as in the 30 kW and 80 kW klystrons that we had already made. (5) Long Life and Reliability Generally, the life of the microwave tube is dependent on the life of the cathode that emits the electron beam. Therefore, we studied how to create a long-lived, highly-reliable cathode and adopted those modifications in this klystron. Next we determined the objective characteristics for this klystron as shown in Table 1. We set the operating frequency band at 2.45 GHz, which is the ISM band (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical), set output at 100 kW or better, and efficiency at 75% or better. Further, we considered the capability of the input pre-stage solid-state amplifier, and set a target gain of 48 dB or more. On the other hand, we also wanted the device to be constructed so it would produce the specified characteristics without adjustment when it was installed to facilitate maintenance and replacement operations. As far as cooling was concerned, we used water cooling for the body and the electromagnets, and forced air cooling for the electron gun. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Fig.1 Stimulation of Electron Beam Trajectory 3.1 Electron Gun Section With respect to perveance, which is an important parameter for the klystron, because there are problems with space-charge strength and velocity scattering, it is generally advantageous to have a low perveance value to focus the beam more easily and increase efficiency. On the other hand, there are disadvantages in terms of voltage resistance and compactness because the voltage is higher and the high-frequency circuit must be longer. Naturally, for the sake of compactness, the lower the beam voltage the better. We studied this overall problem and settled for a perveance of 0.5�A/V[.sup]3/2[/]. Therefore, because of the relationship between output and effectiveness, the beam voltage became 38.5 kVdc. The parameters of the electron gun are shown in Table 2. To obtain stable operation, it was necessary to increase voltage resistance between the electrodes and obtain an electron beam with laminar flow that has few ripples. Therefore, we used computer simulations to determine the cathode diameter, electron beam focusing ratio, distance between electrodes, and the design of the electromagnetic circuit that creates the magnetic field for focusing. Figure 1 shows the electron beam trajectory obtained by computer simulation. The ripple rate of this electron beam was an extremely small 1.5%, and thus we obtained an excellent electron beam. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

We used the CAD to optimize the shape of the collector so that it will capture the electron beam with greatest efficiency, and this enabled us to make it more compact overall. We used the same water-cooling format that we used on the 30 kW and 80 kW klystrons. Generally, as the Reynolds number gets higher the convective heat transfer between the collector and the cooling water improves and cooling efficiency increases. On the other hand, however, pressure loss also increases. In this 100 kW klystron we computed the optimal cooling grooves on the collector for maximum cooling efficiency with minimum pressure loss and were able to design a very small collector. 4. Performance Table 4 shows the operating characteristics of the klystron. The input/output properties under the operating conditions in Table 4 are shown in Figure 4. At a frequency of 2.45 GHz we obtained an output of more than 100 kW, a power gain of 50.5 dB, and under saturated output operation, a conversion efficiency of 76%. These were nearly identical to the computed values predicted by the CAD. Moreover, as far as weight is concerned, we were able to make the device compact and lightweight at about 60 kg. Cooling the collector requires a flow volume of 150 L/min of cooling water, and the pressure loss is a small value of 2.0 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] or less.

First of all, with respect to nMOS's drain current-gate voltage characteristics, even if drain voltage is raised to 2V, current quickly responds to this with precipitous rise, confirming the fact it is equipped with a function to increase width as a transistor. Secondly, as for the nMOS's properties of drain current and drain voltage, it has been confirmed that when source voltage is set at .1.5V , if gate voltage is below 0.6V, drain current will not flow (in other words, it has a cut-off property); also saturation characteristics has been confirmed for drain voltage. As for breakdown voltage by [punch-through], it was possible to obtain 3.5V, comfortably topping the 1.5V which is equivalent to the upper limit of power source voltage with current gate length. An increase in drain current resulting from [punch-through] was said to have been observed at around 4V. This was due to the 10nm-deep shallow junction formed through [punch through]. With a 30nm-deep junction, because of the [punch-through], the transistor cannot be activated below the 0.5V level. To Get Around the Problem of Short Channel, Hot Carrier With Toshiba's latest nMOS transistor, it became possible to make change in threshold voltage and suppress lowering of S factor (the inverse number of subthreshold current inclination). Hot carrier effect is said to be minimum. First of all, with respect to change in threshold voltage by short channel effect, the threshold voltage for the 1.5V drain voltage was controlled at below -0.16V through shortening of a gate length from 1 micron to 0.04 micron. This compares favorably with the case in which change of 0.1 V was obtained by shortening a gate length from 1 micron to 0.1 micron by using existing impurity-diffusion technology. As for the S factor, although inferior to 80mV/[keta], still it was able to obtain 100mV/[keta]. Toshiba found that it was difficult to generate hot carriers with the nMOS transistor. Measurement of impact-ionization ratio and drain voltage dependency of substrate current indicated that in both cases drain voltage plummeted to below 1.5V. Since this drain voltage of 1.5 V is very close to Si's energy gap of 1.1 V, it stands to reason that not many hot carriers will be generated under such conditions. Moreover, the energy level of most hot carriers generated( which is a low-probability event) in many cases tends to be low. For this reason, even if gate length becomes minute, effect of hot carriers will not be increased. It was possible to improve the transistor's driving power even with a 0.04 micron gate. With a 0.1 micron transistor, improvements in both drain current and mutual conductance have been in the range of from 30 to 40%. This will put drain current at 600mA/mm and mutual conductance at 450mS/mm. It used to be that, if below 0.2 micron, because of speed saturation, it was not possible to improve drive capability by miniaturization. However, the results of Toshiba's new transistor undermines this thinking. The company's plan for the immediate future will be to examine its mechanisms. Gate Length 0.04 micron, Junction Depth 10 nm In order to prevent short channel effect, something which must be done in order to obtain Toshiba's new transistor characteristics, it is necessary to make a junction 10nm deep for the gate length of 0.04 micron. In order to achieve the gate length of 0.04 micron, after the excimer laser has been exposed, a gate electrode was made still thinner using an isotropic [aciding]. Using the SEM measurement method, Toshiba verified the length of the gate to be 0.043 micron after etching. In order to obtain a shallow junction of 10nm, solid-phase P was diffused from a gate-side wall. The company used 1000�C, 10 seconds RTA (rapid thermal annealing) processing. Use of a solid-phase diffusion using RTA is a technique Toshiba has developed in order to develop a 0.1 micron pMOS transistor. In this case, Toshiba achieved a 40nm junction formation by diffusing B from BSG. On a Si substrate on which As is mounted, since P is inclined to be segregated more than B, Toshiba's thinking was that it would be easy to form a shallow junction. In the case of B, the company could not form the junction less shallow than 30nm. Fig. 3. Realizing Low Sheet Resistance Diffusion Layer Distribution of impurity in the direction of depth was examined by measuring SIMS and sheet resistance. Using the SIMS analysis, the company was able to verify that distribution in a 10nm zone was 10[.sup]18[/]/cm[.sup]3[/]. Sheet resistance was improved to achieve An overall process flow consists of the following: (1) formation of a field-separation oxidation film; (2) mounting of B on channels; (3) heat diffusion by a furnace unit; (4) formation of an oxidation film of a 3nm-thick gate using 800�C oxidation; (5) polycrystal Si film formation by adding P as impurity in-situ; (6) exposure of the gate using excimer laser; (7) processing designed to make resist thinner using aciding; (8) etching of gate polycrystal Si using RIE; (9) PSG film formation; (10) formation of 190nm thick-side wall with RIE etchback; (11) mounting of source- and drain-impurity As masking gate electrodes and side wall; (12) RTA processing to achieve diffusion of solid-phase P forming a shallow junction of 10nm. Realization of pMOS Problem of Future Future problems include realization of pMOS and suppression of parasitic capacity. According to Toshiba, the company is studying various methods, including solid-phase diffusion, to develop pMOS. However, since the solid-phase diffusion of B results in a junction as deep as 30nm, Toshiba feels that it should investigate other type of impurity.
