ACTION: Proposed rule and petition findings. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the Laguna Mountains skipper ( Pyrgus ruralis lagunae ) and quino checkerspot ( Euphydryas editha quino ) butterflies as endangered species throughout their respective ranges in southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Laguna Mountains skipper occupies two montane meadow habitats in a very restricted range within San Diego County, California. The quino checkerspot is locally distributed in sunny openings within chaparral and coastal sage shrublands in portions of Riverside County, California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. These species are threatened by one or more of the following factors: Grazing, urban development, collection by lepidopterists and other human disturbance, stochastic events, and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to provide for their conservation. This proposed rule, if made final, would extend protection under the Act to these species. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by October 3, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Carlsbad Field Office, 2730 Loker Avenue West, Carlsbad, California 92008. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address.
