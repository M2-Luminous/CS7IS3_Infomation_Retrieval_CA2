"Fighting would do no good to anyone. What we [the Khmer Rouge] want is to build up our country and return it to normalcy," a Khmer Rouge representative in Phnom Penh told The Nation. He reiterated the Maoist faction's commitment to pursue King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point guideline aimed at national reconciliation and accused the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of opposing the plan. Sihanouk's first three guidelines call for: an immediate and complete ceasefire throughout Cambodia; the immediate and unconditional transfer of the Preah Vihear temple, Pailin and other Khmer Rouge-controlled zones to the Cambodian govemment; and the dissolution of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK) and its partial absorption into the royal army. "You see these first three points are what the DKP [Democratic Kampuchea Party or Khmer Rouge] must give to the other side," the representative said. He said the other two guidelines require the Phnom Penh government to give the DKP the posts of coministers, co-vice ministers, co-secretaries of states and advisers; and the DKP and the government must hold talks to settle all these issues. "Altogether the five points make national reconciliation possible. But the CPP have been concentrating on the first three points only and that means they are opposed to national reconciliation," he said. The DKP representative referred to Cambodia's present government as a two-headed government, one head of which is Cambodian while the other -- and the whole body -- is Vietnamese. He said a truly national government would not exclude any political party or political personnel. "We will never be part of the puppet government. We don't want to be co-puppets," he said. He said the future of the Phnom Penh coalition govemment would be totally compromised if it refused to implement the peace plan. "How could they survive if they cannot solve the three main problems of this country?" he said, citing the influx of Vietnamese into Cambodia, corruption among government officials and people's fear for their lives and property. The Khmer Rouge is aware that the Vietnamese are trying to swallow up Cambodia. After "closing Cambodia's western border and opening up its eastern border, they will move little by little into our land," he said. However, without help from "some western countries", Hanoi would be unable to carry out its policy of Vietnamization, the representative said, without identifying the "colluding" Western countries. Asked to clarify the situation in Anlong Veng, the representative denied that govemment troops have overwhelmed Khmer Rouge headquarters there. "What they [the govemment] claimed to be our base is not in fact our headquarters. That is somewhere else. We were able to seize a number of government tanks outside Anlong Veng," he said. Though admitting the situation is tense in Pailin as fighting continues the Khmer Rouge representative dismissed reports that government forces were about to take the town. "The nearest they've got to Pailin is Treng, about 50 km away," he said.
