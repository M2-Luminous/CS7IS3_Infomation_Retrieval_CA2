From the press service's explanation we may draw the conclusion that one of the reasons is the the extremely compressed time period for holding elections for all the power structures. The refusal expressed in the interview is not your final word, however. Please tell me under what circumstances you would be able to review your decision. [Kravchuk] I (?will draw your) attention to the fact that our mass media and the foreign mass media are currently paying, well, solid attention, I would say, to this problem. Well, the press here is international. So I do not think that it is of special significance in which newspaper or at what microphone it was said first. The main thing is that it was said. I would not like this problem to be viewed solely in the context of the president as an individual. I saw this when I drew these conclusions (?in the) interview, the context of the formation of power in Ukraine. For example, let us try to predict the variants. The issue here is not so much the compressed time period as the situation that might arise. If, for example, on 27 March, the entire composition of the new parliament is not elected. Well, I'll say, for example, 200 deputies are elected, or even 150. The current parliament does not have 450 deputies at present, there are somewhat fewer than that. Thus if new deputies are elected in 150 districts, then there will be fewer than 300 in the current parliament; that is, less than two thirds. It will immediately not be competent, no matter what is said. I will refer to you to the Constitution, article 104 -- the Supreme Council of Ukraine is competent to adopt decisions if there are no fewer than two thirds of the actual number of people's deputies of Ukraine present at the sitting, whose authority is recognized and has not been suspended by established legal procedure, but more than half of its constitutional composition. It is clearly stated. It cannot be that two people's deputies come to the Supreme Council, one from the old convocation and one from the new convocation. A collision arises immediately. Such a collision arises because there is in fact no old Supreme Council, you see, but there is no new one yet. The run-off elections take place, say, after two weeks. The law on run-off elections is a complex one, a very complex one. How will it be, say, if another 100 deputies are elected -- 150 [at the 27 March election] and 100 [at the run-off election]; we will have 250 altogether, or maybe 280, or 290. Again we do not have the necessary 300. We do not have them here, and we do not have them there. Ukraine does not in fact have a legislative body. The elections move on to the next stage, that is elections of a president then, and elections of local chairmen of authorities. What happens? There is no Supreme Council as such. The new government is not formed. Its authorities have not been determined. The president is the only legitimate figure, who in fact can realistically manage the situation together with the local administrations and bodies of power in the localities -- all of them -- with councils, or rather the councils' executive bodies and representatives, and the president's administrations. There is no one else to do it. If at this time the president also, the president who is in power, runs for election, clearly the danger of a collapse of executive power becomes probable. That is, in this case I am not speaking about my possibilities or my wish [to run] or not. I am driven into a corner -- either to leave everything and run for election or to be responsible and not to take this step. Thus my decision depends on many factors. The first one is the election of the Supreme Council and the creation of a new government -- this without fail. Then the new government -- the Supreme Council having, say, adopted a law on the cabinet of ministers, determines the government's powers, let us say, transfers executive functions to it, and the government begins to work. Executive power is in the hands of the government. This is the first thing. The second thing is that it is still necessary to determine what kind of president is going to be elected and with what kind of powers. If this happens in accordance with the present Constitution, the president will again be elected as head of state and head of the executive authority with the relevant powers. You know how many questions there are with this. We must determine this; that is, the president or a person who is a candidate for the presidency, who runs for elections, knows what his future powers will be and who he will be in the state. This has not been determined at present. If he is elected in accordance with the present Constitution, then the issue will arise with the new Supreme Council of what sort of law there should be on the cabinet of ministers, what the powers and functions of the cabinet are, and the tugging of powers will begin again -- from the president to the Supreme Council, from the Supreme Council to, say, somewhere else, between the president and cabinet of ministers. All of this vagueness is an important point. The third thing: If, having elected a new president in June and chairmen of executive, rather chairmen of local bodies of power, we have not determined the powers once and for all of those chairmen, and have not determined when they could be suspended, or in some other way if they violate, for example, the Constitution or laws, who is to stop this? That law says this will be determined by a separate law, but when will we have this law? Before the election of those chairmen, so that they know their final powers, or will it be after that, when they have been elected and have begun to adopt laws? That is, we have been working in such a tight schedule over this. I do not want to blame anyone, but remember how the preparation for elections proceeded -- under pressure of strikes. A decision on a referendum was adopted. Then a decision on elections was adopted. Time went by. Time was short and an extremely complex political situation arose, or can arise. So I said that in this situation my responsibility for the state is greater than my wish to run in the coming elections for president. This is the logic. There is no need to, say, raise banners about this. There is another aspect, and I must tell you about it. It is not so much political as moral. I studied, like all of us, in school and out of school, history and the fate of various presidents, but I have not come across such dirt, such lack of culture, such badgering as some people feel free to do, for example, in parliament and outside parliament, and certain mass media, as in Ukraine. This could become a phenomenon of the history of the Ukrainian state, when the first president, he might be liked, he might suit someone, or he might not -- one can elect one or elect a new one in a legitimate way, but to feel free to do such things, establishing in the consciousness of generations such a, I would say, boorish psychology, as some are striving to do and are doing, this simply causes indignation, not just my own personal indignation, but I see in some of my colleagues, too. Clearly as a person, in this case, not as president, I cannot understand this, and I do not want to understand this. Here is a factor that affects and will affect my decision. I cannot but say this to my people. These are two aspects of it, which I wanted to tell you about, so that you convey this to the electors, who naturally are also interested in this decision by the president and what has caused it. [Correspondent] A question from HOLOS UKRAYINY. Leonid Makarovych, as is well-known, elections under conditions of a difficult economic crisis are always a risky matter. And Russia is an example of this. In addition, many of your political opponents connect our economic ills with Ukraine's course toward independence, and now are especially demanding the restoration of absolutely all links with Russia and CIS countries. And some people are even proposing the Belarusian variant, which we know about. What can you say about this? [Kravchuk] Well, this is a subject of many aspects. Its first aspect, from my point of view, is that in our time--especially a year to one and a half years ago, thanks to the vigorous, say, political activity of certain political forces--we established in people's consciousness that the main reason for the economic and social suffering was the severance of economic links, and everything, say, boiled down to this severence of economic links with CIS countries. I explained then, if you remember, that if one is to restore all economic links, which existed previously, then one would have to restore the Soviet Union, to restore or to keep unchanged the whole structure of industry in every CIS country. Yesterday Russia's president said in his speech that Russia should produce what Russians need and that which can be competitive. The same goes for Ukraine and for other states, and to speak of restoring all links is simply nonsense because a new, new states and new economic structures are being constructed. The point is to restore necessary links, to create a market, for example, within a CIS framework -- whether a common market or a market is not important, so as not to lose this market and to trade on this market, to sell, to buy, to resolve customs issues, other issues, tax issues, price issues. All of this needs to be coordinated, generalized, and elaborated. This is a normal process, but to speak again about the previous links and to restore them all means restoring the military-industrial complex; this means restoring everything that we, Ukraine, produced as a part of a former great power. This is the first thing. And at all meetings now, you see, links are not mentioned. Whoever wanted these links established them, for example Zaporozhsich, it has splendid links with Russian enterprises, and it works. There should be links between enterprises and not between one state and another. This is a normal phenomenon. States should create the right conditions between themselves, but entrepreneurs and businessmen, plants, factories, industrialists, agriculturists, commercial people, should establish links between themselves, trade and produce. This is the first thing. The second thing: If a decision had suddenly been taken here, say, by Ukraine, like Belarus as you say, to enter the ruble zone, I am convinced that Russia would not want this. It would not have been able to carry our state, because what would it mean for Russia to take Ukraine into the ruble zone? This would mean giving Ukraine a considerable, even a very considerable quantity of rubles--I cannot even name a figure--and this is its wealth. This means it would be necessary for Ukraine to do [as heard] or Russia would have demanded such concessions on the part of Ukraine, which would have brought its economic independence to nought, to nought. If one is to ask the question today, one should ask it directly, frankly, and sincerely, that Ukraine is changing its course with regard to its continued economic and political independence and is agreeing to such a decision -- the formation of some other kind of, say, union, or whatever it might be called. That is, I am in favor of a common market, in favor of resolving all economic and political issues by way of coordinated actions by CIS states. Here an economic union can play an appropriate role, too. Maybe, you see the Asian countries have created a single economic space, but they have not created a unified currency. (?I have in mind) CIS countries. We could have created a single economic space, for example, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, or the whole economic space, but this with one's own currencies, one's own banks, one's own independent credit and financial structures, that is, as an independent state. For example, the three Baltic states created what is called the Baltic Assembly, but no one is losing or taking steps to lose their independence. Any kind of economic integration is a realistic process, but it should clearly determine whether states are integrating or whether some kind of autonomous or oblast structures are integrating. This should be clearly explained to people. Those who hint at something, that we should change our course, we should do this and do that, they are simply either afraid to say sincerely what they finally want -- and we have such sirs, who were in power in their time, who are now hinting at various, say, variants, and want to win for themselves a post of national hero and savior of Ukraine. There are such people. Incidentally, they could have done this when in power, but one should then say directly, this is my surname, these are my first names and patronymic, and I am telling you that one should put an end to all of these problems of independence, unite in a single state, and may that state then live on. Why deceive people and say that some want this, and some want that, but I want something, but do not know myself what, or maybe I know, but I am afraid to say what. [Correspondent] A question from URYADOVYY KURYER, please. Leonid Makarovych, should one not view the program of actions and first steps of the new president of Crimea as the beginning of Ukraine's federalization? What is your attitude to the idea of Ukraine's federalization in general? [Kravchuk] I think that when such a complex issue is to be resolved, one should always turn to history. See how federative states were formed. Well, take Germany and the United States for example. They were formed historically by way of annexation at a certain time, lands there, states there, to a state structure, which was already formed. For example, the state of Texas was annexed considerably later than, say, other states; that is, this was a process of annexing territories to a state structure, which were annexed on appropriate terms. And federations formed in this way. We have a unitary state. Well, the Crimea, its special status, is simply, say, connected with its history surely. I will return to the Crimea later. So why now, when we have a unitary state, does one consciously suddenly begin to divide it into federative centers from above, well what for, when there is an undivided unitary state, not large in territory, if one is to compare it, for example, with other states, and is compact, having history in common. I am in favor of regions having the most extensive economic self-determination, the most extensive, in issues of, for example, the budget, finances, customs, I mean customs problems on the borders, and so on, influence on enterprises, powers connected with managing state property, of which there is a great proportion there now, that is the most extensive [economic self-determination], including Crimea. This is my point of view. It seems to me that this is the most realistic point of view at present, which will not cause another division and redivision of our political problems. Well, Russia's experience shows that Russia as a federation, and it was not formed yesterday, has problems, too. So we will begin suddenly, and we will begin with problems. Regarding Crimea: Well, people often accuse the president and the Supreme Council chairman that we are supposedly the chief culprits for there being an Autonomous Republic of Crimea. I would like to refer you to 1990 again, to history, when the Soviet Union still existed, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the USSR Congress of People's Deputies, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union existed then, too. And then the Crimeans, and the Crimean party -- the Communist Party -- and the oblast council put the question of a referendum regarding autonomy. And the second point -- the issue of what kind of status was discussed, where was Crimea to belong -- it was already beginning to be discussed then. Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev often hinted to me -- you watch what is going on in Crimea. I knew for certain then that if I did not support what was happening there, if I banned it, then this would not mean that everyone there would suddenly listen to me. Then Crimea would turn directly to the USSR, not to Russia, and the Supreme Soviet, having the powers, would adopt this resolution, because there was a unified Soviet Union, and all of this talk that Ukraine was a state in the Soviet Union, well we know what sort of a state it was, and Crimea would transfer from Ukraine. Now, when we have done this, it is not so simple now. The Union institutions, which could have adopted this, do not exist now, and Russia signed a treaty with Ukraine on us not having territorial claims on each other, back in 1990. In this way this question sounds entirely different now, and now, and in the agreement, which we signed in Moscow with Bill Clinton and Yeltsin with regard to nuclear questions, there is a stance there that territorial integrity and inviolability will be respected both by the United States and by Russia, and so on. Already we, when--I say this frankly, I have never said this to my people, but there is speculation going on around this and people are speculating who know this well. Perhaps they are making use of this in an election campaign. God knows. Or perhaps they are simply showing ignorance, although I do not think that academicians can show ignorance in this matter. Although it happens. Therefore, I am saying sincerely that this was a considered step. Now there have been elections for a Crimean president. People became so absurd as to ask whether I really have the right to meet the president of Crimea. Well, firstly, this is not a right that I am going to ask anyone for. This is the first thing. I could not have met him under one circumstance -- if Ukraine's Supreme Council had revoked the law on elections of the Crimean president and they had taken place, then the Crimean president would have been outside the law and I would never in my life have met him. But as this did not happen, that is, elections are elections, I meet him, and it is my opinion that it is better to meet than not to meet and it is better to resolve issues than not to resolve them and drive them into a dead end. It is better to go along the path of, say, mutual understanding, and not the path of confrontation. I am convinced that the new president of Crimea, the new government, and everyone will go along this path, because the other path leads to trouble. They would be the initiators of this trouble; they would assume the highest responsibility, because Ukraine, if we are looking at this, is fussing and bothering over Crimea so much that there is nowhere to go from here. And we will talk about of how many violations there are of the (?letter of) the law, and the referendum law was violated, for example, which does not comply in the constitution to Ukraine's referendum law, the Crimean one I mean, the referendum law in Crimea. And the Supreme Council, the Presidium, and all of us, sent documents, said that they should be brought into line with Ukraine's Constitution. They keep biding their time. Yesterday, the Supreme Council adopted an appropriate document and gave explanations. I think that this should influence--influence reason, common sense--that Crimea is at the moment an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine and any actions directed against this most important political, say, pivotal issue, will necessarily be viewed as illegal, as illegal. This should be kept in mind. I think that we will manage to settle these issues, we will manage to settle them, and again we will resolve them by way of talks, by way of debates, by way of coordination both of legislative and executive power documents and structures. [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, Ukrainian Radio, news service. I would like to return to our difficult economic and domestic situation and the related foreign economic policy of our state. In your opinion, why is privatization not occurring in our country? And what is it necessary to do to activate foreign investments? [Kravchuk] Well, privatization has not occurred for many reasons. First, we worked on privatization legislation for a very long time. This is the first thing. The second thing is, legislation is all very well, but various political forces, and in the power structures too, in their time had varying attitudes to privatization. The previous governments, Kuchma's government and Fokin's government, did practically nothing for privatization, practically nothing. Everything was frozen. Only now are the first steps beginning to be taken. Appropriate programs are being adopted. Appropriate actions have begun in the regions, but again this will depend on how people there, from the village council to the Cabinet of Ministers, will act and resolve these issues. That is, we were late with privatization. Although, I should tell you that privatization in Ukraine, taking account of its heavy industrial structure--for example, 33 percent is concentrated in the military-industrial complex of the former Soviet Union. Well, you see, these are giants, and is it really so simple to privatize the Malyshev Plant or the Southern Machine-Building Plant. We smelted half the metal in Ukraine. Is it really so simple to privatize metallurgical plants, mines, and so on? One has to see all of this. This is a fearful structure -- nuclear power engineering and so on, but we are late and now these steps have begun. Second, taking account of our leaps I would call them, in such an acute issue as nuclear weapons, where we announced one course to begin with, said we would manage to become nonnuclear quickly, then started to refine it. There were such layers that it then became entirely incomprehensible to some what we really wanted. This led to economic assistance to us being frozen on the part of Western countries. I will give you only one example. You probably know it, but I will give it. For example, assistance to the Baltic countries -- all of Western assistance in relation to gross national product comes to 25 percent. For Ukraine it is 0.5 percent, and only now, when we have determined our position with regard to this acute issue for the world, for humanity, has some kind of gradual progress begun somewhere. This does not yet mean that it is finished, but it has begun. For example, normal economic relations have begun to be established, and there is an entirely different attitude to us. Therefore, there are many reasons here and what occurred was our fault. I am being frank. There are objective problems here, but the fault for the inconsistency and indecisiveness, both in privatization and in the entire sphere of politics, was severely marked in this sphere of life. [1 minute break in transmission] ...to work and earn money. I do not see that there is any other way. The situation regarding pensioners, doctors, and teachers is different. They are subject to the budget and there is a different attitude toward them. Let us say, Ukraine has up to 40 million hectares of land: We spend a lot of time deciding whether or not to give them land; we then make a decision to allow them to, let us say, build together with the land and make a decision not to let them build with the land. As you see there are people with such a mentality who live constantly in fear that we will sell the land to somebody. If somebody wants to build a factory in Ukraine, and if we say that the land on which the factory is built belongs to the factory, then what is wrong with this? We must not think like this. We are always arguing about this. I repeat, we have 39 million hectares of land in Ukraine. This is practically 1 million hectares per person, or even more if we are only talking about adults. Where is the problem here? Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, during the Supreme Council sessions, mentioned figures of many countries, including Turkey and other countries, where the population is the same and where they utilize only half of their land and, as well as being self-sufficient, they also export their products. But we cannot even do this. Land must be utilized. I would advise that in life we must work and earn a living and produce. At present, the majority of the population has begun to earn in a different way, instead of producing and earning a living. This is our misfortune and I must not severely condemn this. If one-third of the population is traveling to the market on trains, then this is a particular phenomenon, although if you remember there was a similar situation six or seven years ago in Poland and Poles were everywhere in China, Jamaica, etc. They were buying, selling everything and transporting it, but now they have begun some other activities because there is an accumulation of funds and they have begun to work. One has to experience this. There must be a desire by everyone to find a way out. It is no use saying that the president has not found a way out. Let them elect a holy president tomorrow, if one could be found. He will not be able to solve anything on his own, unless, at first, there is a desire on the part of everyone to work and secondly, unless there is accord in society. We should know that we must manage this land, this Ukraine, because nobody will do it for us. Some are calling for (?dependency), and others are calling for a return to the old structures, and now there is an electoral campaign and it is arousing the people. You must understand that this does not give the people vigor, strength, nor optimism. There should be an objective. I understand that the people have become disillusioned. They even say: Why should I go and vote and who should I vote for? These are the kind of letters I am receiving. But I would like to say something with regard to my answer to your first question. Without fail, we must have elections, it is worse not to. There must be an authority. When there is authority there is also hope and let us say, levers that will not permit surprises. There will be somebody who will make the decisions. For example, let us say that the Supreme Council cannot be convened. The president has authority with regard to executive power in Crimea. Elections have taken place. Certain processes of a legislative nature have taken place in Crimea. Who should repeal what has taken place in Crimea? How should the Supreme Council act? I would like the people to understand that it is all very difficult, very difficult. They ask: Who should I listen to? You are all promising something, why should I go and vote? But elections must be held in order to preserve the state and make an important step in forming the political and power structures. Some say that the new Supreme Council will be worse than the present one. I will not say whether it will be worse or better. It will be a new parliament. Those deputies who do not want elections keep on saying that it will be worse. We will see what kind of parliament it will be, but the main thing is that the Supreme Council should be elected, and that it should begin to take steps toward a structural reorganization and political reconstruction, that it begins to take specific steps toward reforms, market and social protection. It should not go from one extreme to the other depending on polarization or political inclinations. It should be a Supreme Council with a clear policy that will form a government. The government will present a program and a process of normal work should begin. We have to go along this path. I turn to the people with a call to overcome these personal problems at the time of the elections. I know that when people go to cast their votes and, let us say a bus does not turn up, they come back and angrily say that if they do not want us to vote, we will not vote. We must understand that we are talking about authority. The state must have authority. If it is no good, then we must reelect it. If there is anarchy then that will be the end and there will be trouble. There could be a collision or confrontation or something else. We must not allow this. I simply wanted to explain the situation because as I can see, it is taking on such a tone and there are various interpretations that do not precisely define my position or my views. Sometimes people say to me that I am interested in the elections not taking place. I have the most interest that elections take place. Perhaps those who want to preserve their positions for some considerable time are interested. Regarding myself, I have defined my position and have told you this frankly, and I tell the people and everybody else that I have no personal interests. My interest is that of Ukraine.
