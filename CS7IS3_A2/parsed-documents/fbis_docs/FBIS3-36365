Yeltsin's visit to St. Petersburg the Russian Federation president and the city Mayor A. Sobchak discussed the future prospects for turning Kronshtadt into a free economic zone and in this connection the naval base's relocation. [passage omitted] Editorial note: On the basis of information from sources within the Russian Navy Main Staff, IZVESTIYA has been informed that as yet no specific decision has been made concerning Kronshtadt. Relocating this naval base really does require enormous resources which nobody has appropriated, and nobody has produced a plan to set up a base in another location. Such an order has not been given. Kronshtadt will remain a Russian naval base for a long time to come.
