Police suspect profits from the booming international trade are ultimately financing Somali warlords. Bill Hamilton, who was sacked from the Metropolitan police four years ago because of business links with a convicted IRA terrorist, has become embroiled in the international trade in qat, a highly addictive drug cultivated in the Horn of Africa. Britain has become the world's biggest clearing house for the drug, which is banned in many western countries but remains legal here. The Home Office, which monitors the drug, maintains it does not constitute a serious threat to British society because its use is restricted to a few thousand refugees from Africa. However, drug abuse workers in areas of London populated by Somalis have become concerned at the harm that misuse of qat is causing to the refugees. They claim it is turning many of them into zombies and creating serious social problems. Police and customs officers have also become concerned that the trade is helping to finance the clan leaders running the civil war in Somalia. They control some of the main areas where qat is grown and are thought to be behind the booming business in supplying the drug to Somali, Ethiopian and other refugee communities in countries where it is illegal. The National Criminal Intelligence Service and customs officers in Britain estimate that at least 80 different syndicates are importing qat from Africa and then re-exporting it illegally to countries where it is banned. Hamilton, a former Special Branch sergeant who worked at Heathrow, has used his knowledge of the system to fly British couriers into North America with suitcases full of qat plants, which are chewed to obtain an amphetamine-like high. He was sacked by Scotland Yard after an inquiry into a double-glazing business he had set up in Northern Ireland with a convicted IRA man. He now operates from west London, recruiting couriers in local pubs. Many couriers have failed to consider the possible consequences of being caught. Some have been banned from further entry into the United States and one man is currently serving a six-month jail sentence in Finland, according to Peter Coutts, a courier recruited by Hamilton. Coutts, 41, an ex-Reuter journalist from Isleworth, west London, was arrested last month with another Briton at Philadelphia after they flew in with four suitcases crammed with the drugs. "We were isolated, handcuffed and grilled. It was a pretty horrible experience," he said. In the past year more than 1.5 tonnes of the drug smuggled from Britain has been confiscated in Scandinavia alone. Yet Hamilton, who was detained at Toronto airport 18 months ago for possessing the drug, remains unrepentant. Last week, he admitted involvement but insisted he had now severed his ties with the syndicate. "My involvement was largely on a casual self-employed basis. I never had an executive role and no financial stake in the courier business," he said.
