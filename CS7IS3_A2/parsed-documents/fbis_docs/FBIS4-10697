The supreme achievement of proper conduct is to know that moment. Yes, we are experiencing today a very critical moment in the evolution of the Haitian crisis that calls upon me as president of the National Assembly -- joint guardian of the national sovereignty -- to address you so as to sum up the immediate national political juncture. This critical moment is marked by a general despondency of the population including all social strata in view of the complications of a national crisis that appears unsolvable after 32 months. Now, if everybody -- including without discrimination politicians, soldiers, shopkeepers, state employees, priests, pastors, teachers, students, and so on -- is overwhelmed, there is good reason to ask the question: What really hinders the resolution of the crisis? This is a pertinent question because the viability of any community lies first and foremost in its capability to define its true problems so as to bring true solutions to bear. Furthermore, this critical moment is marked by a big confusion knowingly maintained by some and by others who are defending unavowed interests to the very detriment of the Haitian national interest. Some are asking for the implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, whereas others are asking for the implementation of Art. 148. But all of that shamelessly reveals the true elements of the solution to the crisis, notably the rehabilitation of the Constitution and of the national sovereignty lying in the universality of the citizens, normal functioning of the state and reinforcement of the republican institutions, social healing, national reconciliation -- conditions essential for recovering social and political stability and for moving toward the path of economic progress. In fact, I say the moment is very critical because -- among other things -- there are precise deadlines that are approaching rapidly. The deadlines will test the fortunes and viability of the Haitian democratic project. The first of those deadlines is next 9 May, the date when the first legislative session will reach an end. From then on, the honorable deputies will go on vacation and will come back on the second Monday of June [13 June], which implies that if -- between now and next 9 May -- the resolution of the crisis has not begun at least in a decisive manner, we will have only three free months left, that is from the second Monday of June to the second Monday of September [12 September] to set up the constitutional measures and the practical mechanisms aimed at leading to the forthcoming 1994 elections. In this regard, I fully share the concerns expressed by the president of the Chamber of Deputies, honorable Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, in his address to the nation this past 13 April, concerns evoked by myself during several meetings and discussions with colleague Deputy Monde. However, I bitterly regret that Deputy Monde decided not as a deputy or president of the Chamber of Deputies, but rather as vice president of the National Assembly to solemnly address the Haitian people and country without having had the kindness, even the courtesy, to inform the president of the National Assembly. I bitterly regret that the vice president of the National Assembly just offered reservations about the latest maneuver of 10 April made by the elected representatives of the contested 18 January 1993 elections assisted by some dissident senators. Finally, I bitterly regret that the vice president of the National Assembly labeled this so-called assembly of 10 April 1994 an assembly of senators under the leadership of an illegal office which the vice president of the National Assembly himself had labeled a few days before as illegal and illegitimate. From that moment, the vice president of the National Assembly should have armed himself with his well-known courage to clearly tell the nation about the unacceptability by the office of the Chamber of Deputies of any and all acts coming from this illegal and illegitimate office. This is what the senatorial assembly and I, president of the National Assembly, were expecting from President Monde. As president of the National Assembly, I must consider all necessary measures for the realization of the session scheduled for next 9 May to allow the honorable deputies to go on vacation. This having been said, it is the duty of each senator and each deputy to work toward the disentanglement of the Senate of the Republic. Everybody knows the reasons for this entanglement are essentially the occupation of the administrative premises and of the session room by those elected in the contested 18 January 1993 elections and some dissident senators and a strong tendency toward physical violence -- which has been manifested several times -- among most of them. So, as a responsible leader, I have the right to prevent any and all situations that might give rise to tragic incidents. All in all the entanglement of the Senate is the entanglement of the parliament, which falls within the scope of the general entanglement of the country. This can be proved by the fact that the rare sessions held at the Chamber of Deputies since I opened the first session this past 11 January have not enabled a move toward the resolution of the crisis. As president of the National Assembly, I consider that the efforts of the parliament will have a real meaning when all of us, senators and deputies, enter the path leading to an effective way out of the current crisis. The essential elements binding the parliament directly in its constitutional prerogatives are the following: a vote on the law relating to the amnesty, the ratification of the new commander in chief, and the ratification of a new prime minister. In this regard, I call on the president of the lower chamber and vice president of the National Assembly as well as all vital forces of the nation to join me so we can reach together this immediate and priority objective. This is why, as president of the National Assembly concerned with the critical situation the nation is experiencing, I am duty bound to draw the attention of the honorable deputies and senators to the fact that it is time -- yes, I say it is time -- for us to roll up our sleeves and to show the people who rely on us that we can do great things. Thank you.
