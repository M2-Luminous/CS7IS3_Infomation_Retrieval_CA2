At present, over 14,000 km of major continental coastal forest shelter belts exist, forming a "Green Great Wall." Since the beginning of the construction of China's coastal shelter forest system in 1988, over 30 million mu of land has been afforested in six years. Since 1991, in particular, the speed of the construction of coastal forest shelter belts in various localities has increased rapidly. In a span of three years, 20 million mu of land has been afforested along more than 5,000 km of coastline. Fujian, Hainan, and Qingdao are at the country's forefront in growing coastal shelter forests. On the basis of fulfilling the task of the first phase project in growing coastal forest shelter belts in 1992, Fujian Province began last year to concentrate its efforts on expanding major coastal forest belts and farmland forest nets, and has built a 3,100 km "Green Great Wall" along the province's 3,300 km coastline. Hainan Province has grown over 1,400 km of major forest belts along its more than 1,500 km coastline. The construction of the coastal shelter forest system has greatly reduced the impact of typhoons, tidal waves, and rainstorms, which occur several times a year, and has given effective protection to 48 million mu of farmland. Half of the counties on coastal plains have grown farmland forest nets and one-third of the coastal mountain counties have grown trees on all barren hills and mountains. This apparently has improved the ecological environment, and even the investment environment of coastal areas.
