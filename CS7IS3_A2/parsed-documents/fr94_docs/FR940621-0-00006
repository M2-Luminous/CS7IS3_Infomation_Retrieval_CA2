FR940621-0-00006 FR940621-0-00002 Section 923.322 is also revised by adding a new section to require that any lot of Rainier cherries would have to contain a minimum of 17 percent soluble solids. The percentage of soluble solids would be determined by using a refractometer to measure the sugar level in a composite sample of cherries. This maturity test would be taken at the time of packing or just prior to shipment, at the option of the handler. As previously discussed, ยง923.55 of the order provides that whenever cherries are subject to grade, size, quality, maturity, pack or container regulations, those cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service (FSIS). Since this rule would establish minimum size and maturity requirements for Rainier variety cherries, such cherries would have to be inspected and certified by the FSIS as meeting the applicable requirements of the regulation. A proposed rule concerning this action was published in the Federal Register on May 19, 1994, (59 FR 26148), which provided a 15 day comment period ending June 3, 1994. Three comments were received. The Washington Cherry Committee recommended a modification to the original minimum maturity requirement. Mr. Mike Hambelton of Stemilt Growers, Inc. did not support the original minimum maturity requirement, but supported the committee's recommended modification. Mr. Grady Auvil of Auvil Fruit Company also supported the modification recommended by the committee. Both Mr. Hambelton and Mr. Auvil did not support the minimum size requirement. The Washington Cherry Committee's comment stated that the modification to its recommended minimum maturity requirement for Rainier cherries was to provide more flexibility for handlers. The proposed rule stated that maturity testing was to be conducted at the time of packing or shipment only. Since handlers use different methods of packing Rainier cherries, the committee agreed that it is important that handlers have the option to determine when the maturity test will be conducted. This will prevent the unnecessary packing and repacking of Rainier cherries that do not meet the minimum size requirements. The new language will accommodate different methods by permitting maturity inspection, prior to packing, at the time of packing, or just prior to shipment. The Department believes that the comments concerning modifying the minimum maturity requirements for Rainier cherries have merit. Therefore, this final rule is modified to revise ยง923.322(c) of Washington Cherry Regulation 22, to provide more flexibility in inspection. Mr. Hambelton and Mr. Auvil also filed comments requesting that the Department not approve the committee's size recommendation. Mr. Hambelton suggested that the committee lacked formal research in the areas of Rainier cherry maturity and size. The committee has done research concerning cherries showing that size and quality are very important to buyers. Although no formal research was specifically conducted on Rainier cherries, there is among growers and handlers a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience about the marketing of Rainier cherries. The overwhelming view of the committee, which is made up of growers and handlers, is that shipments of small, sour Rainier cherries has been poorly received by consumers. In addition, the committee gave the issue full and timely consideration, as noted in the two meetings which were held. The committee in its final decision voted 13 to 1 in favor of its recommendation. Mr. Auvil also stated that the minimum size requirement would limit supply, resulting in higher prices. Mr. Hambelton also claimed that the size regulation would reduce Rainier cherry supplies and result in grower prices exceeding parity levels. He cited that the 1993 parity price for sweet cherries was $1,640 per ton, and that Rainier cherry producers received on average $1,822 per ton. However, the $1,640 figure used by Mr. Hambelton is a national sweet cherry parity figure from the July 1993 National Agricultural Statistics Service report. This figure reflects prices for all sweet cherries grown in the United States, including Rainier cherries and other varieties of sweet cherries grown in the regulated area. There are no separate official data on Rainier cherries. The AMS has calculated an equivalent parity price for Washington sweet cherries of $2,083 per ton, and does not expect that prices received during the 1994 season will exceed parity levels. More importantly, however, the intent of this action is to establish minimum levels of size and maturity to ensure consumer satisfaction and maintain current markets. The objective of this action is not to reduce supplies of Rainier cherries. As previously discussed, higher prices for earliest offerings of Rainier cherries provide an incentive for producers to harvest early, which has resulted in immature, sour Rainier cherries being marketed. The establishment of minimum size and maturity requirements should reduce this propensity to harvest prematurely, but should not reduce the overall volume of Rainier cherries. Considering complaints received from consumers last season about immature Rainier cherries, the committee made its recommendation to make 11 row size the minimum for such cherries. The size recommendation ensures cherries of a good size will be shipped to market. For the reasons stated above, the Department is not making any changes to the size requirements for Rainier cherries. Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all available information, it is found that establishing minimum size and maturity requirements, as set forth in this final rule, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exist for not postponing the effective date of this final rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The committee held several meetings concerning the need to regulate Rainier variety cherries and all interested persons were invited to participate and express their opinions on this issue; (2) the proposed rule provided a comment period and modifications were made based on the comments; and (3) to be of maximum benefit to the industry, any regulation covering Rainier cherries should be in place for the 1994 season which begins in mid-June, and adequate time is needed to advise producers and shippers.
