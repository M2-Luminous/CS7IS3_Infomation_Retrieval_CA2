So far it has not caused severe pollution. The truck was owned by a company from Lianxian County. At about 0900 on that day, the truck, which had loaded 6.2 metric tons of arsenic in Jiangxi, headed for Lianxian County, but it suddenly fell into the river while going through Yangshan County. The two drivers were rescued from the river, but approximately two metric tons of arsenic sank in the river and disappeared. The local government and departments concerned quickly took resolute measures to promptly deal with the aftermath of the accident. The public security bureaus of Yangshan County and Qingyuan City immediately informed the departments concerned in various localities along the river to prevent people and animals from directly drinking water from the river. After receiving a message from the Qingyuan City environmental protection department, the provincial environmental protection administration immediately informed its subordinate departments in localities along the Lian Jiang and the Bei Jiang, including the four cities of Qingyuan, Zhaoqing, Foshan, and Guangzhou, urging them to more intensively monitor water quality in the two rivers. On 1 April, experts sent by the administration were driven to the scene and helped the local authorities deal with the aftermath of the accident. Sanitation and disease control departments in Yangshan, Yingde, Sanshui, Foshan, and Guangzhou were immediately asked to more intensively measure the arsenic content in the source of the water supplying waterworks and tap water in various localities. Moreover, medical units in the above-mentioned localities were asked to prepare the appropriate antidotes. Yesterday, almost 100 personnel salvaged the two metric tons of arsenic for more than six hours straight, but nothing was found. The arsenic was packed in a waterproof covering consisting of an inner layer of plastic film and an outer layer of a plastic mesh bag. According to experts in this field, the type of arsenic that sank in the river does not easily dissolve in water and hence would not cause severe pollution. The work of salvaging the arsenic is still in progress.
