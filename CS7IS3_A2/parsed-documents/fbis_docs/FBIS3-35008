This was a violation of a valid agreement in the region, Peres said. The appropriate authorities are now checking whether it was an isolated incident, and Israel will decide on its moves based on the outcome of the investigation. Mr. Peres spoke with correspondents after meeting with Portugal's foreign minister. Police Minister Moshe Shahal said that Israel will respond with its full might against anybody who harms the Galilee residents. Minister Shahal rejected the charges that there was an attempt to hide the shelling from the public. He said he is convinced that the news was withheld for operational reasons. Our correspondent Nati Silberman reports that the police minister addressed a ceremony inaugurating a new police station in Tirat Karmel.
