FR940214-2-00021 FR940214-2-00011 •Add 2,500 hp of compression by retrofitting an existing 12,500-hp engine at Compressor Station 195, in Washington County, Kansas. The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1. 2 2 The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the Federal Register . Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or call (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the mail. Land Requirements for Construction Natural proposes to abandon about 490 miles of 24-inch-diameter Amarillo No. 1 mainline and to remove it over a 4- to 5-year period. Natural proposes to leave the pipe in place in sensitive areas (such as waterbody crossings, wetland crossings, and areas of cultural and sensitive biological resources) where it believes removal activities could result in significant environmental impacts. The Amarillo No. 1 mainline is next to the Amarillo No. 4 mainline. The segments of proposed new pipeline would loop 3 the Amarillo No. 4 mainline. The segments of proposed new pipeline would generally be placed in the same trench as the Amarillo No. 1 mainline after the segments of that pipeline are removed. 3 A loop is a segment of pipeline that is installed adjacent to an existing pipeline and connected to it at both ends. The loop allows more gas to be moved through the pipeline system at the location in which the loop is installed. Natural proposes to use a 75-foot-wide to 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way, at least partly within existing rights-of-way. Areas of steep slope, staging areas, and other areas where additional right-of-way would be needed to permit safe construction would be identified on a site-specific basis. No new permanent right-of-way would be required. Abandonment of all 490 miles of pipe by removal and construction of the replacement pipeline would disturb about 5,900 acres. Most of the acreage disturbed would consist of existing pipeline right-of-way. One storage yard, about 4 acres in size, would be required for each of the four segments of new pipeline. Storage yards, about 6 acres in size, would be required about every 50 miles for the removal of the abandoned Amarillo No. 1 mainline. Private roads/lanes would be used to access the pipeline during construction and removal. These roads may require repair and upgrading to support increased traffic. The EA Process The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By the Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA. The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction, operation, and abandonment of the proposed project facilities under these general headings: •Geology and soils •Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands •Vegetation and wildlife •Endangered and threatened species •Land use •Cultural resources •Hazardous waste We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will then consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project. Currently Identified Environmental Issues We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the environmental information provided by Natural. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list; the list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our own analysis. The currently identified issues are: •The removal of abandoned pipeline and construction of new pipeline could affect 30.42 acres of wetlands. •The project could cross habitat of the least tern, bald eagle, and whooping crane (federally listed endangered species) and of the piping plover (a federally listed threatened species). •The project could cross habitat of the Arkansas darter, Arkansas river shiner, snowy plover, and eastern spotted skunk (Federal candidate species). •Pipeline would be abandoned within the Fort Larned National Historic Site (a National Historic Landmark). •The abandoned pipe may be coated with materials that contain asbestos.
