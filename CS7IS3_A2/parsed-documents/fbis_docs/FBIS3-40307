Concurrently with this, the Constitutional Court will initiate an amendment to the Constitution: the number of constitutional justices should be nine instead of 15. In connection with the information received by MTI, Laszlo Solyom, the chief justice of the Constitutional Court, disclosed that approval of the legislative proposal concerning the regulations and the requested amendment to the constitution are on the agenda for the 24 January meeting of the full Court. Answering a question, Laszlo Solyom said that in contrast to assertions appearing in the media, the Constitutional Court has not taken and is not taking any steps toward the election of a successor to Geza Herczegh, who resigned from his position as constitutional justice when he became a member of the International Court in The Hague.
