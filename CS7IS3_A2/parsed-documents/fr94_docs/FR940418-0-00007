FR940418-0-00007 FR940418-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 558 New Animal Drugs for Use in Animal Feeds; Laidlomycin Propionate Potassium AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the approval of a new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Syntex Animal Health, Division of Syntex Agribusiness, Inc. The NADA provides for the use of laidlomycin propionate potassium (CATTLYST ® ) Type A medicated article to make Type B and Type C medicated feeds for improved feed efficiency and increased rate of weight gain in cattle fed in confinement for slaughter. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daniel A. Benz, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;126), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1638. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Syntex Animal Health, Division of Syntex Agribusiness, Inc., 3401 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, filed NADA 141&hyph;025 which provides for the use of 50 grams (g) per pound of laidlomycin propionate potassium (CATTLYST ® ) Type A medicated article to make Type B and Type C medicated feeds for improved feed efficiency and increased rate of weight gain in cattle fed in confinement for slaughter. The Type C feed contains 5 g of laidlomycin propionate potassium per ton of feed to provide not less than 30 milligrams (mg) and not more than 75 mg per head per day for improved feed efficiency and increased rate of weight gain, and 5 to 10 g of laidlomycin propionate potassium per ton of feed to provide not less than 30 mg and not more than 150 mg per head per day for improved feed efficiency. The NADA is approved as of March 4, 1994, and the regulations are amended in part 558 (21 CFR part 558) by adding laidlomycin propionate potassium to the Category I table in §558.4(d) and by adding new §558.305 to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(i) provides a 5-year period of exclusivity to this original NADA beginning March 4, 1994, because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) has been approved in any other application under section 512(b)(1) of the act. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. List of Subjects 21 CFR Part 558 Animal drugs, Animal feeds. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 558 is amended as follows: PART 558_NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR USE IN ANIMAL FEEDS 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 558 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b, 371). 2. Section 558.4 is amended in paragraph (d) in the ``Category I'' table by alphabetically adding a new entry for ``Laidlomycin propionate potassium'' to read as follows: §558.4 Medicated feed applications. * * * * * (d) * * * * * * * * Category I 1Drug 1Assay limits percent 1 type A 1Type B maximum (200x) 1Assay limits percent1 type B/C 2 ␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣ Laidlomycin propionate potassium 90&hyph;110 1 g/pound (0.22%) 90&hyph;115/85&hyph;115 ␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣ 1Percent of labeled amount. 2Values given represent ranges for either Type B or Type C medicated feeds. For those drugs that have two range limits, the first set is for a Type B medicated feed and the second set is for a Type C medicated feed. These values (ranges) have been assigned in order to provide for the possibility of dilution of a Type B medicated feed with lower assay limits to make Type C medicated feed. * * * * * 3. New §558.305 is added to subpart B to read as follows: §558.305 Laidlomycin propionate potassium. (a) Approvals . Type A medicated articles: 50 grams per pound to 000033 in §510.600(c) of this chapter. (b) Conditions of use . Used in cattle feed as follows: (1) Amount . Laidlomycin propionate potassium, 5 grams per ton. (i) Indications for use . For improved feed efficiency and increased rate of weight gain. (ii) Limitations . Feed only to cattle being fed in confinement for slaughter. Feed continuously in a Type C feed at a rate of 30 to 75 milligrams per head per day. (2) Amount . Laidlomycin propionate potassium, 5 to 10 grams per ton. (i) Indications for use . For improved feed efficiency. (ii) Limitations . Feed only to cattle being fed in confinement for slaughter. Feed continuously in a Type C feed at a rate of 30 to 150 milligrams per head per day. (3) Special considerations _(i) Do not allow horses or other equines access to feeds containing laidlomycin propionate potassium. (ii) The safety of laidlomycin propionate potassium in unapproved species has not been established. (iii) Not for use in animals intended for breeding. Dated: April 8, 1994. Richard H.
