FR940620-0-00070 FR940620-0-00025 40 CFR Parts 261, 268, and 302 [FRL&hyph;4999&hyph;1] Hazardous Waste Management System; Correction of Listing of P015_Beryllium Powder AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Technical correction amendment. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency today is correcting the listing for ``beryllium'' in the list of commercial chemical products that are hazardous wastes when discarded or intended to be discarded. The listing description is corrected to read ``Beryllium powder.'' Conforming changes also are being made to the RCRA list of hazardous constituents, the RCRA land disposal restrictions technology-based treatment standards, and to the CERCLA list of hazardous substances. EFFECTIVE DATE: The amendment is effective June 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: The Office of Solid Waste (OSW) RCRA Docket is located at the following address: EPA RCRA Docket Clerk, room 2616 (5305), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

For technical information contact Wanda L. Levine, Office of Solid Waste (5304), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, 202&hyph;260&hyph;7458. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 22, 1988, EPA published a technical corrections notice to make a number of corrections to 40 CFR 261.33(e) and (f) and to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 (53 FR 13383). In that notice, the word ``dust'' was inadvertently omitted from the 40 CFR 261.33(e) listing, ``P015_Beryllium dust,'' which was the original listing promulgated on May 19, 1980. There have been a number of inquiries since the April 22, 1988 correction notice as to the intent of this listing, and EPA has responded in each case by explaining that the word ``dust'' was mistakenly omitted, but the intent of the listing ( i.e. , to list as hazardous the commercial chemical product, beryllium dust, when discarded or intended to be discarded) has remained. In fact, the land disposal restrictions refer to P015 as ``Beryllium dust.'' In addition, the sole manufacturer of the commercial chemical product has indicated that ``beryllium powder'' is the actual term used to describe their product. The term dust is not used by industry to describe the commercial chemical product. For the purpose of clarification, EPA is adding the word ``powder'' to the P015 listing description. Since this change is only a clarification, the scope of the P015 hazardous waste listing is neither increased, diminished or otherwise affected by this technical correction amendment. In order to rectify this confusion in the regulated community, the Agency today is correcting the Code of Federal Regulations by adding the word ``powder'' to the P015 listing for beryllium. Conforming changes also are being made to the RCRA list of hazardous constituents, the RCRA land disposal restrictions technology-based treatment standards, and to the CERCLA list of hazardous substances. Because this action is a technical correction, prior notice and opportunity for comment is unnecessary, and good cause exists for this change to take effect immediately (see 5 U.S.C. 553(b)). Accordingly, the Agency is not seeking any comments based on today's notice.
