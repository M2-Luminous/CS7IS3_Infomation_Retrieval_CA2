Sporadic gunshots are heard. Indeed, in violence-prone Congo, no day is ever like the one before it. The government blames the opposition for this worsening situation, an accusation rejected by the opposition in the words of Bernard Kolelas, who spoke to Anastasie Kengue: [Begin Kolelas recording] The situation prevailing in Congo now is characterized by continued clashes, always started by security forces of the presidential coalition. At this very moment, tanks [words indistinct] have lined up at (Moutabala) and are shooting directly into the working class district of (Ndoto), the Major Seminary, and the [word indistinct] district. For the past four days, there has been a blockade of the Makelekele and Bacongo districts. The radio told us today that the blockade is a routine operation because opposition activists (?were crossing over) to cause trouble in the northern districts of the capital, which is a blatant lie. They have put the Makelekele and Bacongo districts under blockade. For the past four days [words indistinct] the soldiers of the presidential coalition and elements of the (?Civil) Guard--I mean, the security forces of the presidential coalition. This is an absurd operation because it is an act of self-suffocation. The sectors placed under blockade are the areas where the government's key ministries are located: the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Ministry of Finance and Budget, the Ministry of Interior, and the Department of Customs and Excise.
