[Hayami] Vowing to achieve political reform, the coalition formed a new government following the collapse of one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Since then, we have been confronted by a series of unexpected matters on the economic front. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa have implemented several packages of economic stimulus measures worth some 30 trillion yen in total. However, they have so far had no noticeable effect. The official discount rate has dropped from 6 percent to 1.75 percent in a period of just over two years. This is the lowest rate in history. The implementation of these several measures still did not bring forth a driving force to stimulate the economy. [Iwasa] What are the causes? [Hayami] Economic stimulus measures have not worked properly because of a political vacuum. This is the principal cause. In August 1992, the government announced a pump-priming package worth 10 trillion yen. However, the Diet passed the supplementary budget to finance the measures only in December. Then, at the beginning of the 1993 fiscal year, the government unveiled another economic stimulus package emphasizing public investment. It was worth 13 trillion yen. However, although there were many public works projects afoot, it was very difficult for local governments to actually sign contracts because of the sudden appreciation of the yen against the dollar, and because of a series of bribery scandals related to public works. Moreover, Japan suffered a crop loss because of the unusually cool summer. For all these reasons, business confidence has been depressed considerably. In September 1993, the government approved another package worth 6 trillion yen. The emergency economic stimulus program compiled by the Hosokawa government aims to create new domestic demand by promoting deregulation and market liberalization. Although it might not have an immediate impact on the economy, I think the program is extremely reasonable. The only problem is that we cannot foresee how soon it will be implemented, because the government's steering of Diet affairs is currently unsuccessful. As for political reform, the public also wants the Diet to pass a package of political reform bills promptly. The public wants the government to promote an economic stimulus program and to work out a tax reform plan, without creating any political vacuum. Each Company Should Steer Its Own Course in Line With Structural Change, Since a Return to the Boom Period Is Only an Illusion [Iwasa] Counting on the government is not sufficient. Don't you think that companies also need to change themselves? [Hayami] The Japanese economy is now undergoing a structural change. Until now, as the whole market kept on growing, each company was content to maintain its market share. However, we can no longer expect growth of this kind. The potential growth rate will reach only 2 to 3 percent at the most from now on. Under such circumstances, people just keep saying, "Times are still bad and there is no way out of it." This attitude is not good. Recently, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives made several proposals in a report entitled "What We Expect From the Economic Reform Research Council." At the beginning of the report, we wrote as follows: "Business is slow, and that is the truth. However, to think that the national economy will go back to its previous state is only an illusion." "What are we going to do in the future?" Each company should ask itself this question and make its own way by keeping future structural change in view. To steer its own course, each company should be able to decide and act at its own risk. I think the business climate will not improve as long as companies do not make efforts to toe their own line. [Iwasa] Do you think business leaders of today are able to do this? [Hayami] Business leaders are now being asked to accept such a challenge. For instance, Keizai Doyukai is an organization independent of any business circle or any specific company. It also pays regard to individual freedom. So, compared with other economic organizations, our association can rather organize free discussions. Our members often meet to exchange views on common issues. These meetings prove useful because free discussions help members to change their minds, and the new business thinking brings on reform in management. [Iwasa] Some other countries say the Japanese economy is not sluggish. What do you think of that? [Hayami] I also think that Japan is not being hit by the recession. For example, Peter F. Drucker said that when he came to Japan, he could not understand why Japanese people were talking about the recession. This was because, when he went to a Chinese restaurant in a hotel, he saw a queue of people, including even youngsters, awaiting their turn, although the restaurant was really expensive. Practically speaking, Japanese business leaders should consider that they are now in a period of change rather than a period of depression. As a matter of course, the government should take necessary economic measures to meet the change. First of all, the government should revise the proportion of direct and indirect taxes. Direct taxes currently account for 72 percent of total tax revenue, while indirect taxes amount to 28 percent. In the near future, the number of Japanese capable of paying direct taxes will decrease as the ratio of aged people grows. If the government does not take any measure, it will become unable to finance new spending needed in such fields as welfare and environmental protection. This is why the government has to implement a drastic tax reform. We propose an immediate reduction of the income tax, which would also help stimulate the economy. An increase in the consumption tax is necessary to cover the tax revenue shortfall. However, the consumption tax hike should be implemented after a lapse of two to three years. I think this is quite natural and that there is no other solution. However, the government is unable to materialize a tax reform plan because, as I just said, Prime Minister Hosokawa is having a hard time handling Diet affairs. [Iwasa] Are companies suffering from the corporate tax? [Hayami] In Japan, the corporate tax rate is about 50 percent, while in other advanced countries it is around 20 to 40 percent. Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that our competitive ability is declining. Companies distribute dividends after paying a 50 percent corporate tax. Therefore, if they want to pay a dividend of 10 percent, they will need to make twice as much money as the amount of the dividend. As the break-even point is becoming higher, the corporate tax rate should be reduced so that business executives can have a larger scope in running their companies. There are two lines of measures that have to be implemented immediately to stimulate the economy. Reducing the Gap Between Domestic and Global Prices 10 to 20 Percent by Improving Productivity in Nontradable Goods [Hayami] Prime Minister Hosokawa has vowed to work out measures to create a more consumer-oriented economy, with the emphasis on improving living standards, as well as measures to turn Japanese society into one in harmony with the international community. For that, he should first try to correct the gap between domestic and global prices caused by the rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar. Japan's trade surplus of some 130 billion dollars is behind the yen's exchange rate of 108 yen to the dollar. However, when we make a comparison between Japan and the United States, or between Tokyo and New York, we realize that the purchasing power parity of the yen against the dollar is around 170 yen to 180 yen. The gap between Japanese and U.S. prices has reached nearly 50 percent over the past few years. In brief, the purchasing power of the yen is weak at home, while it is very strong abroad. Both exports and imports are the cause of this gap. This problem is especially serious in the sector of nontradable goods. This low-productivity sector is protected, thanks to the granting of subsidies and price regulation. Consumers are the sole sufferers from these measures, since they have to buy the goods despite the high prices. The productivity of this sector, which does not need to compete with foreign rivals, is extremely low, compared with the similar sector in the United States. As long as the government does not gradually dismantle regulations and protectionist measures in this sector, the yen's purchasing power will never rise at home. [Iwasa] What do you propose as a concrete measure to narrow the existing gap? [Hayami] First of all, if we find a foreign product of good quality that is less expensive than the domestic product, we should import it, period. Meanwhile, there are some sectors that are still obliged to maintain their work force, even though it is unprofitable. We should create a new high-productivity sector so that surplus workers of the inefficient sectors can be transferred. The creation of a new sector and the transfer of surplus workers will temporarily cause friction. However, we should make efforts and manage to find a good solution without victimizing consumers. The government should promote economic measures in this direction by aiming at reducing the gap between domestic and global prices some 10 to 20 percent. For instance, Japanese travelers usually say that everything was really inexpensive, as they return to Narita Airport carrying a pile of foreign goods in their arms. This is definitely strange. If we create a sort of offshore market or free market in which products will be sold at a price based on the real exchange rate of the yen against the dollar, for example 108 yen or 109 yen, consumers will immediately become aware that something is really wrong with the current purchasing power of the yen. [Iwasa] This is an interesting idea. [Hayami] Unfortunately, we need to clear several regulations which exist under the Customs Act, the Large-Scale Retail Stores Act, and so on in order to create an offshore market. If the government makes an exception to the rule to enable us to surmount the obstacle to the establishment of an offshore market, I think we will get an interesting result. [Iwasa] Could you please explain the second line of economic measures? [Hayami] In Japan, personal savings or personal monetary assets now total some 1 quadrillion yen, thanks to the consistent policy to encourage savings which has been promoted since the end of the war, and thanks to the laudable Japanese custom of thrift and saving. (laughter) When I was in the service of the Bank of Japan, I also participated in a savings campaign. There is no doubt that Japan's postwar rehabilitation and Japan's postwar growth were supported by the savings movement. However, we are now suffering from insufficient consumption and investment due to oversaving. It is not easy to make consumers buy expensive products under the existing situation, because they have already bought more or less everything they want, and because they are anxious about the employment situation. The household economy does not involve only consumption. There is also investment, and we can encourage consumers to invest more. We should particularly encourage housing investment aimed at improving living standards. For instance, in the United States or Britain, a preferential treatment is applied to taxpayers who have a house built. Not only those who build their own house for the first time, but those who sell a house to build a new one, or those who get a cottage, are also subject to the preferential treatment. The government might defend itself, saying the Housing Loan Corporation is extending loans at a low interest rate. However, preferably, the government should encourage housing investment also by adopting a preferential treatment to lighten the interest payment burden of those who have a house built by borrowing money from a private financial institution. The government used to emphasize the promotion of personal savings, while nothing has been done so far to encourage investment. What People Need Now Is a Japanese Dream [Iwasa] Before building a house, you first have to get a lot. However, you cannot buy a piece of land so easily. [Hayami] In Japan, a huge portion of farmland remains idle. It now involves an area of 700,000 to 800,000 hectares, which is equivalent to 80 percent of the total housing area. The government should take necessary steps to facilitate the development of uncultivated farmland for housing. Do you not think it would be great, if you could live in a big house where each member of your family would have enough space to do whatever they like. The acquisition of a big house is essential if you want to experience good living. The social climate is gloomy because people see no hope for the future. This is why we need a Japanese dream, which is to live comfortably in a big house. Moreover, the acquisition of a house helps create new demand for various products, such as household electric appliances. Therefore, it will have a tremendous effect as a medium- and long-term economic stimulus measure. An affluent society in the true sense is a society in which you can easily afford a big house and experience good living. It is the measure to facilitate the acquisition of a house that will help people to live comfortably. [Iwasa] I agree with you. My last question is "How do you foresee 1994?" [Hayami] People will do their best to change their thinking in order to cope with the unfolding changes. Japanese companies will try to change, based on the view that consumers will achieve self-reformation. In other words, Japanese companies will go through a process similar to that of U.S. companies a few years ago. Some people say the transfer of production centers to overseas is nonsense. However, I do not think so. If the product can be manufactured outside Japan at low cost, we should automatically switch to overseas production. At the same time, we should promote the production of high-value-added products inside Japan. It is not premature at all to carry out this kind of production transfer. In the United States, the development of new business has been supported by talented people who joined minor companies after they were forced to leave big companies because of rationalization. New businesses helped increase U.S. exports, promoting the recovery of the U.S. economy. It will not be so easy to bring on change without completely dismantling our laudable customs, such as the lifetime employment system, because it will cause friction. However, if we know that we can never go back to the previous period of prosperity, I am sure we will be able to accomplish reform. The year 1994 will be one of self-reformation and structural reform. I am not so pessimistic about the future (laughter). [as published]
