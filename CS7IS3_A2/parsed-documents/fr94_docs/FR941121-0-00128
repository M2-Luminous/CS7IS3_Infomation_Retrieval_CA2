FR941121-0-00128 FR941121-0-00013 The purpose of this action is to allow Federal permit holders to compete in the state waters fishery on a more equitable basis where Federal and state laws are inconsistent and to encourage vessels with general category permits to fish under the exemption program and continue to submit catch and effort data. Not implementing an exemption could force general category vessels that target scallops to cancel their Federal permits and be exempt from all Federal requirements, including reporting of landings while fishing in state waters. These vessels are able to re-apply for a general category permit at anytime. Conversely, limited access permit holders that voluntarily relinquish their permits can not re-apply. Without this exemption, the most significant inconsistency between the requirements of Federal vs. state sea scallop fishery permit holders occurs in Maine. (Maine does not have ring size restrictions, but both Massachusetts and New Hampshire have regulations that are the same or are more restrictive than Federal regulations.) Maine-permitted boats typically fish with 3-inch (76-mm) rings or smaller. Because the Gulf of Maine sea scallop resource normally consists of beds of spatfall that belong to the same year class and thus all have almost the same shell size, Maine-permitted boats would leave few scallops for federally permitted vessels with 31/4-inch (83-mm) rings or larger. Under this gear exemption program, which allows Federal permit holders to use smaller rings in state waters, Federal permit holders can compete on an equal footing with Maine state-waters-only vessel operators whose dredges have rings that are smaller than allowed under Federal regulations. Although this particular inconsistency does not exist in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, there are other restrictions in those states relating to gear that could create a competitive disadvantage between state and Federal permit holders. The exemption program also allows Federal permit holders to avoid the cost of changing the rings on existing gear if they intend to use the gear only in state waters. The impacts of the adjustment fall within the scope of the impacts analyzed in Amendment 4 to the FMP and the FSEIS. The rationale and analyses of expected biological effects, economic impacts, impacts on employment are discussed further in the framework adjustment document (see ADDRESSES ). Comments on Draft Framework No. 2 and Responses NMFS is amending the scallop regulations following the procedure for framework adjustments established by Amendment 4 and codified in 50 CFR part 650, subpart C. The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) followed the framework procedure when making this adjustment by developing and analyzing the actions over three Council meetings, on May 11, June 30, and September 21, 1994. The Council provided the public with advance notice of both the proposal and the analysis, and the opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the Council meetings. Upon review of the analysis and public comment (see below), the Council recommended to the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), that the measures contained in this framework adjustment be published as a final rule. The Regional Director has agreed with this determination. Comment: One commenter expressed disbelief that fishing in Maine with 3-inch (76-mm) rings and a dredge as small as 41/4 ft (1.4 m) would be a violation. Response: Current regulations would require Federal permit holders to change the rings on their dredges to 31/4 inches (83 mm) during the 1994&hyph;5 season, and again to 31/2 inches (89 mm) in 1996, even if they were fishing strictly in state waters. The gear exemption will allow fishermen to continue to use rings smaller than 31/4 inches (83 mm) along with the dredge sizes required by Maine regulations. Comment: There were two comments dealing with keeping track of vessels and where they fish. One commenter believes that the vessel tracking system (VTS) must be required to accomplish this. The U.S. Coast Guard commented that it will be difficult to determine who is fishing inside and outside of state waters. Response: The VTS is considered a potential aid to enforcement of this provision but is not essential to its enforcement. When the VTS requirement is implemented, all limited access vessels required to have a VTS under a Federal permit (full-time and part-time vessels) must use them while fishing in the state waters exemption program. Limited access vessels in the occasional category will continue to be required to call in, but general permit holders will not be required to call in while in the state waters exemption program. General permit holders will be required to report landings and other data. The primary Federal enforcement concern regarding the Gulf of Maine scallop resource is that vessels with state permits only, or with exemptions from Federal requirements, might fish in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with gear not meeting Federal requirements. This problem exists whether or not a gear exemption program for Federal permit holders is implemented. Also, Federal enforcement personnel must still monitor scallop gear used by Federal limited access permit holders. Lists of vessels participating in the exemption program will be given periodically to enforcement agents to minimize problems. Therefore, exempting these vessels should not create any additional enforcement burden. Comment: The Maine Scallopers Association supported the exemption from the ring size requirements. Response: The gear exemption program responds to this concern by allowing vessels to fish in state waters with gear that conforms to the requirements of state management programs, provided that the exemption does not jeopardize the achievement of the fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the FMP.
