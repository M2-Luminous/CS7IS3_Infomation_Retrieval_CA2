Upon returning from Cuba, Arce voiced his concern that while the government celebrates the fourth anniversary of its electoral victory, it has not yet appointed an ambassador to Cuba. There are thousands of Nicaraguan students in Cuba, health cooperation agreements are maintained, and many people travel to that country to receive medical treatment for exceptional health problems. He stressed that Cuba renegotiated its debt with Nicaragua, reducing it to almost symbolic levels, and that those obligations have not even been honored by the Nicaraguan Government. In addition to meeting with Fidel Castro, Arce met with other government leaders and members of the Communist Party of Cuba, including Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State; Osmany Cienfuegos, member of the PCC [Communist Party of Cuba] Politburo; Pedro Arbizu [name as published], director of the America Department; Foreign Trade Minister Carlos Cabrizas [name as published]; and Hector Rodriguez, president of the National Bank of Cuba. As for the subjects discussed, Arce said that he reviewed with the Cuban leaders aspects related to the Cuban economic opening and Nicaragua's domestic situation, particularly the Sandinist process and the party's upcoming special congress.
