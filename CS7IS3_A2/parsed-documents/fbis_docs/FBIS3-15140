Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian delegation [at 17th round of Estonian-Russian talks], made a statement to this effect at a news conference today. Viewing the outcome of yet another round of talks between Estonia and Russia, Svirin said that they satisfy neither the Russian nor the Estonian side. For the Russian side the first priority is the situation of its compatriots in Estonia, but these issues were practically not even discussed because of the Estonian side's position. Explaining the change of view on the date for the withdrawal that was previously put forward by the Russian side, the Russian delegation leader said that this results from statements by the Estonian side (?which is now avoiding putting this in writing). Svirin mentioned the readiness to finance the building of housing for Russian servicemen, the giving up of mutual compensation, and the agreement ensuring social guarantees for retired Russian servicemen. Speaking about the border between Estonia and Russia, Svirin said that the issue is clear for Russia: the border is where it runs at present. Estonia, however, is making territorial claims on Russia, Svirin claimed. Russia does not see it as possible to resolve the border issue through an international court. If the Estonian side does not wish to set down markers along the border Russia will do so unilaterally, Svirin added. At the same time Svirin stated that the Russian side intends to continue the talks in order to achieve friendly and [word indistinct]] cooperation and mutual understanding. Commenting on the statement made by the leader of the Russian Federation's delegation at the news conference, Estonian delegation leader Vaino Reinart said that the Estonian side does not wish to break off the talks, either. The statement read out just now may, however, lead to the talks being broken off and Estonia changing her delegation [words indistinct]. Reinart noted that the Russian side did not agree to hand over to the Estonian side a list of Russian citizens living in Estonia, making a reference to [words indistinct]. Estonia proposed that on the subject of the Estonian-Russian border the International Court in The Hague should be approached. The Russian delegation rejected the proposal unambiguously, said Reinart. He went on to state that the Estonian Government is due to discuss the [word indistinct] outcome of the 17th round of talks in the near future.
