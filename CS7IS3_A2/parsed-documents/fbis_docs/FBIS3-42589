The conference discussed in detail the results of the sector's operations in 1993 and the problems gold-mining enterprises are encountering. Today we are publishing materials from this conference. "The sector has fulfilled the 1993 plan"--with these words Viktor Gritsayev, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones, began his report, a rendition of which is published below. Quoting a number of figures on various aspects of gold production, he noted that in the current difficult conditions many regions have increased production of the precious metal. Among them are first and foremost Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk Krays, Irkutsk and Amur Oblasts, and the Evenk Republic. At the same time, there are many problems interfering with the operations of gold-mining enterprises and gold-prospecting cooperatives. The sector has shifted to transactions at world prices. This improved the economic situation of enterprises in the first half of the year somewhat. However, in the second half of 1993 inflation caused a sharp rise in prices for fuel, food, and material and technical resources, and put gold-mining enterprises in a difficult situation. This was exacerbated by the introduction of a score of taxes and levies, totalling 30-40 percent of the value of gold produced. Investment in reconstruction of existing and construction of new enterprises was curtailed sharply, and material and technical supply worsened, especially in the Far North regions. The fact that the existing structure of associations has been destroyed and settlements were left without financial support had a serious impact on the work of gold prospectors. Most of the skilled cadres are leaving the Far North regions. It was pointed out in the report that the decision to transfer gold-mining industry enterprises to the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones was made by the government in May of this year, but the sector is still being managed by a number of ministries and agencies. For instance, the raw materials base is under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources and local administrations; property relations and structural transformations are the prerogative of the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of State Property; credits are the sphere of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Finance. Price formation and receipt of the final products are the competence of the Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones together with the Ministry of Finance and the Russian Federation Committee on Price Policy. The first six months of work in the new conditions showed that despite all the difficulties, the gold-mining enterprises have not reduced production of the precious metal and a certain foundation has been laid for normal work in 1994. Noting the positive points, the speaker nevertheless dwelled on the shortcomings in special detail. Construction of enterprises on the new Sukhoy Log mineral deposit is proceeding at a very slow pace. With respect to the level of technologies used, the gold-mining industry has been and remains among the best in the world so far, the speaker said. Without purchasing a single license, we possess a modern system of resource-saving. Our new enterprises over the past 10 years have been designed and built on the basis of tested scientific development. Unfortunately, because centralized financing has dried up, science services in the sectors have deteriorated dramatically. Especially with respect to finding solutions to major scientific and technical problems. Work has been practically suspended on improving the existing and creating new, more efficient domestic equipment. Even the largest enterprises cannot support new research on their own. We will be able to handle it only if we combine our resources. The president and the government of Russia, the speaker said, have made a decision to set up a nonbudget fund to finance scientific-technical and R&D work in the sector. This decision was in effect in 1993, and we asked the government to extend it to 1994. I want everybody present to understand that all of us need it, said Viktor Gritsayev. He expressed particular concern over the curtailment of geological prospecting work. In 1993, the report said, the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources allocated us 9 billion rubles [R] for this purpose instead of the R130 billion it was supposed to allocate on the basis of the volume of commercial product produced in the sector. The figures are incommensurate. What awaits the sector in the future? In 1990, said the speaker, the Main Administration for Diamonds and Gold, with the participation of a broad range of scientific organizations and representatives of the territories, developed a concept for the development of the gold-mining industry to the year 2010. For well-known reasons its implementation has been curtailed since 1992. Today, in order to implement this program, we need to invest at least R140 billion annually. Quite clearly, enterprises do not have such money, and the budget cannot issue such credit. Therefore, the task for the sector is to attract domestic and foreign investors. The Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones is developing a gold-mining program for 1994-1995 and up to the year 2000 in the new environment. In conclusion, the speaker said that at a conference organized by the Central Council of the Trade Union of the Russian Federation Mining and Metallurgical Industry Workers on 28 November, the question of establishing in the sector honorary titles and awards for many years of unblemished work and considerable contribution to the development of the gold-mining industry was brought up with some urgency. The Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones and the Russian Ministry of Labor have been instructed to prepare appropriate proposals on this subject. Meanwhile, today, said Viktor Gritsayev, on behalf of the collegium I would like to thank all those who worked conscientiously in 1993 and wish them success in the year to come.
