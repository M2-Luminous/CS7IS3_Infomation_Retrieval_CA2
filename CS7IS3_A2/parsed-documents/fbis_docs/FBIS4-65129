Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal says cooperation will not be successful if direct links to Mussolini's supporter organizations are discovered in the past of the four ministers concerned. [Johansen] Socialist Left Party Chairman Erik Solheim stressed in parliament today that fascism in Europe is not a common phenomenon but a criminal ideology and he wanted to know what attitude the government intends to take toward the four fascist ministers in the new Italian Government. Solheim asked whether the government intends to meet with the Italian ministers of culture, environmental protection, agriculture, and transport at ministerial level. Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal announced that the Norwegian Government intends to assess the ministers concerned on the basis of the replies they have given. If they are fascists without any direct line to Mussolini, then they pose no problem. Should one of them belong to this gang, links will be out of the question, Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal stated sharply in a reply given in parliament today.
