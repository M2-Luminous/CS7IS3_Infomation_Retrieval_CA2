He further said that he will suggest at the upcoming meeting that Japan should cooperate with the EU in reducing the emission of carbon dioxide and in space development. During a ministerial meeting in January 1993, Japan and the EU agreed on strengthening cooperation in new areas, such as assistance to developing countries and science and technology, in addition to the existing industrial cooperation. In accordance with this agreement, the "Japan-EU Science and Technology Forum" will be held on 7 June. Ruberti and Mikio Omi, director general of the Science and Technology Agency, will attend this forum. Ruberti proposed holding regular consultations of experts in addition to annual meetings of ministers concerned, saying: "Efforts should be made to hold forums on a regular basis." He pointed out the need for strengthening cooperation in nuclear fusion and biotechnology programs, which is already taking place between Japan and EU, or is being conducted on a multinational basis among Japan, EU, the United States, and Russia. He then said that during his visit to Japan, he "would like to stress the need for cooperation in the area of the environment," such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions. With regard to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, Ruberti showed an intention to discuss long-term tasks, as well as short- term concerns, such as technical development, electric power, and gas.
