DP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] election spokesman Lester Fuchs said Mr Mandela's weak endorsement of free and fair elections was not shared by certain prominent ANC and South African national civics organisation members on the ANC election list. "Khabisi Mosunkuthu, Dan Mofokeng and Moses Mayekiso have all indicated the DP will not be allowed to canvass in the townships," he said in a statement. He said that if Mr Mandela was serious about a free and fair election he should remove from the ANC's election list the names of all those not committed to allowing other parties to campaign in townships.
