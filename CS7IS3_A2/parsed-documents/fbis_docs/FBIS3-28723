Bernard Narokobi, an influential opposition MP, gave an emphatic "no" when responding to an agreement between prime ministers Paias Wingti of PNG and Paul Keating of Australia that an Australian parliamentary delegation could visit Bougainville. The island province has been riven by conflict since a secessionist uprising there four years ago and each side has accused the other of atrocities. A delegation would assess security and investigate allegations of human rights abuses. The timing and composition of the group is to be discussed between the two governments. Narokobi, a former attorney general, was one of two government negotiators of two failed peace accords -- the Endeavour Accord and the Honiara Declaration -- made with Bougainville rebels. Narokobi accused Wingti, currently visiting Australia, of admitting failure by agreeing to allow outsiders to attend to PNG's domestic problems. He told journalists that Australia would be meddling in PNG's internal affairs if it sent the delegation. "Australian parliamentarians have no right whatsoever to walk into Bougainville," he said. Narokobi said he would personally refuse to co-operate with them, and has called on security forces in Bougainville not to allow the delegation on to the island. He said for any outsider to come in would be the "highest form of insult." "Australians would do well to attend to the plight of their indigenous people," he said. And if an Australian parliamentary delegation was allowed into PNG, then a similar PNG delegation should be allowed to go to Australia to look into issues affecting indigenous Australians, he added.
