FBIS4-21336 "jptdd018___94002" JPRS-TDD-94-018-L JPRS Narcotics 20 April 1994 INTERNATIONAL Bolivia's Soliz Says Country Needs At Least $25 Million To Bolivia's Soliz Says Country Needs At Least $25 Million To Combat Drug Trafficking PY2104032894 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1443 GMT 20 Apr 94 PY2104032894 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Vienna, 20 Apr (EFE) -- A high-ranking Bolivian government official stated that Bolivia needs at least $25 million per year to be able to implement a sustainable development program, "which is the only way to defeat drug trafficking and extreme poverty." This week Mario Soliz Valenzuela, national social defense secretary of the Bolivian Government Ministry, said: "As the world community knows, the Bolivian Government does not have those resources; this is why we appeal to the international community for cooperation if there is a true desire to do something concrete." He added: "The Bolivian Government alone cannot wage, under such unfair circumstances" a war "against foreign drug traffickers, their technology to produce and export, their safety measures, and their flow of money and power, which is what makes international cooperation a must." In his address to the 37th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, headquartered in Vienna, that will end on 22 April, Soliz said the drug problem will still be "long and bloody." Bolivia is the world's second-largest producer of coca leaves, after Peru, and the second-largest cocaine exporter, after Colombia. Soliz called upon "friendly governments, international organizations, and financial enterprises such as the World Bank and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] to help the Bolivian Government use its potential to eradicate surplus coca plantations by 1997." The Bolivian Government plans to open a land register for the Chapare region, which will help obtain foreign financial aid "to start alternative development programs in the coca production region and, for the first time, give peasants there access to a market economy, free of any suspicion." The mere possibility of obtaining a legal deed as a result of the census "increases the property value nine-fold with the advantage of being able to obtain direct financial aid," asserted the Bolivian Government representative. Soliz added: "Many things are changing in Bolivia lately, such as the broader approach to the longstanding problems we have endured." One of the goals established by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's government is to give priority treatment to the problem of illegal drug trafficking and consumption, "which we combat in a resolute, frank, and decided manner." Currently, the fight against drug trafficking in Bolivia is centered on alternative development and police and legal interdiction of drug organizations, as well as prevention, stated Soliz. The UN International Drug Control Board, in its 1993 report disclosed in February, urges Bolivia to modify its law regarding consumption of coca tea and the chewing of coca leaves "unless it believes that the reasons for including this product on the list of the 1961 Convention are no longer valid," and, if so, it would have to propose that it be eliminated from the list. In this regard, Soliz said that in Bolivia the Law of Special Regulations on Coca and Controlled Substances, Law No. 1008, "allows the legal use of this product, such as in the coca tea industry, the chewing of coca leaves, and its use for rituals, and establishes that Yungas is the traditional coca production zone," where the replacement of coca plantations must be "voluntary and compensated, and bans coca plantations throughout the rest of the country." Soliz explained that Bolivia has reached an agreement with the United States to eradicate 5,000 of the 8,000 hectares of coca planted per year in exchange for financial aid for the Bolivian balance of payments. Soliz admitted, however, that although a plan for an alternative development has been implemented, "it still has not reached a degree that will allow a reduction of the production of coca and cocaine that reaches the consumer countries." Therefore, if productive activities that might absorb labor and generate political and social stability are not promoted, "one cannot dream of a voluntary reduction of surplus coca plantations," that is, those prohibited by Law No. 1008. Substitution "must entail products that will have a foreign market; if not, alternative development is unfeasible," asserted the Bolivia social defense secretary.
