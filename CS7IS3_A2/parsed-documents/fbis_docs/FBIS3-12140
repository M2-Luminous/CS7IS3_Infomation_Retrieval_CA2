Where are the international human rights organizations whose task is to protect people everywhere? When will the world act to protect the Palestinians inside the occupied territories? What is the fate of the Middle East peace process? Many questions rise in the minds of observers and political analysts everywhere in the wake of the ugly massacre perpetrated by a Jewish settler inside the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron on the West Bank at dawn yesterday. The massacre has dismayed Muslims everywhere and reminded them of the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque. It has dismayed the whole world with them. Peace loving forces in Israel have strongly condemned the act. We believe that this massacre is not part of the daily, mutual Palestinian Israeli violence and killings but a premeditated crime with serious implications, not merely because of its hideousness, the method in which it was carried out at this particular time, and the number of martyrs and wounded who fell in it, but because it raises numerous doubts about the Israeli authorities' ability to provide security for the Palestinian people, whose land is under occupation. At the same time, the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been stumbling for months as a result of Israeli security claims. Egypt strongly condemns this criminal action and urges the world community to act promptly to protect the Palestinian people as Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa demanded yesterday. We also believe that this hideous massacre raises several important points. First, any discussion of security requirements in the framework of the current Palestinian-Israeli negotiations must focus primarily on providing security not for the Israelis, as the Israeli delegation is demanding, but for the Palestinians. The danger threatens only the unarmed Palestinians who demand to live free on their national soil like all other nations. Thus Israel's security pretext totally collapses. Second, keeping the settlements inside the Palestinian territories is an issue that comes forcefully to the fore in the negotiations and requires a decisive solution. Peace will not come as long as the settlements stay and as long as their residents carry weapons with permission from the authorities and fire indiscriminately and with impunity on civilian women, children, and old people, perpetrating ugly massacres against them as happened at dawn yesterday while worshipers were praying in the Ibrahimi Mosque. Third, this terrible crime has proven the need to expedite the peace moves, particularly on the Palestinian-Israeli track, on the grounds that the Palestinian issue is at the core of the Middle East conflict. The Declaration of Principles, the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and the Cairo Agreement must be implemented so that the Israeli Government can demonstrate its sincere intentions to establish a just peace that will serve the good of all the nations in the Arab region. We believe that it is now Israel's responsibility to carry this out because the PLO has shown the utmost flexibility for the sake of peace. Fourth, any Israeli delay or procrastination is bound to encourage extremists on both sides to carry out lethal strikes with the aim of burying the peace. Delay will open the door wide for mutual violence. On the same note, the Jewish settlers and the Israeli forces must be banned from opening fire in such an insane manner on an unarmed population whose land was occupied by force. Fifth, this criminal incident lays a great and direct responsibility on the shoulders of the two peace sponsors, particularly U.S. President Bill Clinton, and Europe, whose peace is intimately linked with the Middle East's security and peace. Their reactions must not be limited to denunciations and expressions of sorrow. The Palestinian people, and all the world's free peoples, are waiting for a positive reaction. Nor is Sarajevo's incident far from the mind. Any delay on the part of the Israeli Government to adopt deterrent measures against the perpetrators of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, any failure to halt the Jewish settlers' criminal actions, and a slow reaction by the world community to protect the Palestinians will have serious negative repercussions, not only for the peace process but for the security of the Israeli people themselves. It is time the Israelis learned that a just peace is the only way to ensure their security and protection.
