'Aziz's remarks were made at the third session of the Baghdad International Symposium on human and women's rights and ways to cope with challenges. He said the sanctions targeting the women, children, and the elderly of Iraq amount to a gross violation of human rights. The sanctions, he pointed out, were passed as a political decision by George Bush under known circumstances, and under U.S. control of the United Nations and the UN Security Council. 'Aziz reviewed the advances Iraq made in the seventies in the areas of education, health, and social welfare for women and children. He emphasized that these advances can be supported by statistics and international agencies and were achieved despite the iniquitous embargo that has covered all aspects of life. The deputy prime minister called for a rethink of the sanctions resolutions that deprive an entire people of food and medicine and restrict international trade. [passage omitted]
