The memorable Vladivostok explosion of two years ago now looks like child's play -- on Saturday 14 May the major arsenal of the fleet's air force thundered forth in Maritime Kray. This was the equivalent of the blast from a five-kilotonne atom bomb. The mushroom that grew near the village of Novonezhino was very similar to the familiar silhouette in textbooks on nuclear security -- the height of a substantial hill, black and crimson, it terrified the local inhabitants. It was a sunny day, and people were digging in truck gardens. The shock wave bowled them all over. They got up and ran to the houses. A second, mightier blast caught them 40 seconds later. After the third one they could enter the houses from any side: They had neither windows nor doors, indeed some people had no walls left either. Panic set in. For some reason mothers began pushing their children under the beds. Grandmothers shouted "It's war!" and started praying. Cats went crazy, dogs howled. A sickening, acrid smell of burning hung in the air.... There were not, however, any nuclear or chemical charges in this arsenal. Aerial bombs, missiles, and shells, brought here from the Baltic region, were exploding. The dumps were very well guarded, and the military took pride in them. The arsenal was also located well from the safety viewpoint: The villages were quite a long way off and were protected by hills. This saved the inhabitants. So far there has not been a single casualty. The fire was extinguished by the next morning. Sappers, militia, and counterintelligence officers are working there now. From KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's File Free-flight rocket -- based on tanks, aircraft, and ships. Range -- 10-15 km. Explodes on impact by self-detonation. Antitank guided missile -- based on aircraft, ships, and infantry fighting vehicles. Equipped with self-destruct device. Self-detonated, could hit chance target, i.e. function in line with combat launch. Range -- 20-25 km. The evacuation of people was organized professionally. The military, the authorities, and the militia secured a lot of buses amazingly promptly and evacuated five villages: Smolyaninovo, Romanovka, Novonezhino, and two small farmstead-railroad halts. All the locals had long known from the military that if THAT blew up, everything would be destroyed for 30 km around. So they evacuated people beyond the 30km zone -- to Shkotovo and Bolshoy Kamen. Fortunately it was not the entire arsenal that blew up. But even what did was enough to cause a minor earthquake. Windows were broken even in buildings in Vladivostok and in blocks at the "Okean" children's camp, which are a good 50 km away as the crow flies. There is scarcely a single building in the villages that did not suffer. A Vladivostok-Partizansk electric train was approaching the "Kilometer 53" halt at the moment of the first explosion. When the engineer caught sight of the mushroom from the explosion, he stopped braking and took the train through the falling debris to the next station. A couple of minutes later the railroad was at a standstill -- the contact wires had been broken, and debris and blocks were falling right onto the permanent way. "Not many people in the village were injured," Divisional Militia Captain Viktor Bityuk said. "Some were hit by bricks from a falling chimney, some were cut by broken glass, and some did not open their mouths or put their hands over their ears in time and now cannot hear." On that day Viktor himself had only just finished his shift and was getting ready for bed. Now it is 48 hours since he slept. He was leading people out of their yards, and they were stopping vehicles on the road until the buses arrived.... "Imagine, there was not a single instance of a private driver's refusing to take people in his vehicle further away from the blast," he said in surprise. "On the contrary, there were volunteers who offered their help and first-aid kits. They released the sailors locked up in the garrison guardhouse and made them help me. I set them to guarding stores and the savings bank. Believe me, there was not a single robbery!" Just one case of looting has been recorded so far. Fish protection inspector Vladimir Snurnik was leading people from a danger zone by the river while his own village of Romanovka was being evacuated. He found himself nearby and called at his home. Everything there had been turned upside down, and the safe had been opened. They had evidently been looking for his pistol, which he had with him at the time. Weapons, incidentally, have always drawn thieves and bandits of various kinds to the arsenal. The small arms of all the nearby military units were kept there. Last year a major robbery occurred, for which a unit commander and six of his accomplices were arrested. The investigation also links the present disaster to the problem of weapons thefts. Almost everyone is certain that this was no chance ignition. There are eyewitnesses who say that the first fire broke out right in the middle of one of the dumps. Rockets at once flew in various directions and started a fire right around the perimeter of the huge arsenal. Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander in chief of the Navy, who has arrived in Maritime Kray with a group of experts, is still very cautious in his assessments of the cause of what happened. He has said just one thing unequivocally: The destruction is colossal, such as I have never seen before in my life. ...A friend and I were once collecting ferns in these places. There were so many of them on the slopes of the hills that we could pick them without straightening up. These hills that are turning green are now strewn equally thickly with unexploded shells and debris. I walked with Anatoliy Panteleyevich Shevchenko, head of Smolyaninovo Administration, through the streets of the deserted settlement. There was still intermittent rumbling, and he showed me which hill had taken the most terrible blow and which one had saved 100-year-old Romanovka, which has lived through two wars and now, so it turns out, also a third one. "Where can I find that much window glass now?" the head grieved, looking at the gaping windows. Yes, we will all need a lot more window glass. This Pacific Fleet arsenal is not the last one....
