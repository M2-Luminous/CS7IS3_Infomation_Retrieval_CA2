Estonia today began registering the residents of the former Soviet military base town located some 40 kilometers to the west of the country's capital. The campaign is scheduled to continue until Saturday [26 March]. Olesk in an interview with BNS warned that if the country fails to get a record of Russia's active service military and their family members in the town, a substantial part of Paldiski residents will remain a secret for Estonia. "We must have on record how many active service military and their family members are there in Paldiski, and who they are. If we fail to learn this, it means one: the Russian side is destabilizing security in Paldiski," he said. The minister said talks on the issue had taken place between the Russian military and the Estonian Government's special representative in the area, Juri Tikk. Olesk said Russian army representatives had promised to present lists of their military in the town. But he added that this was not enough for Estonia. To pass the procedure, Paldiski residents must answer a questionnaire, after what they will get a special inscription into their passports. Car owners must also present their driver's license and car ownership document. The questionnaires will be filled in by Estonian officials and then signed by the respondent. Estonian authorities will be entitled to deny working and residence permits to non-citizens who have no passport inscription on having passed the registration. The stamp will also give the holder the right to enter Paldiski at the time when special entry regulations are to be introduced. The regulations will be effective during the dismantling of two nuclear reactors at a Russian base in the area. Olesk said the overwhelming majority of Paldiski residents were in favor of the registering. The questionnaires are later to be checked by officials at the Citizenship and Migration Department. "It is clear that as the passport inscription is also a certain kind of guarantee for movement in Paldiski during the time of dismantling of the reactors, most Paldiski residents want to get this inscription. Paldiski residents also understand that the passport inscription and the special regulations to be introduced for the time of dismantling of the reactors are in their own interests," Olesk explained. Government representative Juri Tikk has earlier said that the passport registration campaign which started today "is only the first stage that will give a picture of the town's residents and their documents." "Sooner or later also those who abstain from filling in the questionnaire will have to bring their explanations. At the time when nuclear fuel will be brought out from Paldiski and controls are stepped up at the Pakri peninsula, those people will start to get caught," Tikk said. Tikk said about 250 Estonian citizens and some 4,000 loyal residents and their children were currently living in Paldiski. Those are the people that have received the Estonian privatization documents. Estimates put the number of Russian military in the town at 800-1,000, about 600 of whom must leave the country by Aug. 31, 1994. Then only some 200 Russian military specialists will remain in the town to dismantle the nuclear facility. "Those people will be allowed to remain in Estonia only in their status as civilians," Tikk added.
