Matochkin, head of Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, by Lyudmila Sherova of POSTFACTUM; place and date not given: "Yuriy Matochkin: Our Oblast Has a Special Status"] [Text] Kaliningrad Oblast, separated by two borders from the main territory of Russia, has recently moved substantially closer to us. Its problems have been at the center of the Russian authorities' attention. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent talked of this with Yuriy Matochkin, head of Kaliningrad Oblast Administration. [Sherova] Yuriy Semenovich, as far as is known, a treaty between Kaliningrad Oblast and the federal government is currently being prepared. Whose was the initiative, and will it be comparable with the treaty signed with Tatarstan? [Matochkin] It is a mutual initiative. The treaty is being drawn up within the framework of the president's and the government's decision. The treaty process began to develop between the center and the components of the Federation after the adoption of the new Constitution. The first such treaty was signed with Tatarstan. The treaty with Kaliningrad Oblast is to be the second. This is connected with the fact that we have previously advanced proposals to grant the oblast a special status, taking into account its position as an enclave. Naturally, we do not wish to copy the treaty with Tatarstan. [Sherova] Which of the center's powers would you like to take over? [Matochkin] Powers in respect of relations with neighboring states: Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and others, i.e. with states through which freight for Kaliningrad Oblast passes. Not all the powers, of course; just sufficient to decide questions promptly, not through Moscow. [Sherova] Do you not have this opportunity now? [Matochkin] At present we have been granted such rights only in relations with Poland. By decision of the Russian Federation Government I was appointed its plenipotentiary in implementing the intergovernmental agreement with Poland. I act as Russia's representative in talks with Poland on questions of cooperation between Kaliningrad Oblast and Polish voivodships. In addition, we would like independently to resolve questions connected with land use and ownership. We intend to include the following conditions in the treaty with the federal authorities: If the Ministry of Defense disbands some unit, the property must be transferred to the oblast, and if the Ministry of Defense decides to send in additional troops, this question must be agreed with the oblast authorities. [Sherova] Russian territories now are frequently divided into subsidized and profitable territories. Which is your oblast? [Matochkin] The oblast is said to have become a subsidized one, but it depends on how you calculate it. Here it is necessary to link the territory's significance from the viewpoint of its strategic position in Russia to the load that the oblast bears from the Ministry of Defense. For example, there are now 130,000 retired servicemen standing in line for apartments in Russia, including 17,500 in Kaliningrad Oblast. At the same time Kaliningrad Oblast amounts to less than 1 percent of Russia in terms of area, population, and industrial potential. [Sherova] To return to subsidies, does this mean that the taxes that are collected on the oblast's territory are insufficient for its needs? [Matochkin] They would be sufficient for us if we did not transfer some of the taxes to the center. They take 35 percent away from us. In working on the treaty we plan to write into it our right not to surrender taxes to the center for five years but to leave them for the oblast's development. We have now begun talks with the Ministry of Finance on the conclusion of a treaty for credit to the tune of 150 billion rubles. This is roughly the amount that, taking possible inflation into account, we will have to transfer to the center in 1994. In addition, we would like to keep the customs duties which today all go to the center. [Sherova] Do you have any problems with the inviolability of borders? [Matochkin] Our borders are violable; only the border with Poland is guarded according to the old Soviet system, and so it is reliable. There is a full system of border security installations there [inzhenernaya systema]. As for the border with Lithuania, it virtually does not exist. Today our border troops guard administrative points on the border between Kaliningrad Oblast and the Lithuanian Republic. Talks concerning the border are under way, but that is all. I am not in favor of fully equipping the border, and we do not have the money for this. It is necessary to set up checkpoints on the traditional traffic routes and conduct inspections. Endeavors must be made to create civilized European borders. [Sherova] Yuriy Semenovich, you are now a senator. What interests you most of all in the Federation Council? [Matochkin] For me everything connected with Kaliningrad Oblast is important: the budget, relations with the Ministry of Defense and with our neighbors. As for the Baltic countries, I believe that the Federation Council must adopt the text of a statement on the formulation of a special economic policy in respect of the Baltic countries, with due regard for the interests of Russia and Kaliningrad Oblast. Such a policy does not yet exist today.
