He said that as a result of an Israeli aviation attack on a Hizballah base, there were many Lebanese casualties, and the territorial sovereignty of Lebanon had been violated. In turn, areas in northern Israel were subjected to dangerous fire. "These alarming events cast a shadow over the continuation of Arab-Israeli dialogue and reconfirm the need for stepping up the comprehensive search for political solutions," the statement by the repesentative of the Russian diplomatic department said. "Only at the negotiating table can and should agreements be reached guaranteeing both the restoration of the territorial integrity of Lebanon and the mutual security of this state and Israel, and guaranteeing that there is no dangerous escalation of violence." As co-sponsor of the Near East peace process, Russia calls upon all sides "to display maximum restraint and common sense and to be guided in their actions by the long-term interests of establishing a stable and just peace in the region."
