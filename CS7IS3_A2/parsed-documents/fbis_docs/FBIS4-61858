The shutdown was caused by financial difficulties arising from ZIL's inability to get its consumers to pay off their arrears and to settle its own debts with suppliers. It is intended that in the next two months the car builders will be able to maintain the pace of production -- 180 trucks per day. Of course, the situation is not an easy one, ZIL deputy engineer-in- chief Vladimir Nosov told the ITAR-TASS correspondent. Since the beginning of the year the workforce has been working in a special mode -- a single four-day shift a week. The works' debts to suppliers in April amounted to 60 billion rubles, even though consumers owe the works even more. Production has almost been halved. Last year ZIL made 108,000 trucks and, even though this year contracts were concluded for 159,000 trucks, ZIL executives believe that if business carries on as it is now, ZIL will be able to sell only slightly over 50,000 trucks. This is why an economic development program has been prepared now which, experts believe, will enable the recently formed "AMO ZIL" joint-stock company to survive. Its' President Yevgeniy Brakov said that it provides for legal and other measures to return the debt owned by the consumers, primarily from Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Today, 85,000 people are working at the enterprise -- in the long-term it is planned to reduce this to 60-65,000 and to close a number of unprofitable plants and sections. ZIL is also counting on its new technical policy: In particular it is intended to considerably expand the range of trucks both as regards horsepower and use. The first steps have been taken: The production has been mastered of heavy-freight truck-trailer combinations and tip-up trucks, before the end of the year it is planned to manufacture a commercial batch of these trucks with a load capacity of 2 - 2.5 tonnes. The managers of the enterprise believe that this tactic will make it possible to considerably increase the demand for ZIL products.
