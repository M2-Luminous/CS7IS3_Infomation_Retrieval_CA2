The Assembly looked into a number of briefing requests addressed to Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Minister 'Amr Musa then addressed the Assembly, saying that the Hebron massacre has shocked the Egyptian president, Government, and people. Musa pointed out that Egypt was the first country to denounce the massacre, its perpetrators, and the policies that led to it. Egypt, he added, voiced the need to curb Israeli extremism and provide measures for protecting the Palestinians. The foreign minister said that President Husni Mubarak instructed Egyptian officials to support the Palestinian demand for a UN Security Council session to discuss the massacre. President Mubarak also got in touch with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat several times, stressing his and Egypt's support for the Palestinians at this critical juncture. The two Presidents reviewed the measures that should be taken to guarantee the safety of Palestinians and prevent the settlers from terrorizing them. Minister Musa said that Egypt's reaction to the massacre was guided by a number of basic principles. Egypt has firmly condemned the massacre. Egypt has stated that responsibility for the massacre is not confined to the perpetrator; that Israel has a clear and specific responsibility for it. Egypt has made it clear that Israeli settlements are illegitimate and that they hamper the peace efforts and undermine tranquility and stability in the occupied territories. The settlements, Egypt believes, conflict with the rights of the Palestinian people in their land as well as with International law. Egypt has called on Israel to take measures to disarm the settlers. Minister Musa said that the massacre should fortify our resolve to seek a peace settlement that is based on the exchange of land for peace and guarantees the restoration of Palestinian rights. The foreign minister said that negotiations should continue because Israel must not be left in control of Arab land. He pointed to the unanimous world condemnation of the massacre. The People's Assembly issued a statement strongly denouncing the barbaric crime, saying that it violates all ethical principles and norms of international law. The statement says that the Israeli Government, being the occupation authority, is responsible for the massacre. It condemns Israel's failure to offer protection to civilians living in the occupied territories in the face of repeated acts of repression and terror. This failure, the statement adds, fuels the spirit of fanaticism and hatred and invites the recurrence of atrocities. The Assembly referred Foreign Minister Musa's speech and the deputies' comments to an ad hoc parliamentary committee to follow up this matter with the government and keep the Assembly fully briefed on the subject.
