FBIS4-57639 "drlat099_o_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 Colombia _O_ Press Review of Samper Campaign Activities _O_ Press Review of Samper Campaign Activities 94P20773 94P20773 CSO [Editorial Report] Bogota Metro Proposal Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper, accompanied by a group of reporters, rode a stretch of the Bogota intercity train on 22 April as a means of promoting his proposal to build a metro system in Bogota. Under Samper's proposal, the metro system would use a large number of the existing railroad corridors. Samper emphasized that a mass transit system would do much to improve the quality of life for Bogota residents, noting that his train ride took only 25 minutes, while by bus the same trip would have taken an hour and a half. According to his calculations, the metro would begin by providing 240 million rides per year, reaching the target of 600 million rides annually in less than four years. (EL TIEMPO, 23 April) After his train ride, Samper proceeded to a mass transportation conference organized by his campaign, with mass transit officials from other Latin American countries and a representative from the United Nations. Addressing the seminar, Samper described previous initiatives to build a metro system as a "long and sad history of wasted time and effort," and laid the blame for these failures on former city officials, including rival Conservative Party candidate and former mayor of Bogota, Andres Pastrana. After the seminar, Samper held a press conference to discuss further details of his metro proposal. (EL ESPECTADOR, 23 April) Campaign "In Deficit" Speaking to reporters during the train ride across Bogota, Samper commented on recent testimony by convicted Colombian drug trafficker Gabriel Taboada before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. Taboada had alleged that trafficker influence is widespread in Colombia and that certain presidential candidates, whom he did not name, had used narcotics trafficking proceeds to help fund their campaigns. Samper reportedly said that, if need be, President Gaviria himself should go to the United States to defend Colombia's reputation. Samper declared that he had been very careful about receiving contributions from sources whose origin was not clear, noting that his campaign is "in deficit" precisely because it has been "scrupulous about monitoring the transparency" of contributions. (EL ESPECTADOR, 23 April) Economic Program In an interview with EL ESPECTADOR (1 May), Samper said his proposed economic program of "social capitalism" acknowledges the "virtues of private initiative and the operation of markets," while recognizing their "limitations." It gives the state a "more definitive" role in the "regulation and orientation" of measures affecting the economy and social welfare. According to Samper: "The state must promote the democratization of credit and access to property; limit the concentration [of power] within the economy, and abuse by those with a dominant position in the market; and make a deliberate effort to promote competition." Samper's model holds that economic policy should be guided by considerations of "efficiency" as much as of "equity," and that social policy has "as much importance" as economic policy. For this reason, says Samper, he has focused on job creation, for only in this way is it possible to "harmonize growth with a favorable distribution of income," and to improve the situation of the "46 percent of Colombian families who live in poverty." Samper said his model does not view privatization as an "ideology," but seeks to use private capital to provide broader access to public services and to improve their quality and efficiency. He further explained that his model would recognize the need for intervention to influence the exchange rate, and for policies to protect producers from unfair competition, and to protect and subsidize agriculture. As on past occasions, Samper contrasted his model of "social capitalism" with Pastrana's model of "savage capitalism." Samper faulted Pastrana's economic program, which he said would limit state action to providing only the "most basic" services--those related to defense, security, justice--and added that Pastrana advocated a "neutral" economic policy guided only by "efficiency without taking equity into account." According to Samper, Pastrana's social policy is essentially that of "picking up the victims" of the "concentration of economic power" and the "uncontrolled operation of the market." Pastrana, he said, "believes blindly in savage privatization without conditions" and is "concerned with economic figures and not with the individual." In addition, he said that Pastrana's job creation program is virtually "nonexistent." Counternarcotics Policy In the same interview with EL ESPECTADOR (1 May) Samper said the country "cannot surrender a single millimeter to criminal organizations." Samper stated: "In this internal struggle we will continue the policy of surrendering to justice which has served to dismantle some of the criminal organizations, but there is no doubt that more severe sentences must be imposed and the accumulation of sentence reductions must be prevented." Samper spoke forcefully on the role of the international community in the counternarcotics effort: "We must do much more to demand responsibility on the part of the international community in this struggle, especially in the control of money laundering, the sale of chemical substances, and the control of consumption in which the developed countries do not make a greater effort. I will develop an aggressive international policy in this regard so that the world finally understands that Colombia is the main victim and not the executioner." Agriculture Sector Concerns During campaign tours of several municipalities in Huila and Tolima Departments affected by the agricultural crisis, Samper's promises to reinvigorate that sector met with enthusiastic applause, according to EL ESPECTADOR (25 April). Acknowledging that the agricultural sector has been negatively affected by the "apertura" (market opening) program, Samper said apertura must not be a one-way street whereby imports are favored at the expense of domestic producers. Samper proposed transforming the Agricultural Credit Bank (Caja Agraria) into "the tool of assistance of many years ago," so that it would be more responsive to the needs of farmers. (EL ESPECTADOR, 25 April) Samper added that his government would ensure that farmers and ranchers who wish to refinance their credit be allowed to do so. Speaking to ranchers days later during a campaign visit to the Atlantic Coast region, Samper reiterated his promise to provide subsidies for agriculture and to address the problem of insurgent violence in the countryside. (EL TIEMPO 2 May) "New Conservatism" Backs Samper A group calling itself "New Conservatism" announced its formation on 26 April in an event held in Bogota and attended by Ernesto Samper. (EL ESPECTADOR, 27 April) The group includes former presidential candidate Rodrigo Marin Bernal, Juvenal de los Rios, Rodolfo Segovia, and other Conservatives who have said they will support the Liberal Party candidate and his Alliance for Colombia. Samper, who attended the event along with Humberto De la Calle, hailed the support of these "important Conservatives" as a "step forward in the direction of reforming Colombia politics," noting that change was needed because Colombians had "lost confidence in the mechanisms of representation and in public administration itself." (EL ESPECTADOR, 27 April) The National Conservative Directorate issued a statement in which it criticized the group's decision to support Samper, and said the move demonstrates that Samper continues the practice of "clientelism which has corrupted the country's political customs." (EL ESPECTADOR, 26 April) Ministry of Culture Planned On 29 April, during a campaign tour of several Atlantic Coast cities, Ernesto Samper attended the Cultural Forum in Barranquilla where he announced plans to establish a Ministry of Culture if elected. The forum, which took place at the nationally recognized Fine Arts School of the Universidad del Atlantico, was organized by a committee headed by Samper's wife, Jacquin, and attended by 700 Colombian artists. Samper said this proposed ministry could likewise be called the "Ministry of Peace since culture is synonymous with peace," and explained that such a ministry would strengthen the sense of national identity, fostering "unity within diversity." (EL TIEMPO, 30 April) EL TIEMPO'S coverage of the event included a half-page interview with Mrs. Samper in which she explained the rationale for establishing a separate Ministry of Culture and what its scope would be. (EL TIEMPO, 30 April) Samper Opposes Reducing Beer Tax On 27 April Ernesto Samper asked Liberal Party senators not to support a bill currently under review by a Senate committee which would reduce the tax on beer, according to EL TIEMPO (28 April). Samper explained that the beer tax accounts for over 25 percent of the tax income received by the departments. In 13 departments it accounts for more than half of tax income, and in four departments it accounts for 65 percent of tax income. Samper said he felt he was in a position to make such a request because he is leader of the party, and noted that he had reached a judgment on the bill as a result of his discussions with Liberal governors. Samper also proposed that trade officials study ways to alleviate the fiscal burden on the beer industry to reduce the problem of contraband.
