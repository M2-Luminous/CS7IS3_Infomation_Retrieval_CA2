The Andhra Pradesh Government faced acute embarrassment as the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao was greeted by hostile demonstrations almost everywhere he went during a day long tour of his Nandyal constituency on Thursday. Perhaps, it was the for the first time that the motorcade of a Prime Minister was forced to retreat when a 200-strong defiant mob of extremists blocked his way, taking the strong posse of police by surprise. The incident occurred near the Municipal office in Nandyal as the Prime Minister was proceeding to address a public meeting. These anti-Dunkel demonstrators, undeterred by the lathicharge, chased the Prime Minister's convoy as it was retreating to a guest house. The incident forced postponement of the public meeting by two and half hours and a worried Chief Minister, M. K. Vijayabhaskara Reddy tendered an apology for the security lapse. The day's schedule of the Prime Minister began on an unhappy note with a group of villagers waving black flags at Mr. Rao's first public meeting at Atmakur, demanding lift irrigation schemes from Srisailam main canal. Atmakur area is the centre of extremist activity in Kurnool district. Demonstration by women: Yet another show of protest under the very nose of the police was one led by Ms Sandhya of Progressive Organisation of Women who contested against the Chief Minister in Panyam Assembly constituency. She organised a group of women, flaunting empty pitchers near the R & B Guest House where the Prime Minister was staying, demanding drinking water for Nandyal town. This was followed by a noisy demonstration by Rayalaseema Paper Mills Staff and Workers Union while Mr. Rao was inaugurating a flyover on the town outskirts. Angry at the Prime Minister turning a deaf ear to their demand for reopening of the sick mill, the workers went on a rampage in the town, burning Congress(I) flags, pulling down arches and banners and damaging the vehicles en route. About 3,000 men and women marched towards the venue of the public meeting but were chased away by the police. This incident too caught the district administration off guard because a CITU (Center of Indian Trade Unions) delegation led by Mr. N. Prasada Rao, its State Secretary, was allowed to meet the Prime Minister. Bullet proof enclosure: In response to these demonstrations, the Prime Minister explained the Government's stand on Dunkel proposals but did not refer to either the water scarcity in Nandyal or the paper mill workers' demands. For the first time in Nandyal constituency, Mr. Rao addressed public meetings, standing behind a bullet proof glass enclosure. Specific questions relating to the needs of Nandyal constituency dominated the press conference that Mr. Rao addressed at the guest house but his replies were vague. He expressed happiness over the pace of developmental activities in his constituency during the 25 months since his election but refused to draw comparisons with Amethi, represented by late Rajiv Gandhi. The press meet was a brief seven-minute affair. Water schemes launched: Mr. Narasimha Rao's fifth visit to his constituency was marked by the launching of two protected drinking water schemes involving an investment of Rs.[rupees]3.5 crores and benefiting 31 villages, seven lift irrigation schemes costing Rs. 1.30 crores, inauguration of a Scheduled Caste housing colony and a Rs. 4.81-crore road bridge in Nandyal. He also declared open a low power TV transmitter at Atmakur, the only Assembly segment in his constituency, which did not have this facility. The Government media managers took pains to project the progress in the constituency and circulated brochures highlighting development activities at the press conference. But the spate of demonstrations and the memoranda submitted to the Prime Minister indicate that the expectations aroused in the wake of his election still persist.
