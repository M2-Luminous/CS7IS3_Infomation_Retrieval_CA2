During his 10-day visit to the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong met and had contacts with many high-ranking U.S. officials as well as representatives of the U.S. business circle. On his return home, the deputy prime minister gave an interview to the newspaper SAIGON GIAI PHONG. He said: - I led the Vietnamese delegation to visit the United States at the invitation of the "International Conference on Economic Development." We attended three seminars held in Washington, New York, and San Francisco. U.S. business circles showed great interest in these seminars. The number of participants in these seminars consistently exceeded the figure of people invited. At the Washington seminar, only 200 people were invited but there were as many as 250 people attending. At the New York seminar, there were 200 people participating compared with only 150 people invited. Most of the questions raised by U.S. business concerns were very realistic, substantial, and practical. U.S. business concerns believe that the time is ripe for them to enter Vietnam. We also met U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, a number of U.S. congressmen, and the U.S. [Senate] Foreign Relations Committee. Through these meetings, the U.S. side agreed with the Vietnamese side that it is now time to end the post-war period of tension and to start the process of gradually building normal relations and advance toward building fine foreign relations between the United States and Vietnam. This is in the interests of the United States, Vietnam, and the trend toward peace, stability, and cooperation in the region. While in the United States, I also visited the president of the World Bank, the director-general of the International Monetary Fund, and the chairman of the UN Development Program. All of the heads of these organizations affirmed that they would provide positive assistance to various cooperative projects with Vietnam. [Correspondent] Did the U.S. business concerns mention any obstacles encountered while investing in Vietnam [Tran Duc Luong] Apart from highly appreciating the opportunities for doing business in Vietnam, U.S. businessmen also pointed out three main obstacles encountered by them when engaged in doing business in Vietnam. They are: 1. The Vietnamese legal system is not perfect; 2. Vietnam's infrastructure is still weak; and 3. Vietnam's administrative procedures are cumbersome and complex. [Correspondent] Did we sound out the prospects for exporting Vietnamese goods to the United States? [Tran Duc Luong] During various contacts, both the U.S. political circles and U.S. businessmen admitted that to promote increased trade investment between the United States and Vietnam, we need the efforts of both sides. It is precisely because of this that they [U.S. businessmen] also were concerned about how to help Vietnam export its goods to the United States. Vietnam's exports, including rice and beer, to the United States have been made in small quantities. While in the United States, I was told by the U.S. business concerns that it welcome the return of Vietnamese goods to the U.S. market after many years of absence. I met with groups of U.S. businessmen and we initially agreed on the signing of certain contracts for the export of goods to the United States. Of course, the export of goods to the United States can develop satisfactorily only when the United States grants Vietnam the most-favored nation status. [Correspondent] As you have already met Secretary of State Christopher, could you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, speak of the substance of the meeting? [Tran Duc Luong] The meeting was focused on the relations between the two countries and other regional issues. [Correspondent] Did the two sides deal with the follow-up "road map" of U.S.-Vietnamese relations? [Tran Duc Luong] At various meetings and seminars where they spoke, U.S. officials never dealt with any "timetables." They only said that the bilateral relations would achieve rapid development if residual issues are satisfactorily resolved. [Correspondent] Will the Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Winston Lord arrive in Vietnam in late June for visit? [Tran Duc Luong] I met Mr. Winston Lord after I had met Mr. Warren Christopher. At that meeting, Mr. Winston Lord handed me a note from the U.S. State Department on its consent to a decision to officially make public the news about the establishment of liaison offices in the capitals of the two countries. [Correspondent] Is there any reaction from the U.S. public? When will the liaison offices be opened in the two countries' capitals? [Tran Duc Luong] This news met with a warm welcome from the U.S. public, particularly from U.S. business circles. Many people in business in the U.S. even asked the U.S. Government to move further toward promptly granting Vietnam the most-favored nation status. The liaison offices will function like Consulates General. Mr. James Habi who has been nominated by the U.S. Government to head the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi said in a seminar that at the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi, there would be economic specialists whose duty is to provide assistance to U.S. businessmen. At present, the two countries are finalizing various procedures about administration and staffing so the two offices can soon be put into operations. The U.S. side also took me on a visit to the building where the Vietnamese Liaison Office in the United States will be headquartered. The building is located within the foreign embassies' quarter in Washington. This building, formerly belonging to Vietnam, has been well maintained by the U.S. side. [Correspondent] During his meeting with you, did Secretary of State Warren Christopher say that increased U.S.-Vietnamese relations would have an impact on regional peace and stability? [Tran Duc Luong] Both the United States and Vietnam hold that the Asia-Pacific region in general and the Southeast Asian region in particular is a dynamically developing region with fine economic prospects. This trend requires countries in the region to take responsibility for maintaining peace and stability so the region can develop favorably. The United States realizes Vietnam's important role in Southeast Asia and wants Vietnam to shoulder [ganhs vacs] the common duty of maintaining regional peace and stability. For its part, Vietnam believes that the United States has an important say and role in maintaining regional peace and stability and hopes that the United States will fulfill this mandate. Increased U.S.-Vietnamese relations will certainly have a positive impact on the region. [Correspondent] Will the two countries' embassies in their respective capitals be opened in the not-too-distant future? [Tran Duc Luong] No one can give a specific timing. The only thing I know is that if the two governments continue to resolve their residual issues as they are doing now, the process of normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese relations will achieve rapid progress. [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister.
