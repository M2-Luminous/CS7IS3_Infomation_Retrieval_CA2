FR941026-2-00033 FR941026-2-00022 DOT has asserted that: (1) local roads and other disturbances have already fragmented the area to some degree; (2) the undeveloped block of habitat near Second Brook is actually 10,000 acres, not 3,000 or 5,000 acres and the road would not pass through the center of it; (3) the bridges and culverts would provide for the movement of animals; (4) DOT's consultant conducted a site specific analysis of the habitats and wildlife; and (5) the vernal pools, several of which are impaired, do not contain any special species. EPA agrees in part with some of these statements, but nevertheless believes the NHCH could have unacceptable effects on wildlife. EPA is, however, especially interested in receiving comment on the five issues raised above. In considering DOT's statements, EPA has been mindful of several factors. First, while there are local roads in the area, most of them are roughly 25 ’ wide and have tree canopies which cover most of the road. Fragmentation impacts are generally proportional to the size of the interruption. A 250 ’ wide highway such as the NHCH, with activity throughout the day and night would normally cause an order of magnitude or greater impact than existing conditions. Second, EPA agrees that the overall habitat block approximates 10,000 acres, but this fact only underscores the value of the area for wildlife. That a roadway further east could cross more of the center of the block does not change the severe impacts of a highway in the present proposed location. Third, we hope that the bridges and culverts would help with animal movement patterns; however, despite these efforts less than 2% of the roadway will allow passage and, in any event, there is little known regarding animal use of oversized culverts. These passages would not assist many of the small species searching for food or breeding sites that cannot find or travel to the nearest potential passageway. Other long ranging species can and will cross highways without using a culvert and are subject to roadkill. While the EIS provided much useful information, it contained relatively few site specific wildlife observations and the likely impacts of the highway. Thus, EPA contracted with wildlife experts to gain site specific information lacking in the EIS. Preliminary results for reptiles and amphibians confirm that many of the vernal pools the NHCH would impact provide high quality breeding habitat for many wetland species, including a rare state listed species. Secondary and Cumulative Impacts Construction of the highway may also spur secondary development along the route which will degrade additional aquatic resources. The highway would allow quicker access to the region, encouraging greater development especially for certain types of projects. Location and access are major siting criteria for many types of commercial and industrial development. In addition, these projects normally require reasonably large tracts of land increasing the prospects of adverse impacts to wetland habitat. Over time, additional point and non-point contamination sources may degrade the quality of both surface and groundwater supply resources. Based on the number of permit applications that EPA, the Corps, and the State have reviewed the past 10 years, the greater Nashua area has experienced some of the most severe cumulative loss of aquatic habitat in New England. The direct and indirect impacts from the proposed highway would aggravate the severe cumulative loss of habitat and depletion of biodiversity that has occurred. Furthermore, other large highways proposed in this vicinity, such as the Manchester Airport highway, the Nashua southwest bypass, and the Windham-Salem Route 111 bypass are currently in the planning stages. If built, these highways would result in additional cumulative impacts to the wetlands and streams that flow into this portion of the Merrimack River. Water Quality Impacts The NHCH would also reduce overall water quality as a result of temporary construction related adverse impacts, the long-term adverse impacts from contamination from highway stormwater runoff, the anticipated secondary and cumulative impacts associated with newly constructed highways, and the potential for bulk chemical or fuel spills. Greater amounts of sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants associated with urban runoff, such as heavy metals, oil and grease, and organic contaminants could enter groundwater and tributary streams and flow into the Merrimack River. Sedimentation results in turbidity and often transports pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins into the streams, which adversely affects aquatic life. EPA is aware that DOT proposes to make a substantial effort to reduce impacts to drinking water resources. It plans to install a closed drainage system near the Pennichuck water supply that diverts a majority of the runoff to a detention pond downstream of the intake. It also proposes to divert drainage from the F.E. Everett Turnpike (not part of the NHCH), several bridges (including crossing the Merrimack River), several interchanges, including the Turnpike and Route 102, and other locations, and discharge the contaminated water into lined detention basins for water quality renovation, prior to being discharged to a surface water source (e.g. the Merrimack River or an associated tributary). DOT also states it will carefully maintain these structures and ponds and designate a Environmental Coordinator to oversee the implementation of the plans. In addition, there has been discussion about implementing some type of long-term water quality monitoring plan to evaluate the effectiveness of selected detention basins. While these measures will help considerably, and in the case of the F.E. Everett Turnpike, actually improve an existing situation, the highway would unavoidably increase overall pollution to these water supply sources. The NHCH would place over 200 acres of land under pavement and impact a number of surface and groundwater public water supplies by adding contaminants to these aquatic systems. Stormwater runoff from the highway would degrade both surface and groundwater. While mitigation measures could reduce these impacts, it is difficult to control fully the pollutants generated by a large highway crossing many streams and wetlands. For example, long-term problems such as accidents, spills, maintenance and disposal would remain. Detention ponds hopefully remove the majority of the pollutants, but some pollution passes through and enters aquatic systems. Over time, detention ponds may become a sink of pollution unless properly and frequently dredged and maintained. In time, impermeable lining material may be altered in such a way that it could be functioning less efficiently. Also, numerous portions of the highway would drain directly to groundwater, wetlands and streams.
