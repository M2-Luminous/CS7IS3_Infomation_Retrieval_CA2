The applicants to hold rallies, which are to be held in the very center of Moscow on Theater Square -- the aim of which, according to the organizers, is to confirm the people's volition for the unity of the country, as expressed in the March 1991 referendum and also the leading role of Russia in creating a single union state -- are the Russian Communist Party, the National Salvation Front, Working Moscow, the Liberal Democratic Party, and Revival. Sergey Dontsov, head of the Moscow Council's State Legal Directorate, today spoke to their representatives, calling on them to strictly follow the aim of the planned action and not to try the patience of the Moscow authorities by coming out with slogans which do not fit in with the direct purpose of the rallies. In this regard, Sergey Dontsov warned those present that if such incidents, which have already taken place on several occasions, are repeated, then opposition parties and movements will no longer be allowed to meet on Theater Square, but given places further from the center.
