The military sources told LOS TIEMPOS that this attitude is to be understood to the extent that "the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have never actually received these funds." The military sources supported their opinions by pointing out that the U.S. Army spent more than $5 million in the name of Bolivia under the excuse of carrying out civic actions in the town of Santa Ana del Yacuma in Beni Department in 1992. The sources noted: "In fact, barely $250,000 was invested in building a school that year." In the opinion of our country's military authorities, the cutbacks in this year's interdiction programs announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration "are a result of the U.S. Army's mismanagement of economic resources over the past few years."
