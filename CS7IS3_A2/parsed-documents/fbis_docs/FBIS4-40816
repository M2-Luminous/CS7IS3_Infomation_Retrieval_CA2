We cannot live without one another," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in his remarks at the opening ceremony of the 19th World Gas Congress here on Monday. The Russian premier emphasised that Moscow expects specific proposals from the Group-of-Seven countries for cooperation in regulating flows of investments and elaborating adequate and specific mechanisms to encourage and insure them. "Russia strives to be recognised a `country with a transitional economy' by partners for the forthcoming G-7 summit in Naples and expects G-7 countries to make new specific steps to improve conditions for Russian commodities' access to external markets," Chernomyrdin said. "I am confident that the G-7 turning into a G-8 would lead to fundamentally important and positive changes in the geopolitical balance and create new favourable conditions for Russia's full-scale participation in the world economic system," Chernomyrdin pointed out. The World Gas Congress is being attended by about 5,000 delegates from 67 countries. They represent leading gas companies that determine gas-industry policy on a world scale. Russia, which now accounts for 36 percent of the world's reserves of natural gas holds a special place in this respect. Experts, politicians and diplomats, whom the Russian delegation meet at the congress, show a lively interest in the state of affairs in Russia. Russia accounts for about 30 percent of the world's trade in gas, Chernomyrdin emphasised. The existence of large gas resources in eastern Siberia and on the Shelf of Sakhalin opens up possibilities for the export of gas to China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, the shipping of gas by tankers to the United States and other countries. Moscow is prepared to discuss proposals about foreign firms' participation in the development of gas and oil fields and in the construction of processing facilities, Chernomyrdin said. He pointed out the importance of reducing fuel losses during production and transportation, and described plans to build steam and gas-fired power stations in the European part of Russia. Chernomyrdin toured the display stands of Gazprom and the Italian ENI fuel company at a specialised exhibition which has been timed for the World Gas Congress.
