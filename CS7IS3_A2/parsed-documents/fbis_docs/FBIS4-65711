"This situation is very regrettable because these sanctions are also affecting Bulgaria," Daskalov said during a one-day official visit here. "This conflict must be resolved on the negotiating table rather than through an embargo." Greece has refused landlocked Macedonia access to its northern port of Salonika since mid-February in a dispute over names. Athens accuses Skopje of having designs on the northern Greek province of Macedonia and of usurping Greek symbols on its flag. Daskalov on Friday also said that his country was paying a heavy price as a result of the UN trade embargo against the rump-Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- for the Serbs' role in the wars in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.
