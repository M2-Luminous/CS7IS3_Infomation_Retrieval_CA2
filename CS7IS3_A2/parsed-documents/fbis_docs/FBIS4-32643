FBIS4-32643 "dreeu124_d_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 SLOVAKIA Coalition Row Over Privatization Minister Coalition Row Over Privatization Minister AU2806100194 AU2806100194 BFN [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 23 and 24 June publish reports on objections voiced by some coalition deputies against Milan Janicina, minister for the administration and privatization of national property, and reactions to calls for Janicina's resignation from his post. Bratislava SME in Slovak on 23 June on page 2 carries a 600-word "asa"-signed report entitled "Deputies of the Coalition Party of the Democratic Left Want To Call on Milan Janicina To Resign." The report states: "Yesterday's meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic Privatization Committee dealt with the problem of whether Milan Janicina should be called upon to resign from the post of minister for the administration and privatization of national property. Members of this committee have received additional documentation pertaining to the `House of Culture Atrium-Ruzinov' affair, in which Milan Janicina was involved as commercial lawyer and, according to some indications, placed [his client's] commercial interests above the interests of the state. Deputies for the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] (Zselenak, Plesnik), the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (Tomecek), and the Slovak National Party (Kona) proposed that the committee pass a resolution recommending that Milan Janicina resign from his post, in view of the `strength of the arguments.' This course of action was opposed by deputies for the government coalition and the Hungarian coalition (Durana, Pollak, Pribula, Komlosy). They argued that, at the very least, one must wait for the ruling of the court, which is now dealing with the case, and ask the Bar Association for its standpoint. At the same time, they were pointing out that, if Milan Janicina committed any mistake, this happened long before he became minister." According to the report, the committee finally decided to suspend the debate on the minister's case until 28 June. On the same day, on page 1, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries a 200-word interview with SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik by Jana Pankovcinova entitled "Milan Ftacnik Does Not Rule Out That the Question of Replacing Minister Janicina Will Be Raised." In the interview, the place and date of which are not given, Ftacnik is asked to respond to rumors that "the Coalition Council has dealt with the person of Privatization Minister Milan Janicina" and that "the prevailing view is that he should be replaced in this post by SDL Deputy J. Plesnik." While Ftacnik concedes that privatization issues have been discussed by the Coalition Council, he asserts that "no coalition partner has officially raised the issue" of replacing Janicina. As Ftacnik adds, however, "I cannot rule out that this issue may still be raised." Bratislava SME in Slovak on 24 June on pages 1 and 2 carries a 300-word "vec"-signed report entitled "Minister Janicina: Csino Is a Pretext; They Want To Recall Me Because I Refuse To Accommodate Bolshevik Managements." Responding to the calls of some members of the parliamentary privatization committee for his resignation, Janicina tells an unidentified SME correspondent: "Although committee members speak about the strength of arguments, in reality I do not know even one of their arguments." Janicina stresses that his only role in the "Atrium" affair was that of a commercial lawyer who gave legal assistance to his client, Mr. Viliam Csino, and helped him overrule the court's original verdict on the privatization of the "Atrium" building in Bratislava-Ruzinov. The minister wonders why he should be attacked for having been a "good defense council" and attributes the efforts to recall him to his "refusal to accommodate Bolshevik managements." Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 24 June on page 2 carries a 500-word TA SR report entitled "Milan Janicina Will Not Resign from His Post." The report notes that, at a meeting on 23 June, the Executive Committee of the National Democratic Party [NDS], of which Janicina is a member, expressed "support" for the minister and "deplored public attacks on him from a coalition partner." The NDS Executive Committee considers the attacks on Janicina "incompetent" and "contradicting the ethics of coalition cooperation," the report says. The PRAVDA report also quotes Minister Janicina as having told the TA SR that he will not resign. According to PRAVDA, in the interview for the TA SR, Janicina challenged the authority of the parliamentary privatization committee to judge the legal aspects of the privatization of the Atrium building and reiterated that he was not representing the interests of the state in the case but, rather, those of a private client: "If someone claims that I placed the commercial interest [of my client] above the interests of the state, he is either an idiot or he demagogically twists the truth," Janicina is quoted as having said. The dispute between SDL members of the parliamentary privatization committee and Minister Janicina is also the subject of a 700-word Alica Strbava commentary entitled "Juraj Plesnik's Moral Mimicry," in Bratislava SME in Slovak on 24 June on page 4. In Strbava's opinion, the true cause of the dispute must be sought in the different privatization ideas of the SDL-controlled Ministry of Economy and the NDS-controlled Ministry of Privatization. Strbava says: "It is a public secret that the Union of Industry is very favorably disposed toward the SDL, as is evidenced by the appointment of Peter Magvasi, a member of the Union of Industry, to the post of minister of economy. However, the Union of Industry was also favorably disposed toward former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. According to information from behind the scenes, Meciar had promised to the Union's representatives--that is, to the directors of the most important Slovak industrial companies (the Union of Industry comprises some 450 companies)--10 to 12 percent of the companies' shares, allegedly under very favorable terms. The present privatization minister, Milan Janicina, does not even want to hear about the fulfillment of this promise, which, naturally, does not play into the hands of the SDL."
