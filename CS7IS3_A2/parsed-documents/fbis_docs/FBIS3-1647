In light of these problems, Gu Erxiong stressed: The month before the spring sowing of cotton is the key to decide the success or failure in this year's cotton production. Governments at all levels should adopt feasible measures to successfully assign cotton growing quotas to peasants and ensure the scale of cotton growing acreage.
