Gylys stated in the letter that Lithuania called to start the negotiations on the associative agreement with the European Union [EU]. It is noted in the letter that the dynamic development of economic and political situation in Eastern and Central Europe increases the necessity to create effective forms of integration into the European Union for the Baltic States. Lithuania expressed its wish that the future free trade agreement with EU should comply with the commercial part of the associative agreement. Gylys urged the Council of Europe to adopt the decision which would allow to transform the free trade agreement between EU and Lithuania into the associative agreement. Greece presides in the Council of Europe during the first half of the year.
