Fortunately, there were no civilian casualties. At the same time, Britsh UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] soldiers clashed with the Serbian aggressor. [Reporter Hajrudin Ceric] First, the British were caught in fierce sniper fire from the criminals on the slopes of Mount Ozren. To protect their lives they returned fire from the small-caliber guns mounted on their combat vehicles. This was no convincing reason for the aggressor to cease fire. On the contrary, they opened up with brief but fierce bursts of fire from a Bofors gun. There was not the slightest trace of NATO aircraft in the sky as the blue helmets were stranded in dire straits. We have unofficially learned that there are no casualties among the ranks of the UNPROFOR unit.
