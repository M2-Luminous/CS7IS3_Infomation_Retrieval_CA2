In this article Colonel A. Zakharenko touches on one of its most important problems--the commander's plan to wage mobile ZRO, and the devising of a plan for combat operations that would correspond to that type of defense. The idea of organizing and conducting the mobile surface-to-air missile defense (ZRO) of fixed targets of the military and economic potential of Russia and its armed forces has been gaining more and more popularity among military scholars and practitioners among the surface-to-air missile forces [ZRV] with time. The experience of local wars and military conflicts has served as the foundation for this idea. The conceptual framework for mobile ZRO, in its most general form, consists of the following: Mobile ZRO is created on the basis of the mobile forces and assets of the ZRV and is waged with the widespread employment of maneuver by them, both before the start (in immediate preparations) and in the course of combat operations. The mobile ZRDNs [SAM battalions] are maintained in peacetime in a non-deployed state in parking areas near military compounds built close to the targets or non-mobile (fixed) ZRV sites being defended. The battalions are deployed to training positions that are selected in the immediate proximity of the military compounds to rehearse combat training tasks. A limited number of ZRDNs of a larger ZRV unit, deployed at specially equipped duty positions, are on combat alert status. The ZRDNs, in accordance with the plans for combat operations, are brought up during periods of threat to their primary battle positions, from which the repulsion of the first enemy air strikes is planned. The execution of maneuvers by the ZRDNs within their deployment areas to alternate battle positions, according to previously determined variations, is expected later in order to provide for the survivability of the unit or, according to the situation, to restore destroyed SAM missile systems, as well as to perform new tasks that arise. This concept has been codified in the guidelines with the coming of highly mobile SAM systems into service with the ZRV; in practice, however, the troops, as well as the tactical theory of the ZRV, still have a host of problems that make its complete realization more difficult. One of those problems, in my opinion, is the development and adoption of the plan for waging mobile ZRO by the unit commander and the preparation of the combat documents. The general plan of the unit commander and the plan for combat operations are currently worked out in detail for the primary combat positions. The scenario formulates, in particular, variations for the maneuvers of the ZRDN and the conditions for performing them, which are reflected on the map of the unit commander's plan in the form of tables that indicate the time of the maneuver to the first (for the first variation) and the second (for the second variation) alternate positions, as well as in the form of a graphical card for the frequency of coverage of the ZRDN envelopes for the maneuver variations. It follows from this that a variation of a maneuver assumes a shift of battle positions by all ZRDNs. But can we be sure that the enemy will give us such an opportunity -- to realize a selected variation of maneuver completely? Priority in the selection of a variation and the moment of a strike belongs to the airborne enemy. We will thus not be able to maneuver all ZRDNs into their alternate positions simultaneously. The duration of the period of threat and the time intervals between strikes in the course of combat operations are also determined by the airborne enemy. There thus may not be enough time for the sequential and orderly maneuvering of ZRDNs to alternate positions. Having deployed the units in battle formation in their primary areas during a period of threat, on the other hand, we should maneuver the ZRDNs within their deployment areas according to a previously worked-out schedule at least within a day (the concrete time is determined by the capabilities of enemy reconnaissance in the sector where combat operations are being conducted). And that means the repulsion of the first strikes by an airborne enemy will be repelled by a ZRDN not from the primary positions, for which a plan of operations has been developed in detail and the combat missions have been assigned to the subunits, but rather from the alternate positions. And that is just where the actions of the subunits have been defined very vaguely. A plan for the combat operations of a unit developed today based on a commander's plan for combat operations oriented toward waging a "positional" (from fixed positions) defense thus does not fully conform to the principles of mobile ZRO. What can be proposed to overcome this contradiction? The following approach to preparing and conducting mobile ZRO has been tried out in KShU [command/staff exercises] by those studying in the ZRV faculty, as well as in the ZRV units headed by officers M. Perfilov, L. Rusenchik and P. Krikun. Proceeding from a combat task that has been received and an assessment of the situation, the required values of surface-to-air missile fire are determined that correspond to the necessary correlation of forces with an airborne enemy -- the size of the area of air-defense missile fire, its density at the assigned lines, the number of firings and their effectiveness, and the frequency of target or area coverage. A system of air-defense missile fire, as is well known, is created via the deployment of units in battle formation. The basic parameters of the battle formation -- the standard distances of the ZRDN from the target being defended (ï¿½[.sup]sp[/]) and the intervals between their positions (J[.sup]sp[/]), as well as the distances between deployment lines of ZRDNs of various echelons when their deployment in echelons is necessary -- are thus calculated on the basis of the required indicators of the firing system that have been received. These parameters are used to determine the dimensions of the ZRDN deployment areas in the assigned deployment area of the large formation or unit. A system of battle positions is selected in the deployment areas of the ZRDNs that allows the fullest possible realization of the capabilities of the ZRDNs to defeat enemy SVN [offensive air weapons] at very low altitudes and maneuvering routes. The quantity of battle positions is not limited on a tactical plane therein -- the more the better (including on the maneuvering routes, within the limits of their capabilities). The rejection of the existing division of positions into battle, training and alert, and battle positions into primary and alternate, seems expedient. All of the battle positions are considered equivalent and, to the extent of capabilities (when they are accessible), are assimilated by the battalions during peacetime in the practicing of combat-training missions and in the course of alert duty. The apprehension expressed by some specialists that this will allow the enemy to uncover the system of positions, in my opinion, does not conform to the intent of highly mobile ZRO. So the system of battle positions has been determined. The schedule of maneuver of the ZRDNs according to the ZRO plan is then worked out. It should be optimized on the terms of preserving the assigned (required) parameters of the firing system at any moment in time, the minimum time and economic expenditures for performing the maneuvers, and the limitations of the systems of reconnaissance, command and control, and technical and rear support. It can also be tied to deceptive measures to confuse the enemy, and with the operations of interacting and covering formations and units. A possible variation of a schedule is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Schedule of the combat Recall that the necessary data regarding all of the positions should be entered into the local computer network--the information and computational system (IRS)--of the ZRV unit ahead of time. The IRS monitors the taking of battle positions by the battalions during a period of threat and the performance of maneuvers according to the ZRO plan, and issues recommendations for the performance of maneuvers during the course of combat operations based on the situation. The cutbacks in the armed forces that are taking place within the framework of military reform and, as a consequence, the necessity that is arising for the efficient performance of combat tasks using limited personnel and assets is an argument of no small importance in favor of this variation for organizing and conducting mobile ZRO. The angular dimensions of the deployment areas of the ZRDNs (deployment sectors) calculated relative to the hypothetical center of the target or area being defended may then be assigned to battalions as their primary sectors (_a_[.sup]pr[/]) when performing mobile operations by means of combat patrols within the deployment area of an air-defense missile brigade (ZRBR). The primary sectors of battalions (_b_[.sup]pr[/]) when maneuvering ZRDNs using combat patrols within their deployment areas are best designated according to the bisectors of the neighboring deployment sector (so that no gaps appear in the system of fire when performing missions by this or that ZRDN). These sectors are best used for organization and interaction with one's own fighters (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Deployment areas and The assignment of the primary sectors (search and firing) of the ZRDNs at low altitudes and alert duty sectors for group search seems extremely difficult when organizing and conducting mobile ZRO with an increased number of possible positions in the deployment area of a ZRDN. This requires a great deal of time for the performance of calculations and coordination, and means that the mobility of the ZRO will be limited; they should consequently be rejected. The assignment of the combat mission to the mobile ZRDN should thus include the boundaries of the deployment area, the primary sector, the system of battle positions, and the schedule and maneuvering signals. These data are reflected on the maps of the unit commander's plan for combat operations and on the maps of the ZRDN commanders. This approach to the development and formulation of the commanders' plans for waging mobile ZRO corresponds more to reality than the one employed today among the troops that is based on prevailing directive documents. From the editors: Such are the views and recommendations of a scholar for the organization and planning of mobile ZRO. True, we do not share them completely. The readers possibly also have other viewpoints and proposals. We await your letters. COPYRIGHT: "Vetsnik PVO" 1993
