According to Eurispes, 350-400,000 votes, or about ten percent of the Sicilian electorate are controlled by Cosa Nostra, and about the same proportion of the island's elective offices, through its 130 "families" each with 150-300 members. The study said that the simple magnitude of the revenue passing through Mafia organisations implies a need for financial services and brokering to handle it -- and, at the same time, an ability to exert pressure and influence decisions wherever the mafiosi are active. The study, which also confirmed that the Mafia is creating "bridge-heads in Europe and East Europe," reported that Italian organised crime as a whole boasts an an army of about 500,000 of whom about 100,000 are professionals and the others ready for the occasional job. Of the Mafia, the study said about 20 percent of its revenue comes from public contracting, which fits in well with figures from the Sicilian Audit Court claiming that tendering regulations are violated in 67 percent of all the public contracts signed in the region. The figures showed that over 26 trillion lire are invested in Sicilian public works contracts each year, with 14 trillion going to local councils. Sicily's regional government is the one that spends most in Italy, with an annual budget of almost 3.5 trillion lire a year. "Today," said Eurispes Chairman Gian Maria Fara, "Cosa Nostra and other Mafia organisations control significant slices of public life and the national as well as the southern market. ``If the Mafia has a political dimension, it is because it has managed to adapt to a service society, infiltrating various sectors of local government and administration. Multiplying the sources of expenditure has also opened new panoramas for Mafia activities to take root.''
