The appeal came at a time when a very grave phase of war fraught with an unpredictable danger has been created on the Korean peninsula by the reckless moves of the U.S. and South Korean bellicose quarters. "If a nuclear war broke out on the Korean peninsula, the Korean territory would be turned into a waste land and the Korean nation with a 5,000-year-long history would suffer from an irrevocable disaster", it warns, and says: "True patriotism for the Korean nation is manifested in averting the imminent danger of war and safeguarding the country's peace". It calls on all the political parties, groupings and people of all social strata of South Korea and overseas Koreans to turn out in a struggle for overthrowing the present treacherous regime of Kim Yong-sam and thwarting the reckless belligerent moves of the U.S. and South Korean bellicose circles. It appeals to the soldiers of the "ROK" to categorically reject the criminal order of the war-thirsty elements who are forcing them to serve outside forces as their mercenaries and impose a nuclear war disaster upon their families and fellow countrymen and turn their guns to the aggressors and the traitors. It appeals to the South Korean people to resolutely rise up in the anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons out of South Korea and convert the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone. The appeal stresses that all the compatriots must unite with each other as one nation with the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation as their common guideline of the nation and take part in the struggle for removing the danger of a nuclear war hanging over the nation and opening the way of the peace and peaceful reunification of the country.
