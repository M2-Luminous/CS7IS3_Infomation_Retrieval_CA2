Clearance of Information Collection Requirements 5 CFR 1320 sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

OMB has reviewed and approved the collection of information requirements for occupational exposure to Asbestos for Construction (29 CFR 1926.1101) and Shipyards (29 CFR 1915.1001) under OMB clearance numbers 1218&hyph;0134 and 1218&hyph;0195 respectively. The OMB clearances expire in July 1997. There were no new information collection requirements for General industry 29 CFR 1910.1001, currently approved under 1218&hyph;0133. The Asbestos General industry clearance expires in March 1996. VI. Authority and Signature This document was prepared under the direction of Joseph A.
