For people 35-year old and older with AIDS, heroin emergencies rose from 422 in 1990 to 2,128 in 1992, the report said. Overall, heroin-related hospital emergencies soared 44 percent in the first six months of 1993 over the same 1992 period. A recent official study also shows a 45 percent in PCP (pentachlorophenol) emergencies and a 61 percent rise in methamphetamine use in the United States. Experts estimate the number of heroin addicts across the United States at more than half a million and the number is still growing, today's "USA TODAY" reported. A report issued by the White House Drug Policy Control Office earlier this month cited marked increases in heroin use in the southwest, west and parts of the south of the United States, as well as in major cities like Washington, Boston, Denver and Los Angeles. Part of the attraction is heroin's purity, the paper said, adding that street doses can be more than five times as potent as they were a decade ago.
