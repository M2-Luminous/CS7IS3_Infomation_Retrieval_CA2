The research work is carried out under the direction of the renowned aerodynamicist and committee member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Prof. Zhuan Fenggan. Members of the research team include 140 scientists and engineers from the Beijing Aerodynamics Research Group of the Aerospace Industrial Corp., the Beijing Aeronautical and Aerospace University, the Graduate School of the Chinese Technical University, the Beijing University, the Mechanics Institute and Computer Center of the CAS, the Qinghua University, and the Chinese Aerodynamics Research and Development Center. Specifically, the research program covers the following eight problem areas: the characteristics and control of vortex flows; the effect of external excitation on shear layers and vortex motion; the interaction of moving shock-wave systems in gas flows; the shock-wave diffraction theory (using high-resolution digital simulation method and optical measurement technique); the non-equilibrium effect in high-temperature gas dynamics; digital simulation of non-equilibrium rarefied gas flows and experimental research of the transition region; digital simulation of internal complex flow field; and simulation of viscous separated flow field and eddy motion. All the planned activities of the research program have been successfully completed; many of the results have advanced the state-of-the-art in the particular field and are recognized by the international research community. In the study of ``interaction between three-dimensional shock waves and boundary layers,'' a comprehensive set of experimental data has been obtained. In the study of separated flow and eddy motion, for the first time mathematical conditions of flow separation and the conditions that must be satisfied by the lines of flow attachment have been derived. It has been proved for the first time that the lines of flow separation are the lines of convergence of the limiting stream lines, and they are themselves limiting stream lines; but the convergence of the limiting stream lines does not provide sufficient condition for the existence of the lines of separation. Also, for the first time the topological distribution of singularities along the lines of separation and the evolution of Hopf fork vortices along the vortex axis have been discovered. In the study of flows inside a curved pipe, digital simulation results of internal secondary flows have been obtained. In particular, the research in digital simulation of rarefied gases has received international recognition by world-renowned scholars. In mid-June, the results of this research program were reviewed and accepted by the National Foundation of Natural Sciences. Members of acceptance committee believe that many of the results are creative and original, and are judged to be state-of-the-art. For example, the flow-field analysis of separated flows and vortices, the study of high accuracy and high resolution format of digital computations, the study of vortex control techniques, the digital simulation of rarefied gas flows, and the study of shock-wave dynamics are considered to be outstanding achievements. Flow-field measurement and display technique is an important research tool in fluid mechanics; achieving such good results under existing test conditions is highly commendable. Vortices, shock waves and complex flows are currently the most active areas of research in fluid mechanics. They involve the understanding of fundamental laws in fluid flow and in physics. Further studies in these areas not only have important theoretical implications, but also have practical applications in many engineering fields such as aeronautical, aerospace, mechanical and chemical engineering.
