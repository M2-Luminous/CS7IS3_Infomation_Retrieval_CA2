In 1993, farm workers engaged in secondary and tertiary industries accounted for 29.8 percent of the total rural work force, an increase of 9.6 percentage points from 1992. This demonstrates China's new achievements in rural industrialization. Since the introduction of reform and opening up, large numbers of rural workers have abandoned crop planting to work in village and town enterprises or to engage in industrial, commercial, and service businesses in other regions. This shift of labor to other sectors has improved peasants' quality and incomes, helping to bring capital, technology, and information to the countryside. Last year was an important year in which rural China, or even the entire socioeconomic structure, turned in the direction of the market. It also saw the quickest transfer of surplus farm labor to nonfarm jobs. The number of workers thus transferred represented 8.6 percent of the total rural work force, an increase of 4.3 percentage points from 1992. Sectorally, industry, construction, commerce, and catering are the main industries where farm labor is headed. Among farm workers who shifted to nonfarm jobs in 1993, 31.1 percent went to the industrial sector, 25.1 percent to the construction industry, and 17 percent to commercial and catering businesses. Some also joined the communications and transportation sector, postal and telecommunications services, and sports, cultural, and art establishments as job opportunities for these workers multiplied. Although men account for most of the workers who transfer to nonfarm jobs, the number of women involved in such transfers is increasing. In 1993, women accounted for 33.2 percent of surplus farm workers who transferred to nonfarm jobs, an increase of 4.8 percentage points from 1992. Geographically, the shift within a province decreased in 1993 but that across provincial lines increased. Statistics show that nationwide, workers who switched to nonfarm jobs within provinces last year accounted for 80.6 percent of the total work force thus transferred, while those who shifted to nonfarm jobs outside their provinces represented 19.4 percent. Judging by the distribution of such labor in east, central, and west China, 74.1 percent of farm workers went to the east in ever-increasing numbers, while the percentage of workers moving to central and west China declined. In 1993, more farm labor transferred to nonfarm jobs in west China at a markedly accelerated pace; however, the number of such workers was still below the national average. Rural workers engaged in secondary and tertiary industries in all of west China accounted for 18 percent of the total rural work force, an increase of 6.7 percentage points from 1992. In 1993, the number of workers which transferred to nonfarm jobs in west China represented 7.8 percent of the total work force. Village and town enterprises continued to expand rapidly, becoming the main reason for last year's accelerated shift of surplus farm labor to nonfarm jobs. Nationwide, village and town enterprises numbered 24 million in 1993, an 18-percent increase from 1992, and employed 120 million workers.
