He accused the political forces participating in the government of practicing a "strong and backward centralism" in managing the state's affairs, adding that this shows that there is no desire to build a united state and its establishments but only a desire to keep things as they are. In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his residence in Aden, al-'Attas added that he rejected President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's offer to join the General People's Congress [GPC] because he did not want to cause more divisions within the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. He also confirmed that there are military movements between the two former sectors of Yemen following the frustration of the plans made to rebuild, organize, and unite the Armed Forces since the establishment of Yemeni unity on 22 May 1993. Al-'Attas spoke about the presence of terrorists in his country and how they are used in internal or external operations. He accused certain Yemeni state organs of benefiting from these terrorists carrying out operations against opposing political forces inside the country. In response to a question about the date of the prime minister's return to Sanaa, al-'Attas said: "Shortly...when we reach a full agreement on the security arrangements and the constitutional and legal guarantees, all of which aim to reorganize to establish security and stability in all parts of Yemen and make them the basis for ensuring that the guarantees agreed on to implement the "Pledge and Agreement" document will help ensure the implementation of the document." [sentence as published] Al-'Attas added: "The responsibility of signing the Pledge and Agreement document is a big one. There are still big "differences" in views and these must be resolved by the Yemeni political forces' Dialogue Committee. We believed that this issue should not be moved from the Dialogue Committee to a subcommittee. We believed that these arrangements and guarantees had to be resolved through the document. But the others insisted on resolving them through the subcommittee." The Yemeni prime minister dealt with the many efforts to reform the system and ensure unity and democracy through the establishment of law and order. He said: "All these efforts were met with countermeasures that showed the lack of desire to build the state and the establishments and the desire to let matters remain as they were before unity. Some political forces waged war against national reconstruction and the political, economic, financial, and administrative reform programs that were adopted by the government in 1991 and that it started to implement after being ratified by the Chamber of Deputies. This is sufficient evidence that there are countermeasures being taken." Al-'Attas added that he returned to Aden when the Dialogue Committee moved to that city after seeing that the work done between 22 November and the end of December 1993 did not result in much progress. The committee met from 2 January to 18 January and achieved a great deal that could not be done during the previous period. Regarding reports that there are divisions inside the YSP about continuing the unity process while the opposite is reportedly unanimous on this issue, the Yemeni prime minister said: "One of the real mistakes made by the GPC is its constant effort to create divisions within the YSP and to fragment the national movement. This is against democracy and it classifies people. It wishes to see these differences inside the YSP." Al-'Attas revealed, for the first time, the secret offer made to him by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to join the GPC instead of the YSP, adding that this was another indication of their attempts to create divisions within the YSP. He said: "Following the incident when the Military Police stopped me last November while I was on my way to Sanaa, a telephone call was made between myself and the brother president. The president asked me to resign from the YSP and join the GPC to continue in my position as prime minister. This is evidence of their continued efforts to split the YSP's unity." Al-'Attas added that his reply to the president's offer was that relinquishing his YSP membership would not be useful to the GPC, the YSP, or the Yemeni homeland. Regarding reports about military movements in preparation for a confrontation between the two sides and the allocation of specific amounts of money to buy equipment and ammunition without the other side's knowledge, such as the one billion riyals that the president ordered to be spent in addition to the state budget or the accusation against the YSP that $300 million was added to the cost of the oil project in Hadhramaut without the president's or the government's knowledge for the same reason, al-'Attas said: "This is the first time I have heard of such a thing. We may have heard before that the same figure mentioned was given by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia!" Al-'Attas added: "First, there is no Yemeni project whose cost has been increased. All the Yemeni oil projects have been completed. These projects' budgets have been approved by the Higher Council for Economic and Oil Affairs. Therefore, what is being said is really strange. The other side is looking for any accusation-- regardless of how false--to make against the YSP." Regarding the military movements, al-'Attas said: "We do not deny that there are military movements by both sides. We have repeatedly warned against this, including in our letter to the Chamber of Deputies in October 1993 when we called for the control of the Army and security through the allocations, the expenditures, and the merger. But this has not been done. We have emphasized our desire that the Armed Forces should not be used in the conflict. One of the guarantees required to implement the Pledge and Agreement document is the adoption of all measures to prevent the use of the Armed Forces as an excuse to abort the document or to proceed with it in the opposite direction." When told that the YSP has been accused of "internationalizing" the problem, the Yemeni prime minister said: We in the YSP have not said this, they are saying it. In his latest trip to Aden as part of the mediation committee, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar met with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and said that there are two systems and two states, which is the reality. During the transitional period, the YSP sought to complete the unification of all institutions, including the military establishment, but if you follow these steps you will realize who was obstructing unification to prevent the establishment of a single state and a unified army. He added: The others are throwing accusations right and left at all people and all countries, including Egypt, but I see it as a Yemeni issue. The problems of application are Yemeni, too, and they were not born in August 1993, as they claim, but go as far back as September 1990, immediately after the Iraqi incursion into Kuwait. The dilemma lies in the failure to recognize that this is a serious problem facing a single state and that there is a crisis facing the unified state because of this dilemma. Al-'Attas categorically denied the GPC's accusations against the YSP that the latter has recently received military aid from Bulgaria with Kuwaiti financing. He said: This is absolutely untrue. They are accusing many sisterly countries, although military preparations by all parties to the conflict are clearly obvious nowadays, but we want to prevent such preparations. Regarding the secessionist threats facing Yemen's southern governorates in particular should a separation take place, God forbid, the Yemeni prime minister said: The threats made by them are not new. They know very well that the YSP is a unionist party, that all its practices are unionist, and that it does not seek a separation. Their remarks always reflect their inner feelings and what they are thinking. When the dialogue started, within the tripartite coalition first and at the national level later on, who was advancing serious and responsible proposals to emerge from the crisis? Was it the YSP or the GPC? Al-'Attas was then asked about the YSP's ambitions for power, which exceed the results of the recent parliamentary elections in Yemen, something that further complicates the crisis. He said: These accusations are untrue as far as the YSP is concerned. The proof of this is the debates of the quadripartite committee that started in November 1991 and continued until 1993. These discussions prove that the YSP has never thought of seizing power but has recognized the need for the participation of all Yemeni political forces. Al-'Attas said that the YSP consolidated its position during the recent parliamentary elections. The YSP succeeded in retaining all the seats in the southern provinces, except for two that were granted to the GPC [as published]. Meanwhile, the YSP managed to wrest a number of seats from the GPC in the north. This represented a great victory for the YSP over the GPC and the Yemen Reform Party. The Yemeni prime minister added: The elections were not disappointing as far as the YSP was concerned because it demonstrated the YSP's strength. Had it not been for some terrorist practices by certain sides, the YSP would have achieved better results, particularly in the northern provinces. In response to a question about the charges that the YSP is responsible for the terrorist acts--judging by the historical record before unity and the attempt to accuse the GPC and other parties of being responsible for the recent assassinations of the YSP's cadres--al-'Attas said: When the terrorist acts started in Yemen, they [not further identified] said that these practices were the result of a settling of accounts among the YSP members or were motivated by acts of revenge. The YSP used to arrest the defendants and refer them to the competent judicial departments. But the interrogations with the defendants were always contradictory to the charges against the YSP. After unity, 151 YSP cadres were liquidated, in addition to the direct threats against the party. Al-'Attas continued: The investigations always blamed external forces, although the perpetrators were Yemenis. In my capacity as the prime minister, I demanded that assassinations be halted and measures be taken against a number of defendants who carried out such assassinations. When the security measures were implemented, a perpetrator from the southern provinces was arrested. But the others failed to arrest the defendants at their end, although the location of the defendants and those supporting them was known. Al-'Attas added: When the explosion occurred near my house in July 1992, a person was arrested whose hands smelled of TNT. But the next day the security reports were reversed and claimed that the smell was that of "qat" [narcotic plants]. The Yemeni prime minister then talked about the foreign dimensions of terrorism which has affected Egypt. He said: "Terrorism has various forms. Terrorism runs counter to the democratic course pursued in Yemen. All terrorist practices in Yemen are listed under the category of terrorism. We have warned against these practices because the state resorted to favoritism with some parties to gain their support in confronting other domestic forces. A number of Yemenis and non-Yemenis recently returned to Yemen from Afghanistan." The prime minister added: In my opinion, the presence of these terrorist elements in Yemen is harmful to the country and to its relations with other countries. It has become clear that there is "an overlap" [taqatu'] between the terrorist elements and the state apparatus. The extent of this "overlap" is not yet known. As prime minister, during a meeting attended by the head of the Presidential Council in 1992 I called for the arrest of the non-Yemeni terrorist elements or their expulsion from the country. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih issued a decision on this matter at that time, but the decision was not implemented. Some of the Yemeni terrorist elements were detained from the south governorates. The move was designed to cast a shadow on these governorates, particularly in view of the "allegations" that the orders of assassinations were issued by the YSP and that the said elements were members of the Jihad Party [hizb al-jihad]. The obvious goal, naturally, was to create further divisions within the southern governorates. The Yemeni prime minister accused the GPC of demonstrating its partitionist designs through the "circular" issued by its standing committee to Yemeni diplomatic missions abroad. He said: The GPC standing committee is the authority in charge of issuing orders to the diplomatic missions abroad. Answering a question concerning the ineligibility of the ruling regime in Yemen to lead the unified state because of its totalitarian history in both states before unity and the fact that the Yemenis have doubts about that regime and are trying to find an alternative democratic system, al-'Attas said: I believe that unity was a great event in Yemen's history. Unity coincided with democracy and these two developments, if left to interact with life and reality, will certainly spawn numerous leaderships. The problem is that the absence of democracy in the past has not allowed leaderships to emerge, but they will emerge in the future. The Yemeni prime minister concluded his interview with AL-AHRAM by commenting on the task of rebuilding, reorganizing, and reuniting the Yemeni Armed Forces. He said: The Yemeni defense minister made several proposals on this matter and some of these were ratified, but some backsliding took place. "In March 1992 the Yemeni Cabinet referred the issue to the prime minister and called for a solution. After meeting with the leaders of the Defense Ministry, the general principles were laid down and referred to the presidency. Suddenly, the whole project was dumped. A third attempt coincided with the formation of the coalition government. A proposal for rebuilding the Armed Forces, drafted by the defense minister and his colleagues, was ratified, with some changes, by the president. A timetable for its actual implementation was prepared. Suddenly, a new chief of staff was appointed and that man requested the postponement of any discussion of this subject. The result was that nothing was accomplished." The prime minister spoke about Yemen's link to domestic and external terrorist incidents. He said: The state has followed and still follows a policy of "appeasement" of certain political forces to win their support in the face of other domestic forces. He added that the presence of terrorists in Yemen is harmful to that country both on the domestic and foreign levels. He disclosed the existence of "an overlap" or a yet unclear exchange of interests between these elements and some Yemeni state organs. The non-Yemeni elements have not been expelled from the country, he said.
