After 10 hours of discussion by supporters and opponents of the budget and also the government's defense, the general points of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill were ratified. According to a report by our correspondent, Mr. Mas'ud Rowghani-Zanjani, in defending the government bill, continuing his statements of last night, said: It is appropriate for the point to be raised that, as far as we can, we should base the cost of the operation of the country on taxes, in other words, our administrative system should be based on tax resources. In the Second [Five-Year Development] Plan, the government policy is to gradually base the current expenditures on tax resources and developmental expenditures on oil resources. This cannot be done all at once. Referring to the 50-percent growth of the current sector, which was the subject of Mr. Khamushi's discussion, he said: Out of 7,000 billion rials[R], R2,027 billion is the difference between the foreign currency rate; R19,800 billion, the import of oil products; R126 billion, recreational hajj pilgrimages; R219 billion, support for the vulnerable strata; R1,300 billion, the difference in the price of essential goods; R300 billion, subsidies for chemical fertilizer; and R1,046 billion, other items. Stating that some of these miscellaneous lines are allocated to reconstruction, he pointed out: When there are expenditure revenues with which the executive organizations will engage in developmental work through the sale of services and goods, they must be centralized. This matter must fall within the authority of the minister. But in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], our developmental budget is 12,600 billion. Of this amount, 3,000 billion concern taxes that have been stated in Note 25. Our national projects, instead of 6,000 billion this year, have reached R5,551 billion, which indicates a 10-percent decrease. On the other hand, we increased from 1,300 billion to 1,930 billion. Concerning Notes 29 and 25, Zanjani said: We have nearly $13 billion in energy consumption. Annually, we import 230,00 barrels of oil products proposed by the government, which is 1.5 billion tomans. If we conserve this amount and place it at the disposal of the related minister, about R700 billion in banking funds will be freed and can be placed at the disposal of the private sector. In the continuation of the open session today, Mr. Aqazadeh, the minister of oil, defended oil and fuel products in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget and said: The OPEC members have proposed an oil production ceiling reduction of 5 percent. If we succeed, in the next session, we will face the issue of price and moving toward increasing revenues. If we do not reach an agreement in the next session, we shall operate on the basis of our own oil production quota. He then referred to Note 25 of the budget bill and said: Today, you pay 1,100 billion tomans in subsidies for fuel. We must tell the people to lower fuel consumption, and lower it by 15 percent. This will solve all the government projections. He also said: If we are able to pay subsidies directly, it would be more just. You should do this. It is not right to give what is justly the right of the deprived rural people to the city people. Concerning Note 25, the minister of petroleum said: Today, the elimination of Note 25 does not just mean the elimination of Note 25. Rather, it will destroy the refinery in Bandar 'Abbas. Or, you will have to take 37 billion tomans from the budget of other regions and attach it to the Bandar 'Abbas project, which is not possible. Concerning the proposed natural gas increase in the proposed government bill, he said: If the price of natural gas remains fixed at R8, we cannot add another rial for the next 10 years. Now, the increase is R2 or R3. If we are unable to change it slightly every year, we will have problems in the future. Now, a 2- or 3-rial increase in the price of natural gas is not tangible. But in five years, we will have to increase it by 4 or 5 tomans, which will be impossible. Aqazadeh said: If you eliminate Note 25, you will also have to decide what I must do in that ministry. Engineer Zangeneh, the minister of energy emphasized in defending the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget: According to the ratification of the joint committee, up to 500 kwh of electricity used in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] will not be subject to any increase, and this level of consumption includes 96.36 percent of residential customers. Concerning the elimination of the projects of Note 29 in the joint committee, he said: In this case, we do not know what is most reasonable to do. A low-rate loan has been assumed earlier, and in Farvardin 1373 [21 March-20 April 1994] another must be assumed. This is an economic matter and will be followed by many foreign currency savings. These are among the affairs of which the implementation was permitted in the First Plan. He said: If investments are not made in electricity, tomorrow will be too late. No investment can respond all at once, it takes at least three to four years. In other words, a solution must be found before serious problems arise. Gharazi, the minister of post, telegraph [and telephone], said in defense of the bill: Experts try to put before you the plans they have devised for the future administration of the country that actually account for the next 10, 15, or 20 years. Gharazi asked the deputies to deal with the issues in the budget bill from an expert and not an emotional standpoint. He continued: Some say, what is the use of selling oil at $10 and spending $3 on it? If we make this $3 [a] domestic [expenditure] and not spend it on oil, this will be a very beautiful expert action in the country, which the government has accomplished after several years. The fact that this issue is being discussed today is the result of government expertise. After the statements of the minister of post, telegraph [and telephone], the general points of the bill were put to a vote and the general points of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill were ratified with a decisive majority vote. Statements of the Speaker of the Majles Prior to voting on the general points of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the Majles, spoke in connection with the statements of Engineer Gharazi and said: We had questions for the gentlemen. One question is, is what you are saying ultimately price increases or taxes? It is not that we did not understand and have discussed it emotionally. Then, in regards to Engineer Yahyavi's reference to quoting from the grand leader concerning Note 25, Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri said: Because these viewpoints affect your decisions, we should know if he has an opinion about a particular paragraph or note. "He should just make a gesture and we shall hasten to it." We have no problem in this regard. In order to clarify the matter, his honor was asked about it. He responded: "I have not expressed any opinion in regards to eliminating Note 25." Rather, the interpretations have been different. We asked the office; he said: If I have an opinion about the budget and want it to be announced to the Majles, I will do so officially through the speaker of the Majles. While apologizing to Yahyavi, the deputy from Tehran, he said: In any case, our interpretations of the speech may be different.
