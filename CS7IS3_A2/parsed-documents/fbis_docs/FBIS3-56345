This remark, made by Russian President Boris Yeltsin when he met with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton at the head of a larger delegation, became the theme of the second hour-long meeting of the two presidents in the Kremlin Thursday. Following the end of this round of talks Oleg Lobov, secretary of the National Security Council, told Interfax that the meeting had demonstrated "America's willingness to provide effective support for the Russian reform by paying some of its social costs." In particular, Clinton assured the Russian president that he had succeeded in having Congress appropriate $900 Mn [Million] for aid to Russia in 1995. Furthermore, numerous funds, especially one supporting small business, would be launched. The U.S.A. is prepared to allocate $300 Mn for that purpose. The Clinton Administration is making $100 Mn available for a recently established American-Russian reconstruction of large factories fund. "Solid support" has also been pledged for Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Duties will be lifted from 4400 Russian products in the U.S. market. The U.S. secretary of commerce will arrive in Russia in March with a team of experts to study the possibility of closer contacts between U.S. businessmen and Russian state and privately owned businesses, Lobov said. In his words, Clinton asked Yeltsin to help in finding partners for U.S. businesses.
