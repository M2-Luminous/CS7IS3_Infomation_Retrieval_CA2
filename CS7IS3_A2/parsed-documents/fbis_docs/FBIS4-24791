It singles out the fields of education, science and technology, culture, sports and public health as areas in which women excel. The Chinese Government has exerted great efforts to promote women's education. In 1992 the attendance rate for girls from seven to 11 years old had risen to 96.2 percent from less than 20 percent before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the white paper issued by the Information Office under the State Council says. The proportion of females in middle schools, colleges and postgraduate schools has reached 43.1 percent, 33.7 percent and 24.8 percent respectively. From 1982, when the academic degree system was resumed, to 1993 some 1,149 women were awarded doctorates, making up 9.4 percent of total Ph.D recipients. The paper goes on to say that China also pays special attention to promoting adult and vocational education, and eliminating illiteracy among women. Over 13 million women are enrolled in institutions of higher learning. Over the period of 45 years since the founding of the People's Republic, more than 110 million women illiterates have been taught to read, reducing the female illiteracy rate from 90 percent in 1949 to 32 percent in 1993. According to the paper, the Chinese Government has attached great importance to training women scientists and technicians, trying to improve their working and living conditions and encouraging and supporting them in their scientific research. In 1993, China had 8,097,000 women scientists and technicians, making up 35 percent of the total, the white paper says. The paper also gives an account of the achievements made by Chinese women in education, culture and arts, physical training, and maternity and child care. It says that between 1949 and 1993 Chinese athletes won 775 world championships, of which 460, or 59 percent, were won by women. However, the paper says that, owing to historical reasons and the constraints of the level of social, economic and cultural development, some problems continue to impede women's full participation in social life and must not be ignored. It notes that, in particular, the majority of women have a low level of education and in some rural areas, especially in remote or border regions, female children are not fully guaranteed their right to education. The government and social organizations are adopting measures to overcome these inadequacies, the paper says.
