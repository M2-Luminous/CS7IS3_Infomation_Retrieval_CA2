Entwistle, the Canadian ambassador to Cuba, said today that his country's businessmen will increase their investments in Cuba. He also reexpressed his government's opposition to the U.S. blockade of the island. During an interview given to GRANMA newspaper, Entwistle said commerce is the most active sector in the relations between the two nations because the Canadian private sector is showing growing interest in the economic opportunities offered by Cuba. Canadian businessmen are beginning to observe growth potential in the Cuban economy in areas such as tourism, mining, and oil. In some of these areas, Canadian businessmen are already participating, and in others, the investment prospects are very interesting, he said. The ambassador observed that Cuba occupies fifth place in his country's commercial relations with Latin America as trade with Cuba amounted to $370 million in 1992, and shows a tendency to grow. Canadian businessmen foresee Cuba possibly being a bridge between South America and the Caribbean and estimate that possible associations with the Cubans will project them into the future, Entwistle added. The ambassador also ratified his country's disapproval of the U.S. blockade against Cuba and asserted that U.S. attempts to have third countries implement this policy are not being accepted. It is very simple, he said; the United States has a policy on Cuba, and Canada has its own policy on Cuba. For Canada, he added, from our political perspective, Cuba's isolation is harmful. Our interest is to contribute to creating a climate that will allow for improved relations between the countries in the hemisphere.
