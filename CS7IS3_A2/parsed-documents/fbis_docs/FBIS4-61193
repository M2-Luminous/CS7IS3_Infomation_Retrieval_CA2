During January-March of this year enterprises reduced output of products by more than one-third in the cities of Babarinsk, Iskitim, Kuybyshev, and Tatarsk, and in Vengerovskiy, Dovolenskiy, Karasukskiy, Kupinskiy, Kolyvanskiy, Moshkovskiy, Ordynskiy, Suzunskiy, Severnyy, Chanovskiy, Chulymskiy, and Chistoozernyy Rayons. The scale of the reduction of the physical volume of production during January-March of this year differed significantly in the various branches: In ferrous metallurgy--about 65 percent; nonferrous metallurgy, the chemical and petrochemical industry, machine-building, milling-cereal and manufactured concentrated feed industry--from 41 to 48 percent; light industry, the timber, wood processing, and the pulp and paper industry, and the construction materials industry--from 31 to 39 percent; and the food industry--14 percent. Production decreased as follows: --in the fuel industry: coal (by 5.1 percent); -in electric energy engineering: hydroelectric energy (by 11.9 percent); --ferrous metallurgy: finished rolled metal (80.4 percent), nonrusting sheet steel (57.2 percent), rolled sheet metal (83.8 percent), cold rolled steel belts (74.8 percent), steel (45.8 percent), ferrous metals (80.9 percent), seamless pipes (90.8 percent), and electric welded items (60.4 percent); --in machine building: metal cutting machine tools (by 37 percent), wood processing (68.9 percent), looms (48.5 percent), large electrical machinery (53.2 percent), electric furnaces (50 percent), tractor seeders (78.2 percent), and concrete mixers (90.1 percent); --in the chemical industry: flexible polyvinyl chloride (15.7 percent), plasticizers (47.8 percent), synthetic resins and plastics (82.5 percent), and polymer film (62.8 percent); --in the timber and wood processing industry: shipments of commercial timber (65.8 percent) and lumber (33.2 percent); --in the construction materials industry: cement (57.6 percent), ceramic sanitation items (45.3 percent), panels for large-panel housing construction (55.4 percent), prefabricated reinforced concrete items (33.3 percent), asbestos cement sheets (91.4 percent), and heating radiators and convectors (49.1 percent). The actual volume of production during the first quarter of this year increased in the fuel industry (by 9.4 percent) and electric energy (by 7 percent). In the oblast as a whole 57 industrial enterprises provided for an increase in production volumes (17.1 percent of the overall number). Taking into account the average daily production in March of this year as compared to February of this year there was an increase in the production of coal, hydroelectric energy, electric steel, finished rolled metal, steel pipes, cold rolled steel strips, flexible polyvinyl chloride, prefabricated reinforced concrete items, radiators and convectors for heating, and ceramic items for sanitation. During January-March of this year there was a considerable reduction of the production of consumer goods--by 33.9 percent, including nonfoodstuffs--by 39.2 percent, which included light industry goods--34.4 percent, foodstuffs--24.5 percent, wine and liquor items and beer--46 percent. The production of individual kinds of foodstuffs is characterized by the following data: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | | |(TONNES) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Produced during January--| | | | | |March 1994 1993 | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | |+, - Januar-| | | | | | |y-compared | | | | | | |to January--| | | | | | |March 1993 | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | | |March 1994 | | | | | | |in 2000070040f Jan-| | | | | | |uary-March 1| | | | | | |993 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | | | |in 2000070040f Feb-| | | | | | |ruary 1994 | | | | | | |in average | | | | | | |daily produ-| | | | | | |ction | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bread and b-|47,381 |58,634 |-11,253 |80.8 |96.6 | |akery items | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Meat, inclu-|12,224 |16,665 |-4,441 |73.4 |101.3 | |ding subpro-| | | | | | |ducts categ-| | | | | | |ory I | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sausage ite-|5,736 |5,395 |+341 |106.3 |114.0 | |ms | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Butter |2,064 |3,736 |-1,672 |55.3 |128.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mayonnaise |1,021 |644 |+377 |158.5 |95.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Margarine p-|2,698 |4,156 |-1,458 |64.9 |94.4 | |roducts | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fatty chees-|1,031 |1,485 |-454 |69.4 |106.2 | |es | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Whole milk |29,637 |36,919 |-7,282 |80.3 |101.6 | |products | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nonfat milk |3,080 |5,571 |-2,491 |55.3 |98.2 | |products | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Canned good-|3,088 |4,647 |-1,559 |66.5 |92.8 | |s, thousand-| | | | | | |s of standa-| | | | | | |rd cans | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cereal |2,541 |5,426 |-2,885 |46.8 |88.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flour |43,851 |78,508 |-34,657 |55.8 |114.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Macaroni it-|5,042 |5,595 |-553 |90.1 |108.7 | |ems | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Confectiona-|6,240 |9,308 |-3,068 |67.0 |103.7 | |ry items | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nonalcoholi-|459 |778 |-319 |59.0 |180.9 | |c beverages,| | | | | | | thousands | | | | | | |of decalite-| | | | | | |rs | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- During January-March of this year the output of prepared cotton fabrics and washing machines increased. The output of leather, fulled, and felt footwear, electric mixers, tape recorders, television sets, clocks, wallpaper, speakers, and general-purpose notebooks increased by more than one- third. Among the wine and liquor items there was a considerable reduction of the production of vodka and liquor-vodka items (by 57.7 percent) and grape wine (by 59.6 percent). During the first quarter of this year the production of products for defense purposes in comparable prices decreased by 32.8 percent. The proportion of military products in the overall volume of oblast production in comparable prices in March of this year amounted to 9 percent. The decline of the overall output of industrial products at converted enterprises during the three months of this year amounted to 44.4 percent, including defense products--29.5 percent. During January-March of this year the number of industrial production personnel in the oblast decreased by 12.4 percent, including at converted enterprises--19.1 percent. There was a growth of the number of personnel in electric energy engineering (by 6.9 percent) and nonferrous metallurgy (by 1.2 percent). The greatest reduction was in machine building and metal processing (by 18.8 percent), the medical industry (11.7 percent), and the timber and wood processing industry (11.4 percent). The reduction of labor productivity amounted to 24.5 percent, including at converted enterprises--31.3 percent. There was a growth of labor productivity in the fuel industry (by 15.6 percent), the timber and wood processing industry (by 2 percent), and the microbiological industry (by 48.5 percent). Losses of working time are increasing because of the prolonged shutdowns of enterprises. During March of this year 75 industrial enterprises had production shutdowns and losses of working time amounted to 471,300 man-days or 16.5 percent of the scheduled supply of working time of these enterprises (in March of last year: 31 enterprises lost 70,900 man-days or 4.4 percent of the scheduled working time of these enterprises). Four enterprises fully halted their production for more than one shift and losses amounted to 29,800 man-days (6.3 percent of the overall losses of working time). The main ones to stand idle were enterprises of machine building and metal processing, the chemical industry, and the construction materials industry. Enterprises are halting their production because of difficulties with the sale of products, shortage of material resources, and other factors. Because of shutdowns or transition to different work schedules in March of this year 595 workers were discharged from 75 enterprises and 24,742 people were furloughed on the initiative of the administration. During the first quarter of this year 42 percent of the industrial enterprises were included in the nonstate form of ownership. A large share of the enterprises of the nonstate sector are joint-stock companies (87 percent). Agriculture Agricultural commodity producers are preparing the material base for planting. As of the beginning of April they had made ready 75 percent of the tractors, 73 percent of the trucks, 69 percent of the seeders, 79 percent of the tractor plows, and 73 percent of the cultivators. The rates of repair of all kinds of agricultural equipment are below last year's. During the past quarter agricultural enterprises have shipped in 44,000 tonnes of diesel fuel and 15,800 tonnes of gasoline, which is less than last year by 33 and 27 percent. The provision of diesel fuel as of the beginning of the second quarter is 38 percent below last year's and gasoline--19 percent. The situation in animal husbandry on farms with the collective- shared form of ownership continues to grow worse. The number of cattle and hogs has decreased by 10.3 percent as compared to the corresponding period of 1993, including cows--7 percent, sheep--31.6 percent, horses--7.5 percent, and poultry--0.2 percent. During the first quarter of this year the farms sold for slaughter 29,800 tonnes of cattle and poultry, produced 130,300 tonnes of milk, and obtained 126.3 million eggs. As compared to the corresponding period of 1993 there was a reduction of meat production by 9,400 tonnes (23.8 percent), and milk--40,200 tonnes (23.6 percent); but more eggs were received than last year by 6.3 million or 5.3 percent. The average milk yield per cow as of the beginning of the year was 348 kilograms during January-March as compared to 421 during January-March of last year. In March the milk yield per cow dropped by 29 kilograms and amounted to 144 kilograms. One laying hen produced 54 eggs as compared to 56 during the first quarter of last year. During the three months the farms obtained 146,600 calves, 109,900 piglets, and 117,900 lambs. The use of the reproduction herd of cattle and sheep improved. Since the beginning of the year 34,800 head of cattle, 29,900 hogs, and 17,700 sheep have died. The maintenance of all kinds of cattle has deteriorated as compared to the corresponding period of last year. During the three months 22,500 head of livestock and poultry, 80,600 tonnes of milk, and 105.2 million eggs were delivered to state resources. As compared to the same period of last year procurements of cattle and poultry decreased by 33 percent, milk--by 32 percent, and eggs--by 1 percent. Additionally, the farms sold in the markets, through their own stores, and through public catering 4,800 tonnes of cattle, 4,200 tonnes of milk, and 1.7 million eggs. Capital Construction During the first quarter of 1994 R116.9 billion in capital investments were assimilated (64 percent of the amount for January- March 1993), of which R20.8 million came from the republic budget (18 percent of the overall volume of capital investments) and R11.4 billion from local budgets (10 percent). The greatest proportion of assimilated capital investments was at state and municipal enterprises (65 percent) and joint-stock companies (34 percent). For construction of facilities for production purposes from all sources of financing R68.2 billion in capital investments was assimilated, including at facilities for producing consumer goods-- R1.2 billion or 1.7 percent. In the oblast as a whole R27.3 billion in capital investments were assimilated in housing construction, the construction of general educational schools--R0.8 billion, preschool institutions-- R0.3 billion, hospitals and outpatient polyclinic institutions--R1.0 billion, and clubs and houses of culture--R0.03 billion. During the first quarter of 1994 the Zatsibselelektrosetstroy Trust put electric power transmission lines with a distance of 8 kilometers into operation. From all sources of financing R8.6 billion worth of fixed capital was put into operation in the oblast, of which R6.5 billion was at facilities for production purposes. During the first quarter of 1994, 274 apartments with an overall area of 16,600 square meters were put into operation in the oblast from all sources of financing, which amounted to 15 percent of the level of the corresponding period of last year. As before, most of the volume of housing construction was carried out by state and municipal enterprises and organizations (65 percent of the overall introduction of housing). Individual builders introduced 1,800 square meters (11 percent) using their own funds or with the help of state credit. During January-March of this year the following were put into operation: a kindergarten to accommodate 140 by the Pobeda AOZT [private joint-stock company] in the village of Kargapolova in Suzunskiy Rayon, and a club to accommodate 100 by the Sibir AOZT in the settlement of Krasnyy Khutor in Krasnozerskiy Rayon. All construction organizations on the territory of the oblast during January-March of this year performed R112.1 billion worth of contracting work through their own forces, and the volume dropped by 41 percent as compared to the corresponding period of last year. The main volume of contracting work (R67.8 billion or 61 percent) was performed by enterprises with a mixed form of ownership, R26.2 billion (23 percent)--by private enterprises, and R18.2 billion (16 percent)--by state and municipal enterprises. In the structure of contracting work performed, construction and installation work makes up 86 percent. Capital repair and other contracting work accounts for 14 percent of the volume performed. Contracting organizations performed R6.2 billion worth of work on the construction of the facilities of the agro-industrial complex, which was 6 percent of the overall volume of contracting work. Transportation and Communications Under the conditions of the decline of production and the continuing growth of prices the volume of freight shipments by general purpose transportation is continually decreasing. Thus during the first quarter of 1994 the volume of shipments of freight by general purpose transportation decreased by 36.4 percent as compared to the first quarter of 1993, and cargo turnover--by 33.2 percent. On the Western Siberian Railroad the volume of freight dispatched decreased by 26.3 percent, and the delivery of timber cargo decreased by 59.1 percent, petroleum cargo--by 32.5 percent, and grain and milling products--by 51.9 percent. Cargo turnover decreased by 31.7 percent or 12.6 tonne-kilometers. A considerable increase in rates for freight shipment because of the sharp increase in fuel prices has led many consumers to refrain from the services of general purpose automotive transportation. As a result, during the first quarter of this year this kind of transportation was used to ship 2.1 million tonnes of freight, which is 47.6 percent less than during the first quarter of last year, and cargo turnover decreased by 46.4 percent. In addition to general purpose automotive transportation, freight was shipped by 64 automotive enterprises of other ministries and departments and they shipped 29.2 million tonnes of freight. The situation with automotive transportation service for citizens continues to be strained. Passenger departures from airports of civil aviation decreased by 40.2 percent during the first quarter. Some of the passenger flow shifted to the relatively less expensive rail transportation, where passenger transportation increased by 2.9 percent, but passenger turnover decreased by 13.4 percent. Transportation of passengers by automotive transportation increased by 6.3 percent, including general purpose transportation--by 6.9 percent, and passenger turnover--by 1.2 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively. Revenues of communications enterprises during the first quarter of this year amounted to R10.1 billion, including from the sale of services to the population--R2.1 billion. Development of Foreign Trade Relations During the first quarter 32 enterprises and organizations entered the foreign market. They exported R15.4 billion worth of machines, equipment, raw materials, processed materials, and consumer goods and services. Ferrous metallurgy products and items made from them amounted to R1.1 billion (7.1 percent of the overall volume), inorganic chemistry products--4.1 billion (26.6 percent), and tin and items made from it--R2.4 billion (15.6 percent). The main exporters, which made up more than 75 percent of the overall number, are four enterprises: the Khimkontsentratov Joint-Stock Company--2.6 percent (R4.1 billion), the tin combine--20.5 percent (R3.2 billion), the Elsib AOOT [public joint-stock company]--8.8 percent (R1.4 billion), and the Institute of Nuclear Physics--19.5 percent (R3 billion). Foreign trade turnover through direct production ties and commodity exchange operations amounted to $32.4 million (exports-- $19 million and imports--$13.4 million). More than 60 percent was commodity turnover with Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and the United States. The Consumer Market The volume of retail commodity turnover of officially registered trade organizations of the oblast during January-March reached R295 billion and increased 6.5-fold as compared to the corresponding period of last year (in actual prices). The physical mass of goods sold was 24.9 percent less. During the report month there was a 0.8-percent increase in the volume of commodity turnover as compared to March of last year. The proportion of sales of foodstuffs in the overall volume of commodity turnover amounted to 51 percent as against 54.2 percent during the first quarter of 1993. The commodity turnover of public catering enterprises amounted to R17.6 billion and increased 5.2-fold as compared to the corresponding period of last year (in actual prices). Its proportion in the overall volume of commodity turnover decreased from 7.4 percent to 6 percent. Enterprises of the nonstate sector in trade and public catering since the beginning of the year have provided for 48.8 percent of the overall volume of commodity turnover. The state sector accounts for 39.5 percent, and consumers' cooperation--11.7 percent. As of the beginning of April commodity reserves in trade organizations amounted to R117 billion. Their provision, calculated in days of trading, amounted to 40 days (in the first quarter of 1993--50 days). During January-February of this year as compared to the corresponding period of last year there was an increase in sales of herring, margarine products, cheese, knitwear, hosiery items, leather footwear, and television sets. There were decreased sales of meat, sausage items, fish, butter and vegetable oil, eggs, sugar, confectionery items, fabrics, sewn items, soap and detergents, and radio receivers. The volume of paid services during the first quarter of this year amounted to R70.7 billion with an average of R25,200 per resident. As compared to last year it increased 12.9-fold in actual prices. The volume of consumer services rendered to the population was R6.1 billion. This is 8.6 percent of the overall volume of paid services (during January-March 1993--16.4 percent). In the sphere of rendering services to the population, nonstate enterprises account for 20.7 percent of the overall volume of services. Finances According to figures from the administration of finance and tax policy of the oblast administration, the consolidated oblast budget during January-February 1994 was fulfilled for incomes and expenditures in the amount of R99.7 billion. The largest proportion of revenues is made up of value added tax--25.2 percent, individual income tax--20.4 percent, and profit tax--19.7 percent. The basic directions for financing are still sociocultural measures and the development of the economy. In budget expenditures during January-February 1994 expenditures on sociocultural measures make up 58 percent and on the development of the economy--28 percent. Enterprises and organizations of the oblast (not including agricultural) during January-March 1994, according to preliminary calculations, received profit in a volume of R250 billion. Industry accounts for 88 percent of the profit, construction--8 percent, and transportation--2 percent. As compared to the corresponding period of last year the volume of profit increased 4.3-fold while the prices of industrial products increased 8.6-fold. The financial position of enterprises and organizations continues to be complicated by the lack of regulation of mutual settlements in the national economy. The overall creditor indebtedness at enterprises of industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture as of 1 March of this year amounted to R684.6 billion, including defaulted--R266.7 billion or 38.9 percent. In the overall total of defaulted creditor indebtedness of these branches, defaulted indebtedness to suppliers accounts for R174.1 billion or 65.3 percent, and the budget--R45.2 billion or 17 percent. More than 66 percent of the defaulted indebtedness to suppliers (nonpayments) are to enterprises of industry. As of 1 March this year all of the accounts receivable amounted to R654.1 billion, of which the defaulted amount was R331 billion or 50.6 percent. Almost 90 percent of the defaulted accounts receivable is defaulted indebtedness for products delivered, work performed, and services rendered (R295.7 billion). Of the overall total of defaulted indebtedness of consumers, R227.5 (76.9 percent) is to industrial enterprises. The shortage of their own financial resources forces enterprises to use credit and loans. Indebtedness on loans and credit received from banks as of 1 March of this year amounted to R166.7 billion, of which R15.3 billion is defaulted. The volume of defaulted indebtedness for issuing funds for consumption for enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, and agriculture amounted to R30.7 billion as of 1 April 1994. Among industrial goods the most significant price increases were for medications--1.8-fold, gasoline and printed publications--1.7- fold, private means of transportation--1.5-fold, and detergents and jewelry items--1.4-fold. The greatest rate of price increases was found for paid services rendered to the population, which was brought about by the sharp increase in the cost of housing and municipal services. Since the beginning of the year housing services have increased in cost 224- fold, communications--2.3-fold, rail transportation--twofold, automotive transportation--1.6-fold, and services for keeping children and children's preschool institutions--1.6-fold. The growth of consumer prices was influenced by the higher wholesale prices in industry, which, in turn, was linked to the increase in expenditures on the production of products (higher costs of raw materials, processed materials, energy resources, and fuel). During the first quarter of this year wholesale prices for food industry products increased 33 percent, including butter--59 percent, wine making products--38 percent, and confectionery items- 27 percent. Light industry products increased in cost by 32 percent during this same period, including footwear--72 percent, cotton fabrics--37 percent, and knitted items--23 percent. Incomes and Expenditures of the Population During January-March of this year monetary incomes of the population amounted to R502 billion and increased 6.5-fold as compared to the same period of 1993. During March of this year nominal monetary incomes totalled R190 billion. As compared to February they increased 10 percent, and compared to March 1993--6.1-fold. At the same time the real disposable monetary incomes (income minus mandatory payments and contributions adjusted to the price index), which reflect the dynamics of the buying power of the current monetary incomes, decreased in March 1994 as compared to the preceding month by 0.4 percent, and as compared to March 1993--by 24 percent. With the increase in prices there is also an increase in the amount of the subsistence level which, according to methods approved by the Ministry of Labor of Russia, as of 1 April 1994 amounted to R55,220 on average per capita. The average monthly wages of workers during January-March of this year amounted to R130,000 and increased 9.4-fold as compared to the corresponding period of last year. Monetary expenditures of the population during January-March 1994 amounted to R528 billion (8.2 times more than during January-March 1993), including for the purchase of goods and paid services--R363 billion (6.8-fold). Public Health During January-March of this year there was an increase in the number of registered infectious and parasitic diseases as compared to the corresponding period of 1993, the number of reported cases of diphtheria increased 10-fold, German measles--7.4-fold, salmonella infections--twofold, and influenza--1.8-fold. There was a certain decrease in the number of reported cases of colitis, enteritis, gastroenteritis, and food poisoning with established etiology (from 342 to 293), critical intestinal infections caused by unestablished infectious agents (from 1,782 to 1,553), chicken pox (from 4,636 to 4,036), and viral hepatitis A (from 694 to 542). The Crime Situation According to data from the oblast internal affairs administration, during January-March of this year 17,800 crimes were reported, including 700 (4 percent)--against individuals, 2,000 (11.2 percent)--against state and public property, and 12,500 (70 percent)--against private and personal property. Criminal charges were brought against 7,600 individuals. Privatization Since the beginning of privatization 1,460 packages of documents have been filled out for enterprises of all branches, and 1,284 enterprises have been fully privatized, including 142 in 1994. Most of the privatized enterprises (59.3 percent) are municipally owned enterprises, 23.5 percent--federally owned, and 17.2 percent-- oblast-owned enterprises. During 1994 these figures were 27.5 percent, 42.9 percent, and 29.5 percent, respectively. On the territory of the oblast 419 joint-stock companies have been created, including 233 on the basis of federally owned enterprises. At commercial competitions 524 enterprises have been sold and 287 enterprises have purchased leased property. A total of R14.8 billion has been obtained from privatization, R2 billion of which in 1994. Earnings from privatization of municipally owned facilities amounted to R7.4 billion (50.7 percent of the total received), and oblast-owned--R1.6 billion. Name-bearing privatization checks were used to obtain R6.5 billion worth, including R1 billion in 1994. Of the monies received from privatization, R7.9 billion was transferred into budgets and funds, and R3.5 billion (43.9 percent)--into local budgets. Since the beginning of privatization in buildings of the state and municipal housing fund, 138,300 apartments have been privatized, including 12,400 in 1994. As of 1 April this year in the rayon committees for land reform 5,999 peasant (farmer-run) farms have been registered, and they were assigned 344,100 hectares of land. There are 57.4 hectares per one farm. Since 1 January 1992, 603 farms have ceased their activity for various reasons.
