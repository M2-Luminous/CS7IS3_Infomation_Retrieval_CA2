The official said that Chernomyrdin may visit Novorossiyisk where a new Russian port is being built, but most likely in the second half of his vacation. The Russian prime minister is now vacationing on the Black Sea. His spokesman Valeriy Grishin said earlier today that during the vacation Chernomyrdin will continue working on the second package of economic decrees which is now being drawn up by the government. The spokesman said that until the last minute it was not clear whether or not Chernomyrdin will take his leave now, mainly because of his active involvement in the work on the package of economic decrees aimed at continuing economic reforms in Russia. The first package was recently signed by President Boris Yeltsin. Grishin denied reports that Chernomyrdin would work on his book during his vacation. "There will be simply no time left for that. Besides, he needs rest too," he said.
