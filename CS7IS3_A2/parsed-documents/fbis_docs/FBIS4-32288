In addition, such a project will resolve the problem of transporting the Russian oil to Western Europe, the I KATHIMERINI Greek daily writes. The oil pipeline, which will pass through southern Bulgaria, is also viewed as an opportunity to stop the expansionist strivings of Turkey in the region, in which 1.5 million Muslims live, and strengthen security in Thrace, I KATHIMERINI writes. Athens views the idea of constructing a Greek-Bulgarian oil pipeline from the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea as a counterpoint to the Turkish strategic plans aimed at establishing eventual control over the export of Russian oil. According to Athens, Turkey also aims at establishing control over the oil of the former Soviet republics around the Caspian Sea. By constructing the Greek-Bulgarian oil pipeline Russia would be able to free itself from its dependence on Turkey and simultaneously, the strategic positions of Greece and Bulgaria will be strengthened.
