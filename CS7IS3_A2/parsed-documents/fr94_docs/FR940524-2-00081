FR940524-2-00081 FR940524-2-00050 The NYSE/Amex Order noted that, for example, in view of the diverse functions performed by a multi-service firm and the material non-public information that may be obtained by any one department of the firm, the firm often may be required to restrict access to information the department receiving it, in order to avoid potential liability under sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Act 12 and Rules 10b&hyph;5 and 14e&hyph;3 thereunder. Moreover, two years after approval of the Amex's NYSE's Chinese Wall procedures, Congress enacted the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (``ITSFEA''), designed primarily to prevent, deter and prosecute insider trading. 13 Among other provisions ITSFEA created a specific requirement for broker-dealers to maintain procedures designed to prevent the misuse of material non-public information. 14 In response to the promulgation thereof, many firms redrafted their internal Chinese Wall Procedures to ensure compliance. 15 12 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), 78(e) (1982). 13 Pub. L. No. 100&hyph;704. 14 15 U.S.C. 78o(f). 15 Several SRO's (Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, and Pacific Stock Exchange) have adopted the substance of the ITSFEA procedures under their rules applicable to members an member firms (See Securities Exchange Release Nos. 30122 (December 30, 1992), 57 FR 729 (January 8, 1992); 30557 (April 6, 1992), 57 FR 13393 (April 16, 1992); 33171 (November 9, 1993 58 FR 60892 (November 18, 1993). In addition, the BSE's comparable rule filing (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;19) is still under consideration (See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33587 (February 7, 1994), 59 FR 6895 (February 14, 1994). The Commission restates its understanding that a number of firms with regional specialist operations have established Chinese Wall procedures between the specialist and its affiliated firm. Nevertheless, such procedures have not necessarily been adopted by all specialist affiliates, have not been adopted pursuant to any specific regional exchange requirements, and have not been subject to specific exchange surveillance and oversight. Consistent with the NYSE/Amex Order, the Commission has continued to encourage the regional exchanges to adopt Chinese Wall procedures. 16 16 The Commission staff has specifically contacted the Pacific Stock Exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and BSE, requesting them to detail the procedures each exchange has implemented for surveillance of compliance with the Chinese Wall procedures adopted by firms affiliated with exchange specialists. The NYSE/Amex Order, in addressing the need for regional exchanges to participate in the regulation of affiliations between specialist operations and diversified broker-dealer firms, took into account the fact that regional exchanges differ from the primary exchanges in terms of order flow and market information. While noting that overall regional exchange volume is small compared to primary market volume, and regional exchange pricing of orders is generally derived from primary market quotations, the Commission expressed its concern that the diversion by a large retail broker-dealer of all or a significant portion of order flow in speciality stocks to an affiliated regional specialist could raise regulatory concerns similar to those raised by such affiliations on the primary exchanges. Moreover the Commission noted that even if regional exchange specialists continued to set their prices based on primary market quotations, a regional specialist affiliated with an integrated retail firm could obtain significant access to material, non-public information. The Commission continues to believe that Chinese Walls, with effective controls, may be useful in restricting information flow between the various departments of broker-dealers. The Commission has monitored the NYSE and Amex Chinese Wall rules since their inception, and generally believes they have proven effective in the context of specialists and affiliated approved persons. The Commission believes that the BSE proposal effectively addresses the potential for market abuses resulting from the ongoing relationship between specialists and affiliated approved persons. The effectiveness of the procedures set forth in the BSE guidelines is reinforced by the Exchange's existing surveillance of specialist and the marketplace as well as the specialist's highly visible position in the marketplace. These factors, along with the specialist's existing statutory duty to maintain a fair and orderly market, should combine to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed Chinese Wall. Finally, the Commission notes that the structural adequacy of the Chinese Wall is only one part of evaluating whether the procedures established by the Exchange will detect and deter potential improper activity by either the approved person or the specialist. Appropriate surveillance procedures are critical to ensure that the Chinese Wall is maintained. To this end, the Exchange has submitted to the Commission proposed procedures for monitoring the Chinese Wall. 17 The Commission also notes that the Exchange has represented that it believes that it has adequate staffing capacity to monitor compliance and conduct independent reviews of member firms. 17 The Exchange has requested that these procedures be accorded confidential treatment by the Commission. IV. Conclusion It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 18 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;17) is approved. 18 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 19 19 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
