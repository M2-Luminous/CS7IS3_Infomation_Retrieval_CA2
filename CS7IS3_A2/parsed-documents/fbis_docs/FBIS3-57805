In a written statement made in the Turkish Cypriot side of Nicosia yesterday, TUPI leader Ahmet Gunes claimed that the media of the world have neglected and overlooked the existence of Turkoman people in Iraq. He said: "We expect the public in Turkey and the media organs in the world to be more sensitive on the matter and to help us remove the Saddam administration's oppression and pressure." Recalling that the Hammer Force protects the Kurds in northern Iraq, including those who live in areas below the 36th parallel, Gunes lamented that all the Turkoman people, including those who live in al-Mawsil and other areas to the north of the 36th parallel, have been ignored. He said: "The Turkomans in Iraq urge the Turkish Government and the entire world to have all the Turkoman people, including those in al-Mawsil Province, protected. We also urge them to help us create an opportunity for ourselves to live like human beings and maintain our political identity."
