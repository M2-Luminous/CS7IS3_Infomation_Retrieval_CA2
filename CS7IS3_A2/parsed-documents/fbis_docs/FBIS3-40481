In these tests, instruments to measure flow will be installed in the reactor and the flow of natrium circulating among the fuel assemblies will be measured and evaluated. To cool the ``Monju's'' core efficiently, the coolant natrium is circulated in response to the amount of heat generated by core fuel assemblies and blanket fuel assemblies, important components of the core. Evaluation testing will continue until around the beginning of February 1994.
