FR940822-0-00039 FR940822-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Care Financing Administration 42 CFR Parts 435 and 436 [MB&hyph;001&hyph;F] RIN 0938&hyph;AA58 Medicaid Program; Eligibility and Coverage Requirements AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule withdraws regulations setting forth a mandatory budgetary method for determining financial eligibility for individuals who are not receiving or deemed to be receiving Federal cash assistance but whose financial eligibility for Medicaid is being determined through the application of financial criteria of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. These regulations were previously issued as part of a final rule with comment period originally published on January 19, 1993, and were to be effective October 18, 1994. This final rule also makes conforming technical changes, as a result of this withdrawal, to the remainder of the January 19, 1993, final rule and reaffirms the August 18, 1994, effective date of this remaining part. These changes are being made as a result of consideration of public comments received. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marinos Svolos, (410) 966&hyph;4451. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4931), we published in the Federal Register a final rule with comment period that amended the requirements for coverage of certain groups of individuals under Medicaid and the requirements for determining Medicaid eligibility. Because the new administration wanted to fully review the policies in these regulations, on February 19, 1993, we published a notice in the Federal Register (58 FR 9120) delaying the effective dates and compliance dates of the final rule with comment period for 6 months. These dates were extended for two additional 6-month periods in subsequent notices published in the Federal Register on August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44457) and February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8138). These regulations incorporated into the Medicaid regulations substantive changes made in the composition of eligibility groups of individuals and in the criteria used to determine their financial eligibility under Medicaid. The substantive changes were initially made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA '81), Public Law 97&hyph;35, and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Public Law 97&hyph;248, and further amended by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DRA), Public Law 98&hyph;369; the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), Public Law 99&hyph;272; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99&hyph;509; the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;93; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203; the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100&hyph;360; the Family Support Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;485; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), Public Law 101&hyph;239; and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508. In addition, the document contained changes made as a result of administrative decisions to improve program administration and efficiency. Basically, the January 1993 rule had two parts with different effective dates. The first part codified a number of statutory changes dating as far back as 1981. This part was classified as a final rule. As extended by the subsequent notices to the January 1993 publication, the effective date for these regulations is August 18, 1994. The second part of the January 1993 rule set forth a mandated budgeting method for determining the financial eligibility of individuals who are not receiving or deemed to be receiving Federal cash assistance but whose financial eligibility for Medicaid is being determined through application of the financial criteria under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program (referred to as ``AFDC-related non-cash assistance individuals''). This part was classified as a final rule with comment period. As extended by the subsequent notices to the January 1993 rule, the effective date for this part is October 18, 1994. The budgetary method set forth in the regulations was developed to clarify contradictory provisions in the Social Security Act (the Act) that had resulted in litigation. Basically, title XIX of the Act (section 1902(a)(10)) requires that the methods of the Federal cash assistance program most closely related to the individual's status be used to determine income and resources for purposes of Medicaid eligibility. At the same time, title XIX (section 1902(a)(17)(D)) prohibits use of some of those same methods without specifying what should be used in their place. That is, section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act prohibits the consideration of income and resources of family members as available to applicants and recipients (unless actually made available) except (1) an applicant or recipient for his or her respective spouse; and (2) parents for their children who are either under 21 or who are blind and disabled regardless of age. This requirement became a problem for AFDC-related non-cash assistance cases when an AFDC statutory change in 1984 mandated that all family members living together be considered one family unit for AFDC eligibility purposes and that the income and resources of all family members be pooled. As a result, AFDC sometimes requires attributing income and resources from persons other than spouses or parents (siblings, stepparents, grandparents, legal guardians, and alien sponsors) as available to the applicant or recipient. Use of the AFDC methods for cases involving income from persons other than spouses or parents, however, is contrary to section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act.
