More than half the young people in the city know someone who has used amphetamines or ecstasy. A similar percentage of Ireland's youth believe they would encounter little difficulty in finding regular suppliers of drugs. These disturbing discoveries come from an exclusive survey, conducted by Irish Marketing Surveys for the SUNDAY INDEPENDENT. The poll reveals evidence of the existence of an alarming drug sub-culture among the teenagers of Ireland. It is the first of its kind to examine the influence of narcotics and alcohol on the young, and has taken its findings from a representative sample of teenagers, aged between 15 and 17, at 58 different towns and cities throughout the country. The survey was rigorously controlled to ensure no bias against social groups or classes. Irish Marketing Surveys, the country's leading statistical analysts, are confident the results are beyond doubt. That confidence is important, because the results of the survey clearly demonstrate that the spread of drug and alcohol abuse among the young has become a widespread problem in Ireland. Our own investigations have revealed the ease with which illegal narcotics are imported; the new poll shows the scale of their impact. Researchers discovered that awareness of drug-taking has escalated to the point where it has become an important hurdle facing adolescents. Almost half the sample group cited peer pressure as the main reason for young people to take drugs. Teenagers who use drugs are striving to be accepted into the sub-culture, to fit into what they see as an intriguing and attractive group. Others take drugs for kicks; 39 percent of those questioned said they used drugs to feel good, to get high or for fun. One in every four teenagers claimed they used narcotics and alcohol to escape stress and family problems. Perhaps most worrying is the discovery that drugs are today readily accessible to young people. Teenagers in Dublin and Leinster are most likely to know where to find drugs--discos, night clubs and street dealers proved the most common sources--while young people on Connacht and Ulster claimed drugs were rarer. Seventy percent of Connacht/Ulster teenagers did not know where drugs were sold in their towns. There was a good degree of recognition of the dangers of illegal drugs, with more than 90 percent of those questioned believing that heroin, cocaine, crack and LSD were too dangerous even for experimentation. Young people appear to view alcohol in a different light, with 35 percent of those polled believing there was no real danger in drinking. In Dublin, the evidence points to a higher level of drug abuse among the young. More than half of the teenagers questioned knew someone who had experimented with ecstasy or amphetamines, while almost a quarter knew someone who used the drugs regularly. One in every 10 Dublin teenagers knows at least one heroin user. On a positive note, it appears that 85 percent of young people are being given drug education at school, and most of those find the information helpful. Professional drug counsellors are held in the highest regard among the young, with 93 percent claiming they would treat seriously any advice they gave. Other sources of advice and example are more alarming. One in five teengers admitted that hearing about pop stars' involvement with drugs might tempt them to experiment themselves.
