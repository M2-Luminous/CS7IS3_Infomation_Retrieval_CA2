They dealt with the anonymity with military resolve. All the units acquired numbers and many of them acquired renown: the 14th army, the 12th post.... Many but not all. The 10th air defense separate army made a serious bid for popularity in connection with the violation of the air border by a Cessna. But not the Cessna on which Rust flew in in May 1987. Later: On 29 May 1988 Mattias Rust's instructor tried to repeat his exploit by flying into the zone of responsibility of the 10th separate army from the North. They did not shoot down the Cessna but simply expelled it. The incident because of the speculative interest in facts of a directly opposite nature remained unnoticed by the press. The 10th air defense army nonetheless acquired some renown: After the arrest of a general who was chief of the army rear services and several of his subordinates. The journalists called the trial "the air defense case." A renown which is highly specific and even offensive to thousands of officers honorably serving in the not very comfortable conditions of the Arctic. Actually, as the famous cartoon character wisely noted, good deeds do not bring you fame. The 10th army includes all the air defense forces units and formations covering the Russian North from the Arctic Amderma to Karelia. Hundreds of fighters, powerful radar, and air defense missiles. Headquarters in Arkhangelsk. Subordinate to Moscow. During the Cold War its regiments and divisions stood loyally as a buffer on the routes of strategic bombers to the capital. To get through to Moscow they would first have had to destroy the 10th army. The most modern MiGs and missiles were always in the 10th army. But so were the Northernmost townships and garrisons. Today a high price has been paid for former priorities. The state has deemed it unnecessary to maintain radar stations and airfields in the Arctic. God be with the hardware, but people went with the hardware: They had destinies, plans, hopes.... On the Arctic islands they have had to abandon considerable material assets, homes, barracks (they took decades to settle in and just months have been assigned for the evacuation). Perhaps the army's reduction will ease the federal coffers? Neither today nor in the next year or two. According to the figures of Aviation Lieutenant General Gennadiy Vasilyev, commander of the 10th army, the withdrawal of a few units has cost eight times more than their maintenance. The general mood is quite pessimistic. The majority are holding out but a feeling of futility and uncertainty has already lodged in many hearts. And that is a terrible state. It brings any ordinary psychological problem to a dramatic finale. On 25 april on a small island of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago Captain Andrey Proskurdin, commander of a radar company, shot his wife with an assault rifle and then took his own life. He left no note. It is not only the regiments of the 10th army that are being reduced. No one knows what will happen to the army itself tomorrow. In an attempt to prevent mental ferment tempting prospects are being outlined for the officers. In newspapers Moscow generals discuss the creation of military space defense forces. Space is all very well. But it is increasingly difficult for the air regiments to break away from the earth. There is no kerosine or spare parts. Kilp-Yavr is the 10th army's forward airfield not far from Murmansk. Colonel Nikolay Ovechkin's SU-7 regiment is based here. The pilots' flying time last year averaged 30-40 hours. They will hardly fly any more this year. Is that a lot or a little. In the Saudi Arabian air force a fighter pilot spends 20 hours in the air. But not in a year. A month. Incidentally, Western air reconnaissance operators as though out of spite are increasing their activity at our borders. The commander of a Norwegian "Orion" ASW aircraft receives something like $6,000 a month. Ovechkin's boys, who prevent the "Orions" from brazenly covering our submarines with hydroacoustic buoys, at least in Russian territorial waters (U.S. submariners simply ignore our sovereignty) have not received a ruble since January. The coffers of the financial section are hopelessly empty. The airmen are writing letters to the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office and threatening to go on strike. And...they are on duty and guarding the border passionately as though to spite someone. Major Vladimir Yelgin, commander of the airfield technical backup battalion, says that he has developed a sixth sense as yet unknown to science: An inner voice tells him when he should leave the headquarters for the airfield to avoid meeting the officers' wives. The women bring their children and go to the headquarters to ask for the money they themselves and their husbands have earned. But where is the battalion commander to get this money? In the nearby air defense missile brigade commanded by Colonel Sergey Tikhov, the state of affairs as regards paying money is similar but here all the scientists have actively been procuring mushrooms and berries and dry-curing fish since the fall. The brigade is armed with the most sophisticated missiles including the "star" of the Abu-Dhabi exhibition, the S-800 system. Its NATO codename is "Grumble." A most inept name. Both the men and the system are remarkable ungrumbling. The missiles have been stored in containers without servicing for 10 years. Such is their design. It must be supposed that is in case the Defense Ministry's money dries up completely even for the purchase of food for rations and the troops begin to faint from hunger. No, no one here is against peace. Even those whose profession is preparation for the opposite. But who said that an insulting attitude toward the men who carry guns is the path toward peace and stability?
