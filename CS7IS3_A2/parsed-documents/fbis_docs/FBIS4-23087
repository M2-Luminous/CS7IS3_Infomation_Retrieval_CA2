FBIS TRENDS-02JUN94-JAPAN-U.S. Japanese Officials Balk at New Framework Agreement Japanese Officials Balk at New Framework Agreement SUMMARY Japan's ruling coalition government has recently come under attack from elements of the Japanese bureaucracy and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for its handling of the 24 May U.S.-Japanese agreement on resuming the stalled framework talks on bilateral trade problems. Bureaucrats have expressed concern that Washington may attempt to turn the objective criteria that both sides agreed to use to measure Japan's trade performance into numerical targets, and are seeking to narrow the definition of these criteria--a stance that could complicate upcoming U.S.-Japanese talks. Judging by media reporting, the LDP, for its part, may be planning to exploit this issue to weaken the ruling coalition. END SUMMARY In the days since the 24 May announcement of the U.S.-Japan agreement to restart the framework talks, Japanese bureaucrats involved in the trade negotiations and elements of the opposition LDP have criticized the government in the Japanese press for its handling of the talks that led to the agreement. -- The 28 May Sankei Shimbun, a conservative newspaper whose views are often close to those of more conservative elements of the LDP, quoted an unidentified government official as expressing concern that the government, under political pressure to reach an agreement with Washington, may have compromised too much over how to define the objective criteria that will be used to measure Japan's trade performance. Warning that Washington might still try to turn the criteria into "something similar to numerical targets," the official commented that the coalition "might have given priority to reopening the trade talks in an attempt to earn diplomatic points" to strengthen its weak domes tic political position. -- The 28 May issue of Sankei Shimbun reported that another official argued that "it is very questionable whether Japan should have made such large concessions" on the issue of objective criteria. He predicted that the two sides would continue to sharply disagree on the issue in the upcoming talks. -- In addition, the 28 May Sankei Shimbun cited a third unidentified official as criticizing the 24 May agreement because it "includes only demands on Japan and makes few references to what the United States should do" to improve its competitiveness in Japan. -- The 27 May Asahi Shimbun quoted unidentified officials as complaining that the 24 May agreement was "hasty," "inadequate," and "open to misinterpretation by the United States." -- According to the 25 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, unidentified sources in the LDP have also criticized the coalition's handling of the trade talks, asserting that the coalition had "only narrowly averted the worst situation that could trigger a trade war between Japan and the United States." The paper reported that the LDP plans to cite the coalition's poor handling of the negotiations surrounding the resumption of the framework talks in a no-confidence motion it is considering against the government after the Diet passes the 1994 budget. Bureaucracy's Criticism Japanese bureaucrats who have criticized the 24 May agreement appear to be planning to work to limit the scope of the objective criteria as much as possible during the upcoming negotiations, seeking to avoid, wherever possible, any standards that might be interpreted as targets, involve future goals, or affect sectors that the government claims are beyond its control. Yosihiro Sakamoto, director general of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's International Trade Policy Bureau, told a press conference on 24 May that although Tokyo understood that the objective criteria would include "a set of measuring yardsticks," they would be used "on a sector-by-sector basis to gauge only how Japan has done in the past" (Kyodo, 25 May). Similarly, an unidentified MITI official told Kyodo on 27 May that Japan would reject any criteria that it regarded as numerical targets. The official added that Tokyo defines such targets as any "quantitative pledges by the government regarding future trade performance and trade areas beyond government control." In addition, the 29 May Mainichi Shimbun reported that a senior unnamed MITI official stated that Japan would reject anything that "comes close to numerical targets" (Mainichi Shimbun, 29 May). Other unidentified government sources quoted in the 29 and 30 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun indicated that Japan would refuse to set any future goals, such as pledges to increase the number of dealers or outlets selling foreign products. The bureaucracy appears to be particularly concerned about limiting the scope of objective criteria in the automobile sector. Officials commenting on the upcoming automobile sector talks have used many of the standard arguments marshalled by Japanese officials in the past to resist monitoring of Japan's import performance in this area. According to the 27 May Asahi Shimbun, a MITI negotiator involved in the framework talks stated that Japan would agree to adopting criteria, such as the number of dealers handling foreign cars, only if they are used to measure current conditions or past performance. He said Tokyo would reject any criteria that involve "future commitments" for specific levels of imports. He also argued, as Japanese negotiators have in the past, that the automobile sector was an "industrial field run by the private sector" over which the government has little control and for which it cannot set targets. The 27 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Japanese negotiators would also refuse to comply with any U.S. demand to guarantee targets set voluntarily by Japanese automakers. Ruling Coalition Response The politically weak ruling coalition has attempted to play the 24 May agreement to its best advantage and head off criticism from the bureaucracy and the opposition. In the days immediately following the announcement of the 24 May agreement, for example, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa sought to portray the agreement in the best possible light for the ruling coalition, suggesting that the government had averted potential U.S. sanctions and secured Washington's agreement to drop demands for numerical targets. On 24 May, he reportedly told a news conference that, as part of the agreement, the two sides had decided to introduce "qualitative and quantitative criteria " to measure imports into Japan and "not to use a single criterion to judge" Japan's performance (Kyodo, 24 May). This situation, he said, would avert the possibility of Washington imposing sanctions on Japan. On 25 May, he reportedly told an opposition member who questioned him during a Diet Budget Committee meeting that the "objective criteria" to be determined in the upcoming negotiations would not be numerical targets (Kyodo, 25 May). MITI Minister Eijiro Hata has also sought to head off criticism by signalling that Tokyo would remain firm in rejecting numerical targets after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was reported in the Japanese media as saying that Washington would continue to pursue "results-oriented" objectives in the upcoming talks (Kyodo, 27 May). On 27 May, Hata reportedly told a news conference that failure to define objective criteria in the 24 May agreement had left a "source of contention" for the talks. He reiterated Japan's longstanding position that it would not accept numerical targets (Kyodo, 27 May). On 31 May, according to a Kyodo report the same day, Hata made similar remarks at another press conference, asserting that "Japan could not swallow any U.S. proposals that would lead to numerical targets." Hata may also have been seeking to signal to Washington that Tokyo would remain firm on the issue of numerical targets. Outlook Japanese bureaucrats involved in the trade talks will probably make every possible effort to keep the objective criteria adopted in various sectors as vague and as limited as possible. This will almost certainly slow progress in the talks, particularly in more contentious areas, such as the automobile sector. Because of its weak political position, the ruling coalition will probably have problems dealing effectively with the bureaucracy's position. On the one hand, the coalition will probably want to avoid pushing the bureaucracy to compromise with the United States, for fear that this would provide fuel for critics of the government to attack the coalition for giving in to Washington. On the other hand, if the talks collapse again or proceed very slowly and acrimoniously because of disagreements over objective criteria, the coalition could open itself to criticism from the LDP for mishandling Japan's relationship with the United States.
