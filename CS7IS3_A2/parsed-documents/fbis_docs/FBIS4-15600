In Friday's appearance on Georgian television Nikolaishvili reported good progress in the efforts to build a national army. The top executives of the Georgian Defense Ministry have drafted and approved a national military doctrine which will be very soon presented for endorsement to the Georgian parliament. According to Nikolaishvili, the Georgian armed forces number up to 20,000 men. Instead of calling up reserves, the Georgian army practices regular army drafts. Nikolaishvili said up to 300,000 men in the 18 to 25 age bracket had never served in the army. Up to ten army bases were under construction in the republic, he added. The army's one big problem was the officers. Nikolaishvili explained it by financial limitations. He said a Georgian army officer earned an equivalent of 4,000 Russian Rubles a month.
