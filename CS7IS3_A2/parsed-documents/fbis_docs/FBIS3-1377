The fighting appears to have been between two ULIMO factions -- one under Alhaji Koromah and supported by the Mandingo people; the other by Krahns, led by ULIMO's military wing chairman, Roosevelt Johnson. But there have also been reports that Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces were also involved in the fighting on Roosevelt Johnson's side. Well, today we spoke to Roosevelt Johnson himself, and on the line to Monrovia, Audrie Brown asked him what he knew about the fighting: [Begin recording] [Johnson] Well, the fighting started early yesterday morning and died down in the evening. [Brown] And, how many people were involved in this fighting? [Johnson] Roughly, 2,000 something men went in to rescue the people there. [Brown] Who are the people they went to rescue? [Johnson] The relatives. The relatives and some other soldiers that were being held hostage there. [Brown] What kind of losses did your side sustain? [Johnson] Well, only two soldiers got wounded on the leg and they have been treated now in Bong Mines, and a few days ago my mother was slaughtered together with my two kids and my sister. [Brown] You lost your mother and your children in this fighting? [Johnson] Well, it was not actually in the fighting. They were coming to Tubmanburg, and they were captured by some of the Mandingo soldiers and they were slaughtered. [Brown] So in this fighting your side are, I understand, Krahn soldiers and you are fighting Mandingos. Why are you fighting now? What is behind the latest fighting, this fighting that started on Friday [25 March]? [Johnson] Well, it is because the Mandingo people, the few Mandingo people who are loyal to Koromah, continue to kill innocent people. Once you cannot speak Mandingo, they kill you. [Brown] So when did they kill innocent people? [Johnson] They have been killing them for the past three weeks, because as Koromah said we did not vote for Sheriff to become chairman on the Council, so that annoyed them and this is the reason why they have started disarming all other tribes, you know, within ULIMO, and that's when they started killing. [Brown] Now, there are reports that you are fighting with Charles Taylor's NPFL. Can you confirm this? [Johnson] This is not true. The information is completely misleading. I have had no connection with Taylor to get men from Taylor, or whatsoever connection. I don't have any connection with Taylor. The men that are fighting are purely ULIMO soldiers, and not only Krahn. What happened we.... [pauses] In the ULIMO we have all tribes there, and those soldiers that went in were not only Krahn. We have Grebo; we have Bassa, and other tribes mix with them. [Brown] So are you in control of Tubmanburg now? [Johnson] Definitely not. [as heard] Yes. I can tell you that my men on grounds now in Tubmanburg. [Brown] If you have captured Tubmanburg, what have you done with the people who supported Alhaji Koromah who were still there? [Johnson] Look, it is not our intention to kill anybody. Okay? So, even when we are fighting with NPFL, when we capture the NPFL soldiers we don't kill them. So I don't see why I should capture anybody from Alhaji Koromah's side and kill them. But the only thing is we had to move in militarily to bring the situation under control. [Brown] So have you taken them prisoner? [Johnson] Those that I have captured, yes, they are prisoners. [Brown] So where do you go from now? You say you have captured Tubmanburg. Do you now want Alhaji Koromah to step down as the leader of ULIMO and you be leader or you choose another leader, or what do you want now? [Johnson] We will decide that at a later date. We have to meet our men and listen to them, and listen to their suggestions before we can make comments on such a thing. [Brown] So where is Alhaji Koromah now? [Johnson] I understand he went to Guinea. [Brown] And the rest of the ULIMO leadership, were they in Tubmanburg when the fighting started, and have you taken them prisoner? [Johnson] They are in hiding. [end recording]
