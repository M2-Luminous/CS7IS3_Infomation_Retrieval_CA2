The RPF controls the Rwandan side of Rusumo bridge between Rwanda and Tanzania. The fears that Rusumo bridge may be destroyed are not founded. The bridge is not contested. It is under the total control of the RPF. The RPF does not expect any invasion from Tanzania. The youthwingers who fled to Tanzania, most of them dumped their weapons to the Rwandan side of the border and those who crossed with their arms have been disarmed by Tanzanian authorities. Some known killers have even been arrested by Tanzanian authorities. It is in the interest of the RPF that the Rusumo bridge remains safe.
