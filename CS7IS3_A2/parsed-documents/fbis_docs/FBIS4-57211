Gen. Constantino Matos Villanueva, Armed Forces secretary, and other generals who were not identified. Pena Gomez said a plan was discussed at the meeting to allow the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) of President Balaguer to retain power in case it loses the 16 May elections, but a group of officers at the meeting opposed the measure. The opposition leader did not specify which position was taken by the secretary of the Armed Forces. Pena Gomez said the subject of the meeting was made known to President Joaquin Balaguer, who disavowed the same and asked the Armed Forces to keep its distance from the electoral and democratic process. The leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) praised the president's position and the professionalism of the Armed Forces and asked Balaguer to discipline the military officers who proposed the plan discussed at the meeting, which was "recorded" by the two officers who reported the same. Pena Gomez' accusations come 24 hours after the Armed Forces issued a communique, signed by Lt. Gen. Matos Villanueva and other generals, expressing their willingness to guarantee constitutional order and peace during the election. The Armed Forces warned that any attempt to alter the results would be strongly dealt with. In a televised appearance, Pena Gomez also asked that the Haitian border be closed for three days, next Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday -- Monday is election day -- to prevent "adventurers on both sides" from interfering in the elections. Pena Gomez' request stems from a minority party report that sectors close to the government and the PRSC plan to cause incidents at the border during the election to alarm the population and influence the elections results.
