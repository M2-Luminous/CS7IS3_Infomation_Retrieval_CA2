FBIS4-53932 "dreas100_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 South Korea Problems With DPRK's Yugyong Hotel Construction Problems With DPRK's Yugyong Hotel Construction SK2305095694 Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean 23 May 94 pp 1, 3 SK2305095694 Seoul SEOUL SINMUN Korean BFN [By correspondent Choe Tu-sam in Beijing] [Text] Western and business sources in Beijing said on 22 May that the 105-storey Yugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, which had been left unfinished, has been slowly leaning to one side since the early nineties due to inadequate foundation groundwork. Therefore, the North Korean authorities recently invited Chinese civil engineering and construction experts to find out ways to make the hotel stand straight. The five-man Chinese team stayed in Pyongyang for a week and studied the building extensively. The team returned to China after saying that "we have no technology to make the building stand straight." A source says: No information is available on which direction the building is leaning. However, given various circumstances, the building does not seem to have tilted to the extent easily recognizable to the naked eye. A business source in Beijing says: The Yugyong Hotel is leaning because of inadequate foundation work. As a result, it is difficult to install elevators and other high-technology equipment in the hotel. And, it is difficult to find foreign companies that do interior work. This has been cautiously said for a long time in business circles. A diplomatic source says: North Korea had made every effort to build the hotel since the mid-eighties. It even mobilized soldiers. It managed to finish the foundation, structure, and brick work. However, when a French joint-venture company withdrew from the construction work, North Korea tried to have a Hong Kong company finish the construction, but failed to reach an agreement with the company on the interior work. As a result, the construction work has stopped, and the hotel has been left unfinished. North Korea failed to reach agreement with the Hong Kong company because the payment conditions for the $500 million-worth interior work were not good and because North Korea did not accept the Hong Kong company's demand that after the hotel construction is finished it be allowed to participate in the hotel management by directly controlling and supervising 200 of its employees. However, business circles think that there will be many difficult technical in addition to monetary problems. It is also speculated that there are many difficulties North Korean technology cannot resolve, including supplying water to the 105-storey building and making the top stories of the building flexible enough to withstand typhoons. It is also speculated that the French company left and a Hong Kong company refused to do the interior work not because of the financial problems but because of difficulties to do the interior work due to the shoddy workmanship of the structure. North Korea has tried hard to build this hotel to display the honor of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il and give boundless pride to its people. North Korea can neither dismantle the hotel nor proceed with the construction. As a result, the hotel now seems to be a skeletal "ghost house" that typifies the North Korean economic reality.
