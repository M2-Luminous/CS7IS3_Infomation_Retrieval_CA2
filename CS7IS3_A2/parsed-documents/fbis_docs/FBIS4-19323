At a conference of the Saarland SPD, Lafontaine stated in Saarlouis today: "Those who want peace in Asia and Africa should finally stop exporting weapons to these countries." He accused the government of schizophrenia, stressing: "First we export our weapons to all parts of the world, and then we send our children there as soldiers to collect them again." Referring to the civil wars in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Rwanda, Lafontaine pointed out that it must also be possible to help without soldiers.
