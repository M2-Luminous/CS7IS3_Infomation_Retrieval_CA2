Increasing sales--more than one in four cars are now diesel--point to the likelihood of taxation being used to cut demand. The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants told the Government to arrest or reverse the rising trend in diesel because of evidence linking it to asthma, cancer and other diseases. In January, a report highlighted international evidence that diesel can cause health problems. But one of the problems for scientists is that other fumes, especially those from petrol engines, are also implicated in health studies. Professor Anthony Newman Taylor, from the Brompton Hospital in London, said the rise in road traffic had coincided with a rise in asthma. But this did not mean the two were related, he added. A third issue being researched is the issue of pollution in the home. Oxides of nitrogen from unventilated gas cookers are far higher inside homes than outside and researchers are investigating to see whether this has any effect on health. The Government is collating all its research in the Medical Research Council's Institute for Environment and Health, based at the University of Leicester. Yesterday scientists from the departments of health and environment said urgent work was required on possible links between air pollution and increasing respiratory illness. About 2,000 people a year die as a result of asthma. Guardian Newspapers Limited, May 12, 1994
