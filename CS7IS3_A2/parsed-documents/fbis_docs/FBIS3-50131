Fuzessy also spoke about intelligence activity regarding the extremist political groupings. "The late Prime Minister Jozsef Antall's widow and two children flew to Rome for the holy mass in memory of her husband on the same airplane as I did. Many people asked whether there was any political connection here" -- Fuzessy told us. "This was only a coincidence, because we planned my trip to Rome well in advance; I paid an official visit, while the Antall family paid a personal visit to Rome." Fuzessy told us that the cooperation between the two countries' intelligence services can now be openly called partnership relations. Control over the intelligence agencies was one of the major issues discussed at the meeting held at the partner organizations. "The answer to this question is never easy and never free of debate" -- Fuzessy pointed out. In Italy, for example, a group of several ministers is in charge of the intelligence services. "We are trying to find a solution that provides the best guarantee that the intelligence services cannot act against the law. This is an important issue in Italy too, where the political restructuring also affects the activity of the intelligence services." Fuzessy told us that antiterrorist actions and the struggle against organized crime, money laundering, and the smuggling of weapons and drugs were the main subjects discussed in the course of his talks with the heads of Western intelligence services. "We succeeded in getting the Hungarian intelligence organizations accepted as partners at the talks" -- Fuzessy added and said that this was one of the major achievements of recent years. Organized crime is a relatively new development in the area of influence of the former Soviet Union and, naturally, in the former Yugoslavia. The Western intelligence organizations, including the Italian intelligence services, are very much interested in this development, and we succeeded in agreeing on the exchange of certain information, and we will receive information about the movement and actions of certain groups. Then we asked Fuzessy for any information about extremist political groupings in Hungary, like the World National Popular Rule Party. "Many parties often fear that the National Security Office keeps them under surveillance. This is not true. However, the National Security Office must keep an eye on everyone who has ideas or actions that could be anti-constitutional; namely those that aim at overthrowing the democratic state" -- Fuzessy pointed out. It is the obligation of the National Security Office to pay attention to every political extremism, no matter on what side. Fuzessy told us that the activity of a party becomes a crime when the party is striving to take over power. A fascist-type takeover of power, or any organized activity with this aim would already qualify as a crime. However, as long as a party declares such an ideology but wants to achieve its goals through democratic means, it cannot be called to account. However, other manifestations, like the use of forbidden symbols, already border on crime. Incitement also qualifies as a crime. This is an area "that the extremist parties can easily slip into" -- Fuzessy said in conclusion.
