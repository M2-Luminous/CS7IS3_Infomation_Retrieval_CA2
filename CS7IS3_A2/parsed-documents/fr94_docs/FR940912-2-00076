FR940912-2-00076 FR940912-2-00056 B. In the event that the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to section 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. section 45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Roche shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to section 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Roche to comply with this order. C. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. or B. this order, Roche shall consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities: 1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Roche, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Roche has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Roche of the identity of any proposed trustee, Roche shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest the Syva Business. 3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, Roche shall execute a trust agreement that, subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this order. 4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in Paragraph III.C.3. to accomplish the divestiture, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission. If, however, at the end of the twelve month period, the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court; provided, however, the Commission may extend this period only two (2) times. 5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities related to Syva, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may request. Roche shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Roche shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any delays in divestiture caused by Roche shall extend the time for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court. 6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission, subject to Roche's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price. The divestiture shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer as set out in Paragraph II of this order, as appropriate; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity or entities selected by Roche from among those approved by the Commission. If requested by the trustee or acquirer, Roche shall provide the acquirer(s) with the assistance required by Paragraph II.C. of this order.
