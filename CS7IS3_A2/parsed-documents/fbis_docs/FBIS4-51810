FBIS4-51810 "dreas085_d_94053" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 South Korea Further on Improved Labor Relations Further on Improved Labor Relations SK0305081194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0651 GMT 3 May 94 SK0305081194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Article by Kim Myong-chol] [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- Labor-management relations have improved greatly from last year thanks to expanding mutual trust, an increasing consensus on the need to sharpen Korean products' competitive edge and dissident unions' restraint on forming a second labor front independent of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU). Moreover, labor disputes are on the decrease and collective bargaining on wage hikes is sailing before the wind. According to the Labor Ministry, 20 labor disputes have been recorded so far this year compared with 18 during the same period last year. Noteworthy is that the manufacturing sector saw only five disputes against 13 last year, while the remainder involved small taxi companies. Employees participating in these disputes decreased from 12,712 last year to 4,739 and working hours lost to the disputes amounted to 20,520 hours, only 15 percent of the figure registered a year ago. Of the 5,483 firms employing 100 or more workers, 918 or 16.7 percent had completed collective bargaining on wage hikes as of May 3. Last year, the same 16.7-percent rate was achieved May 11. The improved labor-management relations and the resulting smooth sailing of collective bargaining are attributed chiefly to an increasing worker-employer consensus on the need to increase the international competitiveness of their products. This need is felt not only by FKTU-affiliated unions but also dissident unions which last year launched general strikes, such as the Hyundai group workers union, the Daewoo group unions' conference and the National Council of Trade Unions (NCTU). These unions have refrained from starting labor disputes or from going to extremes when a dispute is indeed launched. In most workplaces which have suffered strikes and work stoppages since 1987, when the winds of democracy began to blow in the country, labor and management have come to believe that extreme labor movements are consumptive and losing propositions. Toward the end of last year, businesses in such industrial areas as Ulsan, Changwon and Koje Island began to improve labor-management relations on the basis of cooperation. Striking a discordant note, the dissident National Congress of Union Representatives (NCUR) charges that the wage guidelines calling for a 5 to 8.7 percent increase agreed between the FKTU and the Korea employers' federation was a product of secret bargaining. Nevertheless, these guidelines are accepted as reasonable by unions in most industries except those in such growth sectors as electronics, automobiles, steel and shipbuilding. Collective bargaining on wage hikes at many firms is proceeding according to these guidelines. The NCUR, consisting of the Hyundai group workers union, the Daewoo group unions' conference, the NCTU and the conference of industrial unions, wants to form a second labor front independent of the FKTU this year, and therefore will not resort to prolonged strikes and other extreme action which might impede this goal. At a separate May Day ceremony, the NCUR adopted a resolution warning that if the government and employers fail to show sincerity in collective wage bargaining -- instead citing the need to increase international competitiveness and the wage guidelines agreed between the FKTU and the Korea employers' federation -- it will launch a nationwide labor struggle in late May and early June. This warning is considered a demonstration of force for forming a second labor front. The hard-line unions of Hyundai heavy industries, Daewoo shipbuilding heavy machinery and Kia Motors may launch a short-term strike because of their leading roles in the NCUR, but few expect a prolonged general strike like the one staged by Hyundai group unions in Ulsan last year. The wage increases offered by unions at large firms for this year are 2 to 3 percentage points lower than last year: 12.6 percent at Hyundai heavy industries, 13.82 percent at Daewoo shipbuilding and heavy machinery, 15.07 percent at Kia motors, and 16.3 percent at Daewoo motor. With such offers, these firms' unions have just started collective bargaining, with an eye to completing the process by early June. The bottom line? It is premature to adopt an optimistic view toward labor-management relations in the coming year because of labor's demand to participate in company management, price hikes, the government's plan to check unions, and other political and economic problems affecting labor.
