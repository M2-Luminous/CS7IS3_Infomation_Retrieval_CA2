A Czech parliamentary delegation is currently on a four day visit to Vietnam, led by parliament chairman Milan Uhde. The need to update existing agreements has arisen from the Czech Republic having undergone substantive changes in economy and foreign trade, a subject discussed with the Vietnamese side by Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy during his visit to Vietnam last November. An agreement is being drawn up on settling the Vietnamese debt worth 92,3 million XTR (interchangeable rubles) and $7.4 million. Vietnamese deputies agreed with the Czech proposal that bilateral agreements on double taxation and the protection of investments be signed, Czech deputy Jan Krycer said, adding that use might be made of the knowledge and expertise of the Vietnamese who had received Czech training and worked in the Czech Republic.
