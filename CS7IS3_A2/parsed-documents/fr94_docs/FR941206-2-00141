FR941206-2-00141 FR941206-2-00095 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Cost-of-Living Adjustments and Headstone or Marker Allowance Rate AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: As required by law, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is hereby giving notice of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) in certain benefit rates and income limitations. These COLAs affect the pension and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) programs. These adjustments are based on the rise in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the one-year period ending September 30, 1994. VA is also giving notice of the maximum amount of reimbursement that may be paid for headstones or markers purchased in lieu of Government-furnished headstones or markers in Fiscal Year 1995 which began on October 1, 1994. DATES: These COLAs are effective December 1, 1994. The headstone or marker allowance rate is effective October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Trowbridge, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service (211B), Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 273&hyph;7210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 38 U.S.C. 2306(d), VA may provide reimbursement for the cost of non-Government headstones or markers at a rate equal to the actual cost or the average actual cost of Government-furnished headstones or markers during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the non-Government headstone or marker was purchased, whichever is less. Section 8041 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508 amended 38 U.S.C. 2306(d) to eliminate the payment of the monetary allowance in lieu of VA-provided headstone or marker for deaths occurring on or after November 1, 1990. However, in a precedent opinion (O.G.C. Prec. 17&hyph;90), VA General Counsel held that there is no limitation period applicable to claims for benefits under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 2306(d). The average actual cost of Government-furnished headstones or markers during any fiscal year is determined by dividing the sum of VA costs during that fiscal year for procurement, transportation, Office of Memorial Programs and miscellaneous administration, inspection and support staff by the total number of headstones and markers procured by VA during that fiscal year and rounding to the nearest whole dollar amount. The average actual cost of Government-furnished headstones or markers for Fiscal Year 1994 under the above computation method was $100. Therefore, effective October 1, 1994, the maximum rate of reimbursement for non-Government headstones or markers purchased during Fiscal Year 1995 is $100. Cost-of-Living Adjustments Under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5312 and section 306 of Pub. L. 95&hyph;588, VA is required to increase the benefit rates and income limitations in the pension and parents' DIC programs by the same percentage, and effective the same date, as increases in the benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social Security Act. The increased rates and income limitations are also required to be published in the Federal Register . The Social Security Administration has announced that there will be a 2.8 percent cost-of-living increase in social security benefits effective December 1, 1994. Therefore, applying the same percentage, the following increased rates and income limitations for the VA pension and parents' DIC programs will be effective December 1, 1994:
