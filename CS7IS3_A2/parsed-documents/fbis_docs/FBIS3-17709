In an interview with INTERFAX, Zorkin noted that so far he had not received such an offer and that it was too early to comment on such rumors. At the same time, Zorkin said that the task of the new movement Accord for Russia (he was one of its initiators) is to unite various social and political forces. Zorkin stressed that the appeal of Accord for Russia to citizens should not be put in opposition to the agreement on civic peace in Russia prepared in the Kremlin. According to Zorkin, he has not yet decided whether he will stay in the Constitutional Court, resign or get involved in politics, all the more so since the court's activities are still suspended and "it is ridiculous to pretend that it is working." At the same time, such a situation to some extent can be justified, Zorkin believes. "If the Constitutional Court starts to work now, in the present unclear legal situation, it would find itself in a false situation," Zorkin said. There is only the new Constitution. The Duma has not in essence adopted a single law, there is no clear legal field. The Constitutional Court is the body oriented for an absolutely clear legal situation with a good-working mechanism of the division of powers and a legal basis." Perhaps this is the reason why the authorities are not encouraging the Constitutional Court to start working immediately, Zorkin suggested.
