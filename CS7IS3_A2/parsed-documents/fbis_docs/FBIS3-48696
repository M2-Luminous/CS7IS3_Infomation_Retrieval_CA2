This situation prompted the business leaders to take action. At a regularly-scheduled news conference held the same day, Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], said: "Political uncertainty and economic effects have shown up in stock values, and Japanese instability in the eyes of the international community has appeared as yen depreciation. We are at an important turning point not only from the domestic standpoint, but also from the international standpoint." Hiraiwa then urged that the political reform bills be enacted, saying: "Politicians should take a broad perspective to try to bring about political reform." He also stated: "The outlook on the economic situation could further worsen. We ask that politicians handle pump-priming measures along with political reform." In his statements announced in the form of an informal talk, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations [Nikkeiren], said: "There is a growing sense of disappointment concerning the outlook on the political reform bills which we have asserted would have had the greatest favorable impact above all else toward economic recovery. For those politicians who fail to calmly analyze the grave impact of the current situation and exercise common sense, their responsibility is extremely serious. If the political reform bills cannot be enacted during the current Diet session, the very foundations of the Japanese economy could crack open." He thus expressed his concern about the current situation. Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai], stated: "Since there was such great hope in the passage of the political reform bills, we are concerned that (business and consumer) sentiments may cool down in reaction to the rejection of the bills. Both ruling coalition and opposition parties should disregard party interests and strategies and pour their utmost efforts to prevent the bills from being killed by seeking a compromise." Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry [Nissho], asserted: "Ruling coalition and opposition parties should disregard what has occurred between them in the past regarding political reform, tax system reform, and budget compilation. They should then discuss and determine what should be given priority in the interest of the people and promptly take necessary action."
