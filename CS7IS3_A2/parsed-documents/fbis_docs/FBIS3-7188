The UN in New York should be informed by letter about the situation in Chanthaburi province, on the Thai-Cambodian border, where about 30,000 Cambodians, many the families of Khmer Rouge fighters, have fled, the source said. UN agencies such as United Nations Border Relief Organisation and the International Red Cross should immediately help by setting up safe areas on Cambodian territory. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is limited in its function and can provide humanitarian assistance only on the Thai side. The source said Thailand does not want to shoulder the burden of caring for Cambodians fleeing attacks by their own government and wishes that the fighting should end soon for the sake of the people and the country. "Thailand shouldered the burden of Cambodian refugees for years before UN agencies and other organizations stepped in," he said. According to the source, Khmer Rouge troops may attack a government military base in Cambodia's Battambang province bordering Thailand's Sa Kaew province and the Cambodian government troops there may seek help from Thai troops across the border. "An attack there would result in an additional influx of Cambodians into Thailand. Thai authorities know of the possibility and will soon meet to arrange a plan for the fleeing Cambodians," he said. The Foreign Ministry will raise the issue with Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut who will visit Bangkok for two days, starting on Monday. Cambodia will provide additional time to Thai loggers hauling logs out of the country on a case-by-case basis, depending on payment, an informed source said. The present deadline for removing the logs is March 30.
