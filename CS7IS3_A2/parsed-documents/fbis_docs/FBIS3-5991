Wimon Wongwanit yesterday emotionally reminded U.S. Ambassador David Lambertson that Thailand was a sovereign state and it was totally unacceptable for any foreigner to make groundless accusations against her. "The Foreign Ministry will not give in to any condemnation which is totally groundless. I consider that we are a sovereign nation and no one has the right to condemn us like this," said the army commander. He was speaking after presiding over a funeral ceremony at Wat Sommanatwihan of an army officer killed by a Khmer landmine at the border in Ubon Ratchathani. The army commander made the remark after being asked by reporters to comment on Mr. Lambertson's statement on Wednesday about Thai military contacts with the Khmer Rouge. Gen. Wimon, however, said that the U.S. embassy here has clarified the ambassador's statement and denied the press report which quoted the ambassador as saying that the Thai military was still backing the Khmer Rouge. Gen. Wimon said if a statement is made by an ambassador it must hold some truth. "The U.S. ambassador denied that he made such an allegation. I don't know how the press could go ahead and publish it when he (the U.S. ambassador) said he did not make the allegation," said Gen. Wimon. Asked about Ambassador Lambertson's call asking the military to sever its contacts with the Communist Khmer Rouge, Gen. Wimon asked reporters whether the U.S. Government could bar Mexicans from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. "Can they do that? It could not be done as the common border is quite long. I'm a Thai and have dignity and would not allow anyone to criticize us without a basis. We have our own dignity," said the army commander. Gen. Wimon said he feels bitter whenever he learns that Thai people have started believing in allegations made by foreigners. He said despite making it clear on several occasions on the neutrality of the Thai military over the conflict in Cambodia, outsiders have not stopped making such allegations against the Thai military. "If you reporters don't believe in what I say then it's time you stopped asking me any more questions," said the general. When asked to comment on the border situation along the Khmer Rouge stronghold in Pailin concerning reports that Phnom Penh was rushing reinforcements to the area in preparation for a new offensive, Gen. Wimon quipped: "Ask the U.S. ambassador. He might be able to comment." Meanwhile, Army secretary Maj. Gen. Chaturit Phromsakha Na Sakonnakhon also said that the U.S. ambassador had clarified the matter with the army over his remarks. Maj. Gen. Chaturit said the ambassador denied press reports quoting him as saying that the military is still backing the Khmer Rouge guerrillas. "That is not true," said Maj. Gen. Chaturit. "The U.S. government does not believe that the Thai Government or the Thai military still backs the Khmer Rouge." He said the misquoted report dispatched by some foreign news agencies could cause a misunderstanding and tarnish the country's image. [passage omitted]
