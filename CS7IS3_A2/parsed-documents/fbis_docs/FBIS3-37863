Answer: I can't say anything about the programme itself for I am not NATO's but the UN representative in Azerbaijan. The UN is in close contact and cooperation with all regional organizations. Lately, the UN's cooperation with the NATO have become closer in an attempt to settle the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The willingness of sovereign Azerbaijan to participate in the Partnership For Peace is the matter to be settled between Azerbaijan and NATO. I'd like to add that the UN supports any decision which does not contradict its Charter and contributes to the strengthening of peace and security. Question: The latest developments in Sarajevo enhance the possibility of bringing the NATO's peace mission to Europe. May such mission's coming to Azerbaijan be materialized? Answer: I don't have a crystal ball. It is the CSCE which deals with such issues in Azerbaijan. When in New York, I met with the new Chairman of the Minsk Group Jan Eliasson. Now, he returned the Swedish Foreign Ministry. He is a very experienced diplomat. He has a good experience of negotiating and mediating. Before the last appointment, Jan Eliasson had been Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs. The new Chairman is expected to visit the conflict zone shortly. Question: The mandate of the UNOMIG [United Nations Organization Mission in Georgia] was extended until March 7, 1994. The UNSC Resolution 896 calls for an immediate determination of the political status of Abkhazia within the parameters of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia. What do you think the political status is. If similar developments take place in Nagorno-Karabakh, how would you like to see the status of Nagorno-Karabakh? Answer: I attended that very meeting of the Security Council. Following the report of the SG, Special Representative for Georgia, it was decided to increase the number of observers. All UN resolutions on Georgia reiterate the territorial integrity of Georgia. The resolution requested Georgia to accelerate the search for political ways of settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. If the problem of Abkhazia exists then political ways should be found to settle it. The same idea could be applied to Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. If there had been no conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Security Council would have never discussed this problem. All resolutions including 822 and the rest 3 on NK [Nagorno-Karabakh] clearly say that no conflict can be settled by military means but by political means within certain parameters. As for political status, the conflict involving Abkhazia is one thing but Nagorno-Karabakh is something different. I have always said that it is very risky to compare different conflicts and that each conflict has its own reasons and peculiarities. But the principles are the same. The UN stands for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of both Georgia and Azerbaijan and seeks to promote the peaceful settlement of those conflicts. As far as the status is concerned, it is part of the negotiation process. I'd like to add that all agreements the parties arrive at should comply with the basic UN principles.
