Mikhail Umanets, chairman of the Ukrainian State Nuclear Power Committee, told an International Conference of Soviet-Made Nuclear Reactor Users, which opened in Moscow Wednesday, that experts were especially worried over the condition of the fourth Chernobyl power unit that had been destroyed by the 1986 explosion. Umanets said that the unit could be made safe within three to five years if developed countries helped. Umanets said that "as long as it is short of energy and cash Ukraine cannot afford closing the Chernobyl station." He thought that the station could be transformed into a store for radioactive waste. He emphasized that all the processing and storing units were situated in Russia and that Russia had been refusing to accept Ukraine's radioactive waste which therefore had to be kept at Ukrainian nuclear power stations. Umanets complained of skilled personnel leaving Ukrainian nuclear power stations where they are paid less than in Russia. Over 2000 people, about 1000 of whom were highly-skilled personnel, had quit jobs in Ukrainian nuclear power stations in 1993.
