During the talks, Prime Minister Klaus distanced himself from the opinion voiced by Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, according to whom the emergence of large European companies might help in coping with American and Asian economic competition. Prime Minister Klaus rejected this idea pertaining, according to him, to the fifties and sixties, saying that small companies are more competitive than clumsy and bureaucratic colossi. Later on during the talks, Klaus said that talks between current and future members of the European Union had revealed unanimity in many areas, as well as some fine differences of opinion in some others. According to him, the Czech Republic can enrich European integration thanks to its experience from the former regime. West Europe does not share this past, and therefore it does not perceive some of the matters so sharply.
