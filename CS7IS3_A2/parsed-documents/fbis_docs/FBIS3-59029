"There are increasing signs that the rapid decline in industrial investments is coming to an end," the Munich-based institute writes in its latest analysis. In the more probable event of a clear acceleration in the export sector and further, more pronounced interest rate reductions, a real increase of 3 percent (following minus 3 percent in 1993) in plant investment can be expected in 1994. If, however, the pressures of the domestic economic situation were to increase, a further slight decline of 1 percent is possible. In either case, the negative development in investment expenditure in industry is likely to continue, in the more favourable scenario by minus 6 percent, in the unfavorable one by minus 11 percent (following the minus 12 percent calculated for 1993). In 1992, investment expenditure in industry was 127 billion German marks [DM] and DM721 billion for all economic sectors. Investment in the former east German states continues to rise, whereby the mining, energy, and services sectors -- as well as, in the medium term, transport -- predominate. Investment in the former East Germany increased by around 15 percent, despite the recession in 1993. In broad sectors of the west German economy, however, the downturn in investment was much more pronounced than even in the most unfavorable scenario, for example in trade, transport, industry, and also agriculture, according to the Ifo. In the medium term, the high investment level of the early 1990's could be regained in 1996 at the earliest. In the purchase of capital goods, data processing equipment and office machinery are likely to remain key areas of growth until 1998. The Ifo Institute warned against hoping for overly large economic impulses from the GATT agreement on the liberalization of world trade, reached in mid-December 1993. A definitive assessment of the outcome is not possible yet. The agreement is basically positive, although only partial success had been achieved in some areas. Failure has only been prevented by excluding some areas or giving compensation. To describe the agreement as a "huge" or "mega economic program" is certainly an exaggeration, the Ifo Institute writes. It should be borne in mind that the liberalization will begin in early 1995 at the earliest and will be completed gradually in five or more stages. "At least some economic impulses can peter out as a result. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the tendency to solve structural problems through protectionist measures no longer exists." Sanctions were still not envisaged. The main reasons for the prolonged nature of the GATT negotiations -- the great conflict of interests between industrialized and developing countries in some areas and the large number of negotiating partners -- continues to exist and in the future will continue to make multilateral liberalization steps more difficult. The discussion on a GATT with several speeds therefore could remain topical.
