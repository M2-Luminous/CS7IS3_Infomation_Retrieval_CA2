ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: On August 12, 1992 (57 FR 35989), NHTSA and FHWA published a final rule implementing the Drug Offender's Driver's License Suspension Law which requires the withholding of certain Federal-aid highway funds from States that do not enact either legislation requiring the revocation or suspension of an individual's driver's license upon conviction for any violation of the Controlled Substances Act or any drug offense or a resolution opposing such legislation. This final rule was codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at 23 CFR part 1212. Specifically, 23 CFR part 1212 sets forth the manner in which States must certify that they are not subject to the withholding of funds, and the disposition of funds that are withheld. This document corrects an error that appears in 23 CFR part 1212.
