FR940727-0-00018 FR940727-0-00006 (3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing association handler(s) and all processors. For the purposes of this final rule, category (1) is referred to as the ``large-sized handler'' group, category (2) is referred to as the ``medium-sized handler'' group, and category (3) is referred to as the ``all other handler'' group. The number of handlers in the ``all other handler'' group has decreased from 10 to 7 since the 1990&hyph;91 crop year. In addition, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, the ``medium-sized handler'' group acquired more than four times the tonnage acquired by the ``all other handler'' group. Based on this information, the Committee met on March 9, 1994, and unanimously recommended to move one handler position from the ``all other handler'' group to the ``medium-sized handler'' group. The interim final rule amended §989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations by changing the independent and small cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows: (1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; (2) Three members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; and (3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing association handler(s) and all processors. The previous and current independent handler/small cooperative handler representation are shown as follows: ␣ 1Independent handler/small cooperative handler category 1Representation 2Previous 2Current Largest 4 Handlers 2 2 Next Largest 6 Handlers 2 3 Remaining Handlers 3 2 The shift in membership recognized the relative importance of the ``large-sized handler,'' ``medium-sized handler,'' and ``all other handler groups,'' and provides an opportunity for the ten largest independent/small cooperative handlers to be represented on the Committee either as a member or as an alternate member. The ``all other handler'' group is eligible to nominate two members and two alternate members. The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended June 27, 1994. No comments were received. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation and other available information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the Federal Register on May 26, 1994, [59 FR 27225], will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 989 Grapes, Marketing agreements, Raisins, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 989 is amended as follows: PART 989_RAISINS PRODUCED FROM GRAPES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR Part 989 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. 2. Accordingly, the interim final rule amending §989.126, which was published at 59 FR 27225 on May 26, 1994, is adopted as a final rule without change. Dated: July 21, 1994. Terry C.
