Asked to comment on Defence Minister Cesare Previti's statement at a Brussels NATO meeting of "general willingness" for such a mission, Martino said "I think Previti wanted to stress the Italian government's concern for the orphans in Rwanda". He added that "nothing precludes" an Italian mission, but pointed out that there are "risks of various kinds" attached to it. "A decision can only be taken by the government, obviously," he said.
