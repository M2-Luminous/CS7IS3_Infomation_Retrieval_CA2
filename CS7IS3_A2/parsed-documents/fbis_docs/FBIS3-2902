Christine Shelly told a news briefing that Secretary of State Warren Christopher held lengthy meetings with Chinese top leaders while he was in Beijing. During the discussions, the two sides addressed a broad range of bilateral issues including human rights, non-proliferation and trade, she said. "The secretary presented U.S. views on all of these subjects to the Chinese leaders," Shelly claimed. "During the meetings in Beijing, some of the differences on human rights issues were narrowed," she said. "However, more work must be done." "We intend to continue our dialogue and our negotiations with China on the human rights issues," she added. Shelly denied a report in the Washington post today that the U.S. had softened its trade stand with China and had offered a compromise plan to China on the renewal of the most-favored-nation trade status. "This inaccurately reflects the substance and the tenor of the secretary's eight hours of discussion with China's leaders over the last three days," the spokeswoman said.
