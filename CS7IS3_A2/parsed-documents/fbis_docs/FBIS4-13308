The Palestinian side to the talks is chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, and the Israeli side by General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff. Dr. Sha'th affirmed that the negotiators will discuss during their meeting today the same subjects they started discussing yesterday and on which they made no progress. Palestinian sources have affirmed to MENA that the two sides are trying to overcome the big obstacles before the negotiations, especially in the framework of the two committees, the Security Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee. Foremost of these issues is legal jurisdiction over the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, as well as control over the crossings and the border points and the release of the Palestinian detainees who are estimated to be around 10,400 people, according to the statistics of the International Red Cross. Palestinian sources clarified that the Palestinian negotiators insist that all Palestinian detainees should be released, irrespective of their political affiliation. The objective is to guarantee that no split takes place inside the Palestinian ranks. On the other hand, the Israeli side insists on not releasing any of the Hamas members since some of its members recently carried out some suicide attacks on Israelis. The sources said that the Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Affairs Committee will today discuss the subject of contacts in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, in addition to providing the Palestinian side with a number of wavelengths and frequencies to be used by the police and other services. The sources pointed out that in the case where the deep differences between the two sides continue over many basic issues, the leaderships of the two sides will have to intervene to rescue the negotiations from collapse.
