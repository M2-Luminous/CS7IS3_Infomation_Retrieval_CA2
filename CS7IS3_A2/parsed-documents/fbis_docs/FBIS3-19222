The reference was to previous summits and meetings in which the leading seven industrial powers have put their names to declarations urging certain macro-economic targets or generic forms of economic convergence. Here in Detroit, however, the whole agenda revolves round the very real question of what should be done about workers whose qualifications are now becoming irrelevant as their jobs are eliminated by technological advance. According to Italian Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, however, macro-economic policies concerning interest rates and so on should not lose sight of objectives such as balanced growth and tangible advantages for those who work in the various economies. Following this line of thinking, Italy will be using the conference to urge the G-7 to create a task force "on the problems of the real economy," one Italian official disclosed. Filling in the background to the Italian position, the official said there must be improvements in real cooperation between the G-7 nations in all fields and sectors. At the same time, budget adjustments needed to fight inflation should not be seen as a justification for "indiscriminate cuts in welfare." According to this official, the G-7 must seek to develop policies and institutions to ensure a balanced spread of new technologies and improvements in efficiency to "reduce the inequities of international trade." "One question is to avoid one area such as the United States being in the middle of an economic boom when another area such as Europe is still getting to grips with the recession," said Labour Minister Gino Giugni. He also argued for a new European Union pact to avoid discharging the costs of convergence between the European economies onto the "real economy," with an increasing gap between welfare and the indicators for the real economy.
