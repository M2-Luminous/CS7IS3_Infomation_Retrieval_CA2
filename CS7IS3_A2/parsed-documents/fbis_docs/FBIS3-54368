He noted that the Palestinian National Authority intends to build 13 new cities in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jericho areas. Dr. Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, PLO Executive Committee member and head of the PLO Economic Department, has noted that the Palestinian economy is in bad shape as a result of the destruction sustained by the infrastructure at the hands of the Israeli occupation authorities. Speaking to a MENA correspondent, Dr. al-Nashashibi pointed out that the first stage of rebuilding the infrastructure requires more than $365 million. He added: We need 80,000 housing units urgently to provide housing for low-income people, who suffer from a major housing problem. On the economic development projects in Palestine, Dr. al-Nashashibi pointed out that a Palestinian bank for industrial development will be set up with a capital of $100 million. He added: We have prepared an investment law and a law for companies, and we welcome private and joint enterprises by Arab investors. He noted that the port of Gaza will be modernized and a floating dock will be urgently built, adding that the Netherlands has agreed to share 40 percent of the costs of this project, which amounts to $50 millions. He noted that contacts are under way with Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Britain, and Greece to finance infrastructure projects separate from those financed by the World Bank. Dr. al-Nashashibi stressed that the Palestinians are in urgent need of 130 megawatts of electricity in Gaza and 220 megawatts on the West Bank, noting that there are contacts with Egypt in this regard. On Palestinian-U.S. relations, the Palestinian official noted that the Americans have promised to consider financing some projects other than those financed by the World Bank and the donor countries. They also promised to abrogate all laws enacted by Congress banning dealings with the Palestinians, to give Palestinian officials a chance to meet with U.S. businessmen, and to open U.S. markets to Palestinian products, he added. Concluding his remarks, Dr. al-Nashashibi added: We need to create 50,000 jobs urgently. He noted that there are 100,000 unemployed, representing 75 percent of the work force. He added: We will conclude an economic agreement with Egypt soon to encourage Egyptian construction companies to carry out projects in the West Bank and Gaza. Dr. al-Nashashibi left Damascus at noon today after taking part in the meetings of the Arab Agricultural Development Organization, which concluded its work here last night.
