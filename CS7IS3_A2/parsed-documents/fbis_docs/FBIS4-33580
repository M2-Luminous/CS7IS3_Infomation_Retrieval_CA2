Lockheed will this month sign a contract with officials in Buenos Aires to modernize the 36 "Skyhawk A-4M" aircraft that Argentina purchased from the United States for about $200 million. According to the letter of intent that was signed, half of the aircraft will be reconditioned in the Military Aircraft Factory (FAMA) of Cordoba, 800 km northwest of Buenos Aires, under the supervision of U.S. technicians. The rest of the aircraft will be reconditioned at Lockheed plants in the United States, so that half of the work will be completed by late 1995. Cordoba Industry Minister Jose Porta said that the U.S. company intends to enter into a joint venture with FAMA, which belongs to the Argentine military-industrial complex, to repair other types of aircraft like the "Hercules C-130" transport aircraft. Porta pointed out that the U.S. company's proposal includes the repair and maintenance of commercial aircraft. Argentine authorities will give a response within the next few days.
