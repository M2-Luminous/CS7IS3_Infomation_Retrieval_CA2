Fuzhou will work mostly at the construction of Changle International Airport, the enlargement of the Min Jiang Bridge, the construction of the second beltway, sewage and garbage disposal, the expansion of the capacity of program-controlled telephones, and so forth. In developing this projects, the proportion of foreign capital utilized will increase considerably. Fuzhou's investment in infrastructural construction last year totaled 5.8 billion yuan, the largest in history, and this year's infrastructural investment will exceed that of last year. Xi Jinping said: The construction of Changle International Airport, a Sino-foreign joint project, is the biggest project for the year. It will entail a total investment of 2.3 billion yuan. American and Spanish banks, as well as British, Singapore, and Malaysian consortia, are showing very great interest in it and are negotiating with us. The removal of the 1,800 mu of land all has been finished and the airport runway project will begin in April. Its passenger terminal now is being designed by famous Singapore experts, and our requirements are that the airport should have ethnic and local characteristics, and that it must attain top international standards. To match the airport project, a special 18-km expressway will be built from Fuzhou to Changle International Airport, and the Qingzhou Bridge straddling the Min Jiang will be constructed. Their total investment comes to 1.7 billion yuan. The projects are being prepared vigorously and foreign capital will be utilized. Last year, Fuzhou built the 4,400-meter third Min Jiang Bridge and the 2,600-meter Wuliting Overpass, which have greatly alleviated traffic moving into and out of Fuzhou. This year, the Min Jiang Bridge (the second Min Jiang bridge) project will be carried out through the expansion of the bridge surface by seven meters. The bridge will be closed for the project and will be finished this year. Xi Jinping said: We are building the bridge with bank loans and will repay the debt with the bridge tolls and income from its neighboring sections. We will continue to build the fourth bridge over the Min Jiang in the future. Fuzhou will complete the main part of the second beltway, which stretches a dozen kilometers or more. Moreover, it will repair and construct several main passages in the city, including Guloujintai, Cangshanguanhai, Yangqiao West, and Guohuo Roads. These projects will entail an investment of 200 million yuan. Furthermore, Fuzhou will step up electricity development this year. Xi Jinping said they are "very determined" about this because power shortages are detrimental to Fuzhou's development and to attracting capital. This year, Fuzhou first will complete 100,000-kw of the large, 180,000-kilowatt power plant in Fuqing. Moreover, the Changle power plant will generate an additional 50,000 kw by the end of this year. In this way, power shortages in Fuzhou can be alleviated. Fuzhou's program-controlled telephones will have seven digits from March onward. This year, the city will have another 50,000 citywide phone call sets and 20,000 international telephone call sets, and will complete the main post and telecommunications building so as to ensure that Fuzhou leads in telecommunications. Xi Jinping also specifically stressed environmental protection. He said that Fuzhou will actively seek loans from foreign governments, the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank to strengthen environmental protection and development, and that the city will spend 100 million yuan building a 50,000-tonne sewage disposal plant and will construct a huge garbage site in Hongmiaoling. Xi said that is a "100-year plan." This series of important infrastructural projects will enable Fuzhou to eliminate traffic problems and power shortages, and to prepare for a new takeoff. Xi Jinping said, with a very resolute tone and full of confidence: "We have many difficulties regarding capital and the projects, but we will forge ahead in the face of the difficulties and do our work in earnest, and we absolutely will not sit and theorize, and thus lose the opportunity!"
