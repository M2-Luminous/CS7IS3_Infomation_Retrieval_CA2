He still "approves of and supports" Edouard Balladur and his government, which "are doing everything they can to correct the situation." What is more, he "does not regret" leaving Matignon [prime minister's office] to Edouard Balladur: "I needed some time to assess the situation, to keep myself at a distance from the daily events, to think about the major reforms which are needed today, and all that was not compatible with the constraints of government," he explained. Today, however, after the successful outcome of the GATT, after the UDF [Union for French Democracy] ministers urged their prime minister to run in the presidential elections, after the FINANCIAL TIMES consecrated Edouard Balladur as its "man of the year," Jacques Chirac must keep a distance -- even a minimum one -- from the government's policy if he wants even a small chance to be a credible candidate in the presidential elections; he also needs to put something else forward, "another political line," which will allow him to rally all those who believe that Balladur's reforms are not fast, nor strong enough. This is precisely what Jacques Chirac has been doing. "We are going through exceptional times when the French people understand that deep changes are necessary and accept them," he explains. Thus, "a real revolution of the mind must be initiated, major reforms must be undertaken and developed, and the peoples' reactions must be taken into account." And for all those naive people who believe that this is exactly what Edouard Balladur has started to do, Jacques Chirac makes himself quite clear: All of this will be done during the hectic months of the presidential campaign, which will be of a "high level and will make it possible to initiate the renewal of France." Another dispute between Chirac and Balladur is over the date when real change is going to take place. For Balladur, the new era started in March 1993 and will continue uninterrupted after the 1995 presidential elections. For Jacques Chirac, nothing will really start until then. Obsolete Measures The first thing that applies in this context is the employment policy. It is true that Jacques Chirac, committed by his support to the government, admits that the "Giraud law is a step in the right direction." He adds, however, that "it is not enough." "Ways of thinking must be changed, another policy is necessary, more money must be spent actively for [social] integration," he recommends. This reminds one of the ideas of Charles Millon [Republican Party] and Philippe Seguin [chairman of the National Assembly] on the transformation of the ANPE [National Employment Agency] and the ASSEDIC [expansion unknown] or also of the theories of Alain Madelin [minister of economic development] on the necessity for everyone to create their jobs. It can be said that the experts convened by Jacques Chirac are beginning to be productive. "At all events," says Jacques Chirac, "the old ways of fighting unemployment from a social point of view do not measure up to the current problems." Still, Mr. Chirac does not accuse Edouard Balladur, as others do, of being content with obsolete measures. Not yet. The prime minister understands by now that the Giraud law would be his weak point as a presidential candidate. This is probably why a further reduction of taxes on the lowest incomes is expected in the near future. But the employment problem is not the only source of opposition between the two men. Schools could well be another one soon, public schools in particular. Whereas Matignon will announce a plan to strengthen security in public schools "in the next few days," Jacques Chirac yesterday called for a "large plan to rehabilitate and modernize public schools."
