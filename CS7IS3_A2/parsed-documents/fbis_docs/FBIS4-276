Headed by British Deputy Inspector Keith Biddle, the officers will be deployed at joint operation centres throughout the country and will report directly to the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. "Our reports will be compiled from hard evidence and we will report fairly without fear or favour," Insp Biddle told a press conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday [5 April]. The head of the European Union election unit, Jacob de Ruiter, said he had received a request for police observers from IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler on March 22. "I am pleased to say the European Union has been able, at very short notice, to respond positively. Mr Biddle, who has the rank of a deputy police commissioner, has been joined by Chief Superintendent Herman ven de Berge, a senior colleague from The Netherlands. Most of the European officers will arrive in South Africa later this week. We sincerely hope this initiative will, in the words of Mr Justice Kriegler, materially contribute to the IEC's ability to work for a free and fair election," Mr de Ruiter said. Mr Biddle said the role of the European Union police contingent would be to advise the IEC on the formulation and implementation of plans to police the elections, to observe and monitor policing activity relevant to the election process and to report on this to the commission. "Our officers, after briefing, will be dispatched to all corners of South Africa. Our task is to monitor the way all police forces in South Africa carry out their duties. We want to see how they facilitate a free and fair election, prevent intimidation and how they conduct themselves," he said. "It should be stressed the officers will have no responsibility for operational matters nor any power to intervene in any policing activity." Mr Biddle will be assisted by 10 regional co-ordinators who will operate mostly from national and regional joint operation centres. The officers would be deployed in consultation with the South African Police, the South African Defence Force, the European Union election unit and the IEC. Mr Biddle said he was honoured to have been selected by the European Union and his own government to head the observer team. IEC Commissioner Charles Nupen said the security forces had an "awesome responsibility" to secure the elections. "The way they conduct themselves in the field and the confidence they build in the electorate is of critical importance to the success of the elections. Consequently the monitoring is very important. The observers should be deployed in areas where they are most needed to observe the conduct of police forces," Mr Nupen said.
