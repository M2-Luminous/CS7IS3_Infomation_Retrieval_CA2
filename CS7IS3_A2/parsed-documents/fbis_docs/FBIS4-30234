The items approved by the office of market access will be included in a deregulation plan to be announced next week in line with the market-access scheme unveiled by the government in March. The government will try to include specific deadlines for each item as much as possible, the officials said. The easing of procedures to obtain a license for motorcycles with displacement volumes of 400 cc or greater has been requested not only by domestic manufacturers but by U.S. companies as well. Friday's approval by the office came in response to an earlier submission of the 21 deregulatory proposals by the Market Access Ombudsman Council, led by Yoshio Okawara, a former ambassador to the United States and currently a Foreign Ministry adviser. The Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman, a system under the Economic Planning Agency, is composed of the Market Access Ombudsman Council and the decision-making Office of Market Access. Starting in fiscal 1996 that begins in April of that year, the license can be obtained at driving schools instead of having to go to offices of prefectural public safety commissions. Other deregulatory measures include easing rules on auto inspection and on specifications related to clothing.
