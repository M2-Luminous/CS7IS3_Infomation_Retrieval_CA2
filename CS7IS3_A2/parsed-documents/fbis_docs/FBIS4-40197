The workers and managerial personnel of the plant told Yeltsin about a variety of problems, the main of which is to find customers for the manufacture of fishing seiners. The president of russian and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin made entries in the visitors' book promising the shipbuilders to promote a solution to the problem. Shipbuilders told ITAR-TASS that they have not been receiving wages since February. Customers -- the fishery enterprises all over Far East, acutely need the plant's products but nevertheless are unable to pay for the completed seiners. This is why the plant managament sends workers on forced leaves. With the plant personnel numbering 1,300, the managament has already sent 1,000 shipbuilders on leave in June. As of now, the default of payment for completed and building ships amount to 8,000 million roubles. The defence and interior ministries owe about 1,500 million roubles to the plant. The president toured a small fishing seiner of the latest make and visited the shipbuilding shop. During a meeting with the management of the plant, Boris Yeltsin once again promised to give assistance in the search for customers for large fishing seiners and suggested making small boats, which farmers need, on direct, non-state orders.
