No contamination of the plant's territory, irradiation of the personnel, or discharges into the environment took place. There is no danger either for the population or for people working at the plant. It has been tentatively found that radioactive water entered the compressed-air pipeline from the fourth power unit due to the lack of tightness in one of the locking valves in the compressed-air line, which is used for processing the ion-exchange resins in filters of the special water-purification installation. Work on decontaminating the compressed-air pipeline has already been completed. Therefore, the incident was local in character and had no effect upon the plant's operation. A commission is investigating the causes of the accident.
