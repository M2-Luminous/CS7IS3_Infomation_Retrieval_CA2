In many cases, such dialogue achieved positive results. This is obviously a good omen. The messages from Beijing were inspiring. First, French Prime Minister Balladur's special envoy, Peyferitte, visited China; then China and France issued a joint communique on 12 January after consultations. The French Government reaffirmed that it only recognized the PRC Government as the sole legal government of China, and guaranteed that it would no longer approve any involvement by French enterprises in the sale of arms to Taiwan. This changed the unharmonious relationship between the two countries after France decided to sell fighters to Taiwan in late 1992. After that, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited Paris and met with French President Mitterrand and other French leaders. Both sides held that a new chapter had opened in the relationship between the two countries. Then, Jennifer Hillman, chief U.S. trade negotiator, visited Beijing, and the fourth round of bilateral textile trade talks was held. A memorandum of understanding was signed on 17 January, and this averted a trade war between the two countries. Immediately after that, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen visited China, and a joint statement was issued after a meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee announcing that the United States "supports a stable, prosperous, and modern China." This indicated that China and the United States had taken a major step to further develop their relations. Coordination between the Western countries and between the Western countries and the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union also achieved positive results. On 10 and 11 January, U.S. President Clinton attended the NATO summit meeting in Brussels. As a result of this coordination, NATO accepted a U.S.-proposed "peace partnership" scheme, and this mitigated the contradictions with Russia caused by the original plan to expand the scope of NATO to some East European countries. After that, Clinton visited Moscow. After the United States and Russia held consultations with Ukraine, on 14 January, the presidents of the three countries signed an agreement on dismantling nuclear weapons inside the territory of Ukraine. Thus, a major problem of the nuclear arsenal left over from the Cold War was solved. As for regional problems, President Clinton and Syrian President al-Asad held talks in Geneva in a harmonious atmosphere, and the talks brought about an opportunity to reopen the Israeli-Syrian talks. While the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement has encountered difficulties, PLO Chairman 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Peres held a meeting when attending the annual conference of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They discussed ways to settle differences between the two sides. Reportedly, the talks between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have "approached the conclusion of a final agreement." Some goodwill messages also came from the talks between the United States and the DPRK on the development of nuclear weapons in Korea. On 29 January, Billy Graham, a representative of American evangelical Christianity, met President Kim Il-sung in Pyongyang, and conveyed a message from President Clinton to President Kim. Graham and Kim Il-sung "held talks in a sincere and friendly atmosphere." This indicated the "determination to make efforts to establish a peaceful and friendly relationship between the two countries." Disputes continue to occur among various countries, and the world is full of contradictions. Using force and exercising pressure only intensifies the contradictions. Only dialogue on an equal footing will reduce trouble and turn danger into safety. It is hoped that the trend of coordination and dialogue shown in January 1994 will continue, and this will provide a bright future to the world.
