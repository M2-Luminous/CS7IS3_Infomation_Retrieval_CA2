He is waiting for the Atlantic Alliance to come up with precise membership criteria for countries like Poland instead of closing itself off in a "selfish and shortsighted strategy of every man for himself." [Urbanowicz] With the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" initiative, is the West sending you a signal of support strong enough to appease your fears and reaffirm your European aspirations? [Kolodziejczyk] "Partnership for Peace" can only meet our expectations if it opens up clear prospects for countries like Poland of belonging to the Atlantic Alliance. We understand that at present it is difficult for the West to put forward a precise date for our integration into the common security zone. However, we expect the NATO member countries to come up with clear criteria in the short term for NATO membership. These criteria could be compliance with the disarmament treaty, the UN Charter, the Charter of Human Rights and Citizen Rights, the obligation to have civilian control over the army, as well as transparency in military budgets. [Urbanowicz] How far is Poland prepared to go in terms of military cooperation with the NATO member countries as part of "Partnership for Peace"? [Kolodziejczyk] We are prepared to commit ourselves to a broad range of actions, including joint maneuvers. I recognize that this cooperation could cause certain financial problems for Poland, but the 1994 budget has not yet been passed by Parliament, and expenditure for the "Partnership" could be written into it. We have already established broad contacts with many countries in the alliance. Poland remains open to other initiatives in the area of European security, such as the Danish proposal for military cooperation between the countries along the Baltic Sea. [Urbanowicz] How did you receive the French-German proposal to offer Poland the status of "associate member" in the WEU (Western European Union), which is the embryo of the common security and defense policy of the European Union? [Kolodziejczyk] France is a great advocate of the WEU. It is obvious that the process of integrating the countries of Central and East Europe into the European Union must go hand in hand with a rapprochement with the WEU, which plays the role of NATO's European pillar. Because I know that the United States takes a dim view of this initiative, I am still a bit skeptical about the WEU. However, the fact remains that, for Poland, the most important thing is to get out of the gray area of security it has gotten into. I therefore feel that cooperation with the WEU can only benefit us. [Urbanowicz] How much time will it take for Poland to reach the level of the countries of the Atlantic Alliance? [Kolodziejczyk] For the moment, the West is mostly refusing to give us technological cooperation. Our own industry can produce limited quantities of good equipment, but not all of the parameters of this equipment match Western standards. Without technological openness by the NATO countries, these standards could prove to be inaccessible to Poland. I hope that the "Partnership" will make an initial breakthrough in this area, which is very important to us, especially now. [Urbanowicz] What does Poland fear? [Kolodziejczyk] For us, the areas of destabilization lie in eastern and southeastern Europe. The West does not seem to realize this, and it is therefore abandoning us. The West thinks that it no longer has anything to fear because the USSR has disappeared and because Russia is so wrapped up in its own problems. As for the countries in East Europe, they will have to get by on their own. This selfish "every man for himself" policy demonstrates shortsightedness. [Urbanowicz] Can the development of cooperation within the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia) become the key to opening the European Union's door to its members? [Kolodziejczyk] Not necessarily. It is above all a common platform from which the countries of Central Europe can speak with a single voice. The West is watching us do so with some caution and probably does not really think we can work effectively together within the four-member Visegrad Group. We want to prove otherwise.
