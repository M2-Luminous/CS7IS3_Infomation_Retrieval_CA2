Isahakian, governor of the Bank of Armenia; date and place not specified] [Excerpts] [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Mr Isahakian, could you first say a few words about the situation preceding the decision of the State Commission on Money Circulation and the organizational measures that the central bank undertook? [Isahakian] In earlier statements I mentioned a few times that, based on all classical examples and the experience of other nations, before putting a new national currency into circulation it is necessary to have an intermediate means of payment which will take upon itself the full weight of inflation. During that period, the government, the central bank and the entire public must take steps to prevent the decline of the economy and to stabilize it. Only after that can genuine monetary reform take place. However, in recent weeks events unfolded very rapidly, as the president of the republic noted with justification. We were forced to replace the 1991-1992 issue 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000-ruble notes with dram bills. Thus we were unable to implement the classical method--we could not have done it. I must say that we had only 1 to 1 and 1/2 weeks for organizational and preparatory work. During that time, the State Commission on Money Circulation and the working group associated with it performed important work. [passage omitted] [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Mr Isahakian, although the Commission's decision is quite clearly drafted, some issues need to be made more comprehensible to our people. For example, if a citizen buys something and pays 10 dram, should that be interpreted as 10 dram or 2,000 rubles? [Isahakian] It should be interpreted as 2,000 rubles. For example, if a citizen buys something that is worth 100 rubles and pays with a 10-dram bill, then the seller must return 1,900 rubles. Similarly 25 dram is equivalent to 5,000 rubles, 50 dram to 10,000 rubles, 100 dram to 20,000 rubles, 200 dram to 40,000 rubles and 500 dram to 100,000 rubles. [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Will not the concurrent circulation of 1, 3, 5, 25, 100, 200 and 500-ruble bills with the Armenian notes create a certain confusion? [Isahakian] Of course, there will be certain difficulties at the beginning. However, both the buyers and the sellers must be very careful. I think that they will get accustomed fairly quickly. This issue is also of immediate concern to the directors and accountants of enterprises and corporations. I must say that nothing has changed. If they had, say, 100,000 rubles on their books, that should be counted the same way as before. In the future, when we make a full transition to a national currency and introduce notes and coins with lower denominations and in luma [presumably a subdivision of dram], then all accounting can be done in terms of dram. For the moment, ruble notes in lower denominations will perform the function of the notes I mentioned. [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] This means that this is the first stage of a full transition to a national currency. [Isahakian] Yes, it is an intermediate stage. We will have entered the final stage when we introduce notes with lower denominations and coins. At this time we are embarking on a new era in the life of our republic. The government and the central bank must take all necessary steps to ensure the stability of our currency and to raise its exchange value. That is not dependent on the currency's name or looks. That depends on our economic base and productivity of our economy. We are all committed to strengthen the dram. That means encouraging exports, the production of goods that consumers demand and making imports manageable. It is also important that we cut the budget deficit by correct financial policies and that we build hard-currency reserves. Thus our financial situation and the stability of our currency depends on us. [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Here is another issue that needs to be explained to the people: according to the Commission's decision, sums of more than 50,000 rubles will be deposited in a savings bank for six months with an interest rate of 48 percent per annum. Based on the experience of past years, the people are a little worried. To what extent is the repayment of those funds guaranteed? Can the people be certain that they will not lose their money? [Isahakian] The people can rest assured that their deposits will be returned. I believe that the people trust the savings banks because the indexation of funds deposited in August has already inspired some confidence. Confidence in the savings banks increased especially among rural people who received their payment for their produce from the savings banks without any problems this year. If we could pay those sums in conditions of dependence on the Bank of Russia, we can be more certain making those payments on time now. [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Can the people use those deposits to pay, for example, for certain services in noncash form? [Isahakian] We are thinking about that issue. After 27 November, when we will know how much money was changed and how much money was deposited, those issues will be examined and somehow resolved. [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Now a technical question: Can those citizens of the republic who have not had the time to obtain an identity card or who have lost theirs exchange their rubles for dram? How about those who are away from the republic on business or who are away from their homes in hospitals or sanatoriums? [Isahakian] First, if a person does not have an identity card he or she cannot exchange his or her money. This does not apply to military servicemen. Those individuals who are outside the republic because of their work can apply to the appropriate exchange boards provided that they have the necessary documents. As for those citizens who are in hospitals or sanatoriums or away from their permanent homes in other parts of the republic, if they do not return to their permanent homes by the expiration of the deadline for exchanging their money, they can exchange their money by presenting their identity documents to the post office or savings bank at their location. The procedure is the same. The exchange is done only once and their identity documents are stamped as appropriate. [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Would you like to say anything else to the people? [Isahakian] Based on the experience of exchanging 50 and 100-ruble notes in 1991, I would like to ask the people to be very careful, to remember where they have kept their ruble notes--excuse the expression, under pillows or inside cracks in walls (although I do not think that in conditions of rapid devaluation anybody would have kept large sums)--so that complications do not arise in the future. I would also like to remind them that there will be only one exchange and one chance to open a deposit account.
