Indicating the importance of bilateral economic relations, Jeszenszky said Russia is currently Hungary's second most important trade partner, while Hungary is in 8th place among Russia's economic partners. The signing of new economic agreements, most probably this spring, is in the interest of both countries, they said. Kozyrev said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is preparing to visit Hungary. He and the Hungarian prime minister will sign the new agreements, including ones on investment protection and the elimination of double taxation. Discussions were also held on important issues involving Europe. Jeszenszky said European integration is of fundamental importance for Hungary, and the primary emphasis is not on becoming members in individual institutions. In other words, the first priority is not for Hungary to become a member of NATO. The Euro-Atlantic organizations are of equal importance for Hungary. However, Hungary calls for accelerating the CSCE process. The Balkan crisis was an important topic of discussion. They had no major differences in the evaluation of this, the foreign ministers said. Minority issues, which are of utmost importance from the point of view of Europe's future, were also discussed. Jeszenszky said the two countries follow common principles in this, as was expressed in the joint statement issued during the visit of President Yeltsin to Hungary in November 1992. As regards cultural relations, Jeszenszky said it is important for church dignitaries to also hold regular meetings. He noted that Russian Orthodox Patriarch Aleksey II will be visiting Budapest shortly. The Russian foreign minister said he hopes the new Russian Parliament will ratify the Hungarian-Russian basic agreement, including the paragraph condemning the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary. With respect to the CSCE summit to be held in Budapest at the end of the year, the foreign ministers said a genuinely effective mechanism for creation of peace and the protection of national minorities should be worked out, whether it be in the Baltic regions or elsewhere. In answer to questions on NATO's Peace Partnership plan, Jeszenszky said the existence of international forces that are capable of deterring anyone from aggression is an important element of the programme, in the spirit of conflict-preventive diplomacy. Kozyrev stated flatly that Moscow will not give in to nationalistic pressure. "We have no hegemonistic, aggressive efforts, we are ready for friendship," he said. The main point of Yeltsin's foreign policy is that Russia wants to create a "good-neighbour zone" with all countries with which it has historical, spiritual, human relations and economic interest connections, he said. Kozyrev added Russia is ready for cooperation in the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Peace Partnership. He said he will use his current tour to disperse the anxieties related to the Russian threat. In his view, a democratic Europe should unite against nationalism. With respect to the Bosnian crisis, Kozyrev said the most important point is to create an administrative control zone for the withdrawal and the cease-fire, and to somehow ensure conditions for peaceful life. Kozyrev mentioned Mostar and Tuzla being among new security zones. However, the long-term goal is to settle the Bosnian situation itself. In this process, Moscow particularly counts on the participation of the United States, the European Union and Germany, he stated.
