First, there is the economic recession and economic collapse. Given mutual support it will be possible to achieve the restoration of the old economic links and the establishment of new ones. Given mutual support and mutual solidarity and active help from the West it will be possible to make 1994 the beginning of economic recovery, the revival of all our economic life and on that basis an improvement in social conditions for each citizen of our countries. Second, I have in the past had occasion to say that after the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the Soviet Union aggressive and bellicose separatism would become the main threat to peace and stability in various parts of the globe. We have experienced for ourselves what separatism means. It means thousands of people killed and shot dead and hundreds thousands of refugees. It means genocide and ethnic cleansing in actual reality. It seems to me that in 1994 we shall be able to achieve a real breakthrough in the fight against this evil and establish peace and stability in our countries. Third, in recent years much has been said about the threat of approaching dictatorship and the revival of fascism. In Ashgabat it seemed to me that we have now realized the whole stern reality of the reconstruction of fascism, the spread of fascism. Once we have realized this I am confident that we shall beat fascism and beat this 20th Century plague. It seems to me that 1994 will be a crucial year in the fight against fascism. Success in these three areas will bring peace and prosperity to each family within our independent and free states. I wish you happiness and prosperity. Thank you.
