Informed Foreign Ministry sources said Jordan did not send an official delegation to the session because we are still awaiting Washington's decision on the Port of al-'Aqabah blockade, anticipated this week. Jordan, sources told AL-RA'Y, sent its ambassador in Rome Hasan Abu-Na'imah to the Hague meeting as an observer rather than participant.
