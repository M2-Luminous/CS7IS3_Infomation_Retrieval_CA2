FR940304-0-00088 FR940304-0-00019 State laws relating to the conservation of biological resources allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological resources (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(a)). The State also may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(c)). If listing were to occur, funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative Agreements). The Hawaii DLNR is mandated to initiate changes in conservation district boundaries to include ``the habitat of rare native species of flora and fauna within the conservation district'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5.1). State and Federal agencies have programs to locate, eradicate, and deter marijuana cultivation, which is a threat to one of the taxa in this rule (CPC 1990). Despite the existence of various State laws and regulations which give protection to Hawaii's native plants, their enforcement is difficult due to limited funding and personnel. These State laws and regulations are therefore inadequate to protect the taxa that occur on State land. Listing of these 21 plant taxa would reinforce and supplement the protection available under the State Act and other laws. The Federal Endangered Species Act would offer additional protection to these 21 taxa because, if they were to be listed as endangered or threatened, it would be a violation of the Act for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence The small numbers of populations and individuals of most of these taxa increase the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. This constitutes a major threat to 15 of the 21 taxa included in this rule (See Table 1). Five of the taxa, Cyanea copelandii ssp. copelandii, Cyanea shipmanii, Isodendrion pyrifolium, Ochrosia kilaueaensis, and Tetramolopium arenarium, are known from a single population. Seven other taxa are known from only two to five populations. Fourteen of the taxa are estimated to number no more than 100 known individuals. Five of these taxa, Clermontia peleana, Clermontia pyrularia, Cyanea copelandii ssp. copelandii, Ochrosia kilaueaensis, and Plantago hawaiensis, number no more than ten known individuals. One or more species of 12 introduced plants threaten 12 of the taxa in this rule. The original native flora of Hawaii consisted of about 1,000 species, 89 percent of which were endemic. Of the total native and naturalized Hawaiian flora of 1,817 species, 47 percent were introduced from other parts of the world and nearly 100 species have become pests (Smith 1985, Wagner et al. 1990). Naturalized, introduced species degrade the Hawaiian landscape and compete with native plants for space, light, water, and nutrients (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Some of these species were brought to Hawaii by various groups of people, including the Polynesian immigrants, for food or cultural reasons. Plantation owners, alarmed at the reduction of water resources for their crops caused by the destruction of native forest cover by grazing feral animals, supported the introduction of alien tree species for reforestation. Ranchers intentionally introduced pasture grasses and other species for agriculture, and sometimes they inadvertently introduced weed seeds as well. Other plants were brought to Hawaii for their potential horticultural value (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wenkam 1969). Lantana camara (lantana), brought to Hawaii as an ornamental plant, is an aggressive, thicket-forming shrub which can now be found on all of the main islands in mesic forests, dry shrublands, and other dry, disturbed habitats (Wagner et al. 1990). One or more populations of each of the following taxa are threatened by lantana: Colubrina oppositifolia, Nothocestrum breviflorum, and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense (HHP 1991e4, 1991e8, 1991e15, 1991e16, 1991p4, 1991p12, 1991x11, HPCC 1991b, 1991h). Leucaena leucocephala (koa haole), a naturalized shrub which is sometimes the dominant species in low elevation, dry, disturbed areas on all of the main Hawaiian islands, threatens Nothocestrum breviflorum (Geesnick et al. 1990, HHP 1991p12, HPCC 1991h). Melia azedarach (Chinaberry), a small tree widely cultivated and naturalized on most of the main Hawaiian Islands, threatens Zanthoxylum hawaiiense on Kauai (HHP 1991x11, Wagner et al. 1990). Passiflora mollissima (banana poka), a woody vine, poses a serious problem to mesic forests on Kauai and Hawaii by covering trees, reducing the amount of light which reaches trees as well as understory, and causing damage and death to trees by the weight of the vines. Animals, especially feral pigs, eat the fruit and distribute the seeds (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Escobar 1990). Banana poka threatens Clermontia lindseyana, Clermontia pyrularia, and Cyanea hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii (HHP 1991a3, 1991y, HPCC 1991c1 to 1991c3). After escaping from cultivation, Schinus terebinthifolius (Christmas berry) became naturalized on most of the main Hawaiian Islands (Wagner et al. 1990). It threatens Colubrina oppositifolia, Mariscus fauriei, and Nothocestrum breviflorum (HHP 1991e8, 1991e15, 1991e16, 1991o8, 1991p12, HPCC 1991b, 1991g).
