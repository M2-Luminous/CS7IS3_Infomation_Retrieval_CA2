Pawlak said the appointment of a finance minister would be discussed by the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL). The prime minister said he was not planning to make any personnel changes in the Ministry of Privatization as recently "it considerably changed its style of work" and "the changes in its leadership were very profound." Asked about appointments of coalition deputy ministers in the so-called presidential ministries, Pawlak said: "We are not priding ourselves on certain matters but there are some achievements." He also suggested that newsmen should concentrate on the functioning of these institutions and not on symbols. Pawlak said that in case of possible amendments to the budget law in mid-1994, if incomes were bigger than planned, he would spend the money to animate the economy and on significant social goals, namely, social assistance and combatting unemployment. When told that the decisions of the Sejm Budget Committee adopted on Wednesday were contradictory to his announcements of the "pro-social budget," Pawlak stressed that press reports on the cabinet amendments were incomplete. He also recalled that education, science and culture were planned to receive the biggest possible means. The prime minister also added that if it were not for the internal indebtedness, the state budget would be balanced. While speaking about a Polish visit by the mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pawlak stressed that Poland fulfilled the conditions included in the agreement. He also added that the success did not depend on such agreements but "on the way we control social and economic processes in Poland."
