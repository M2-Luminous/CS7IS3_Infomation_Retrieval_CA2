In a statement, the House said that it views the killing of innocent people and attacks on places of worship as criminal acts that are a disgrace to human civilization. These acts also violate all international norms, laws, and legitimacy, the statement noted. At the same time, the House emphasized that this criminal incident indicates that the tampering and criminal hands do not want fraternal Lebanon to restore its well-being and stability, the statement said. Just as in the case of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, these hands wanted Lebanon to be an arena for destruction and bloodshed. This confirms that the sinful hands, which committed the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, were the same hands that targeted the lives of innocent people at the Sayyidat al-Najah church, and that they only carried out this act to overshadow the massacre they committed in Hebron, the statement noted. Greetings to the Lebanese Government and people, and may God preserve Lebanon as an oasis of security and safety and as a supporter of its Arab nation, the statement added.
