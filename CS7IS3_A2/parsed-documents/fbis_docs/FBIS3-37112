The Azerbaijani leader said that "some states and groups" render a material and moral support to Armenia. "This makes the fight to liberate our territory tougher," Aliyev stressed. "Azerbaijan seeks to resolve the problem by peaceful means, but Armenia wants to resolve it by force and bring Azerbaijan to the knees," the Azerbaijani president noted. Azerbaijan did not request Turkey to render military assistance. The two sides agreed about "supplies of wheat and granting of credits, as well as capital investments in the economy of Azerbaijan," Aliyev emphasised said. The Azerbaijani leader noted that Azerbaijan itself will resolve military questions, but would like to "take advantage of prestigious military academies in Turkey to train experienced officers for the Azeri Army." The president said that his visit to Turkey was "very useful" from the point of view of the development of "friendly and fraternal relations" with the Turkish Republic. Geydar Aliyev is expected to leave Turkey on Friday.
