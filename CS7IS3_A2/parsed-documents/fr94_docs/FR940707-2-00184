FR940707-2-00184 FR940707-2-00099 [Release No. 34&hyph;34277; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Granting Temporary Approval and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 8 of Proposed Rule Change Creating a Short Sale Bid-Test for Nasdaq National Market Securities June 29, 1994. I. Introduction On July 22, 1992, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. 2 The rule change creates, on a temporary basis for eighteen months, a short sale rule or ``bid-test'' for Nasdaq Stock Market (``Nasdaq'') National Market Securities 3 that will prohibit short sales at or below the current inside bid as shown on the Nasdaq screen when that bid is lower than the previous inside bid. The rule provides certain exemptions, including an exemption for qualified Nasdaq market makers, options market makers, and warrant market makers. The rule also provides exemptions similar to those provided under the Commission's short sale rule, Rule 10a&hyph;1. 4 Further, the NASD has submitted three interpretations regarding ``bona fide'' market making activity, the prices at which ``legal'' short sales may be effected, and examples of conduct that will be deemed to be in violation of the rule; these interpretations are part of the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1994). 3 Nasdaq includes both Nasdaq SmallCap Market and Nasdaq National Market securities. In July 1993, the NASD began referring to Nasdaq National Market System or Nasdaq NMS securities as Nasdaq National Market securities. 4 17 CFR 240.10a&hyph;1. Notice of the proposed rule change and subsequent amendments appeared in the Federal Register . 5 The Commission received 397 comments in response to the release, 122 in support and 275 in opposition. 6 In addition to amending the proposal several times, the NASD responded to issues raised by the commenters in a letter dated June 24, 1993. 7 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposal, effective September 6, 1994, on a temporary basis through March 5, 1996. 5 The NASD amended the proposed rule change eight times since it was originally filed with the Commission on April 9, 1992. The first two amendments were included in the Commission's original notice. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31003 (Aug. 6, 1992), 57 FR 36421 (Aug. 13, 1992). The NASD submitted Amendment No. 3 on December 23, 1992, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31729 (Jan. 13, 1993), 58 FR 5791 (Jan. 22, 1993), Amendment No. 4 on November 19, 1993, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33289 (Dec. 3, 1993), 58 FR 64994 (Dec. 10, 1993), Amendment No. 5 on January 14, 1994, Amendment No. 6 on March 8, 1994, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33758 (Mar. 11, 1994), 59 FR 13016 (Mar. 18, 1994) (Amendment No. 6 replaced Amendment No. 5, which was not published for comment), and Amendment No. 7 on May 16, 1994, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34092 (May 20, 1994), 59 FR 27634 (May 27, 1994). On June 29, 1994, the NASD submitted Amendment No. 8 requesting approval of the rule on a temporary basis for eighteen months beyond the effective date of the rule and amending Interpretation C to clarify that moving a bid up or down and then moving it back to the original bid simply to create an up bid or down bid to facilitate or preclude short selling will be considered a manipulative act and a violation of the rule. 6 A list of comment letters received in connection with the publication of the rule change is available for inspection in the Commission's Public Reference Room. 7 Letter from Richard Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, NASD, to Jonathan G. Katz, Security, SEC (June 24, 1993). II. Description of the Rule A. Background The opportunity for short selling can add to market liquidity and pricing efficiency, while at the same time can raise general anti-manipulation concerns. Currently, neither the Commission nor the NASD imposes any general restriction on short selling of OTC securities. This contrasts with short sale restrictions on exchange-listed securities that have been in place since 1938. In general, the Commission's short sale rule, Rule 10a&hyph;1, provides that short sales of securities may be effected only at a price above the price at which the immediately preceding sale was effected (``plus-tick'') or at a price equal to the last sale if the last preceding transaction at a different price was at a lower price (``zero-plus-tick''). The NASD proposes to add two sections to Article III of the Rules of Fair Practice establishing a short sale rule based on a ``bid-test'' for Nasdaq National Market securities. 8 The first section will prohibit members from effecting short sales at or below the bid for themselves or their customers when the current inside or best bid is below the previous bid, unless one of the exemptions applies. The second section provides a definition of ``primary Nasdaq market maker'' which, beginning one year after the effective date of the rule, sets forth the criteria a market maker must satisfy to be exempt from the rule. In addition, the NASD submitted three interpretations setting forth: (a) what will constitute ``bona fide market making activity;'' (b) the prices at which ``legal'' short sales may be effected; and (c) situations that will be deemed to be indirect violations of the rule. 8 The rule will be in effect during normal, domestic market hours (9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern Time).
