Father Felini MacAlister, Robert Elco, a doctor, his wife Karena and their daughter Zita were caught by automatic gunfire Saturday during an attack by United Revolutionary Front (RUF) rebels near the hospital at Panguma, 240 kilometres (145 miles) east of here, it said. They had been trying to escape the attack in three vehicles along with five other colleagues. One of the others, New Zealand doctor Ann Greeling, was captured by RUF forces but was freed unharmed by government forces, according to the statement. The two others, Irish nun Madeline Naughton and her Nigerian colleague Jestina Igwu, escaped unscathed as did Americans Mary Tippet and Arthur Gordon. Last August, two nurses from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were killed and a third wounded in the Pujehun region, 210 kilometres (125 miles) southeast of Freetown during an attack attributed to the RUF. The rebellion, which started in May 1991, has increased in intensity since December in the east near the Liberian border and in the south along the Atlantic coast.
