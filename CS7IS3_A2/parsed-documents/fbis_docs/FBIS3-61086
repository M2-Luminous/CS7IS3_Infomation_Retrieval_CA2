Secondly, let us talk about a serious matter: the smuggling of strategic raw materials and rare earth metals out of the former USSR. And here is why: if Mariya Devi Khristov has prophesied the end of the world correctly (24 November, or according to posters in Moscow October -- mark it down on you calendar), then the buyers of nuclear weapons components will only warn a "close circle of restricted individuals" about it... Spherical Thieves Journalists have gotten in the habit of saying that when the organized crime members shoot it out with each other they are dividing up spheres of influence. When you ask militiamen about the structures of these groups, the answer you get is that that all depends on spheres of influence. What sort of spheres are these? It is hard to describe them precisely, the militia explains, because the term includes both the areas in which the gangs operate, various operations by commercial structures which serve as fronts, and the high-paying crime business in which the bandits themselves engage. According to Ministry of Internal Affairs representatives, the oldest (i.e. most well-established) and profitable of those types of business are antique smuggling and the drug trade. A new business in existence since about 1988 involves the smuggling of strategic raw materials and rare earth metals. A press briefing on this topic was given by the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration last Wednesday. First journalists heard Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics: the number of cases of theft and smuggling of strategic raw materials increased by a factor of two in 1993 compared to the previous year. The briefing organizers' explanation for this phenomenon was twofold: firstly, the raw materials are now freely available for sale and, secondly, there is inflation, which is forcing citizens to carry off magnesium from plants in sacks or in convenient hiding places in their clothing. This situation leads one to the conclusion that if ordinary workers are carting off our country's defensive wealth, then they must have gotten their example from someone in management. As noted at the briefing, the administrators of enterprises often conspire with commercial structures. The administration writes off materials as waste, after which businessmen export that "waste" to other countries. And not to very distant countries either -- the Baltic countries, for example. Also alarming is the fact that, according to KOMMERSANT's information, for the past three years Moscow has not been the focus of attention by law enforcement organs as a center of strategic raw material smuggling. But now comes this briefing... How It All Began In the mid-1980's, almost immediately after the beginning of perestroyka, uranium, plutonium and other materials of interest to those wanting to build nuclear weapons began to be quietly shipped out of the USSR. In the early 1990's I was invited to meet with a secretary of the South Korean Embassy, who spent a long time telling me about the possible effects of a nuclear strike by North Korea on the people of his country. According to that individual's figures, North Korea had four secret plants working to manufacture nuclear weapons using components stolen from the USSR. Let us go back in history a bit. In 1991 two kilograms of red mercury were seized in Milan. According to some sources this is used in missile and torpedo guidance systems. A short while later the KGB (as that agency was then called) officially informed the world public that the red mercury did not exist. One month ago foreign television showed foreign scientists analyzing that very same mercury and finding it ready for use. Somewhat later came Rutskoy's scandalous report that bureaucrats were dealing in red mercury. The most interesting thing is that some people (capitalists and communists) are saying that it does not exist, while others (communists and capitalists) are saying that it does. We will only get to the truth in this debate when it is used... But the problem is not mercury, the problem is that uranium, plutonium, tellurium and other materials are being taken out of the country. According to KOMMERSANT's figures, the sources of those materials are secret state-run enterprises and USSR Ministry of Defense bases that have now become bases belonging to other countries' ministries of defense. With the complicity of certain military officers, nuclear components are flowing out of areas where military units are based. As a rule, the items most interesting from a theft standpoint are the nuclear weapons which are slated for destruction (under an agreement between Yeltsin and Clinton). According to reports from KOMMERSANT informants, reactor fuel is the most commonly stolen item. Usually anything radioactive is shipped out by train in the same cars that carry industrial wastes. In the same train or following it there travels an observer, who is termed a "middleman" in organized crime language. From the moment the material is loaded to the moment it crosses the border of the former USSR this "middleman" stays with it, and if the goods get through all right he receives 0.5 percent of the final payment for the exported items (by way of example, according to one source's figures one kilogram of red mercury costs between $200,000 and $300,000 at its destination). Whereas previously this was all done by structures close to the KGB or similar agencies, now this kind of business is being handled by organized crime groups that have gained access to the trade on account of their money, connections and sales market. And so it began... Stabbed Aleksandr Svechinskiy, director of the Karaganda Metallurgical Combine, was killed in Temirtau by a bullet in the back of the neck. According to some sources, Svechinskiy had opened up a channel for under-the-table shipments of iron from Kazakhstan to accomplices in the Baltic countries. According to the official version of the investigation, this version does not exist. According to the unofficial version, 10 days later Kazakhstan karate champion Sergey Shmakov, who had allegedly covered for the metal shipments to the Baltic countries, got stabbed (coincidentally). That's the way it goes... Sergey Shmakov, the holder of a 3rd-degree black belt in karate (in 1990 a student of his became champion of the USSR), died at 3:35 am on 8 January, bleeding to death from a deep knife wound to the abdomen. His killers have not been caught. Unofficial sources say that in 1991 Shmakov had started combining his professional sports activities with business. In 1991 he tried to do joint projects with the director of the metallurgical combine, among other things by shipping the enterprise's products to Lithuania. According to one version, Shmakov must have been killed by outsiders, because he was widely respected by the locals. Approximate Diagram of the Current Flow of Strategic and Radioactive Materials
