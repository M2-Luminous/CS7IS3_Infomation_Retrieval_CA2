The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace, controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL at Fayettee Regional Air Center, La Grange, TX. The development of a Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR)/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) SIAP has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the VOR/DME SIAP at Fayette Regional Air Center, La Grange, TX. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designated Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
