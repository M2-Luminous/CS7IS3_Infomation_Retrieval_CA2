[Samper] Thank you. I am very pleased with this victory and for the opportunity to offer to Colombians, as I said today, a government of cohesion and social commitment. [Reporter] You said there were similarities with Andres Pastrana's campaign concerning peace, social justice, and progress. Does that mean you could call some of Pastrana's followers to work with you in those three fields? [Samper] I believe all Colombians coincide in those fields. All possibilities of cooperation are welcome as long as we can agree. [Reporter] I know you asked me to be brief, but Dario Arizmendi wants to greet you from our studios. [Arizmendi] Congratulations, and greetings to Ernesto Samper Pizano; we sincerely say this, because we know how he carried out his campaign, the difficulties he had to overcome. We wish him success, because his success will also be Colombia's. [Samper] Thank you, Dario, for your message. I also reiterate my gratitude to Caracol and other networks for the wide coverage they gave my campaign. That was the best contribution they could give to democracy. [Arizmendi] Thank you, President-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano. This was the president-elect's first interview in Colombia. [Reporter] I would like to ask the president-elect when he plans to accompany the soccer team representing Colombia at the World Cup to the United States. [Samper] We will see. I will begin the transition process tomorrow, and I hope to have the opportunity this same week. I tried to call Maturana and El Pibe today to dedicate to them this victory, which somewhat compensates the setback we had last night. I want to tell them I hope this victory will encourage them, so that on 22 June they can give all Colombians the good news on the World Cup. [Arizmendi] Will you be there on 22 or 26 June? [Samper] I do not have travel plans yet. I believe I may decide tomorrow. [Arizmendi] When will you announce your cabinet, on 7 August or before? [Samper] We will see. For now, I will sit down to prepare a transition plan to guarantee continuity. I already had the opportunity to talk with President Gaviria twice this afternoon. I hope we can meet again this week to continue working in that direction. [Arizmendi] Did you talk with Andres Pastrana by telephone? [Samper] No. I have not had the opportunity to greet him. [Arizmendi] Did you hear his speech conceding defeat and recognizing your victory? [Samper] Yes, Dario, I did hear it. [Arizmendi] What are your comments about Pastrana's speech? [Samper] I believe Pastrana has created a very important political opening, because 3.5 million votes are a very interesting figure that reflects the support he received. I am sure he will use that opening to benefit the activities he proposed during his campaign; to that effect, he can also count on my support. [Arizmendi] What does that support mean? A representation in your cabinet, if he agrees, as you mentioned in your speech? [Samper] Yes. The decision on cooperation will depend on the position Pastrana adopts. [Arizmendi] Pastrana said he also offered his cooperation to Colombia, in other words, to your government and that he recognized your victory. Will you then directly invite Pastrana's friends and representatives? [Samper] We will sit down and decide this later on. Right now we are celebrating our victory, but tomorrow we will begin our political contacts. [Arizmendi] What was your most difficult moment today? Were you confident of your victory, or did you have any doubts? [Samper] I remained calm at all times. I learned this week I had good opportunities to win, something that did, in fact, occur. [Arizmendi] Did you learn about the results of the exit poll conducted by the Caracol Network and the National Consultative Center? [Samper] Yes I did, and I understand the figures are very similar to the ones released by the National Registrar. [Arizmendi] What will be the first thing the president-elect will do tomorrow after this historic night? [Samper] I will sit down to talk with my working teams tomorrow. I have some commitments with the international media. I will give them as many interviews as possible, because I believe we must take advantage of this opportunity to let others know more about our country and the plans of the next government. [Arizmendi] To whom do you dedicate your victory? [Samper] To Colombian democracy and all Colombians, for whom I have struggled all my life. [Arizmendi] You won by a wide margin in Santa Fe de Bogota and practically in all the departments along the Atlantic Coast. Will they benefit the most from your victory? [Samper] No. I am not going to discriminate. I will govern for all regions and for all Colombians.
