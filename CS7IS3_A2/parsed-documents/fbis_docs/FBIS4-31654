Skerlev: "Macedonia Insists on a Package Solution"] [Text] Yesterday, the special envoy of the U.S. President and mediator in the Macedonian-Greek dispute, Mr. Matthew Niemitz, held talks with the President of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kiro Gligorov after holding discussions with Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski in Ohrid. On this occasion they exchanged opinions about the current stage of the Macedonian-Greek negotiations and the possibility of resuming the dialogue on disputed questions. This time, too, the Republic of Macedonia's stance was reiterated on the need for an urgent lifting of the unilateral embargo and for all the questions to be solved as a package. President Gligorov made a special review of the difficulties suffered by Macedonia because of the Greek embargo and the real danger that it represents for a greater destabilization of the republic and the whole region. He also expressed his belief that in the next round of negotiations with the mediators from New York there will be greater likelihood for solving this situation, which has already become a clear element of threat to the stability in the south. During the discussions there was also an exchange of opinions about the further development of relations between the United States and the Republic of Macedonia. On what was referred to as "an exchange of opinions about the current views of Macedonia and Greece in relation to the solution of mutual problems," Minister Crvenkovski and Mr. Niemitz made short statements to journalists. "Yesterday we had long and extensive discussions in smaller delegations, and today we had discussions with the president of the republic," Minister Crvenkovski said. "We discussed all the aspects of the situation here and particularly the damage caused to Macedonia by the embargo, as well as the whole situation in the region. We discussed a number of other questions of importance for the whole region and we hope that we shall soon have another opportunity to meet and continue these discussions, and that we shall also have continual meetings with Mr. Cyrus Vance." In his statement to the journalists, among whom, as usual, there were a large number from the Greek media, Mr. Niemitz said that it was his great honor to be here again and to have two days of discussions about these issues. "As you know, we had serious discussions in New York. Cyrus Vance and I talked with Minister Crvenkovski there, but we thought it was a good idea to come and hold discussions here. There is no special reason for this, or any special message, just fruitful discussions." After that Mr. Niemitz stated that he was ready to answer some journalists' questions. The first was whether he had nothing more to say after his few days of discussions in Greece and Macedonia. "I will just say," Niemitz said, "that we have all agreed not to talk or discuss the contents of the meetings. I know that this is frustrating for you journalists, but it is a fact that it is a far better way for comprehending some of the subjects. There is nothing for publication, there are no breakthroughs or changes of policy or ideas, but I think, in my personal view, that there is a better understanding and viewing of the situation and the position of both sides, so, from my point of view, it was a good idea for me to come here and have this useful series of meetings." Asked whether there existed opportunities for a direct dialogue between the two countries, Niemitz said that this was something to be discussed between the two countries, but that he had not discussed this. The task that was assigned to him by the President of his country was to talk with both sides in order to clarify the concepts, and thus to examine and explain the other positions. If the two countries wanted to talk with each another, that would be something that they would have to agree upon. "There are some aspects of the relations between the two countries that were reconsidered with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus Vance, which is a normal and acceptable method, and I would like to say that the leaderships of the two countries are approaching the problems with seriousness. And that is how most of the problems can be solved." The next question was whether there had been any progress in the discussions. Niemitz replied that he was not going to talk about what had been discussed and the word "progress" for this kind of discussion was irrelevant. "I talked with both sides," he said, "about their positions, and that is all I can say for now." As we heard, Mr. Niemitz is leaving Macedonia today. Whether intentionally or unintentionally there have not been scheduled new consultations in Athens, so he is leaving for New York, where, as we know, Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski and his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias will go next week for indirect discussions with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus Vance, the special envoy of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.
