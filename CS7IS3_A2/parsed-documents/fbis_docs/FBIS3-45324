The central authorities have thus decided to resolve problems occurring with rapid development in two to three years. The source quoted a top leader saying that the economic macrocontrol measures adopted in 1993 had not thoroughly resolved the problems brought about by high-speed economic growth since 1992. Because a "hard landing" [ying zhuo lu 4289 4192 7120] was effected in 1993, this led to serious ups and downs in the economy and caused certain shocks to society. Therefore, those measures for intensifying economic macrocontrol in 1993 could only be effective to a limited degree. That is, they succeeded in curbing the rising inflation rate and restraining the scale of capital construction as banks were prevented from offering large amounts of capital in the market. The leader said that according to estimates, the scale of construction in progress throughout the country is three times that of 1991. In order to complete all the construction projects that have been started, it is not enough to just issue more currency. The increase in the money supply will just result in a substantial increase in prices. Therefore, it is necessary to effect an economic "soft landing" in 1994. The money supply and the scale of capital construction must not be increased substantially. Otherwise, the authorities will be forced to effect another round of "hard landing" and to exercise strict control by mandatory administrative means. It is hard to imagine what changes would then be brought about in society. For example, steel and cement prices are still increasing at present. In 1993, when macrocontrol was being exercised, steel prices were lowered somewhat, but are now increasing again. The price of cement has never been lowered. In such circumstances, it is impossible to enlarge the size of capital construction any further. He finally emphasized that the central authorities attach great importance to reforms in 1994. If the reforms do not go smoothly, China will lose an important historical opportunity, and it will be hard to find another similar opportunity in the future. At present, China is facing a very good domestic and international situation. Therefore, the 1994 reforms must succeed, thus fundamentally guaranteeing the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the national economy. If the reforms do not succeed, the size of capital construction continues to grow, and prices continue to increase, social unrest may occur and China may lose the opportunity.
