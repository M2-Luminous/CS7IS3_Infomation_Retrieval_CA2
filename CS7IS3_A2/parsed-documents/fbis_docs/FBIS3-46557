The message reads: To dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the sagacious leader [yongmyonghan chidoja] of the nation: Under the brilliant sun of guidance, an age-shaking year of excitement ended and the hopeful new year 1994 has broken. On this breaking morning of the new year, the SKNDF Central Committee respectfully sends the first greeting of longevity to Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the sagacious leader of the nation, the great leader [yongsu] of the chuche cause, and a talented military strategist whom the fellow countrymen and all human beings admire, with the consistent wishes of hearty congratulations by all the vanguard fighters and masses of various strata in the South. The past year of 1993 was a meaningful year when the sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was elected chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission and when the 40th anniversary of the 27 July war victory was brilliantly decorated with a grand festival of victors. It was also an honorable year when the world was shocked by mankind's admiration and epochal hymns for the immortal achievements registered by the dear leader in 1993. With his insightful and farseeing wisdom, the sagacious comrade leader, an outstanding leader [yongsu], presented the chuche Korea's policy to overcome piled difficulties and trials. He also consolidated the entire party, all the people, and the entire Army as a pure social and political living body filled with loyalty and filial piety, thus demonstrating the invincibility of the masses-oriented, unique socialism. The sagacious comrade leader, an outstanding military genius, defeated and smashed the enemy's isolating, suffocating, and crushing maneuver [chokturui korip chilsik apsal chaektongul kyokpa punswaehasigo] and registered the outstanding feat of brilliantly protecting the national dignity and the country's interests by using his peerless talented wisdom, matchless braveness, and iron-strong will last year when the strong anti-Republic and antisocialist wind created by the allied imperialist forces blew unprecedentedly harshly. The more unscrupulous was the revilement of the imperialists and their puppets, who had been pushed into a pitfall of successive defeats, the more the northern half of the fatherland increased the speed of the general onward march of socialism of our own style, upholding the banner of self-relience and fortitude, thus victoriously accomplishing the Third Seven-Year Plan. The North's farmlands, where the chuche farming method advanced, won a victory of achieving bumper crops. All this was possible thanks to the sagacious comrade leader and his seasoned leadership. At the end of last year, when the North's nuclear issue was mentioned again in Washington and Seoul was frantically attempting to crushing fellow countrymen while adhering to the international cooperation system, Pyongyang, unlike Seoul, presented revolutionary economic strategies based on the result of summing up the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year Plan and discussed and decided upon the issue of correctly inheriting the nation's cultural legacies, which had been presented as an important state affair, thus striking the people of the world with admiration. From the very composed and peace-oriented attitude of the northern half of the fatherland, we could see an overwhelming victory of the denuclearization policy over the U.S. nuclear war policy [haekchonjaeng chongchaek] as well as the infinite vigor of the chuche economic and cultural policies, and could realize again the valuable truth that the masses under the seasoned leadership of the outstanding leader can vigorously advance toward the prosperous future no matter how harsh are the trials they are repeatedly faced with. The sagacious comrade leader, who is pioneering mankind's cause of independence at the forefront while stoutly grasping the rudder of the times, struck a deadly blow to the imperialists and betrayers of socialism who try to void and distort the true superiority of socialism and enabled the masses who are making efforts to rehabilitate socialism to have firm faith and will, thus making a great contribution to the development of the socialist movement. History tells numerous legends about heroes, however we have not witnessed a leader like our sagacious leader who is an unequalled iron-willed brilliant commander and excelled politician. He has both literary and military accomplishments that are not shared by any leader of all times and places, has embroidered the history of the nation and mankind with his legendary strategies and has blocked raging storms with his own body during the period of most stern trials. The sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great incarnation of the chuche politics and peerless great commander who has turned an unprecedented steep path and trials into favorable conditions overflowing with optimism, thus creating new history by turning a misfortune into a blessing. Under the wise and tested leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, the sagacious leader of the nation, a remarkable progress was made in the movement to reunify the fatherland in the last year. The sagacious comrade leader opened a broad alliance road for the people wandering about in a quagmire of confrontation and mistrust by administering politics of love and trust and broad-based politics which embody the idea of believing in the people as in heaven, and aroused 70 million countrymen in the North, South, and overseas into the plaza of great unity and national reconciliation under the great banner of the 10-point program of the great national unity for the reunification of the fatherland. Even though aggressors and traitorous cliques viciously staged anti-peace, antireunification maneuvers in the last year, our masses advanced along the road for independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland by kicking out brutal suppression of the fascists and girding up themselves with hope and grit against disappointment and frustration because the sagacious comrade leader, who supports the whole nation's immortal will and aspiration for the end of the tragedy of the fatherland division and the establishment of a confederal state in the nineties', stands firm at the head of our nation. We are convinced of a brilliant tomorrow since we have the sagacious comrade leader as the nation's leading spirit [yongsu]. Thus, our SKNDF and other patriotic masses kindled the flame of anti-U.S.and antifascist patriotic struggle by firmly holding the chuche sword without the slightest vacillation despite the development of a grave situation in which the military dictatorship turned into civilian fascism, strangled democracy, and maximized pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese subordination and North-South confrontation. The struggle by peasants and masses of various strata opposing the rice market opening that erupted from various parts of Pyongyang [as heard] liquidated the traitorous cliques and completely unveiled the cloak of the civilian regime worn by the current regime as the struggle developed into a nationwide movement opposing the U.S. imperialists' shameless acts of looting. As a result, the colonial fascist rule now faces a serious crisis. Our masses, under the banner of the chuche idea, acquired deep in their hearts precious experiences during the stern course of struggle waged in the last year that, without fundamentally reforming the colonial domination system, the disgrace and misfortune of subordination and national division can never be eliminated. In the new year, we, upholding the banner of the chuche idea, will accelerate the work to make the masses have consciousness and to organize them, and will firmly guarantee the uniformity of the leadership and idea among SKNDF ranks so that they would be firmly prepared as the main forces of reform. We will ignite the flame of struggle against the current fascist regime and wage successive patriotic struggles to make the masses have consciousness, become independent, have democracy, and realize the 10-point program for the great national unity. At this meaningful moment of ushering in the first morning of the new year, the SKNDF Central Committee respectfully wishes Comrade Kim Chong-il, the lodestar of the fatherland's reunification and benefactor of the nation's destiny, long life with the unanimous expression of wishes by all the vanguard fighters and patriotic masses of various classes and strata. [Signed] The SKNDF Central Committee [Issued] 1 January 1994, Seoul
