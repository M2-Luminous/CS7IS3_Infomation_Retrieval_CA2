[Qaddumi] Welcome. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can you give us an idea about the Palestinian action following the dreadful massacre committed against the sons of the Palestinian people? [Qaddumi] The horrendous crime committed by the Israelis in collusion with the army is a sign of disgrace in the history of these racist powers. We have taken measures to provide the necessary protection to our people by referring the issue to the UN Security Council, the highest international authority, to take the required steps to send international troops. We are pressing in the direction of the United States, because it can put pressure on Israel to disarm those settlers who tamper with peace and security and effect an early withdrawal. There are settlements that Rabin calls political settlements. Why don't they dismantle these settlements? Why are there no deterrent measures against the perpetrators? Regrettably, the first responsibility falls on Rabin and the Israeli Government, which failed to take any measures to stop such acts in the past. We drew attention to these acts repeatedly; we warned Israel and the United States, as a sponsor of the peace conference. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You demand the disarming of settlers to guarantee the safety and security of the Palestinian citizen. Do you believe that this is sufficient, particularly as the army's collusion with the settlers has been established, as you said? [Qaddumi] It is not sufficient. But to start with, we expect a swift withdrawal, as they promised. We expected it, as stipulated, on 13 December. Unfortunately, they failed to do that. I was certain in opposing that agreement that they would not withdraw. They were stalling for time to tell the world that security is unstable and that incidents would happen when they withdrew, leaving the security task to the Palestinians. By prolonging the period, the Israelis want to justify to the world the killing and terrorism they have exercised against our people. They killed national symbols. They have committed the biggest ever crime--the major holocaust [last word in English] at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. We will struggle. Our Arab brothers and our friends are standing by us against this dreadful crime. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You pointed out that settlements must be eliminated. They have become time bombs. You demanded that they be dismantled. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that settlements will stay, that you agreed to this, and that they insist on that agreement. [Qaddumi] First, we did not say we agree with maintaining the settlements. The political solution should be based on international legitimacy. Second, international legitimacy is represented by the UN Security Council resolutions. There is Resolution 465, which calls for eliminating the settlements. The United States approved that resolution. Besides, the United States said the settlements constitute an obstacle to peace and Europe said they were illegal. Rabin is a liar and he prevaricates. He agreed with the army to carry out this filthy job. Had Rabin wanted peace, he would have withdrawn on 13 December. But, as Peres said, we have been talking or negotiating with ourselves in Cairo. The controversy has concerned the means to (?perpetuate) their presence. This is what they have been discussing. Why then do they arm the settlers? Isn't the Israeli army occupying our land? Yet they want to tell the world that they are not responsible for these crimes, which they plan in the dark. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is a question that arises concerning participation in the new round of bilateral peace talks between you and Israel, is there not? [Qaddumi] On what do we negotiate now? What does Clinton want us to tell him at these negotiations? Why does he call the negotiators? First, decisive measures must be taken if the United States is eager for security and peace and not biased toward Israel. By these quick negotiations, it seems that the United States wants to absorb international indignation. But international indignation is overwhelming and the United States cannot absorb it. Israel will indeed encounter numerous afflictions in the future because of its terrorist behavior. It has been proven to the world, particularly the countries that supported Israel, that Israel is the cause of tension in the region. It is the hotbed of tension. So, on what do we negotiate? Let Clinton tell Rabin frankly and clearly to withdraw from the Palestinian land. We have accepted peace and the U.S. conditions. Now they want us to negotiate following this tragedy. The United States is asking the impossible. The Palestinian nation can stand fast and sacrifice. It will not surrender, no matter how big a power supports Israel. Yes, we know we are sacrificing and that this sacrifice is essential. If there is seriousness about establishing a just and durable peace, we support such a move. We said yes with pride to the peace conference under unjust conditions, which Baker, the architect of this settlement, knows. Why then does Clinton hesitate to take measures? We want you, the friends of Israel, if you are concerned about peace, to come forward and bridge this wide gap between us and Israel. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much. [Qaddumi] We thank you very much and appreciate the role of our brothers in Egypt, who support the Palestinian people. We also appreciate the role of the Arab nation and the Arab League in this tragedy. No doubt, the united Arab stance is a basic factor and this unity has been clearly shown to the world.
