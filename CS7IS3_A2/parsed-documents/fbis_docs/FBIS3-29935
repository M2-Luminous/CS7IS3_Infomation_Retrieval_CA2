The proclamation of the cooperative Republic of Guyana was a fruition of the struggle of her people to consolidate national independence, MINJU CHOSON says, and goes on: After the proclamation of the republic the Guyanese people have covered the road of building a new society. They are now striving hard for the prosperity of the country, pushing aside all manners of intervention and pressure of outside forces. Pursuing non-aligned policy externally, Guyana is developing friendly relations with foreign countries and making efforts to establish a new international economic order. Though Korea and Guyana are geographically far away from each other, the peoples of the two countries are developing the bonds of friendship. The Korean people believe that the friendly and cooperative relations between Korea and Guyana will further expand and develop in the common interests of the two peoples. The Korean people extend congratulatory greetings to the Guyanese people on the day of the proclamation of the republic and wish them great success in their future work to build a new prosperous society.
