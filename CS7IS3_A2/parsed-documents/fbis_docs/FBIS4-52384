It sold 42 K200 armored cars, made by Daewoo Heavy Industries, to Malaysia at $25 million. Modeled after the U.S. FMC company's armored personnel carrier, this armored car was developed in the early eighties, and served Malaysia's peacekeeping troops in Bosnia as a capital armored car. The ROK began to export weapons full scale in 1974, but its weapon exports were constantly under U.S. Government supervision. In 1983, the ROK set its best record in exporting weapons to third countries by selling $300 million worth of them that year, but since then, arms sales have continued to decline so that in the early nineties, the ROK finally stopped selling weapons. ROK sale of M16 rifles to Indonesia without prior U.S. knowledge put the ROK in a difficult situation with the United States in 1983. A bigger incident, however, took place six years later in 1989, when the ROK sold some defense industrial supplies to Jordan. Despite the ROK's explanation that it sold military uniforms, the United States held fast to its view that the export item was software-related to precision weapons. This incident resulted in a virtual suspension of weapon exports by the ROK, which had previously ranked third for ten years among in weapons exports by third world countries, including China. The United States is checking ROK weapon exports based on legal grounds in the Weapons Export Control Law and the regulations on the international transportation of weapons. These laws stipulate that the ROK should not sell weapons to a third country without the United States' prior approval. Although these laws have exceptions, getting prior approval from the United States through diplomatic negotiations is very complicated and not easy. While ROK national defense industrial companies were able to export weapons with U.S. approval during the period from 1981 to 1984, they have virtually been suspended since 1985. After fundamentally blocking the ROK from selling U.S. weapons produced in the ROK to third countries, the United States began to curb the ROK's export of weapons produced with imported foreign technology or produced in cooperation with foreign countries. The United States stipulated in contracts with the ROK that the ROK not sell any weapon produced in the country to other countries, and this has repressed ROK defense industrial exports of not only such basic weapons as M16 and various trench mortars, but also the ROK-type K1 tanks and 155-mm self-propelled guns, which have comparatively high competitive strength. To make matters worse, the United States demanded high royalty fees for military technology that the ROK defense industrial companies introduced unilaterally. At the 21st annual ROK-U.S. security consultative meeting held in 1989 after tiresome negotiations which began in 1984, the two governments agreed to the ROK paying eight percent of the sale price as royalty to the United States. Although the ROK Government has asked the United States to ease those regulations through various channels, this demand has not been met because some U.S. munitions businesses regard ROK defense industrial companies as their rivals and because the ROK Government imposes dampers. An official with a domestic defense industrial company said: "We stopped bringing up this bothersome demand in 1990 when ROK weapon exports were virtually suspended." The only way out of this situation is to independently develop ROK weapons for exports. We were able to export the ROK armored cars in 1993 because the localization rate of the item was almost 95 percent. However, Mun Chong-in, a political science professor at the U.S. University of Kentucky, who is well versed in the ROK-U.S. defense industrial cooperation, said: "It is highly possible for the United States to raise the issue of intellectual property rights in this case, too." That is, the United States is likely to demand the protection of intellectual property rights for U.S. parts and technology used in manufacturing ROK-type armored cars. The imposition of restrictions on the ROK's weapons exports to third countries seems to be the most difficult issue in cooperation between the ROK and the United States in the defense industry field.
