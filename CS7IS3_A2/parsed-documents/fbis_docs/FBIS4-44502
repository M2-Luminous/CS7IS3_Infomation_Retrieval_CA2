The responsible department of the government either remains indifferent or sternly rebukes and adopts all kinds of measures to oppose the changes. When the whole situation has changed and what is done cannot be undone, the government department would reverse its attitude, admit the facts and even humbly regard such changes as an important government policy and a major achievement of the government. This is true about the mainland policy which affects Taiwan's economic future and the relations between the two sides of the Straits. Even a more typical example is the southbound policy which attracts the attention of the whole society. The southbound development of Taiwan's civilian industries had already become more obvious even 10 years ago. This trend had reached a peak about six to seven years ago. A large number of Taiwan's export processing industries had suffered from the sudden deterioration of Taiwan's own business environment. At the same time, some Southeast Asian nations had readjusted their foreign policies to improve their investment climate in order to attract more foreign enterprises to establish factories there. Their wages were ten times cheaper than that in Taiwan. These favorable terms had posed an irresistible appeal to Taiwan's export processing industries which were suffering from labor shortages and soaring labor costs. As a result, Taiwan's medium-sized and small enterprises went after such a good opportunity like a flock of ducks, whipping up a high tide to make investments in Southeast Asia. However, during that period, the responsible government department was worried. It believed that the exodus of a large number of export enterprises would empty out Taiwan's industries. In addition, if these processing enterprises move their equipment, technology and even orders and markets to these nations having a lower labor cost, their action would pose a serious threat to those enterprises which stayed in Taiwan, and further destroy Taiwan's economy. Therefore, the emphasis of the "southbound policy" at that time was how to prevent enterprises from leaving Taiwan, constrain them to make investments abroad and force them to leave the roots of their industries in Taiwan. However, reality is grim. No matter how much effort you exert to urge these enterprises to stay, most of the export processing industries which had constituted Taiwan's main force in exports left the island in a short period of a few years. Naturally more and more export processing enterprises have now moved from the south to the west and regard mainland China's southeast coastal areas as a more favorable location for their future development. At a time when a large number of Taiwan's businessmen had gradually lost their interest in Thailand, Malaysia and other countries, several government departments suddenly reversed their attitude, and began to shout aloud that they would adequately support and aid those who invested their money in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, hoisting high the banner of "southbound policy", the president visited Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines to carry out his vacation diplomacy during the Spring Festival this year. For a short time, the cry to go south was louder than ever before, and became the focal point of the nation's policy. Nevertheless, when this southbound banner was hoisted high, the total investments of Taiwan's businessmen had decreased. Moreover, problems had cropped up in those countries to which the government encouraged Taiwan's businesses to invest. Anti-Chinese riots suddenly broke out recently in Indonesia with a population of 200 million which has always regarded itself as the leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Even now, riots have not been completely controlled. Such riots pose a direct threat to the Taiwan investors' lives and properties. As a result, their investment enthusiasm, which is not so warm to begin with, would certainly cool off. Recently Taiwan's businessmen had diverted their attention to Vietnam where the wage scale remains extremely low and efficiency is the highest in the Communist community in changing its economic structure. However, since the United States lifted its embargo to Vietnam in February this year, Vietnam has become a new focal point of the major U.S., Japanese and European enterprises. The kind of predominance enjoyed by Taiwan's businesses in Vietnam no longer exists. The price of land in Vietnam is increasing, and there are gradually less preferential treatments given to foreign investors. The terms of making investments there are far less favorable than before. This is another typical example of a situation whereas this good prospect is like the evening glow of the setting sun even if there is full support from the government. Perhaps, there is no need for us to worry about the changes in Taiwan's southbound policy. On the contrary, they may provide us with an opportunity to expand our market beyond Southeast Asia. In despite of the adverse situation in countries which are the targets of our southbound policy such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam, South Asia will undoubtedly remain the area where it is full of vitality in today's world. It will definitely be an action of passivity and self-immolation, if we cannot join the other nations in taking the full advantage of the sign of vitality in South Asia. Southbound market expansion is a task that we must work hard to fulfill. However, we must not restrict our activities to a designated area or sphere, and limit ourselves to the aforementioned several nations. The brightest star in South Asia today is India which has a population as large as 800 million. It already has a fine market, a sound legal and democratic system, an abundant supply of cheap, English-speaking labor and a favorable geographical position between Europe and Asia. India has adopted the policy of improving the investment climate and opening to the outside world since last year. This policy has indeed created a fine condition for India to develop itself. It is also one of our southbound targets which must not neglect. We must not restrict ourselves to the several target nations, when we study our southbound policy. In fact, we should not limit ourselves to expanding our market southward. Because our southbound policy, on the surface, can be used for the economic benefits of our enterprises and as diplomatic bargaining chips of our government. However, its true meaning is to not only help more developing nations develop their export processing industries with which they may increase their purchasing power and promote the world's economic prosperity, but also make use of the chain effect of the upper-stream and downstream industries to expand the sales of Taiwan's products and services and promote its economic development. As far as this purpose is concerned, the gradual changes for the worse in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam indicate that the aforementioned task has been basically fulfilled. We should now divert our financial resources and manpower to other backward nations which badly need development. We must not restrict ourselves to South Asia only. Our banner should spread out in the south, the west, the north and the east and in any area with a great potential for future development, which awaits our assistance. This is the major stride that we should make.
