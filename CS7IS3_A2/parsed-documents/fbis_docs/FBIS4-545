[Boisserie] Absolutely, Bruno. And the Rwandan Armed Forces themselves have said that the soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, those who were in the center of the town and those who this morning were on all the hills round the town, have met up. Nevertheless, the battalions of the Rwandan Armed Forces are still there, and they are fighting bravely back. There was very intense fighting here late this afternoon. [Masurer] Philippe, a certain number of French soldiers are still in Rwanda: what exactly will their mission be? [Boisserie] For the moment nothing has been decided about the 350 men still here. But this evening the United Nations has deployed a unit on the airport car park which implies that it will replace the foreign troops who are occupying the airport for the moment. So it will be the United Nations that takes over from the troops. However, so far nothing has been decided. Anyway, the Rwandan Patriotic Front has made things quite clear: It has set a time limit of 60 hours from this morning, the United Nations says. So by Thursday [14 April] evening they are saying clearly that there must not be a single foreign soldier left on Rwandan soil.
