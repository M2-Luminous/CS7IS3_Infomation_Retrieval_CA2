An exception was made only to a representative of the newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. This action was reported by ITAR-TASS. It noted that correspondents of news agencies and the television were not allowed to attend a meeting of the Russian Government for the first time in the past two and a half years. Dwelling on the motives behind this decision, Kvasov told the newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "The accreditation of journalists was all muddled up lately. Absolutely unknown people come to the Presidium. And then various assessments, views and critical remarks appeared in the press even before we began to discuss this or that problem. After all, a government meeting is not a show. It is serious, hard and responsible work". Touching on ways to allow the mass media to objectively cover the work of the Russian Government, Kvasov noted: "We are ready to furnish them with all the necessary materials, but only after a final decision is made on the discussed problems." Speaking about the February 3 meeting, Kvasov noted that "it continued for almost six hours, while some other meetings were even longer. And this time is sufficient for this or that minister to say quite a lot. Why must we disclose our kitchen. No other government permits this. Just try to come to such a meeting in France or Britain. This will, mildly speaking, evoke surprise." Asked by the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA whether journalists would henceforth be barred from meetings of the government's Presidium and whether this was fair, Kvasov stated: "Whenever some restrictions are imposed, we are immediately accused of encroaching upon the freedom of speech. There is no such ban in the true sense of the word. We must merely put everything in proper order. Representatives of the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will be allowed to attend all the meetings, because it is a government publication. This refers also to ITAR-TASS. The other newspapers, the radio and the television will be allowed to attend such meetings in accordance with a newly endorsed list. But they will have limited access. The presence of representatives from these publications will depend on the agenda. We shall invite everybody to broader meetings, and only the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and ITAR-TASS To other sessons," Kvasov stressed. "The other publications will get all the necessary materials from the government's press service," he added.
