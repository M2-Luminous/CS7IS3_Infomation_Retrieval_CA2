The Keidanren, in its agenda of proposals, asks the government to revise the basic plan for public investment totaling 430 trillion yen on which Japan and the United States agreed three years ago and to add more than 100 trillion yen. The Keizai Doyukai, in its agenda of proposals, calls on the government to 1) add 100 trillion yen for public investment, 2) reduce Japan's current account surplus to about 2 percent of its GDP (gross national product) three years later, 3) cut the income tax, not for one year, but for at least three years prior to raising the consumption tax, and 4) work out an action program to narrow price differentials between Japan and other nations. The two economic organizations have submitted their proposals to the prime minister. On 7 March, the president and vice presidents of Keidanren met to compile the agenda of emergency proposals entitled "View on Aggressive Solution of Japan-U.S. Issues." The Keizai Doyukai inaugurated an ad hoc committee shortly after the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off to study ways to compile the agenda of the emergency proposal. As reasons for making the emergency proposal, the Keidanren says, "the United States is moving to slap sanctions on Japan over the mobile phone issue after the Super 301 provision was revived, and a sense of crisis is growing at home." Keizai Doyukai President Masaru Hayami says, "Both Japan and the United States should restore mutual trust at the earliest date." A growing sense of crisis among business leaders has prompted the two economic organizations to compile the agenda of their emergency proposals. The Keidanren, in its agenda of proposals, calls for increasing the amount of public investment, thoroughly relaxing bureaucratic regulations, taking measures to help foreign firms gain access to the Japanese market through the removal of import and investment barriers, implementing properly a competitive policy, and reducing areas subject to exclusion from the competitive policy. As for the revival of the Super 301 provision, the Keidanren makes clear its view that Japan should take its case to GATT if necessary, saying, "Japan should handle a bilateral trade dispute with the United States in GATT, and a hollowing out of international organizations and systems should be prevented." The Keizai Doyukai makes concrete proposals to Japanese enterprises, U.S. corporations, the Japanese Government, and the U.S. Government. In its concrete proposals, the Keizai Doyukai asks Japanese enterprises to stop exporting goods at below production costs, aggressively purchase equipment and raw materials from abroad, address Japan's traditional trade practices, and rebuild their structure of business and production, and asks U.S. corporations to make self-help efforts to develop goods that are salable on the Japanese market. Commenting on the "reduction of Japan's current account surplus to about 2 percent of GDP," the centerpiece of the Keizai Doyukai's proposal to the Japanese Government, Keizai Doyukai President Masaru Hayami says: "This year, Japan's current account surplus is 2.8 percent of its GDP, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points from a year earlier. If this trend continues every year, the target figure could be met." Regarding the action program on bridging price differentials between Japan and other nations, the president says, the action program and timetable should be worked out to cut in half the gap between the exchange rate and purchasing power parity. He urges the U.S. Government to stabilize the exchange rate.
