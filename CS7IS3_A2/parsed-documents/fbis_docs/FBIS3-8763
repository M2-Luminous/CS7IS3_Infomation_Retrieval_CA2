At one of its coming sessions, the committee, chaired by Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] Deputy Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, will present the Sejm with three proposed amendments. The first one concerns the holding of a preconstitutional referendum, proposed in a bill submitted by the Union of Labor [UP]. As was agreed upon during a previous meeting of the committee, it would be of an optional character; that is, the Sejm might, but would not have to, hold such a referendum. On Friday [11 March], the committee also agreed to give up the idea of the so-called zero option--that is, the proposal that the seven draft constitutions submitted in the previous Sejm be declared invalid. This means that the drafts will be taken into account. The committee also accepted the idea, submitted on behalf of the coalition by SLD Deputy Jerzy Jaskiernia, that the right to submit a constitutional draft also be granted to a group of 500,000 citizens, if this support is backed up by their signatures. The period for the submission of these bills would be three months from the day the law comes into force. In the cases of well-founded doubts concerning the authenticity of the signatures, the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly could request that the State Electoral Committee verify them on the basis of appropriate regulations of the Sejm Election Law. A counterproposal was put forward by Krzysztof Kaminski (Confederation for an Independent Poland--KPN). He suggested that the right to submit a draft constitution be granted to a group of 100,000 citizens. The issue of the citizens' constitutional initiative stirred up the most controversy during the Friday session. UP Deputy Janusz Szymanski and KPN Deputy Krzysztof Kaminski expressed their doubts about whether the committee can debate this motion because it is clearly an extension of the matter included in the amendment bills (prepared by the KPN and UP) the Sejm forwarded to the Constitutional Committee. It was claimed that this motion should be the subject of a separate legislative initiative; it was at the same time recalled that the Sejm recently rejected similar proposals submitted by the president. However, in the ballot that followed, the committee did not share these objections. During the discussion, the bill was also criticized for something else: It was claimed that drafting a constitution in three months' time and collecting 500,000 signatures is next to impossible. Deputy Jaskiernia polemized with this view; he claimed that, in practice, this period will be longer and that many groupings have already prepared or almost prepared their drafts. Setting a more remote deadline would excessively prolong work on the Constitution, which has lasted too long already, and would be dangerous. The explanation of the figure of 500,000 was the following: The right to submit a Constitution draft is exercised by, among others, 56 members of the National Assembly, who represent 1.2 million voters. Granting the right to the initiative to 100,000 citizens would mean unjustified privileges for the electorate of extraparliamentary groups. According to Deputy Jaskiernia, the coalition has launched this initiative because, especially in a situation when the right wing refuses to cooperate in the creation of a Constitution, it wants to avoid the accusation that "the parliament members that are dealing with this fail to notice the citizens." Serving this purpose is the invitation of the representatives of the extraparliamentary parties to the work in the Constitutional Committee, abandoning the zero option, the possibility of holding a preconstitutional referendum, the constitutional citizens' initiative, and a confirming referendum.
