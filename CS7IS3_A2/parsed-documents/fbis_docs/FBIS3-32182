We will try to restore it in a few minutes, because there seems to be a ray of hope that in the next few hours this problem that is already exerting heavy pressure on the people will be settled. Thus, we call on Jorge Celis to reestablish contact, to perhaps start this report over again, because it is interesting news. Here at our news center we are duty-bound to bring news to all parties involved in the problem and to report the information as it happens. [passage omitted] Donald Gonzalez has contacted us from another location. [Begin relay] ...government intention to intimidate the businessmen of the country's organized transportation sector, by this means we urge the human rights ombudsman and the metropolitan archbishop to be on call should this organization or its members deem this necessary at any given time. We clarify this because at no time have or will commercial organizations and businesses represented by this national group participated in acts violating the law. The principle of freedom of industries and commerce entitles us to make our own decisions in our activities. We know, we are sure that we can work for our country's development as long as government officials fulfill their obligations and meet the people's demands. We are also the people. Article 43 of the Republic's Constitution. [as heard] Based on the aforementioned, the National Transportation Coordination Board, in reply to the proposal made by the president today, and as a goodwill gesture with the sole goal of not hurting the Guatemalan people despite the indifference of government officials, reports the following: A. We agree to [word indistinct] of the value of the freight value in the adjustment of current fuel transportation rates plus 0.5 quetzals per gallon considered as part of the insurance expenses for that freight [words indistinct]. B. Rates for cement transportation should be established at 87 percent of the 13.5 percent established by ministerial agreement dated 1-90 of 24 May 1990 issued by the Ministry of Communications, Transportation, and Public Works, forcing the issuance of the respective ministerial agreement. The president must immediately sign the following government agreements: 1. Extra-urban passenger transportation. 2. Ground transportation of cargo equipment in the country [words indistinct] shipping companies. 3. Definition of the correct interpretation of Articles 61 and 64 of the Income Tax Law, decree number 26-92 of the Congress of the Republic to the effect that transportation companies that issue receipts authorized by the General Internal Revenues Directorate are not subject to the 4 percent withholding under the category of professional service. 4. Order and control of work 24 hours a day by customs and immigration officials at national borders and ports. 5. We clarify that we do not reject liberalization of heavy transportation because freight transportation in the country is regulated by commercial contracts signed by mutual agreement among the interested parties. Thus we ask the president to try not to confuse public opinion. Moreover, as a private sector that provides work for more than 30,000 families throughout the country, we are not interested in more state controls on transportation activities. 6. We want history books to record that the current conflict reached the magnitude it has today because during the past seven months of government, state officials closed the doors on the country's organized transportation sector. We do not have political interests. We never stop being and thinking as an integral part of the Guatemalan people, and, as such, we continue to demand solution of our problems and those of any other segment of the population as long as inefficiency persists in the decisionmaking process, because they stop making such decisions at certain times. [as heard] This group continues to be open to dialogue and negotiation with the sole purpose of finding solutions to national problems together. [end relay]
