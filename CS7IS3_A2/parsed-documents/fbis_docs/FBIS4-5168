The law was adopted as a decision of the SPA Standing Committee on March 24, 1994. It consists of six chapters and 52 articles. The law shall be conducive to establishing strict system and order in the preservation and management of cultural relics and keeping them in their original state to properly inherit and develop the cultural legacies of the nation and exalt the national pride of the people. According to the law, the cultural relics include primitive relics, castles, ruins of beacons, buildings, ruins of buildings, graves, towers, tombstones, pottery kiln sites, smithy sites and other historical relics and production tools, daily necessities, weapons, plastic art works, old books, ancient documents, human fossils, remains of dead persons and other historical remains. They are owned by the state only. The inherited historical relics, however, can be owned by individual citizens. The state does not admit the transfer of the ownership of historical remains which have illegally been carried abroad but claims their return. The excavation of cultural relics shall be done only by the cultural relics preservation institutions and competent professional organs. Upon discovering cultural relics, an office, an enterprise, an organisation or a citizen should report the cultural relics to a preservation guidance institution or a competent organ. Cultural relics shall be preserved and managed by the cultural relics preservation institutions and the offices, enterprises, organisations and citizens that have the historical relics. The state shall designate historical relics reserves in order to preserve them. Historical relics cannot be sold or bought, nor can they be taken to a foreign country. The institution that wants to take historical relics to a foreign country for the purpose of exhibition should obtain the approval of the Administration Council. The unified guidance over the cultural relics preservation shall be given by the central guidance institution for the preservation of cultural relics. If anyone digs out cultural relics by stealth, sells or buys historical relics, takes them to a foreign country or does not present discovered historical relics, the relevant relics shall be confiscated.
