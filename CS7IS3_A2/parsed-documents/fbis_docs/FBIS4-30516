"If you added all the logging quotas allowed so far, this would mean that in no time, Erromango would become a desert", Carlot told AFP in an interview. He said his government would risk legal action for breach of contract over the ban, imposed on June 20 because of mounting concern about exploitation of Vanuatu's natural resources by foreign companies. European Union member countries represented here officially expressed concern to Carlot over logging in the island state last May. An estimated 8,000 cubic meters (10,400 cubic yards) of logs is stockpiled at the Erromango port of Ipota after a ship from Hong Kong was forced to leave the island state's capital Port Vila without its cargo. Carlot denied any official protest had been received from the companies. But said he had suggested to them that they bring the facilities to mill the logs here. "If they did that, they would gain in the long run", he said. He met officials from the logging companies currently licensed to operate on the southern Vanuatu island, two from Malaysia, one Chinese and a Malaysia-Vanuatu joint-venture. "At one stage, quite a few ministers came to tell me that such and such a company was bad and that this other one was good and now, there are four companies licensed to operate on Erromango and export the unprocessed logs." Carlot said according to new government policy guidelines, Malaysian company Parklane, forced last week to suspend operations, would be allowed to log 15,000 cubic meters a year. Two others, Pacific Veneers and Erro Lumber, would be allowed 5,000 cubic metres each. The Chinese-based Kingwood company would be denied the right to log on Erromango and would have to negotiate on another island. "I know some companies won't be happy and will put the pressure on us to obtain what they want," said Carlot. "But as long as I'll be here, they won't get their way. By doing this, I think I'm protecting the future generations."
