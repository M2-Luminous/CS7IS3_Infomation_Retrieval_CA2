An immediate effect was that they have been given a welcome respite from an opposition move to call for a no-confidence debate over the unimpressive performance of the administration. As the mystery shrouding the past deeds of Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong is being unraveled with more embarrassing evidence involving his alleged role in marijuana consignments to the U.S., Thai authorities appear reluctant to be put on the spot with the lawmaker. A nagging question from the public is "why so?" Thanong, proprietor of the Little Duck Group of hotel and entertainment chains, has become an ugly duckling for Chat Thai Party and the whole opposition block which have been dismayed by a sudden reversal of fortune. Newly-elected Chat Thai leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha must have been particularly upset by the jinx which had further dimmed his chances of being in the government by whatever means he deems possible. The scandal has made all senior officials in law enforcement and drug suppression look very foolish. First they said they had not been aware of Thanong's path to his current vast fortune. Yielding to more pressing questions, they conceded that they had quite substantial information about the MP's alleged role in drug trafficking. The public is frustrated on many points after hearing hasty explanations from Thanong as well as government authorities. Thanong categorically denied on May 6 that he had no idea about the assets seized by U.S. authorities, but conceded on Tuesday that he had indeed owned the property and a limousine in California. The exposed falsehood was sufficient to wash away whatever innocence he had claimed. Any prosecutor having Thanong on the defense stand and with that kind of admission would certainly be rubbing his hands in glee. But wait a minute. What we heard later from government officials was perplexing. From all comments, it boiled down to something like this: they weren't quite sure whether legal actions could be taken against the lawmaker who is being accused by U.S. authorities of trafficking in narcotics. "There is not yet any evidence to implicate him," they said. This is really funny. They made the statement even before there was any attempt to start an investigation. The Police Department is silent. The Interior Ministry officials are distancing themselves from the "sitting duck'' who is now in the line of fire of U.S. legal potshots. The Narcotics Suppression Unit has not displayed any enthusiasm to launch a probe, despite a forced admission that there was substantial record of suspected illegal activities. The Office of the Attorney General did not seem interested in finding out whether there are grounds for legal actions. We wonder why, because the whole mess is making a mockery of our creaking legal machinery. But more revealing yesterday was an explanation from American authorities that there had been a plan to arrest the MP if he showed up in the United States. This should be dreadful enough for Thanong to change his bravado that he intended to prove his innocence in any U.S. court of law. He will be lucky enough, from now on, to stay away from the long arm of the American law whenever he travels outside Thailand. There are too many fine points involved. But there are things to be done. Thanong must discontinue his House membership to reduce the negative image on the institution. The government must start investigations right away on this explosive scandal. If not, it must explain to the public why the MP should be exempted from due process of the law to clear his name. If the government is unmoved, it would not be a surprise to see Chat Thai and other opposition MPs from Chat Phathana and Social Action parties come up soon with an audacious demand that Prime Minister Chuan resign to show his responsibility, if Thanong refuses to quit. Knowing full well the extent of their political scruples, we believe that they certainly can go that far.
