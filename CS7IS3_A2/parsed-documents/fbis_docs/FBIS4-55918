FBIS4-55918 "dreeu101__a94008" FBIS-EEU-94-101-A Daily Report 20 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Coalition Not To Support Abolishing Senate Coalition Not To Support Abolishing Senate AU2005203894 Prague CTK in English 1948 GMT 20 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2005203894 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague May 20 (CTK) -- Coalition deputies will not support a constitutional bill deleting the Senate from the Constitution and introducing a unicameral parliament at the parliamentary session opening next Tuesday [24 May], Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde said today. The bill has been submitted by deputies from opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) and the Liberal Social Union (LSU). Three-fifths or 120 votes in the 200-seat parliament are necessary for a constitutional bill to be passed. The coalition commands 105 votes. Speaking after a meeting of the "coalition thirteen," Uhde said that the four coalition parties still held different views on Senatorial elections. The coalition thirteen comprises the chairman and four deputy chairmen of the parliament, the chairmen of the four coalition parties and the chairmen of their deputies' groups. The coalition parties are the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Christian Democratic Party-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS). Uhde said that some deputies still believed that the Senatorial elections should be one-round, while the government bill provides for two-round balloting. A third, compromise bill applies the "Australian principle", which combines both previous ones, he added. The elections will probably be held in the autumn, along with local elections. Another question at issue is the number of constituencies. The ODS still rejects any other number than 81, Uhde, an ODS member himself, said. But he stressed that negotiations would continue "until the last moment" before the session, and may be also during the session, which is to deal with the bill. Therefore, the course of the session may be slightly dramatic, but "dramatic only in brackets because there is will to reach agreement," Uhde said. The coalition thirteen today set up a commission to seek a solution to the dispute over the size of constituencies for elections to the Chamber of Deputies (to be held in 1996) and to the Senate. The commission should find a solution as close to the original proposal as possible, which would respect the existing administrative districts. The original proposal provided for about 15 percent differences in the numbers of voters in individual constituencies. On May 12, Josef Jezek (formerly ODS, now independent deputy), told journalists that in the government-approved bill the differences in the population of individual constituencies had not been more than 15 percent. But the material distributed to the deputies provides for differences of up to 27 percent, he added. The commission is headed by Karel Ledvinka (ODA) and comprises Libor Novak Jr (ODS), Ivan Masek (ODA), Ludvik Motycka (KDU-CSL), Marek Benda (KDS) and government experts. The authenticity of the government bill given to the parliament was also doubted today by Deputy Premier and ODA Chairman Jan Kalvoda. His statement contradicts an earlier claim by Premier Vaclav Klaus who sharply rejected the possibility that the parliament would have received another bill than that approved by the government.
