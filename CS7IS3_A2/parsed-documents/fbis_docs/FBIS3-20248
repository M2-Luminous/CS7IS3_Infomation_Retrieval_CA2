He has said no to forming a government with Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance] and no to Berlusconi's candidacy for the post of prime minister. These are two formidable obstacles which Berlusconi must overcome. It is difficult to make any forecasts at present. The postelection games have not even begun. However, it is clear that there will not be any clearcut choices and nor the stability which we expected from the new electoral system.
