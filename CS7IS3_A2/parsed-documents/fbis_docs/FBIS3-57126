A 45-year-old economist and first deputy prime minister in the former USSR cabinet, Shcherbakov has lately been favored as the possible new finance minister. According to unconfirmed reports, the two men agreed that since the financial situation in the country "is extremely tense," a finance minister should also be a first deputy prime minister. Shcherbakov is reported to have been trying to persuade Fedorov to drop his tough demands on the cabinet's makeup and stay in the government.
