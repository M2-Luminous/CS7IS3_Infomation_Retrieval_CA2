FR940725-0-00096 FR940725-0-00013 The provisions of section 1915(c)(7) of the Act, as amended by OBRA '86, apply to applications for waivers (or renewals) approved on or after October 21, 1986. Section 8437(a) of TMRA made a further amendment to section 1915(c)(7)(A) of the Act to extend the principle of specific illness or condition cost estimates to individuals ``who would require the level of care provided in hospitals, NFs or ICFs/MR.'' As amended by TMRA, section 1915(c)(7)(A) specifies that, for a home and community-based services waiver that applies to individuals with a particular illness or condition, who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided in, hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR, the Secretary must allow the State to determine the average per capita expenditure that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under the State plan separately from the expenditures for other individuals who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided in, those respective facilities. This provision applies to eligible individuals whether or not those individuals are institutionalized prior to entering the waiver. Section 8437(b) of TMRA made the amendments to section 1915(c)(7)(A) effective for waiver applications submitted before, on, or after November 10, 1988, the date TMRA was enacted. In the proposed rule, we revised ยง441.303(f)(3) to provide that, for waivers that apply only to individuals with a particular illness or condition (formerly referred to as physically disabled in section 9502(d) of COBRA) who are inpatients in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR, the State may determine the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in each waiver year for those individuals under the State plan separately from the expenditures for other inpatients of the respective certified facilities. We did not receive public comments on this specific provision. b. Provisions of the final rule. We are adopting this proposed provision as final with the change described below. We will consider timely comments submitted on this change. We have revised proposed ยง441.303(f)(4) (and renumbered it as ยง441.303(f)(3) to accommodate other revisions) to include reference to individuals who would require the level of care provided in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR. In addition, we have revised this section to allow an agency to (1) exclude expenditures for other individuals in the affected hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR when estimating average per capita expenditures for a waiver for individuals with a particular illness or condition who would otherwise require hospital, NF, or ICF/MR level of care, as provided for in section 8437(a) of TMRA; and (2) support the accompanying data with documentation to verify that the cost-effectiveness estimates for these illness or condition specific waivers are reasonable as required under section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act. 3. Computation of Estimated Expenditures Under Waiver for Institutionalized Developmentally Disabled Individuals a. Background. Section 4118(k) of OBRA '87 added a new paragraph (B) to section 1915(c)(7) of the Act concerning computation of the average per capita expenditure estimates made by a State under section 1915(c)(2)(B) of the Act for a waiver that applies only to individuals with developmental disabilities who are inpatients in a nursing facility. (The original wording of the statute specified SNFs and ICFs.) The new provision states that, if the State has determined, on the basis of an evaluation under section 1915(c)(2)(B) of the Act, that individuals need the level of care provided in an ICF/MR, the State may determine the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under the State plan based on the average per capita expenditures under the State plan for services to individuals who are inpatients of ICFs/MR (rather than NFs). We have determined that the evaluation required under section 1915(c)(2)(B) of the Act should be completed as part of the preadmission screening annual resident review (PASARR) required under section 1919(e)(7)(B) of the Act entitled ``State Requirements for Annual Resident Review.'' Section 1919(e)(7)(B)(ii) requires that, as of April 1, 1990, in the case of each resident of a nursing facility who is mentally retarded, the State mental retardation or developmental disability authority must review and determine_
