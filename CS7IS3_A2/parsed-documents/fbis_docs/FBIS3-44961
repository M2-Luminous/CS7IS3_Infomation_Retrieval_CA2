Macleod was reacting to yesterday's threat by the U.S. to slash quotas on imports of Chinese textiles. Meanwhile China yesterday threatened to retaliate against the "irresponsible" U.S. decision and called for a return to the negotiating table. In the U.S., however, the head of the Textile Manufacturers Institute called China "an international outlaw" and said China's illegal textiles transshipments had cost the U.S. 50,000 jobs. The U.S. has given China until 17 January before it actually imposes the quota cuts, which are expected to be between 25 and 35 percent of China's total textile quota to the U.S. Macleod said Hong Kong would suffer, but he said the territory should keep out of the row. "As a matter of fact, we have our own quota arrangements with the U.S. government so Hong Kong's direct trade will not be affected," he said. However, he admitted that Hong Kong's economy would be affected, both directly and indirectly, if the cuts went ahead. "Quite a large number of local textile manufacturers have moved their production bases to the mainland, therefore a direct impact would be apparent on them. "It would affect Hong Kong entrepreneurs' investments in China very directly." Macleod said Hong Kong would also suffer indirectly as a result of the drop in textile shipments to the U.S. from China, because the re-export trade would be hit. But local analysts said the quota cuts would not have a major impact on Hong Kong garment makers in the short term despite the heavy shift of Hong Kong production facilities into southern China. "Hong Kong right now is not using much of China's quotas so I wouldn't say that in the medium term it would have much impact," Barings Securities analyst Chris Li said. Beijing condemned the U.S. for its unilateral move to slash China's quotas in a strongly worded protest by a Foreign Trade Ministry spokesman carried by the official XINHUA News Agency. "The irresponsible action taken by the U.S. has caused both strong reaction in China and extensive dissatisfaction in the U.S.," he said. A Hong Kong Trade Department spokesman said yesterday that the territory's role as a port for China's world trade would suffer if Beijing and Washington failed to settle the dispute soon. He said there would be no immediate impact, but added: "If a resolution is not reached in due course, re-exports of Chinese-made textiles and clothing to the U.S. will be affected." China's textiles re-exports through Hong Kong to the U.S. was estimated to be about $26 billion in 1993. Raymond Chien, chairman of the board of directors of the Hong Kong Industrial Technology Centre Corporation, described the U.S. move as "shocking". He hit out at Washington for mixing issues and blaming China as a whole for the work of a few corrupt traders.
