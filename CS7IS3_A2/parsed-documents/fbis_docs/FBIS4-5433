Gen. [Police General] Phong-ammat Amattayakun said yesterday. He said that police had unearthed no trace of Mr Makeyev's whereabouts. He also insisted that Immigration Department officials could not find any record of the Russian diplomat having left the country. Pol. Gen. Phong-ammat said Mr Makeyev's name did not appear on the list of foreigners who had passed though Thailand's Immigration checkpoints. A report from Russia's Tass news agency said Mr Makeyev had emerged in the United States but other details were not available. Meanwhile immigration officials at Don Muang airport said they would stop issuing visas to the citizens of certain nations who apply for entry visas at Don Muang, but refused to name the countries. A high-ranking official said the measures were designed to prevent some ill-intentioned foreigners from carrying out acts of sabotage in Thailand. Pol. Gen. Phong-ammat said Thailand last year had relaxed the process of issuing visas at Don Muang airport to promote tourism but this would have to change in line with the world situation.
