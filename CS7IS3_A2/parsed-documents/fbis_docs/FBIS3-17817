In particular, 120,000 left Kazakhstan, 106,000 -- Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan], 90,000 -- Uzbekistan. Russian Minister of Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray gave these figures during his meeting in Moscow on Tuesday with CSCE Supreme Commissar for Ethnic Minorities Max van der Stoel. After the meeting Shakhray told Interfax that he had informed the guest about the reasons for the migration of ethnic Russians from Central Asian countries. Thus, statistical data show that 28 percent explained the return to their historical homeland with "the real threat of violence or persecution," and 19 percent with "insult and humililation of national dignity." In the minister's opinion, if the situation for ethnic Russians does not impove in this region, within the next two or three years the migration of 3 million people can be expected from the Central Asian republics to the Russian Federation. The situation with 11 million ethnic Russians living in Ukraine is also complicated. According to Shakhray, the main problems there are "the exclusion of the Russian language from the daily life and business, "the Ukrainization" of education in high schools, the obligatory knowledge of the Ukrainian language for getting a profession." Shakhray noted that in Ukraine, like in other republics of the former Soviet Union, the share of unemployed ethnic Russians is "inadmissibly large." Regarding the situation of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic states, Shakhray said that after the parliaments of these states adopted corresponding laws, 300,000 ethnic Russians living in Estonia were deprived of citizenship. In Latvia 700,000 Russians lost citizenship, of them 160,000 have no legal status at all, including the right to work. Shakhray stated that Russia as a legal successor of the Soviet Union has taken all responsibility for those people who "hold only the USSR passport." The minister believes that a multilateral convention within the framework of the CIS should be signed to assure the rights of ethnic minorities and that on the basis of this document bilateral treaties must be concluded. In his opinion, apart from that it would also be necessary to establish efficient control over the observance of these documents. Shakhray said that at the meeting with Max van der Stoel it was agreed to expand cooperation in the protection of interests of ethnic minorities and in the more efficient use of international mechanisms on this issue.
