The spokesman, Shen Guofang, made the remarks at a weekly press conference held here this afternoon when commenting on a report that the United States recently asserted that if China would make major progress in its human rights, it would consider adopting the approach of reviewing China's MFN status once in several years. Shen said that the Chinese Government has repeatedly stated most clearly that the mutual offer of MFN status between China and the United States is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade arrangement, and that the MFN ought not to be linked with issues irrelevant to it. Recently, Shen said, President Clinton and the U.S. Government both indicated the intention to put behind the annual debate on China's MFN status, in order to settle this issue permanently and have the Sino-U.S. relations built on a more solid foundation. "We believe this is a positive and sensible notion," said Shen, "But it is yet to be translated into action on the part of the U.S. side." The spokesman said that the U.S. practice of linking the MFN status with the human rights issue also constitutes a violation of the principle of respect for state sovereignty enshrined in the U.N. Charter. "This linking sounds as if it is for promoting human rights, but as a matter of fact, it is an act of violating human rights and infringing upon the rights to development elaborated in the declaration on the right to development and the Vienna Declaration and program of action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights last year," said Shen. "These actions of the U.S. have done nothing but present obstacles to the promotion of human rights," the spokesman stressed.
