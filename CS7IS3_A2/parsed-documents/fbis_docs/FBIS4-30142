Despite having implemented economic stimulous measures totaling 45 trillion yen in four stages, difficulties have been encountered in placing the economy back on the road to recovery. The questions are why and what remedial action is required? The "white paper" provides an effective response to those questions. Causes for the protracted recession include stock adjustments associated with capital investments, housing investments, and consumer durables. Further, balance sheets of firms that used debt to purchase land and buildings at inflated prices during the bubble economy and of banks that issued such loans have deteriorated because of the collapse of the bubble. The adverse effects of such asset deflation are a widely mentioned topic. An important aspect of the "white paper" is that it lists as a third factor in the extended recession the structural adjustment of Japanese industry. The structural adjustments have been required by a change in the international competitive environment led by the explosive growth in China's manufacturing capabilities and rise in U.S. manufacturing productivity. China, whose labor rates are two percent of those in Japan, is now becoming the world's factory. Mass production technology for high-tech products, which was once considered Japan's specialty, is in the process of being transferred to Asian nations including China. Such changes are forcing Japanese industries to undergo structural adjustments calling for specialization in technology intensive products. The white paper's analysis stating that the future economic recovery will be slow in tempo is of a persuasive quality when one considers the two obstacles of balance sheet adjustments and structural adjustments. The principal role that government should play as a matter of policy would be to assist in this structural adjustment in the private sector and to establish efficiency in providing government services to minimize the burdens associated with the pending aging of society. Viewed historically, effective measures that could be taken by advanced industrialized nations in competing with rapidly growing developing nations include devaluation of currencies, protectionism, and technical innovations. However, lessons learned during the economic depression of the 1930's rule out the use of protectionism. Many advanced nations have made efforts at modest currency devaluations, but the yen continues to be strong. Moreover, Japan cannot afford to abandon principles of free trade. Accordingly, preservation of economic vitality in Japan in the 21st century will require technical innovation of a considerable scope. The core of technical innovation must consist of an information revolution. The white paper suggests that the key to structural adjustments is a bold relaxation of government regulations. Concurrently, the government must take action to improve immense inefficiencies associated with administrative services through the use of information revolution. In March [1994], U.S. President Clinton announced a plan to reduce the federal work force by 270,000 in five years. They say that congressional hearings are held daily on how to combine information and administrative reforms. A requirement is the systemic improvement of Japan as a whole. We must increase efficiency in industrial, social, and administrative systems and build a new type of welfare state. Preservation of old systems combined with a shot in the arm will not solve our problems. We must learn our lessons from a history of economic failure and high welfare nations where the people lost incentives to work. Desirable is that central and regional government employees deal with restructurings in a manner similar to that undertaken by the private sector to attain revolutionary improvements in efficiencies in the area of government services. Deregulation will represent the core of all required actions. Common access to information based on optical fiber networks will probably provide for significant increases in efficiency. Administrative reform is not limited to manpower reductions.
