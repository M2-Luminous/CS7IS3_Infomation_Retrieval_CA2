Nevertheless, despite the fact that this was reported on the front pages of all the newspapers, it failed to impress anyone and the chances of success are very close to zero. The most frequent explanation of the no-confidence vote proposal, which could be heard last week in political circles, was that this is an attempt to delay the adoption of the 1994 budget. Two sessions will certainly be wasted, which still does not mean that the budget debate could not start as soon as this week. Some of the SDS deputies did not tire of repeating that the purpose of the proposal was to topple the cabinet and bring forward the elections. However, when asked about the real reason, another section of deputies only shrug their shoulders and develop a great interest in their shoelaces. This is so because, if anyone really wanted to topple Berov, the SDS leadership would have proposed the no-confidence vote after rather than prior to adopting the budget. Perhaps then the chances would not have been so close to zero as they are now. Unlike previous reasons that prompted no-confidence votes, such as the "beating" of Stefan Savov, the sidewalk taxes, and other such lunacies, this time things are more serious. Burgeoning crime and the police shoot-out could easily generate enough votes against the government. However, this will not happen when the country is without a budget. Even a child could understand the economic consequences of such a situation. If we assume that this is, nevertheless, unclear to some SDS deputies (which is highly questionable), then we would have to believe the thesis that they repeat ad nauseam, namely, that the government, only the government, and no one but the government is responsible for the crime rate, and if the government is brought down and new elections emerge on the horizon, the sticks and the firearms on our streets will disappear, and the same will happen to the vicious fight between economic groups and to corruption. In other words, life will become as pretty as a picture. This is more than absurd. There is no more fertile soil for the crime, corruption, and anarchy than the absence of laws, a legislating institution, and an executive institution responsible for implementing the laws. It is a completely different question as to how the cabinet and parliament cope with their obligations. In addition, if the Socialists boycott the voting, something that was mentioned over the weekend, the no-confidence motion will not gain the 121 votes required by the Constitution, and the thesis that "by supporting the government the Bulgarian Socialist Party is supporting crime," will vanish into thin air. Thus, regardless of which direction the no-confidence vote is viewed, it always looks like total lunacy.
