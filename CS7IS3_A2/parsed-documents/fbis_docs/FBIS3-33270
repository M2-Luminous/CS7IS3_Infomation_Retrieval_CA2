The meeting was attended by Juan Salazar, Finance Ministry international policy adviser and future Foreign Ministry economic affairs director; Alejandro Jara, bilateral affairs director for the International Economic Relations Directorate; and Fishing Corporation and Sofofa representatives. Sofofa Secretary General Jaime Pozo said the Mexican charges, which resulted in temporary sanctions against Chile while an investigation is conducted, are quite groundless: [Begin Pozo recording, in progress] ...punctual. One must adjust to the international market prices currently set by Peru, which is exporting at significantly low prices. Chilean industry cannot just fail to comply with previously made contracts. Mexico also is buying in the international market because Chilean fishmeal is of very good quality and, in this sense, it is very competitive precisely because of its quality. [end recording] The Chilean business sector has asked the government's support in confronting charges that, according to the Mexican law system, Chile exports below cost. Salazar explained that the government is concerned about this issue and will raise the subject before the administrative council of the Chilean-Mexican Free Trade Accord. Moreover, Alejandro Jara said Chile is not causing Mexican producers any harm: [Begin Jara recording, in progress] ...we are very worried. Mexican businessmen cannot categorically say that Chilean fishmeal exports are the direct and main cause of the harm suffered by the Mexican industry, which has experienced a significant reduction in its sales in addition to having to go by the international fishmeal price, which also affects Chile because they have been relatively low or, at, least lower than when the investigation was carried out. [end recording] Jara said these measures are unjustified and must be reversed as soon as possible.
