Due to the tremendous destructive and killing power of nuclear weapons, however, we believe that their use is not in accord with the spirit of humanitarianism that is the basis of international law." However, there arose a chorus of opposition from all over Japan voicing such reactions as, "The statement is not in accord with the popular sentiments of the only nation to suffer from atomic bombing." The government then submitted its written statement after removing the part "Speaking from a purely legal point of view... one cannot say that it is a violation." What should we make of this? ASAHI SHIMBUN's 7 June editorial called the government's position "heartless." MAINICHI SHIMBUN's 8 June editorial criticized the Foreign Ministry: "One can only call the response that of legal gangsters." Certainly, one can understand how the written statement that "one cannot say that the use of nuclear weapons is a violation" does not square with the popular sentiment of Japanese who, having experienced the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have since taken the lead in implementing the three nonnuclear principles, and appealed to the world for disarmament and the abolition of nuclear weapons. The immediate reaction of the people in this way, too, can certainly be considered a sound response. However, the nature of the nuclear problem is a complicated one. The people did not react after understanding the big picture and giving it dispassionate and mature consideration. Explaining the problem rationally to the people should remain the task of specialists and political leaders. Of course, diplomacy divorced from popular sentiment will not last. But it is also true that diplomacy errs in simply following popular sentiment. The editorials from ASAHI SHIMBUN and MAINICHI SHIMBUN themselves admit that "perhaps there is no treaty or agreement in which it is expressly written that the use of nuclear weapons is a legal violation" (ASAHI), and that "the fact is that there is almost certainly no international law or regulation prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons" (MAINICHI). Therefore, the argument becomes one for enacting a law: "If nonuse of nuclear weapons is not prescribed by international law, then it should be prescribed in accord with the times" (ASAHI). The problem the ICJ raised is an argument of interpretation. Therefore, ASAHI and MAINICHI have substituted the first type of argument for the second. If they had answered the problem squarely, ASAHI and MAINICHI would have had to say that, "One cannot say that the use of nuclear weapons is against the law." However, those taking the position that depends on the argument for enacting a law so that "the use of nuclear weapons is against the law" probably also wished to say "it is against the law" in the argument of interpretation as well. However, that is like the 17th-century Roman Catholic pope who demanded that Galileo accept the Ptolemaic theory that the sun revolves around the earth. Perhaps the Foreign Ministry officials are murmuring, "Even so, it is the earth that is revolving around the sun." Hiroshima, Nagasaki Bombings Were Violations of International Law Of course, saying "one cannot say it is against the law" does not mean that one can therefore legally use nuclear weapons at any time and any place. In a war of aggression, the war itself is against the law, and thus so not only are nuclear weapons but the use of all weapons. The problem is that even for cases in which a war is legal (for example, in exercising the right to self-defense or in the military measures taken by the United Nations), the use of certain weapons is outlawed. The question is whether nuclear weapons are among them. In the balance between military effectiveness and humanitarian considerations, the call to prohibit the use of certain weapons comes when the latter consideration dominates (i.e., when suffering considered unnecessary is inflicted by the use of certain weapons despite there being other means to achieve the same military effect). Thus, the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 outlawed the use of explosives under 400 grams while not outlawing the use of those above 400 grams. Even if we were to ignore military effectiveness and outlaw the use of certain weapons on the grounds of humanitarianism alone, the act would actually have no effect. All weapons are basically inhumane. Speaking from a strictly humane point of view, the use of all weapons should be prohibited. Incidentally, I believe the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States was illegal under international law. However, my reasoning is not that the use of the atomic bombs was itself illegal (dropping an atomic bomb on the battleship Yamato under way at sea would have been completely legal) but that the act strayed from the principle of military targeting. The bombing was illegal as an indiscriminate attack upon a defenseless city, resulting in many casualties among peaceful citizens. In that sense, although atomic bombs were not used, the massive air raid against Tokyo on 10 March 1945 was an eminent violation of international law. Inescapable Problem of Nuclear Deterrence However, the destructive and killing power of nuclear weapons is tremendous. A situation in which they would be used again is absolutely inexcusable for whatever reason. Turning at this point to the argument for enacting a law, it is natural for Japan, which maintains its three nonnuclear principles, to work to outlaw the use of nuclear weapons. However, precisely because we would not resolve all the issues in creating such a treaty, the problem is truly complicated. To what extent do Japanese understand this? The history of international relations is one of broken treaties. The real issue is creating an international management system to guarantee the implementation of the agreements. Then, for that to happen, we cannot escape from the problem of nuclear deterrence. Therein lies the true difficulty of this problem.
