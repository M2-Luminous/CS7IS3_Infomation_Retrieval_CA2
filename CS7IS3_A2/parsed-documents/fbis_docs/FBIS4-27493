FBIS4-27493 "dreas106_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 29 May 1994 North Korea Radio Reports 27 May U.S. `Aerial War Exercise' Radio Reports 27 May U.S. `Aerial War Exercise' SK0106033194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0300 GMT 29 May 94 SK0106033194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0300 GMT 29 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists on 27 May perpetrated a provocative aerial war exercise aimed at northward invasion. Prior to this, pursuit-assault planes, vertical take-off and landing attack planes, and electronic jamming planes flew in from the U.S. bases in the Pacific region to the U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea. The overseas-based flying corps were mobilized in the skies above Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Umsong on this day and were frenzied in the aerial war exercise aimed at northward invasion in cooperation with fighter planes of the U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea. In the war exercise staged amid electronic jamming under the command of EA-6, the flying corps from overseas bases and fighter-bombers, attack planes, observation planes, and reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea were mobilized on a large-scale. The war exercise was a reckless play with fire aimed at increasing their capabilities of making a surprise attack on the North and at enhancing cooperation between overseas-based flying corps and military planes of the U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea. This is a clear proof that the U.S. imperialists are the ones who increase tension on the Korean peninsula.
