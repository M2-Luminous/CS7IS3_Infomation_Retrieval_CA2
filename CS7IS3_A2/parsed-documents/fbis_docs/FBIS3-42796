Late on the night of 25 January negotiations on the participation of Siemens and a number of other German companies in the construction of an international airport in Novosibirsk came to a close in that city (according to preliminary estimates the cost of construction will come to $1.2 billion). In the course of the negotiations, two drafts were compared--the German one and the American draft offered by Boeing Aerosystems International late last year. The negotiations were conducted by representatives of the Novosibirsk directorate for construction of the airport--the Transsibavia joint-stock company. In addition to Siemens, Gunther Eppelmann, general representative of the company Graf von Wedel, and Werner Thiemig, managing engineer of the company DYWIDAG Osteuropa, took part in the negotiations for the German side. As the Siemens manager Horst Warzel stated in the course of the negotiations, the draft of the construction of the international airport proposed by Boeing Aerosystems International does not fully account for the local climatic and financial-economic peculiarities (a consortium of American companies led by Boeing and the consulting company Ernst and Young is planning to complete work on its draft in mid-February). Mr. Warzel noted that the concept of the Siemens draft is fundamentally different from the American draft of an airport terminal complex which would not allow for further expansion. Mr. Warzel believes that in this instance, a block-modular pattern of airport construction which makes it possible to gradually augment the capacity of the airport is optimal. The model of construction of one of the Indonesian international airports, as well as that of the airport in the capital of Qatar, Doha, was proposed as a prototype; they were also designed with the participation of Siemens specialists. As Mr. Warzel stated, the Berliner Bank, the Deutsche Bank, and a number of Swiss and Austrian banks, as well as the German engineering construction companies DYWIDAG Osteuropa and Graf von Wedel have already shown interest in financial participation in the project. They are prepared to embark on carrying out the airport project shortly; within two to three weeks Siemens could develop a business plan of the project. Carrying out the project may influence the nature of the economic presence of foreign countries in the Siberian region substantially. This circumstance, in combination with the considerable cost of the project, was the reason for this kind of keen competition between German and American companies. The negotiations have not been completed yet: The Transsibavia joint-stock company and the German companies have agreed to continue them and hold joint consultations. KOMMERSANT observers note that the lack of necessary foreign exchange funds in the possession of the Russian side may become the main obstacle to implementation of the project. According to data from unofficial sources, representatives of the Transsibavia have already approached Aeroflot for financial support, but have gotten no response so far.
