Here is what President Salinas said: [Begin Salinas recording] We need peace in the highlands and in the jungles so that justice can progress. Particularly now that we have made a commitment, may no one pretend to return to situations of the past. Rather, what we are seeking, which in effect has been set out here, is willingness on the part of the authorities to serve through their organizations, to respect human rights so that progress can be made in the democratic system and justice can be fostered. This is the commitment that has been made. [end recording] Chiapas peasants and Indians presented some of the region's problems to President Salinas and gave him their opinions on the Chiapas conflict. They said that the armed conflict is a sign of the poverty and social backwardness in which the people of Chiapas live. [Begin recording] [Peasant Antonio Hernandez] Peace will always be a means to achieve high values in a new human relationship that will produce liberty, democracy, and social justice. We believe we have made a great deal of progress in the last few days since you organized the consulting commission. The social organizations are currently convinced that the road to solving the people's problems is through dialogue and consensus. [Felix Corozo, Indian community leader] We believe that peace for the Chiapas peasants should begin in the homes of the Chiapas community. We need to have decent living conditions, enough food, health services, and assurances that our children will attend school and get a good education for the future. We want peace that leads to infrastructure projects. We want peace that brings justice for all and on equal terms. We want peace that represents tranquility on the roads to our fields. We want peace to go to our coffee fields, peace to go to our bean and corn fields. [Lazarno Hernandez, agricultural union leader] We know that those who made those decisions were following orders and they believed there was no other road to take. They believed that with force they would gain their freedom; they believed their movement was nationalistic. We combated those ideas. We told them there were many ways to take up the struggle within the law and within democracy. We told the that weapons do not free us from poverty nor from ignorance. We told them that the Mexican people did not want war, but rather peace. [end recording] They all pointed out to President Salinas that the way to solve the people's problems is through dialogue and consensus. Therefore, a commitment has been made to hold a meeting next weekend during which pacification of the area will be fostered. Carlos Rojas, secretary of social development, and Beatriz Paredes Rangel, president of the National Commission for the Overall Development of and Social Justice for Indian Peoples, accompanied President Salinas during the meeting. Likewise, Enrique Del Val, under secretary of social development; Guillermo Espinosa, director of the National Indian Institute; and Arturo Warman, agrarian ombudsman, were present at this meeting at Los Pinos.
