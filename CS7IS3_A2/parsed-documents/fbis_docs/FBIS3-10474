FBIS3-10474 "drlat045__a94012" FBIS-LAT-94-044-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 March 1994 ANNEX Cuba Envoy Rejects U.S. Human Rights Options PA0303031294 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1943 GMT 2 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA0303031294 Havana PRENSA LATINA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [By PRENSA LATINA correspondent Mary Simon] [Text] Geneva [no date or agency attribution as received] -- Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Human Rights Commission (CDH), stated that this nation rejects the imposition of a rapporteur appointed as a result U.S. pressure or attempts to impose any type of alternatives. With respect to this issue, the head of the Cuban delegation participating in the 50th session of the CDH described the appointment of the aforementioned rapporteur as part of Washington's hostile and unmerciful policy toward his country. In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA [PL], Perez Novoa stressed that at a time when the end of the so-called Cold War is being used as an instrument to demand an end to hostilities in regions such as Palestine and South Africa, as well as between bloc relations, ironically, that same policy is still being used and reinforced against Cuba. To the diplomat, it is unacceptable to discuss an anti-Cuban resolution promoted by the United States such as the one scheduled to be voted on next week when the CDH is expected to end its current session. In this respect, Perez Novoa indicated that "we did not come here on the defensive, nor did we arrive and feel that we are on the defendant's seat." This is why Cuba's participation is directed toward the overall context of the CDH programs which has encouraged and negotiated dozens of projects, some of which were approved already during the CDH's second voting round on Friday, 24 February [date as received]. Moreover, the Cuban delegation's participation is taking place in an integral, multivalent, and comprehensive manner, completely divorced from any perception of isolation toward Havana. In this respect, Perez Novoa stated that they are not concerned or apprehensive about the ghost of an alleged resolution against Cuba. In nothing -- he insisted -- does this cause us to lose sleep. The proposal for a special rapporteur came about as a result of a U.S. imposition in its vendetta against Cuba. During the presentation of the report to the general assembly, [CDH rapporteur] Carl Johan Goth pointed out that in Cuba there are no missing persons, torture, murders, or armed groups. Later on -- Perez Novoa stated -- he tried to justify an institutional system, but what is very clear to him is that "in Cuba there is no indication of massive and flagrant human rights violations." That is obvious, insisted the ambassador, who believes that the real source of this resolution is the hostile and aggressive policy of U.S. Administrations against Cuba. In this respect, Perez Novoa regretted that the new administration still clings to such a position which has no basis whatsoever. That is why Cuba maintains its rightful position with respect to there being no reason for selective and discriminatory treatment by this CDH, nothing to justify the existence of the rapporteur or it being included as item 12 of the agenda. Nothing of the sort -- he stated -- corresponds to the true situation in Cuba or what its people are experiencing. "They simply cannot acknowledge that Cuba has been able to accomplish a social, economic, and political program such as the one it has despite hostilities from the United States," Perez Novoa indicated. When correlating Washington's position with respect to the so-called Cold War, the ambassador indicated that while the new administration calls for an end to the Cold War and to confrontation in Palestine and South Africa, as well as in relations between blocs, it continues and reinforces its policy toward Cuba. How can they explain to the world that they continue this Cold War policy and harass our small country, the ambassador asked, when Cuba does not constitute any danger whatsoever to the United States. Today -- he indicated -- they cannot even resort to the false but much used argument that we are "a Soviet base" because the Soviet Union as such no longer exists. Perez Novoa insisted that Cuba has historically maintained, is, and will always be willing to discuss its differences with the United States under an equal condition of sovereignty and without any preconditions. The ambassador asserted they are the ones who do not want to accept and evade the responsibility of having normal relations and discussing differences. "An example that obstinacy remains is this false and manipulative human rights policy, and this is why they seek a new resolution," he said. Cuban Cooperation With the CDH Jose Perez Novoa recounted what he called Cuba's broad, frank, and transparent cooperation with the entire human rights system and rapporteurs throughout the years. In this regard, he described how, encouraged and subsidized by the United States, the rapporteurs receive complaints, which are sometimes presented without any evidence, legality, or force. Nevertheless, he said, the rapporteurs received the complaints and sent them to the government. The government, in turn, answered them without any doubt or fear because we have nothing to hide, he said. On the contrary, the ambassador said, we feel proud of the human rights situation prevailing in Cuba as few nations have been able to accomplish what we have in this respect. He added that cooperation is valid for all countries without discrimination, selectivity, or political imposition. Perez Novoa observed: Cuba is willing to cooperate, has done so, is doing so, and will continue to do so. On this subject, he mentioned the time in 1988 when Cuba invited a CDH delegation for a visit. The CDH representatives visited the island, met with all those they wanted to see and made a report. The report was presented the following year and discussed publicly with the media, nongovernment organizations, and observer governments during three sessions. Perez Novoa said the report was discussed as no other in the CDH session and no evidence was found to justify that Cuba be assigned a rapporteur. What's more, he said, when the issue was taken to a vote, they [the United States] lost. The ambassador then referred to the phase after the debate, when Cuba negotiated its desire to continue cooperative relations with the [UN] secretary general with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries (Grulac) [Grupo de Paises Latinoamericanos y del Caribe] and the EEC. [sentence as received] Cuba, he said, was not included on the agenda, had not been assigned a rapporteur as the United States lost that vote (1989), and -- as was accepted by then UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar -- the island maintained smooth and transparent cooperative relations. Not satisfied with the situation, Washington asked for a report from the secretary general in 1990, who presented it and had it analyzed. The fact that Cuba had maintained permanent and stable cooperation with the [UN] secretary general was obviously established in the negotiations with Grulac and the EEC. As it did not further [U.S.] propaganda goals to say Havana had been registered as a human rights case because it was under topic 12 or had a rapporteur, it took advantage of the changes in the correlation of international forces. At the time, the disintegration of the Socialist field had already begun. This situation was used by the United States to impose an amendment to the resolution presented by Grulac, which was signed by approximately 20 representatives. The only thing our people have always objected to in their history and will continue to object to is when something is imposed upon them, he asserted. Our people are open, warm, affectionate, and compassionate, but we will never accept those who try to impose their power upon us, the ambassador stressed. Regarding the changes [in Cuba], as they are usually called, they are the ones born from our own national identity, the ones needed by our country and, based on this, the ones being implemented because they are not meant to satisfy the world, he said. The diplomat was clear when he said: "We will not turn our backs on the world. We know there have been changes. However, we also know we have to protect the great social, economic, and political accomplishments of the revolution, which is the essence of the Cuban program. [no ending quotation mark as received] To further this objective, he manifested, we are obliged to make adjustments in the country -- including economic ones -- to secure those achievements as much as possible. What we are not ready to do, under any circumstances, pressure, or even under the threat of weapons, is to surrender our independence and sovereignty, he stressed.
