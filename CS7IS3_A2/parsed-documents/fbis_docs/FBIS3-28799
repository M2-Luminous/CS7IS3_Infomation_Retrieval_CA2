Otani, 58, formerly of the ruling coalition party Shinseito and now an independent member of the House of Representatives, allegedly conspired with his former political secretary Susumu Ochiai, 51. The indictment came after police sent their case to the Nagoya District Public Prosecutors Office earlier in the day. The two men submitted false reports to the Aichi Prefectural Election Administration Committee, from 1990 through 1992, saying that Otani's support groups had received political donations from 72 supporters for which, according to the indictment, they issued false receipts. Otani's supporters then claimed unlawful income tax refunds totaling 55 million yen, prosecutors said. Otani also evaded 1.2 million yen in tax during the 1990 to 1992 period by falsely reporting that he had donated 3 million yen to one of the groups. In a separate allegation, Ochiai submitted false reports during that same period claiming that support groups had received donations from 47 supporters to whom he issued receipts, but later refunded a total of 38 million yen, prosecutors said. The supporters apparently each claimed tax refunds of several hundred thousand yen by reporting to tax offices false donations of 1 million yen to 1.5 million yen. Private donations by individuals to politicians are exempt from income tax. Prosecutors indicted Otani without arrest on charges of violating the Political Funds Control Law and the Income Tax Law. It is the first time a Diet member has been charged with such a tax refund scam, prosecutors said. Otani has denied his involvement, stating Ochiai acted on his own discretion. At the time of the alleged violations, Otani was an Aichi Prefectural Assembly member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Otani was elected in July last year as a lower house member of Shinseito, an LDP offshoot. He left Shinseito last month to serve as an independent member of the lower house. Ochiai, indicted in December on charges of violating the Income Tax Law in the case, pleaded guilty in his trial last month. Ochiai was also indicted Thursday on charges of violating the Political Funds Control Law.
