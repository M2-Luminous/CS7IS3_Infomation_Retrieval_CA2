Commenting on the talks, Minister Aleksandrov reportedly said that the demands of the students on strike have been fulfilled. Let us hear some of his latest remarks on the subject as submitted to BTA: The strike of the Sofia University students is political, the finance minister declared in briefing the media at the Council of Ministers headquarters today. He is convinced that the students have either been deceived, or are acting at someone's instructions. I am even in doubt whether a strike exists at all, considering that 500 people cannot possible represent the interests of 140,000 students all over the country, Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov is reported as saying. After his meeting with Prof. Ivan Lalov, during which he was informed of the demands of the strikers, the finance minister resolutely declared that he would neither negotiate with the strikers nor sign any agreements with them. According to the minister, the scholarships were paid from the university's extrabudgetary funds on the basis of the rectors' decision. The university's leadership preferred to spend the means of the state subsidies for its own wages, which were increased by 40 percent. Stoyan Aleksandrov described as preposterous the claim that 2 percent of the gross national domestic product should be spent on education as of 1995. According to him, the (?state subsidies) will not be abolished, but it should be considered whether to preserve the current system of distribution in higher educational institutions, or whether a new scheme should be adopted at the suggestion of the rectors, in accordance with the specialists required in different spheres. The legal documents related to scholarships, students' hostels, and credits for students shall be adopted in one package, as the strikers demand, but this will presumably take place only at the beginning of the next or in the middle of the current school year, the minister is reported as saying.
