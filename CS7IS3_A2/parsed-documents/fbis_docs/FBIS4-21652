The political higher-ups are incessantly issuing statements which are only accentuating the agony of our people and adding to their confusion. Apprehensions are mounting as mutual accusations are clouding the reality. Besides pointing fingers at each other, the politicians are contributing to the image tarnishing of the Army. The severity of blames being tossed lead to an inevitable impression as if the decision to continue with the atomic programme or to strangulate it rests entirely with the Army and that the politicians are utterly helpless. The present writer is the perpetual scapegoat, and many `wondrous' acts are being dumped into his `accomplishment baggage,' of which he is not even aware of. "Strange are the doings of beauty" goes an Urdu adage. The singular motive of this drive seems to be to extricate the politicians from their responsibility, and to insinuate as if the Army was the sole arbiter of the decision either to pursue the atomic plan or to nail it down. The recent verdict of the out-going caretaker Prime Minister, Mr. Moin Qureshi, that the Army has the final say in the political dynamics of the country is an explicit assertion to this effect. The present climate of stressful uncertainty with respect to the nuclear issue is an awful load on the nerves of the nation. It seems, therefore, necessary to lift the mask to unravel the reality. It must be mentioned here that it was Richard Barlow -- an American, placed in Islamabad to monitor Pakistan's nuclear programme, who had unequivocally asserted that Pakistan had acquired the nuclear capability in 1987, and this very year his `report' had come into wide circulation, but the people at the helm of affairs in the USA did not pay any heed to it. Far from taking notice, a process of enquiry was initiated against him. (Reference to Seymore Hersh report entitled "On the Nuclear Edge") Why did it so happen? The most vital reason was that at that time, the gravest battle against the Soviet Union was being waged in Afghanistan, and the US had put all its weight on the scale in favour of the Mojahedin. Using Pakistan as a conduit, it was lending all support to the Afghan freedom-fighters, and it did not deem it expedient at that critical and delicate moment that it should risk spoiling relations with Pakistan. Oblivious of the restraints of principles, the Bush administration, from 1987 to 1989, continued for three years to certifying that Pakistan did not possess any nuclear capability. [sentence as published] (Refer to Seymore Hersh report: "On the Nuclear Edge.") No sooner did the Soviet forces step out of Afghanistan in 1989, it suddenly dawned upon the US that Pakistan had succeeded in its nuclear capability acquisition, and Mr Richard Barlow's report was used as a testimony and Pakistan was accused crossing the "Red Light." There was thus no respite in the vicious propaganda onslaught against Pakistan, and the US pressure kept on accelerating. Its military aid was suspended, and the economic aid substantially curtailed. The pressure tactic was employed to have Pakistan abandon its nuclear mission so as to regress it back to a harmless threshold. Pakistan, to tell the truth, had embarked upon all the nuclear steps simultaneously, and these stages are no secret to anyone. In all the reference books these are explicitly mentioned. For the benefit of the readers, these are spelt out as follows: -- The enrichment of the Uranium up to 95 percent and above. -- Preparation of the device by integrating all its elements. -- The laboratory test of the different elements of the device. -- The final test of the integrated system. This can be accomplished either by detonation, which is termed `Hot Test' or through a `Cold Test,' without it. -- Developing the delivery system -- through special aeroplane or missile technology. As stated earlier, Pakistan had developed this capability in 1987, but the `slings' and "arrows" against it were triggered in 1990 for the ostensible reason that the Soviet forces had left the Afghan soil. The US security scenario had metamorphosed and Pakistan was the chosen target for the strangulation of its `nuclear' neck. It would be in the fitness of thing to say that the process of freezing the first stage of atomic programme had actually started in January 1989, i.e. after the decision taken in a conference,co- chaired by the then President Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the then Prime Minster Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. It was a deliberate and consensus decision, about which the Prime Minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was fully aware of her allegation that she was kept in the dark about the nuclear programme contains no substance. To set the record right,it is appropriate to state the fact that in 1988, after Mohtarma Benazir's government had assumed power after the elections,a meeting was held in the Presidency during January of 1989, to deliberate on the nuclear issue. The then President Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Mohtarma Bhutto the Prime Minister - the then Chief of the Army Staff (this writer) and three other very responsible persons had attended this meeting. A detailed discussion took place and all the crucial aspects of the issue were evaluated. Taking the overall situational imperatives and the national interest into perspective, all the members unanimously reached the assessment that Pakistan had acquired the requisite nuclear capability, vitally needed for its security and that it has significantly added to its defensive strength by achieving a "credible deterrence." After recognising this reality, a consensus based decision was reached in which there was no overt or covert pressure from the Army at all. In view of the global scenario,the regional security, and the pressing needs of economic aid, it was decided that only in the first phase, i.e., the stage of Uranium enrichment, Pakistan should temporarily put a "restraint on its efforts" or so to say, a "policy of restraints" was adopted. In other words,there was to be only a lull period so far as the first stage was concerned. The research activities however, were to continue in all the remaining stages so that at the time of an emergency, the nation would be able to cope up with the situation. This decision was taken after thorough and indepth deliberations. As the then Chief of the Army Staff, this writer would like to remind that no pressure of any kind was exerted by him. Whatever is now being attributed to this scribe has no bearing on reality. In the wake of the consensus decision, there was `No freeze' and `No capping' whatsoever. As a result of "freezing" of phase 1 of the programme, i.e. enrichment only up to 3 per cent, subsequently, phase 2 got automatically frozen, because of lack of the "basic material," i.e., enriched weapon grade uranium. This process of "freezing" continued during the tenure of Mian Nawaz Sharif's prime ministership as well. Voices of "freeze" and "roll-back" are being heard now, and the political figures have transformed this sensitive issue into an `infantile playground,' merely for political ends while the nation is gasping into the whirlpool of hope and despair with dazed amazement. The situation has now come where the US is intensifying its pressure on Pakistan to roll back the programme. It is their avowed demand that Pakistan should exterminate the capability which it has acquired after years of toil and enormous sacrifice. This was not acceptable to Pakistan. After Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto's ouster from the government, when Mian Nawaz Sharif was saddled into power, he also pursued the same policy, despite the magnitude of the mounting pressure from the US. The magnitude of the problem and the recalcitrant approach of the US can be assessed from the fact that to cripple us militarily and economically, the Pressler Amendment was fully imposed upon us. The military aid was totally stopped and the economic assistance was only negligible. This state of affairs continued till the tenure of this writer, which expired in August 1991. Whatever has happened since then is outside the scope of his knowledge. The irony is that without knowing full facts, the character assassination of the writer is being done since long and that this is by a deliberate design. To say that the writer was instrumental in the nuclear freezing or that it was imposed on the government, is totally outside the pale of reality. Based on his conscientiously determined vision, the writer still maintains that to give up the nuclear capability would be tantamount to committing a national suicide. To acquire this capability is totally in congruence with our defence requirements. The nation is unnecessarily being subjected to doubts and apprehensions, which is not right. Without mincing words, the writer would emphatically reassert: The atomic plan was not frozen. OnIy the enrichment of uranium was temporaily delayed through a well deliberated decision. If any government has subsequently "frozen" it, this should be subjected to enquiry by the present regime and the nation must be taken into confidence. If at all it has really been "frozen" it is in our supreme interest that the programme be reactivated from where it was broken. Pakistan is presently placed at a difficult choice point. It can continue with the animated suspense-neither "yes" nor "no" stand-and keep on accusing each other, while the nation remains in a stateof perpetual quandary. The other alternative could be to concede to the pressure and either "freeze" or "cap" our nuclear programme and later on by rolling it back,extract, in exchange, all the favours from the US. There is yet a third possibility. We learn to live with the style and grace of a sovereign nation and make no compromises on vital national issues. This indeed is a difficult decision but to circumvent it, in the opinion of this writer, is nothing short of high treason. This writer once again would like to reiterate his submission that the issue of "freezing" of the plan be thoroughly investigated, mere mudslinging is no solution to the problem. To camouflage it in the veil of "Secrecy" is no longer possible. The nation is very impatient to know, under what compulsions was Pakistan's atomic programme `frozen' and why is the US so adamant to inspect our nuclear installations? Notwithstanding the Government and the Opposition's stand on this issue, this writer is fully convinced that the people and those deeply interested in the security of the country, must in unison accept the reality that our defence requirements could only be met if we link our nuclear programme with that of India. We must unequivocally tell the US that any unilateral or partisan approach would not be acceptable to Pakistan.
