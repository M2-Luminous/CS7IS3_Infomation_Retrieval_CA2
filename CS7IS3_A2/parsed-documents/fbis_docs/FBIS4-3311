Egyptian Ambassador to China Samir Burhan expressed this belief in an interview with XINHUA. President Mubarak will start a three-day state visit to China on April 21 at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Burhan noted that a Cairo earthquake two years ago disrupted Mubarak's China trip and the forthcoming visit would be an extension of that visit. The frequent high-level exchanges of visits are "manifestations of the friendly ties" between the two countries, he said. During the visit, Mubarak is scheduled to hold talks and exchange views with President Jiang on regional and international issues of mutual concern. Mubarak will brief the Chinese leadership on the latest developments of the Middle East peace process, and Egypt's role in the negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, Burhan said. As chairman of the Organization of African Unity, Mubarak will also brief the Chinese leaders on the developments in hot spots in Africa, such as Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, Mozambique and South Africa. Leaders of the two countries will explore new ways to enhance bilateral ties, especially those in the economic and trade fields, and propel these ties toward a new phase of development, Burhan said. The ambassador touched on Egypt-China economic and trade relations, saying that the two-way trade volume reached 200 million U.S. dollars last year. "The figure is not all that big and there exists great potential for development," he said. He voiced the belief that President Mubarak's visit will also serve to expand bilateral economic and trade relations. Burhan revealed that the two countries are working on an agreement on judicial cooperation for the president to sign during his visit here. "This will mark another new development in bilateral cooperation," he noted. Egypt and China share similar experiences in their respective opening drives and economic re-working, and are faced with common difficulties, he said. The exchange of these experiences will help them to solve obstacles and to promote each country's progress, the ambassador noted.
