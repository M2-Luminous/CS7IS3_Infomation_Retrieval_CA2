When he opened his mouth the second time, the "only point" he had to add was: "The fact that we are here answering your questions speaks volumes." He said it twice in his succinct little speech of no more than a few sentences. The session spoke volumes, indeed, about the way the Hong Kong Governor is accountable to the British Parliament. In answering questions he must have been asked dozens of times before, the Governor made his case uncontested, ridiculing at will all those who had disagreed with him but were not present to defend themselves. Governor Patten quoted Sir David Akers-Jones as saying that the Chinese style was not to rig elections, but to know the results before they were held. The room erupted in laughter. No one bothered to question the accuracy of the quote. The Governor described statements from Chinese officials as "irrational", "largely rhetorical" and "devoid of argument". The FAC took him at his word. Mr Patten stressed that there were "obviously some limits" to what he could say at the moment about the Sino-British election talks, then safely went on to blame the intransigence and perfidy of the Chinese side for the breakdown of the talks. In some questions Mr Patten even managed to display his magnanimity. He was asked to comment on the speculation that China was "pouring money into a political party called DAB [Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]", to which he answered: "I do not know where (the DAB's) funds come from." He was invited to give an opinion on China's "so-called advisers", and he generously said it would help Hong Kong if those advisers gave good advice to China, hastily adding: "I am not sure that the advice is always as good and sound as one might like." The main thrust of Mr Patten's argument was that the Sino-British dispute could not be resolved because China did not want to see fair elections in Hong Kong. "What is at issue is whether (the 1994/95 electoral) arrangements are fair or unfair," he said. "That is the nub of the argument." He told the committee that the Chinese wanted "rotten" electoral arrangements. As an example he pointed to the geographical constituencies: "If it is the case that Chinese officials are arguing in geographical constituencies, for example, for double- member constituencies with everybody having one vote, thus ensuring that you would get a very different result in geographical constituencies from the one that was obtained last time; if that is what Chinese officials are arguing for, and if Chinese officials will not give up on that, does one just surrender the point? Does one put in place electoral arrangements which secure halving the number of pro-democracy politicians that can be elected through geographical constituencies?" A very interesting piece of logic. Let us put aside the obvious question of how a double-seat single-vote system, and for that matter any electoral system based on universal franchise, could selectively penalise a particular category of politicians. Why would "a very different result...from the one that was obtained last time" be unacceptable to Mr Patten? Does he already have a preconception about how many of those whom he calls "pro-democracy politicians" should be elected? So who is talking about knowing the result before the elections now? In his eagerness to expose the rottenness of the Chinese side. Mr Patten ran into yet another self contradiction. If, as he claimed, the British and the Chinese sides were each insisting on a different electoral system for the Legco [Legislative Council] geographical constituencies in 1995. How could the British call it a "non-contentious" issue, and blame the Chinese for refusing to include it in a first-stage agreement? These inconsistencies, and many others, stood out blatantly in Mr Patten's allegations. The FAC overlooked them all, deliberately or otherwise. The local English press called it a "grilling". It was more like Chris Patten's one-man show. As such it was painstakingly planned and superbly performed, one must admit, realising there was never any intention to seek truth from facts.
