FR941012-0-00163 FR941012-0-00011 This standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options, consult with States prior to taking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State laws relating to issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards. Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards. The logging standard is drafted so that loggers in every State would be protected by general, performance-oriented standards. To the extent that there are State or regional peculiarities caused by the types of timber to be logged, the terrain, the climate or other factors, States with occupational safety and health plans approved under Section 18 of the OSH Act would be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems. Moreover, the performance nature of this proposed standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by States and loggers to provide as much safety as possible using varying methods consonant with conditions in each State. In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in the logging industry. While the individual States, if all acted, might be able collectively to deal with the safety problems involved, most have not elected to do so in the twenty-four years since the enactment of the OSH Act. Those States which have elected to participate under Section 18 of the OSH Act would not be preempted by this standard and would be able to deal with special, local conditions within the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standards are at least as effective as the Federal standard. State comments are invited on this proposal and will be fully considered prior to promulgation of a final rule. XI. State Plan Standards The 25 States with their own OSHA approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable standard within six months of the publication date of the final standard. These States are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut (for State and local government employees only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (for State and local government employees only), North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such time as a State standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these States.
