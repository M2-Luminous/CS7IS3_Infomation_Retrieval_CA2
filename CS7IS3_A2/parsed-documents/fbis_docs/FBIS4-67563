Almost 50 per cent of food in developing countries is contaminated with pesticides, according to a recent report. Scientists say that the study of pesticide behaviour is of critical importance particularly for developing countries which also face food shortages. Presently 135 pesticides are registered by the Indian Pesticide Registration Committee. A majority of these pesticides have been found to be unsafe by the United States of America Environmental Agency. According to a recent report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), every year at least five lakh people suffer from pesticide poisoning all over the world and of these an estimated 5,000 die. Monitoring of pesticide contamination is therefore absolutely necessary, it adds. At a recent seminar of "soil pollution" in Madras, sponsored by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, scientists have suggested that Indian farmers should be immediately provided with "Soil Health Cards." The soil health cards will help government agencies in analysing the pesticide content in soils of different regions of the country. The proposal has been accepted by the Tamil Nadu government. Professor M.S. Swaminathan, an eminent scientist and chairman of the national organising committee of the seminar, appealed to other states to follow suit. In his paper "Pesticides and Their Impact on Groundwater," Dr R.P. Singh, a soil scientist at the Aligarh Muslim University, has contended that at least three banned pesticides which were considered hazardous in some western countries, do not pose the same danger in some regions in India because of certain characteristics of the soil and different climatic conditions. According to him, if the soil characteristics of a particular area is studied, then the selection of a proper and safe pesticide becomes a distinct possibility. Dr Singh points out that pesticides such as Carbofuran oxmyal and Phosphasmidon do not pollute groundwater when they are used in clay loam and silt loam soils in India, provided the annual rainfall is not high. These pesticides have a high absorption affinity towards such soils and hence their movements restricted. According to a United States environmental agency report: "If the partition coefficient value of a pesticide is more than five and the organic matter's partition coefficient value is more than 300, then the pesticide is not harmful." Similar views have been expressed by Dr N. Sethunathan of the Central Rice Research Institute of Cuttack. He said: "The study of leaching rates of pesticides using soil physico-chemical properties will be of immediate help in controlling pesticide pollution in flooded soils."
