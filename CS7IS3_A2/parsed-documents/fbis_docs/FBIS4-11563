In a communique, the PRI leadership reiterates that Zedillo is willing to debate over radio and television with Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of the National Action Party [PAN] on Tuesday 3 May and rules out the proposal by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] to hold the debates at a later date. Herewith follows the complete text: "The PRI CEN reports the following regarding the invitation made by presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo to the PAN and PRD candidates to debate as soon as possible: ``1. In a message published on 24 April, Ernesto Zedillo expressed his confidence that `throughout the campaign there will be opportunities to compare our positions with the candidates of all parties.' ``2. On 25 April, Engineer Cardenas, in a letter addressed to our candidate Ernesto Zedillo, without clearly agreeing to take part in the debate, said: `We plan to hold several debates, among which you and I could hold one more on our own, in view of the objective fact that this campaign's confrontation really represents what both of us believe in and is what voters will have to decide upon.' ``That same day, our candidate clearly replied: `I do not agree with your plan to disqualify other candidacies registered within the law, nor can I agree with your attempt to rule out other parties that represent ideological pluralism and diversity in the country's political life. I reiterate to you that in my invitation I pointed out my confidence that there will be opportunities to compare positions with the candidates of all the parties throughout the campaign. ``3. In his invitation, Ernesto Zedillo proposed clear conditions: That the debate be broadcast live on television and over the radio and managed in an unquestionably impartial, honest, and equal format. ``4. PAN Presidential Candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos has accepted the invitation. He suggested the event take place on 3 May. ``5. Candidate Ernesto Zedillo has accepted this proposal for 3 May. ``6. In light of the above, our candidate has decided to postpone his activities and campaign events for the first few days of the week. He did so because of the significance he has attached to debating his ideas and political program before the nation. ``7. He also accepted Diego Fernandez de Cevallos's suggestion that the event take place at the National Chamber of Television and Radio Industries. This means that the Chamber will provide the necessary technical support to guarantee that all stations who want to pick up the signal can do so and provide whatever the press may need to cover the event. ``8. Cardenas has already advised the media that he accepts the debate, but at a much later date. ``9. In an effort to ensure unquestionable integrity and equality, our party will present a format proposal for the debate tomorrow. This format will provide time for opening and closing remarks by each candidate and the same amount of time for each contender to present his ideas. The proposal will also include a moderator whose absolute integrity and renowned impartiality qualify him or her to direct the debate and ensure that all candidates stick to the agreed times and scope. ``10. The three parties will discuss their points of view and agree upon all these issues, pursuant to the organization and completion of the debate, in the shortest possible time. ``11. The PRI and its presidential candidate are aware that the direct exchange of ideas is an enriching element within our country's democratic process. It will be an opportunity for the Mexicans to see where they really and truly agree and disagree with each candidate to the Presidency of the republic.''
