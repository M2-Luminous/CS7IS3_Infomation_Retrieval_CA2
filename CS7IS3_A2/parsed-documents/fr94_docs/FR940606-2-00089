FR940606-2-00089 FR940606-2-00059 As of March 31, 1994, the securities comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $124.11 million to a high of $2.08 billion. The average capitalization as of that date was $566.83 million. The component accounting for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was Elbit Ltd. (13.12%), while the smallest was Biotechnology General Corp. (1.92%). Calculation The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the component stocks relative to the base date of January 2, 1992. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing by a divisor that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date. The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-sale prices and will be disseminated every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component stock of the Index is not currently being traded, the most recent price at which the stock traded will be used in the Index calculation. Maintenance The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to, spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The Exchange states that the Index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components of the Index or the Israeli economy generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a stock from the Index (generally due to a takeover or merger), every effort will be made to add to the Index an Israeli stock that is traded in the U.S. and not in Israel. (According to the Exchange, there are currently 46 Israeli stocks trading in the United States, of which five are also traded in Israel.) In such circumstances, CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement stock. The Exchange will most likely maintain fifteen stocks in the Index at all times. 9 9 The Exchange will notify the Commission of changes in the number of components in the Index. Prior to increasing the number of components of the Index to more than 20 or decreasing the number of components to less than 10, the Exchange will be required to submit a rule filing pursuant to Section 19 of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. Id . Long-Term Index Options In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS for which the underlying value would be computed at one-tenth (1/10th) of the value of the Index. The current and closing index value of any such reduced-value Index LEAPS will, after such initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced value, all other specifications and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same. Exercise and Settlement Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of the rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules. 10 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Israeli Index options. The Exchange states that the proposed Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus, the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration date. 10 Under CBOE Rule 24.9, A.M.-settled index options are settled based on an index value derived from opening prices on the last day of trading prior to expiration. Exchange Rules Applicable Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules regarding narrow-based or industry indexes will be applicable to Index options. Index option contracts based on the Israeli Index will be subject to position limits on 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.4A. For purposes of position and exercise limits Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis. Under the proposal, ten reduced-value Index LEAPS contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAPS for purposes of aggregating positions. The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new options series that would result from the introduction of Israeli Index options and Index LEAPS.
