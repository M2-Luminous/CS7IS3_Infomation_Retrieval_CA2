Li Peng, premier of the State Council, attended and cut the ribbon at a celebration held at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant this morning. In the evening of 5 February, Premier Li Peng held a reception in Shenzhen. He cordially met and addressed those attending the celebration, including those responsible for the joint venture that set up the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant; Chinese and foreign suppliers and contractors; representatives of Chinese and foreign experts; and French and British diplomats in China. He pointed out: The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a result of reform and opening up, and has been a beneficial experiment in establishing a modern enterprise system. Jointly funded and constructed by the Guangdong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited and the Hong Kong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a large nuclear power plant with two pressurized water reactors capable of generating 900,000 kilowatts. The reactors were imported from France and Britain. Construction of the plant began in early 1984 and civil engineering and construction projects for various key buildings were essentially completed at the end of 1990. The No. 1 Generating Unit formally began commercial operations on 1 February. The No. 2 Generating Unit of the plant is expected to commence commercial operations this year. Once fully complete, the nuclear power plant will generate more than 10 billion kwh of electricity annually, and will play an active role in helping economic progress and prosperity in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Li Peng said at the reception: The commercial operation of the No. 1 generating unit of the power plant marks a new step for China in the development of its nuclear power industry. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant is China's first medium-scale nuclear power plant which was researched, designed, manufactured, and built by China itself. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is China's first large nuclear power plant built with foreign funds and advanced equipment and technology. The construction of both nuclear plants has important significance for China as it starts to develop its nuclear power industry, cultivate its technological personnel, and master nuclear power technology. Li Peng said: The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a result of reform and opening up. As early as 1979, when China had just begun to implement its policy of reform and opening up, the Power Industry Ministry Industry and Guangdong Province proposed the idea of taking advantage of Shenzhen's favorable geographical location to attract foreign capital, construct a plant with loans, and repay the loans by selling electricity, thereby blazing a new path for China in the use of foreign funds and the development of large infrastructural projects. The Daya Bay Nuclear Plant was China's largest Sino- foreign joint-venture enterprise set up in the early period of reform and opening up. In accordance with international normal practice, the plant has established a modern enterprise management system and enforces a responsibility system whereby the general manager is under the guidance of a board of directors. The plant has, therefore, separated government from enterprise functions, and has instituted specific responsibilities and a scientific management system. In the course of constructing the power plant, it has introduced competitive mechanisms, and has adopted a system of attracting and accepting public tenders whereby it chose outstanding Chinese and foreign suppliers and construction enterprises to join in various endeavors including design, construction, experimentation, and consultation. The commendable aspects of the construction of Daya Bay Nuclear Plant are not only that China has imported advanced foreign equipment and technology, but it has also gained from advanced foreign experience in organizing and managing construction projects, thereby considerably raising its standards of modern construction. Li Peng said: The party central committee and the State Council have been paying attention to and supporting the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant project. The State Council has held many meetings to expound and demonstrate the necessity of the project. When the joint-venture agreement was signed by the Guangdong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited in 1985, Comrade Deng Xiaoping personally met Lord Kadoorie, founder of the Hong Kong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited and former chairman of Hong Kong's China Light and Power Company, thereby fully endorsing his approval and support for the new project, which arose from reform and opening up. Comrade Jiang Zemin has been very concerned with the work at the nuclear power plant: He personally visited and gave instructions at the work site. During crucial moments when the project was under construction, many leading comrades of the party Central Committee and the State Council involved themselves personally and resolved problems as they occurred in an effort to help the project progress smoothly. Localities and departments -- including the Power Industry Ministry, the China National Nuclear Corporation, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen city -- have done a lot of work to help construction of the nuclear power plant, have created various conditions, and have provided effective support in various aspects. The plant is also a product of the constructive efforts of both the central and local governments. Li Peng expressed his hope: Chinese and foreign suppliers and contractors, as well as Chinese and foreign personnel at the work site, should continue to make efforts and contribute to finishing the whole nuclear power plant project comprehensively and efficiently. Not only should we properly construct the new nuclear power plant, but we should also manage it properly. In a sense, it is more difficult to manage a nuclear power plant properly than to build it properly. Therefore, when operating the power plant in the future, all personnel must persistently pursue the principle of "quality and safety first" to ensure that electricity is safely, efficiently, and continuously generated and supplied to Guangdong and Hong Kong and so promotes economic prosperity in the region. Li Peng said: China needs a lot of electricity. While vigorously developing thermal and hydroelectric power stations, we should also appropriately develop nuclear power plants as local conditions demand. The construction of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has generated successful experience on which the development of China's nuclear power industry can be based, and has trained a large number of specialist nuclear power professionals. Meanwhile, it has also created favorable conditions for the development of the second-phase construction project at Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. At present, China is comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, it is deepening reform and opening wider to the outside world. Foreign investors have been very enthusiastic about investing in China. China has continually improved its investment environment and has further widened the scope for new investment. We welcome foreign investors to join us in developing China's basic industries and infrastructural facilities and warmly invite friends from various countries to carry out further economic and technological cooperation with China. Leading comrades attending the celebration and the reception were Ding Guangen, Zou Jiahua, and Xie Fei; and also responsible persons from relevant departments of the State Council, from Guangdong Province, and from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch. Also invited to attend the celebration and reception were the French and British ambassadors to China; and responsible persons from enterprises including Hong Kong's China Light and Power Company, the Hong Kong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited, the French Power Company, the French Framatome Corporation, the French and British General Electric Alsthom Corporation, and the British General Electric Company.
