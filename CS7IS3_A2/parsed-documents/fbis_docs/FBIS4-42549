His friends describe him as a Fox whose partner is the Cat, Gianfranco Fini. Even his enemy Giorgio Pisano, a certified fascist, acknowledges his diabolical shrewdness. "In the MSI [Italian Social Movement] thay called him the Levantine. He is a Richelieu." They say his specialty is convincing someone to do his bidding while giving the poor soul the impression that he made the decision on his own. Who knows whether that is how he became part of the government team? The fact remains that Giuseppe ("Pinuccio") Tatarella--59 years of age; a native of Cerignola, Apulia; married, no children; a professional politician who presents himself as a lawyer; and an MSI soft-liner who founded the National Alliance--is today the number two in the Berlusconi cabinet. He is the deputy prime minister and minister of posts and telecommunications, a ministry that used to have little prestige but that now--in the cabinet of the King of TV--has been upgraded to the status of supplementary heart of the government. It is now one of the most sensitive and strategically decisive ministries and is charged with redesigning the new map of the airwaves and rewriting the Mammi Law. He is the first postfascist to serve in the cabinet in the 50 years since the fall of Benito Mussolini. "Tatarella a fascist?" Pisano protests indignantly. "But he has never been one!" Too shrewd to forswear fascism, Pinuccio the Fox employs verbal acrobatics to avoid the trap. "If we do not end the war of words and judge the Right and the Left on the basis of results, we will not solve any problem." A low profile is his favorite weapon. Unkempt in appearance, with his clothes perpetually stained because he has the bad habit of spilling coffee and pasta on himself, this Richelieu of Cerignola is a tresette [Italian card game] addict, a masterful player at party congresses, a tireless dealmaker in the halls of parliament, and invincible when it comes to conquering the compartments of power--both within the party and outside it. Rumor has it that Giorgio Almirante advised his heir apparent Fini: "Be careful never to go against Tatarella." The young man took his advice. Today, in the AN constellation, the rising stars--from Maurizio Gasparri to Ignazio La Russa--all come from the Tatarella stable. Moreover, Apulia is the region best represented on the AN cabinet team, with two ministers out of a total of five: Tatarella, and Adriana Poli Bortone of Lecce. There, in the heel of Italy's boot, the Tatarellas are multiplying. Whereas Pinuccio, the oldest of four sons of an honest shoemaker, is the undisputed head of the party, his youngest brother Salvatore--the mayor of Cerignola--is headed for a seat in the European Parliament. Still another brother, Matteo, is editor of the QUOTIDIANO DI FOGGIA. Along with politics and tresette, the print media is another of the passions of the new posts and telecommunications minister. A newspaper addict, he reads the papers, clips articles, and keeps them in a monumental file. Sometimes he himself has written them. In his biography for NAVICELLA--the who's who of the members of parliament--he not only wrote that he had been editor of the weekly PUGLIA D'OGGI but added that for a period it had been a daily and recited the names of a number of published articles, notable among which was "Quando Moro non era Moro" ("When Moro Wasn't Moro"). In the early 1990's he founded REPUBBLICA PRESIDENZIALE, a monthly in which he argued the case for an AN. Accordingly, in May of 1993, well before Fini was won over to the cause, Tantarella was proclaiming: "The National Alliance must be the alternative for all Italians who believe the sirens of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and of the Left, both old and new, are out of date and should not be heeded." Moderatism has always been his obsession--and his fortune--ever since the schism of the moderates within the National Democratic Party at the end of the decade of the 1970's opened the road to parliament for him. Until that time Tatarella had operated on the local scene, as councilman in a number of municipalities from Bari to Polignano and as a member of the regional council. The strong man of the Apulia MSI was Ernesto De Marzio, group leader in the Chamber of Deputies, and Tatarella was his private secretary. But when De Marzio embarked on the National Democratic Party adventure--to the great delight of the DC--Tatarella declined to follow him, because, among other things, the schism was opposed by a monument of the Apulia MSI, Araldo di Crollalanza, who during the 20 years of the fascism had been minister of public works and a peace advocate within Mussolinian fascism and subsequently served as senator of the Republic. In 1979 De Marzio suffered political defeat, and Tatarella entered the Chamber of Deputies. Fifteen years later, Tatarella is deputy prime minister. He is the object of much attention in Bari, at the Yacht Club that he frequents together with his wife Angela, a cultured and refined university instructor of legal philosophy. He is received with full honors at Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]. He is cruelly satirized in CUORE and demolished by Chantal Dubois, the dean of parliamentary fashion. At Tatarella's debut as deputy prime minister, Dubois destroyed him with the comment: "Tatarella believes he is presentable with black shoe polish on his hair." In his native Cerignola, his brother Salvatore snickers: "Pinuccio doesn't act like a cabinet minister. You look at him and you say, Mamma mia!'" But you can bet that having taken power, Pinuccio the Fox will change his coat of fur. Biographic Note Giuseppe Tatarella. Born in Cerignola, Apulia, on 17 September 1935. Married, no children. Degree in jurisprudence. Member of parliament since 1979. Journalist.
