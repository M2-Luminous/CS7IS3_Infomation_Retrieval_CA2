I am sure that all of you still recall the occasion as if it were yesterday. Two years have gone by quickly. As the term of office for the first group of Hong Kong affairs advisers is about to end, the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch have jointly decided to reappoint the first group of 43 advisers for another term. Today, as we hold this reappointment ceremony in the warm and blossoming city of Shenzhen, let me first offer my heartfelt congratulations to the reappointed advisers on behalf of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch! Acting as Hong Kong affairs advisers to you is not so much an honor as a responsibility to be shouldered. First, this reflects your sense of responsibility as masters who regard it as their responsibility to achieve "one country, two systems," Hong Kong's smooth transition in 1997, and to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. On the other hand, it also embodies the Chinese Government's determination to ensure the "rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people" and to achieve a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong. Precisely based on this high sense of responsibility, over the past two years you all have, through a variety of means and channels, put forward large numbers of valuable opinions and suggestions on a series of questions regarding Hong Kong's handover of power and a smooth transition. We alone have received hundreds of letters from advisers. The State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch have held many discussion meetings with advisers to listen directly to their opinions. All advisers, whether the first group or the second, have made their greatest efforts and done their best and have rendered very great help and support to our work. They are our think tank and a force we rely on in handling Hong Kong affairs. I would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude to all Hong Kong affairs advisers. A few days ago, the British Hong Kong Legislative Council passed the partial bill which was formulated in accordance with Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's "political reform proposals." The British Government even published a White Paper regarding the Sino-British talks on the political system. This series of unilateral measures, which have ruined cooperation, show that in the remaining three and a half years of the transition period, the British side will cling obstinately to its course and continue to pursue a policy that puts itself in confrontation with us. By doing so, they will only enable all kindhearted people to see clearly so that they no longer harbor any imagination about "cooperation" which the British side hangs on to verbally. Moreover, this will consolidate our determination to rely on our strength to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term stability together with vast numbers of Hong Kong compatriots who love the country and who love Hong Kong. Mr. Deng Xiaoping said as early as 10 years ago: "It is psychology left over by the old colonialists that people trust that the Chinese in Hong Kong can exercise good rule over Hong Kong but do not trust that the Chinese are able to exercise good rule over Hong Kong." Deng added: "Hong Kong's prosperity has come about by the work of Hong Kong people the majority of whom are Chinese." "Hong Kong people are able to exercise good rule over Hong Kong. We should have self- confidence in this." We believe that you advisers seated here and vast numbers of Hong Kong people have this self-confidence! At present, our country has social stability, its economy is developing continuously, and its international status is rising daily. More and more Hong Kong people are consciously standing on the side of safeguarding Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and peaceful transition. We are going to appoint the third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers soon. They will come from all strata and all quarters of the Hong Kong community. We can say that the contingent of Hong Kong affairs advisers has grown large and they are much more representative. This contingent will surely play a more important role on the road to achieving Hong Kong's reversion. It will gather thousands of people to form a large army to write a new epoch-making chapter for Hong Kong. Although the British side's lack of cooperation and confrontational attitude will place obstacles on our road of resuming the exercise of sovereignty and will make various kinds of trouble, with the strong backing of the motherland and with the concerted efforts of vast numbers of Hong Kong compatriots, we will have no insurmountable difficulties and dangers or unremovable obstacles! Advisers, under the present situation, the burden on your shoulders is heavier and your tasks will multiply. I hope that all of you will continue your efforts, continue to use your talents, wisdom, experience, and influence to make a new and greater contribution at the critical stage as Hong Kong is reverting to the motherland. Thank you!
