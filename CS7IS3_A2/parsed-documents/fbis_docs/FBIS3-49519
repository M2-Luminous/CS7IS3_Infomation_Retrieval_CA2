President Walesa said that Poland did not intend to block the [Partnership for Peace] initiative, but he pointed out all the doubts connected with it, the doubts arising from the historical experience of our country, and the doubts arising from the assessment of the situation. Anyway, President Walesa emphasized the wish, if not to say a determined wish, for the process of our country's integration with European structures, involving equally the areas of security, politics, and economics, to take place efficiently and as speedily as possible. He emphasized that this aspiration is not aimed at cutting Russia off and that this aspiration was not aimed against Russia and Russia's interests. Another important element was a statement by Prime Minister Pawlak who spoke about economic relations between Poland and Europe, and between Poland and the United States. President Walesa emphasized on many occasions the need for more activity on the part of Western Europe in the integration processes. I would like to stress here what President Clinton pointed out a few times. He said that he regarded the Partnership for Peace as an opening of the door and not the creation of obstacles.
