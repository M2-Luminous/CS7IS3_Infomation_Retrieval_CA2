In addition, DTB [Digital Television Broadcasting] will acquire an interest in SES "within the next three to four weeks," the objective being for DBP Telekom to eventually hold "15 or 16 percent" of the Luxembourg company capital, people at the SES head office in Betzdorf (near Luxembourg) indicated. Luxembourg will remain the largest shareholder, through two public companies, the State Savings Bank and the National Credit and Investment Company, each retaining one third of the voting rights. The future company "will promote the development of digital satellite and cable transmission techniques for TV and radio programs and interactive services." The SES intends to use digital compression on its two future satellites, Astra-1E and Astra-1S, to be launched at the beginning of 1995 and 1996 respectively. With 40 repeaters each, these two satellites will broadcast up to 400 TV programs. This range of new services will enable consumers to pay only for what they choose, or even to place orders directly by telephone through a modem.
