Shevardnadze himself underwent a medical too. As might have been expected, no drug addicts were found in Shevardnadze's apparatus. Ramaz Sakvarelidze, head of the Georgian leader's press service, made the following comment on this unusual event: Drug addiction has penetrated the state's structures of authority. This is one means of combating it. All officials in ministries and departments along with the personnel of the parliament and cabinet of ministers apparatuses will undergo similar checks. The reason for the checks was the countless statements by Georgian parliamentarians to the effect that some members of the cabinet of ministers do drugs and are helping to form a drugs mafia in Georgia. At the same time the power ministries -- the Defense Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Affairs -- were the primary targets along with staffers in the apparatus of certain vice premiers. We will leave aside the effectiveness of these actions, since any sensible person is aware that these checks will have zero results in practice. The moral aspect is far more important. And it is hard to disagree with the opinion voiced by parliament Deputy Ivlian Khaindrav, who says that the enforced nature of these checks is offensive. As for the propaganda nature of the action, in the current situation it can only impress Joe Public. However, the problem of drug addiction in Georgia has indeed become menacing. Figures provided by the Georgian Internal Affairs Ministry Narcotics Administration demonstrate that the republic is one of the main staging posts for the international drug business. In the last few years there has been a considerable increase in drug use in Georgia itself. The country is now one of the world leaders in the field.
