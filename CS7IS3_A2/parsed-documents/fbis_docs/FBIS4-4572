According to several senior ruling coalition party officials, the plan to set up a new study group is aimed at coordinating various parties' basic policies regarding such general topics as constitutional issues and ideas about how Japan ought to be as a nation. They hope to set up the study group in April. Former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi (independent), who is one of the original proponents of the policy study group, is playing a major role in working out plans for the new group. Partial changes in the prospectus originally drawn up for the policy study group are planned. Changes are to include the removal of topics such as that calling for selecting "unified candidates" in preparation for future national elections and that for cooperation among the ruling coalition parties geared toward "formation of a new new party." In addition, study subjects are to be changed to more generalized topics instead of specific areas, and participation in the study group is to be on an individual basis, as a rule. On the morning of 30 March, Yamaguchi met SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama at the lower house official residence. Yamaguchi explained the new plan and sought his understanding. However, Murayama said he believed it is more important to resume Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 draft national budget.
