Riza Turmen, the Foreign Ministry director responsible for ties with the CSCE, told reporters that the "base" in Erzurum would serve as a supply center for the CSCE observers who would be placed in the region to supervise a cease-fire between Armenians and Azeris. The base in Erzurun would have a staff of 10 civilians, Turmen said. Turmen also said that the first group of 34 people was planned to be sent to the Caucasus as soon as a cease-fire was established. Two weeks later, another 64 would be dispatched and the number of CSCE observers would be increased to 350. Four Turks will also be participating in the CSCE mission, Turmen said. The mandate of the mission will be to supervise the cease-fire as well as the return of refugees. "This large group will need back-up facilities, and Erzurun was selected to be the suitable spot for such a base," he said. Various press reports have called the CSCE operation a "Poised Hammer for the Armenians," drawing parallels between the Erzurum base and the allied force stationed in the Southeast to deter Baghdad from attacking the Kurds. The Foreign Ministry has categorically denied any similarities.
