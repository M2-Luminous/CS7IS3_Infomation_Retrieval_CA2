This company has a centrifugal separation machine parts fabrication and assembly plant in Sendai City in Miyagi Prefecture, however, operations at the uranium enrichment facility by Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. has begun, and future expansion work is continuing in earnest. Because of this, and also because of a desire to increase the centrifugal separator transport efficiency, ensure product quality, and at the urging of the prefecture where the facility is located, the company decided to construct the final assembly processing plant at the Rokkasho-mura factory, within the Ogawara development zone which is adjacent to the enrichment plant, and transfer this function from the Sendai facility. As for the size of the facility, the area of the lot is around 40,000 square meters and the area of the construction site is approximately 4,000 square meters. The construction is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, and construction completion ceremonies are slated for January 1994. The commencement of assembly operations is planned to start around the end of this fiscal year [the end of March 1994], and they will perform assembly operations starting at a rate of 150 ton SWU/year of centrifugal separator for FY94. They plan, at first, to employ 20-30 people at this facility. The Uranium Enrichment Machinery Company was established with ¥3 billion, ¥1 billion each coming from Hitachi, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. This company, which was established in December 1984, is Japan's only uranium enrichment centrifugal separation machinery manufacturer. Currently, they employ around 300 people.
