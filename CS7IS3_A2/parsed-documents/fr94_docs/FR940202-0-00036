SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in this final regulation have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545&hyph;1353. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from .3 hours to .5 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of .4 hours. These estimates are an approximation of the average time expected to be necessary for a collection of information. They are based on such information as is available to the IRS. Individual respondents may require more or less time, depending on their particular circumstances. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Background On December 22, 1992, the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register (57 FR 60750) relating to original issue discount (OID) under section 163(e) and sections 1271 through 1275 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The notice also contained proposed amendments to the regulations under sections 446 (relating to the accrual of interest), 483 (relating to unstated interest), 1001 (relating to amount realized), and 1012 (relating to basis). The notice withdrew most of the proposed regulations that were previously published in the Federal Register on April 8, 1986 (51 FR 12022), as amended on May 7, 1991 (56 FR 21112), and July 12, 1991 (56 FR 31887). On February 16, 1993, the IRS held a public hearing on the proposed regulations. In addition, the IRS received a number of written comments on the proposed regulations. The proposed regulations, with certain changes to respond to comments, are adopted as final regulations; to permit further comment, §1.446&hyph;2(e)(3) remains outstanding in proposed form. The changes, as well as several comments and suggestions that were not adopted in the final regulations, are discussed below. Explanation of Provisions Section 1.163&hyph;7␣Deduction for OID on Certain Debt Instruments The final regulations retain the rule of the proposed regulations that allows the issuer of a debt instrument to deduct de minimis OID using a straight line method. As requested by a commentator, the final regulations also allow the issuer the choice of deducting de minimis OID at maturity or in proportion to stated interest payments. Because the proposed regulations permit flexible accrual periods, a commentator requested guidance on what accrual period controls to determine whether a debt instrument is an applicable high yield debt obligation under section 163(i). The final regulations provide that the issuer's choice of accrual periods governs for purposes of section 163(i).
