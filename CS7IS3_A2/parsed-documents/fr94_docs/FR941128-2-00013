FR941128-2-00013 FR941128-2-00010 [C&hyph;475&hyph;815] Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Small Diameter Circular Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel Standard, Line and Pressure Pipe (``Seamless Pipe'') From Italy AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas McGinty or Peter Wilkniss, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3099, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5055 and (202) 482&hyph;0588, respectively. Preliminary Determination The Department preliminarily determines that benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters of seamless pipe in Italy. For information on the estimated net subsidies, please see the Suspension of Liquidation section of this notice. Case History Since the publication of the notice of initiation in the Federal Register (59 FR 37028, July 20, 1994), the following events have occurred. On July 26 and 27, 1994, respectively, we issued countervailing duty questionnaires to the Government of Italy (``GOI'') and the Commission of the European Communities (``EC''), in Washington, D.C., concerning petitioner's allegations. On August 2, 1994, the GOI responded to the first section of our questionnaire informing us that Dalmine S.p.A. (``Dalmine''), an Italian steel pipe producer, accounted for more than 85 percent of Italian exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI. The GOI, the EC, and Dalmine submitted questionnaire responses on October 3, 1994. On October 18, 1994, we issued deficiency questionnaires to these parties. We received responses from the GOI and the EC on October 31, 1994, and from Dalmine on November 7, 1994. On August 24, 1994, we postponed the preliminary determination in this investigation until November 18, 1994 (59 FR 43554, August 24, 1994). Scope of Investigation For the purposes of this investigation, seamless pipes are seamless carbon and alloy (other than stainless) steel pipes, of circular cross-section, not more than 114.3 mm (4.5 inches) in outside diameter, regardless of wall thickness, manufacturing process (hot-finished or cold-drawn), end finish (plain end, bevelled end, upset end, threaded, or threaded and coupled), or surface finish. These pipes are commonly known as standard pipe, line pipe or pressure pipe, depending upon the application. They may also be used in structural applications. The seamless pipes subject to this investigation are currently classifiable under subheadings 7304.10.10.20, 7304.10.50.20, 7304.31.60.50, 7304.39.00.16, 7304.39.00.20, 7304.39.00.24, 7304.39.00.28, 7304.39.00.32, 7304.51.50.05, 7304.51.50.60, 7304.59.60.00, 7304.59.80.10, 7304.59.80.15, 7304.59.80.20, and 7304.59.80.25 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). The following information further defines the scope of this investigation, which covers pipes meeting the physical parameters described above: Specifications, Characteristics, and Uses: Seamless pressure pipes are intended for the conveyance of water, steam, petrochemicals, chemicals, oil products, natural gas, and other liquids and gasses in industrial piping systems. They may carry these substances at elevated pressures and temperatures and may be subject to the application of external heat. Seamless carbon steel pressure pipe meeting the American Society for Testing and Materials (``ASTM'') standard A&hyph;106 may be used in temperatures of up to 1000 degrees fahrenheit, at various American Society of Engineers (``ASME'') code stress levels. Alloy pipes made to ASTM standard A&hyph;335 must be used if temperatures and stress levels exceed those allowed for A&hyph;106 and the ASME codes. Seamless pressure pipes sold in the United States are commonly produced to the ASTM&hyph;106 standard. Seamless standard pipes are most commonly produced to the ASTM A&hyph;53 specification and generally are not intended for high temperature service. They are intended for the low temperature and pressure conveyance of water, steam, natural gas, air and other liquids and gasses in plumbing and heating systems, air conditioning units, automatic sprinkler systems, and other related uses. Standard pipes (depending on type and code) may carry liquids at elevated temperatures but must not exceed relevant ASME code requirements. Seamless line pipes are intended for the conveyance of oil and natural gas or other fluids in pipe lines. Seamless line pipes are produced to the API 5L specification. Seamless pipes are commonly produced and certified to meet ASTM A&hyph;106, ASTM A&hyph;53, and API 5L specifications. Such triple certifications of pipes is common because all pipes meeting the stringent A&hyph;106 specification necessarily meet the API 5L and ASTM A&hyph;53 specifications. Pipes meeting the API 5L specification necessarily meet the ASTM A&hyph;53 specification. However, pipes meeting the A&hyph;53 or API 5L specifications do not necessarily meet the A&hyph;106 specification. To avoid maintaining separate productions runs and separate inventories, manufacturers triple certify the pipes. Since distributors sell the vast majority of this product, they can thereby maintain a single inventory to service all customers.
