"We are offering South Korea cooperation in various fields, including the military." Yi Pyong-tae, for his part, noted that, during the flight from Tokyo to Moscow, the South Korean delegation "crossed the huge territory of Russia and we sensed the great potential of your country." As already reported, the defense ministers of Russia and the ROK are exchanging views on the development of the situation in Northeast Asia and, primarily, on the issue of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula. P. Grachev and Yi Pyong-tae will discuss ways of expanding Russian-South Korean military cooperation. A document on mutual understanding over measures to develop ties between the Defense Ministries of Russia and the ROK in 1994-95 is expected to be signed. During his stay in Russia, the head of the South Korean defense department will also meet high-ranking representatives of the Russian Government and will visit miltary units and defense enterprises.
