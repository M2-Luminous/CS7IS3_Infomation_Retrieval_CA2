It studied the specific ways to solve these problems and issued some preferential policies and measures. These policies and measures include mainly the following: 1. Finance departments, banks, and the enterprises engaged in the processing of these materials will make concerted efforts to arrange special funds to pay off the arrears owed peasants during the purchases of beets, flax, and flue-cured tobacco before the end of February. Efforts will be made to ensure that no new IOU is issued during this year's purchases. 2. The purchasing prices of beets, flax, and flue-cured tobacco will be adjusted. In this year's purchases of beets, the county will be taken as the accounting unit. The purchasing price of the beets whose sugar content is 16.5 percent or more will be increased from 155 yuan per tonne to 180 yuan, the purchasing price of the beets whose sugar content is lower than 16.5 percent will be increased from 140 yuan per tonne to 165 yuan, and 165 yuan per tonne will be the lowest protection price for the purchases. The purchasing price of flax will be increased by 20 to 40 percent from the current price. Regarding the purchasing price of flue-cured tobacco, the state already increased the overall price from 130 yuan per dan to 165 yuan last August, and therefore the price will not be adjusted this time. 3. Various preferential policies will be continued. In beet production, seeds will be sold at half the price, mix pesticides will be provided free of charge, and mileage subsidies will be given for transportation. The subsidy for vertical cultivation of seedlings will be increased from 36 yuan per mu to 54 yuan. Regarding flue-cured tobacco production, the profits and taxes will be shared 50 to 50 percent or 30 to 70 percent by the state and counties, and the money will be used in subsidizing peasants' production and supplies of materials. 4. Construction of sugar, flax, flue-cured tobacco production bases will be intensified, and integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture will be applied. Beginning this year, experiment will be conducted in the construction of the base areas. Every processing enterprises will select two to three major beet, flax, and flue-cured tobacco producing townships as the base areas. The focus is on the construction of the villages that applies the vertical cultivation of beet seedlings to 1,000 mu each and the villages that produce high yields thanks to comprehensive technology dissemination. These villages will be supported with certain amount of investment, and the overall coordinated service focusing on farm mechanization will be enhanced. To boost the enthusiasm of the governments at all levels, the provincial government decided that beginning this year, all specialized corporations should conduct the experiment first in two to three counties where conditions permit and define the base production figures of these raw materials. The economic benefits gained from the processing of the materials above the base figures will be shared 30 to 70 percent or 40 to 60 percent by the corporations and the counties so that the counties and the people can gain more benefits. The provincial government also urged the governments at all levels to adopt measures to ensure implementation of this year's beet, flax, and flue-cured tobacco production targets by all parts concerned. Based on the guidance plan formulated by the province, governments at all levels should continue to assign plans to every level and, on the premise that peasants' opinions are fully respected, to peasant households in the form of economic contracts so that peasants will know their production tasks one year ahead of time. Counties and townships should send a number of full-time cadres to coordinate with beet and flax mills to publicize the policies and provide service to villages and households, to resolve their misgivings and difficulties, and to organize well the signing of the contracts. They should also write down the preferential policies provided by higher levels in the contracts so that the responsibility of all parts concerned will be clarified. To meet the needs of the enterprises engaged in the processing of beets, flax, and flue-cured tobacco, the provincial government decided that this year, 6 million mu of beets will be planted, and the output will be 6 million tonnes; and 1.1 million mu of flax will be planted, and the output will be 180,000 tonnes. In flue-cured tobacco production, due to the outstripping of production over marketing in the country, the tobacco planting areas are arranged at 850,000 mu, and the output will be 85,000 tonnes.
