FR940317-1-00201 FR940317-1-00017 2. Disclosure of Unrated Debt Securities As proposed, both Rule 10b&hyph;10 and Rule 15c2&hyph;13 will require broker-dealers to disclose when a debt security, other than securities defined under Section 3(a)(42)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, 27 is not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Commission is not requiring the disclosure of the specific rating of a debt security because that information most likely will be disclosed to a customer when a broker-dealer sells such a security. Brokers are less likely to inform customers that a security is not rated. While the Commission recognizes that an unrated bond may not necessarily be unsound or speculative, this information will benefit investors by alerting them that they may want to make further inquiry of the broker-dealer. In the municipal securities market, this information is particularly useful because of the limited secondary market information in that market and the comparatively higher rates of issuer default for unrated municipal bonds. 28 The Commission requests comment whether securities other than U.S. Treasury securities should be excluded from this requirement. In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether this requirement as it relates to municipal securities should be incorporated in one rule under the authority of the MSRB. 27 15 U.S.C. 78(c)(a)(42)(A) and (B). 28 Statistics have shown that unrated municipal bonds, which make up approximately one-third of the market, in the aggregate have a higher default rate than do rated bonds. See Municipal Bond Defaults_The 1980's a Decade in Review 1&hyph;2, at 1, J.J. Kenny Co., Inc. 1993). According to this study on default rates between January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1991, 628 unrated issues defaulted compared with 98 rated issues.

Disclosure of Mark-Ups and Mark-downs in Certain Nasdaq and Exchange-Listed Securities Since 1985, Rule 10b&hyph;10 has required broker-dealers acting as principals in transactions in Reported Securities 29 to disclose on customer confirmations the reported trade price, the price to the customer, and the difference between the two prices. 30 In response to the expansion of last sale reporting to additional securities, the Commission is now proposing to amend Rule 10b&hyph;10 to require similar disclosure in principal transactions in Nasdaq equity securities that are not Nasdaq/NMS securities (``Nasdaq Small Cap Securities'') and certain exchange-listed securities. These securities are subject to last sale reporting, but are not included in the definition of ``Reported Security,'' as provided in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Exchange Act. 29 See, supra note 8 for the definition of ``Reported Securities.'' 30 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(8)(i)(B). The reported trade price is the price at which a broker-dealer reports a trade to NASDAQ or an exchange. Price to the customer means the ultimate price the customer pays or receives for a securities transaction, including any miscellaneous fees imposed by the broker-dealer. This would not include fees, such as taxes, SEC fees, or any other fees required by state or federal law. See, e.g., Letter regarding Cities Securities Corp. (Dec. 11, 1991) [available on LEXIS]. In April, 1992, the Commission approved a proposal by the NASD 31 to require last sale and volume reporting for all securities traded on Nasdaq. 32 Shortly afterwards, the NASD required its members to disclose to customers on written confirmations the reported trade price, the price to the customer, and the difference between the two prices in a particular Nasdaq Small Cap Securities transaction. 33 The NASD's rule provides customers who trade Nasdaq Small Cap Securities with the same compensation disclosure required under Rule 10b&hyph;10 for Nasdaq/NMS securities. 31 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30392 (Feb. 21, 1992), 57 FR 6880. 32 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30569 (Apr. 10, 1992), 57 FR 13396. 33 NASD Schedule to By-Laws, Schedule D, pt. XI, §3, NASD Manual (CCH) ¶1867D, approved in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30871 (June 29, 1992), 57 FR 30281. The proposed amendment would consolidate in Rule 10b&hyph;10 compensation disclosure applicable to all Nasdaq stocks. It also would extend this compensation disclosure to principal transactions in regional-exchange listed securities subject to last sale reporting. 34 Doing so would treat similar securities consistently and would provide benefits to customers with little additional burden on broker-dealers. Because securities traded through Nasdaq and regional exchanges are subject to last sale reporting requirements, and NASD members are required to disclose on confirmations the reported price, the customer's price, and the difference, capturing and disclosing the same information for purposes of complying with Rule 10b&hyph;10 would not appear to require systems changes or additional personnel. 34 Typically, these are securities of smaller companies that are listed and traded exclusively on one regional exchange. 4. Disclosure of Coverage by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation The Commission is proposing to require that the confirmation contain a disclosure concerning coverage under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (``SIPA''). 35 Under SIPA, all brokers or dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, with certain exceptions, 36 are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC''). In the event of the financial failure of a SIPC member broker-dealer, SIPC protects each customer up to $500,000 for claims for cash and securities, except that claims for cash are limited to $100,000. 35 Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970. Pub. L. 91&hyph;598, 64 Stat. 1836, as amended (codified at 15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq .). 36 The following broker-dealers are excluded from SIPC membership: (1) Government securities broker-dealers registered under section 15C of the Exchange Act; (2) persons whose principal business in the determination of SIPC (and subject to Commission approval) is conducted outside the United States; and (3) persons whose business consists exclusively of (a) the distribution of shares of registered open-end investment companies or unit investment trusts, (b) the sale of variable annuities, (c) the business of insurance, or (d) the business of rendering investment advisory services to one or more registered investment companies or insurance company separate accounts. SIPA secs. 3(a)(2)(A) and 16(12) 15 U.S.C. 78ccc(a)(2)(A) and 78lll(12). A number of incidents involving the financial failure of registered broker-dealers, and their unregistered affiliates, have illustrated the potential for confusion about the application of SIPC coverage to customers' accounts. In one of these cases, a registered broker-dealer and its government securities affiliate were commonly owned, shared personnel and office facilities, and did not distinguish between the two entities in certain written and oral communications, leading to customer confusion concerning SIPC coverage. 37 Because government securities brokers and dealers registered under section 15C of the Exchange Act are not members of SIPC, their customer accounts are not protected by SIPC. 38 37 See generally, SEC v. Donald Sheldon Group, Inc. et al., Admin. Pro. File No. 3&hyph;6626 (Dec. 2, 1988). 38 See, supra note 33. In order to reduce the potential for confusion regarding whether SIPC coverage exists for accounts with government securities dealers, as well as other cases where an investor might mistakenly assume that SIPC coverage exists, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule 10b&hyph;10 to require broker-dealers that are not SIPC members to affirmatively state in the customer confirmation that they are not SIPC members and to require disclosure if the account is carried by a broker or a dealer that is not a SIPC member. This disclosure requirement would be consistent with the authority granted to the Commission concerning SIPC disclosure under the Government Securities Acts Amendments of 1993. 39 39 15 U.S.C. 78O&hyph;5(a)(4). 5. Disclosure for Certain Asset-Backed Securities The Commission is proposing to amend the yield disclosure requirements with respect to asset-backed securities. The Rule currently requires broker-dealers that effect transactions in debt securities, other than U.S. Savings Bonds or municipal securities, to disclose: (1) The yield to maturity, if the transaction is effected on the basis of dollar price; (2) if the transaction is effected on a yield basis, then the dollar price calculated from that yield; and (3) if effected on a basis other than dollar price or yield to maturity, and the yield to maturity will be less than the represented yield, then both the yield to maturity and represented yield. When these amendments were adopted, the Commission noted the importance of yield data to an investor in transactions in debt securities. 40 The yield, or dollar price, at which a transaction is effected in the secondary market will be directly related to the anticipated maturity. Thus, features that cause a debt security to pay sooner or later than expected will alter the actual yield that an investor receives. 40 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19687 (April 18, 1983), 49 FR 17583.
