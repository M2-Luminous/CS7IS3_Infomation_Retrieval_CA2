"We're ready to start publishing on February 1," said Steve Vines, the new paper's editor, who claimed the EASTERN EXPRESS -- owned by the Oriental Press Group -- would be "independently minded" with no political affiliations. Local analysts have welcomed the emergence of a new English- language newspaper, with many saying the newspaper had taken the best selling point by insisting on its independence at this politically sensitive time. While, in theory, a free press flourishes in Hong Kong, in the transition to China's takeover of the British colony in 1997, the future of the press remains uncertain. As a result, some dailies are shifting stances towards China, with many engaging in self-censorship to avoid offending Beijing, giving the EASTERN EXPRESS the chance to exploit the psychological advantage of being "neutral." The two established English-language dailies have taken notice of the market newcomer, changing formats and offering giveaways in an effort to keep their readers from deserting to the EASTERN EXPRESS. The market leader SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST -- which Tuesday touted its spruced up "bigger, better" business pages -- is offering nine Mercedes Benz cars in a competition for its readers. The HONG KONG STANDARD has also radically changed its format and logo, and now offers a weekly colour magazine and the CHINA DAILY'S BUSINESS WEEKLY as a supplement every Monday. "We are delighted by the response from our competitors," Vines said. "We will have a place in the market," he said confidently. The ORIENTAL EXPRESS [as published] has bought German-made presses at a cost of 24 million dollars which will print more than twice as fast and with about the third of the labour of current presses in use here. The new daily plans an initial circulation of 60,000 copies a day. Its sister publication, the Chinese-language ORIENTAL DAILY, currently claims a readership of 1.6 million. The emergence of the new newspaper followed the purchase by Chinese-Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok -- who has substantial business interests in China -- of a 24.9 percent stake in the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. Kuok's acquisition prompted fears the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST would adopt a more pro-China stance, although the reclusive entrepreneur has said he planned no change in its editorial policy. The Chinese language press ranges from pro-Beijing to pro-Taiwan. The launching of the EASTERN EXPRESS adds to the colony's existing 67 newspapers and 608 periodicals -- including 39 Chinese- language dailies and two English-language dailies -- the world's highest rate of newspapers per person. Timothy Hamlett, a media lecturer at the Baptist College, said the new newspaper would give Hong Kong an average of two and a half newspapers per person in the colony of six million people. But, he said, despite the saturated press industry, "the launching of a third English-language daily is worth experimenting" with. "There is an obvious temptation to take the non-left wing stance," he said, "whether it will work is another question." "It is a fantastic development," said media analyst James Miles of Asia Equity, but he predicted it would take at least six months to see whether the newspaper was profitable. "It will offer more choice to consumers," said media analyst Kirk Sweeney of Lehman Brothers. "It remains to be seen whether the editorial policy will be independent," he added.
