Denny] [Text] Johannesburg March 13 SAPA -- The African National Congress [ANC] has welcomed the appointment of former Bophuthatswana Ambassador Professor Tjaart van der Walt as administrator of the strife-torn homeland. Congratulating the Batswana for their "courageous struggle against the brutal Mangope regime," the ANC said in a statement on Sunday [13 March] the homeland's residents could now engage in free political activity and next month's election. "We urge all to exercise this hard won right in a peaceful and orderly manner," the statement said. It condemned the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] and other white rightwingers who had tried to keep President Lucas Mangope's government in power. "Their efforts were doomed from the start and turned out to be a pathetic and dismal failure. Many died because of their brutal and blundering thuggery -- including some in their own ranks -- and many more sustained serious injuries. We hope that rightwingers, who have in the past so easily threatened violence, will now finally realise that war is no solution," the statement said. Now was the time for all democrats to take hands and ensure that every South African voted next month without fear of violence or intimidation.
