FR940622-1-00021 FR940622-1-00009 The 6 regional workshops of January and February 1994, were sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the Coastal States Organization (CSO). Attendance at the workshops included federal, state, Indian, and foreign trustees, industry, protection and indemnity (P&I) clubs, environmental groups, and private citizens. Information disseminated for the workshops included NOAA's proposed rule, an outline of the proposed rule, a draft memorandum of agreement, and an agenda for the workshops. The purpose of the agenda was to reach agreement on many of the issues of cooperative NRDA through open discussion among participants. This Notice provides a summary of information, concerns and recommendations received by NOAA at the workshops and requests further comment on specific issues raised by NOAA and members of the public at the workshops. In addition, this Notice makes available to the public a document summarizing the proceedings at the six workshops on cooperative damage assessment. The document entitled ``Summary Report of Six Cooperative Natural Resource Damage Assessment Workshops'' is available upon request to the address provided above. Issues on Injury and Related Concepts Sections 1002(a) and (b)(2) of OPA establish the elements for a natural resource damage claim. Under OPA, a party responsible for a vessel or facility is liable if there is (1) a discharge or a substantial threat of discharge (2) of oil (3) from the vessel or facility (4) into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the Exclusive Economic Zone. Damages are measured in terms of the injury to natural resources resulting from such an incident. Damages resulting from an incident include those associated with injury to, destruction of, loss of, and loss of use of natural resources. OPA adds the phrase ``loss of use of'' which is not explicit under CERCLA. The proposed rule defines ``injury'' to incorporate these concepts. The damage assessment process as under the proposed rule is designed to: determine if there is an injury to a natural resource (Injury Determination), and subsequently quantify the extent of those injuries (Injury Quantification). The OPA proposed rule defines ``injury'' as ``any adverse change in a natural resource or impairment of a service provided by a resource.'' While measurement is not required for Injury Determination, it is usually needed for Injury Quantification. It is necessary to quantify the injury to provide the basis for restoration and determine the extent or amount of damages. Injury Quantification also may be relevant in establishing that the natural resource injuries resulted from or were caused by the incident. In contrast to the definition under the proposed rule, ``injury'' under the CERCLA regulations is generally defined as ``a measurable adverse change, either long- or short-term, in the chemical or physical quality or the viability of a natural resource resulting either directly or indirectly from exposure to a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance, or exposure to a product of reactions resulting from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance.'' The CERCLA regulations provide specific injury definitions for various categories of natural resources in the Injury Determination Phase.
