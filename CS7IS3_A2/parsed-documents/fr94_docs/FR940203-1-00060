FR940203-1-00060 FR940203-1-00013 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR 192.3 define a gas service line as a distribution line that transports gas from a common source of supply to (1) a customer meter or the connection to a customer's piping, whichever is farther downstream, or (2) the connection to a customer's piping if there is no customer meter. The source of supply for most gas services is a main commonly located in the street. For service lines to homes and buildings, the customer meter, which measures the transfer of gas from the operator to the consumer, is commonly located adjacent to (outside or inside) an exterior wall. A service line may also end at a customer meter adjacent to end-use gas equipment. For all of the above installations, the operator is responsible for compliance with part 192 standards from the common source of supply (e.g., the main) to the end of the service line. Customer-Owned Service Lines Not all customer meters are located adjacent to a home or building wall or end-use equipment. Some customer meters are located at property lines or at other locations more convenient for the gas distribution operator or for the customer. In such cases, the service line ends at the meter and the pipe running from the outlet of the meter to the exterior wall or end-use equipment is called a customer-owned service line. Instances also exist where there is no customer meter or the operator-owned service line extends beyond the meter to the connection to a customer's piping. In such cases, the pipe running from this connection to the exterior wall or end-use equipment is called a customer-owned service line. Customer-owned service lines are also known as ``yard lines'' and ``fuel lines''. A ``farm tap'' is a customer-owned service line that begins at a customer meter, usually adjacent to a gas transmission line, and runs (often a considerable distance) to a single consumer. For the purposes of this notice, each of the above situations is referred to as a customer-owned service line. Customer-owned service lines are thought to comprise 12 to 17 percent of the piping that transports natural gas from distribution mains to homes, businesses, and other consumers. These lines are predominantly found in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia. Many states have few, if any, customer-owned service lines because the customer meter is adjacent to the home or building wall or the state regulatory agency has required the distribution operator to be responsible for operation and maintenance of the service line up to the home or building wall, regardless of where the meter is placed. These states include California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Federal pipeline safety regulations do not cover customer-owned service lines, although a few states have issued regulations and some gas distribution operators voluntarily maintain these lines to part 192 standards. In most states, the material, design, construction, corrosion control, testing, and maintenance of customer-owned service lines is left to the discretion of people who may not be familiar with part 192 requirements for service lines. This has resulted in instances of improper installation and minimal or no maintenance of these lines. Over the last five years, one-third of all pipeline-related fatalities reported to the Department of Transportation involved distribution lines running from mains to homes and other buildings. An unregulated customer-owned service line buried downstream of a customer meter is prone to the same environmental stresses (corrosion and earth settlement) and excavation damage hazards as a regulated service line buried upstream of a customer meter. However, because of its proximity to homes, businesses and schools, the unregulated segment of a customer-owned service line buried downstream of a customer meter poses a greater risk to people and property than the regulated segment of the line buried upstream of the meter. The safety of customer-owned service lines first emerged as an issue after a series of five natural gas incidents occurred during a 7-month period beginning September 16, 1988, in the Kansas City-Topeka area. These instances resulted in four fatalities, twelve injuries, and the destruction of four homes. In three of those incidents, the failures were attributed to corrosion on unprotected customer-owned service lines. As a result of these incidents, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, and New York made significant changes to their state's pipeline safety regulations. These changes included extending the state regulatory authority over service lines to the building wall. Under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (49 App. U.S.C. 1671 et seq. ), states may adopt more stringent safety regulations than the Federal regulations if the state regulations are not incompatible with federal regulations.
