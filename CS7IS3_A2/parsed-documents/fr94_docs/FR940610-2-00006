ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of countervailing duty administrative review. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative review of the countervailing duty order on certain electrical conductor aluminum redraw rod from Venezuela for the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. There are no known entries in the review period. Therefore, we preliminarily determine that the cash deposit rate of estimated countervailing duties will be 0.50 percent ad valorem, the rate established in the final results of the last administrative review of this order (57 FR 36063; August 12, 1992). We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gayle Longest or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 41239) for the countervailing duty order on certain electrical conductor aluminum redraw rod from Venezuela (53 FR 31904; August 22, 1988). We received a request for review from Southwire Company, the petitioner. We initiated the review, covering the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992, on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51053). The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The final results of the last administrative review of this order were published in the Federal Register on September 14, 1992 (57 FR 41918). Scope of Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of certain electrical conductor aluminum redraw rod from Venezuela, which is wrought rod of aluminum that is electrically conductive and contains not less than 99 percent of aluminum by weight. This merchandise is currently classifiable under item numbers 7604.10.3010, 7604.10.3050, 7604.29.3010, 7604.29.3050, 7605.11.0030, 7605.11.0090, 7605.19.0000, 7605.21.0030, 7605.21.0090 and 7605.29.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review period is January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. In its questionnaire response, the Government of Venezuela reported no shipments of the subject merchandise to the United States during the review period. On April 7, 1994, Southwire Company submitted factual information regarding possible shipments of subject merchandise during the review period. We subsequently confirmed through various Customs, Census, and Import Administration sources that there were no known entries of the subject merchandise during the review period. See Memorandum to the File dated May 19, 1994; Certain Electrical Conductor Aluminum Redraw Rod from Venezuela No Shipment Search, which is on file in the Central Records Unit (room B099 of the Main Commerce Building). Preliminary Results of Review As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that there are no known entries of the subject merchandise exported to the United States in the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. Therefore, we preliminarily determine the estimated net subsidy to be 0.50 percent ad valorem, the cash deposit rate established in the final results of the last administrative review (57 FR 36063; August 12, 1992). If the final results of this review remain the same as these preliminary results, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties of 0.50 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of the subject merchandise from Venezuela entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results of this review. Interested parties may request a hearing, not later than 10 days after the date of publication of this notice. Interested parties may submit written arguments in case briefs on these preliminary results within 30 days of the date of publication in accordance with 19 CFR 355.38(c). Rebuttal briefs, limited to arguments raised in case briefs, may be submitted seven days after the time limit for filing the case brief. Any hearing, if requested, will be held seven days after the scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs. Copies of case briefs and rebuttal briefs must be served on interested parties in accordance with 19 CFR 355.38(e). Representatives of parties to the proceeding may request disclosure of proprietary information under administrative protective order no later than 10 days after the representative's client or employer becomes a party to the proceeding, but in no event later than the date the case briefs are due. The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief or at a hearing. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.22. Dated: June 1, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14207 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
