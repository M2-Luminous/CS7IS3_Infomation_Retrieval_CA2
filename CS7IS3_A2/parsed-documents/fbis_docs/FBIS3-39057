The RP has not neglected the Alawis in its calls to various circles urging them to join the party. The RP's favorite targets in their recruitment efforts have been Turkey's fashion models, with women with modern or Western appearances coming in second and, finally, the Alawis following in third. Alawis, who have distanced themselves from Islamic circles for years, were stunned at Professor Izzettin Dogan's (a prominent Alawi leader known as "Dede" or grandfather) flirtation with the party and subsequent acceptance of the RP's party line. Dogan's move has elicited a harsh reaction from the Alawis as well as from other prominent figures. Some, unable to find another explanation for his actions, have even concluded that Dogan might actually have lost his mind and described his stance as a betrayal of the Alawis. On the other hand, it is claimed that Nurettin Yildirim, an Alawi who entered the RP with great fanfare, does not enjoy prestige among the Alawis and that he only joined the RP because he had been rejected by all the other parties. The cloud of doubt cast over the sincerity of Yildirim's conversion to the RP ideology has led to allegations that the RP's Alawi recruits may be contrived. The fact that Yildirim, who has been completely ostracized by the Alawis for having joined the RP, has stated on various occasions that he has been the victim of an RP trap, is noteworthy. Yildirm had previously served as the secretary general for the now defunct Unity Party (BP) which was founded by Mustafa Timisi. It is alleged that Yildirim, who has also served in the Republican People's Party (CHP) as well as the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), has been unable to achieve any noteworthy successes throughout his political career. RP Parliamentary Group Deputy Chairman Sevket Kazan said that his party refrained from laying down any prerequisites for joining the RP. Kazan said that the RP opened its doors to anyone who wanted to join. Pointing out that he and his colleagues did not discriminate between members of Sunni and Alawi Muslim sects, Kazan said that the RP was open to anyone who believed in God. He noted that the RP's grassroots constituency had not reacted negatively to growing Alawi membership in the party. In reply to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS' question as to what he thought about the statements that Dogan, who claimed to speak on behalf of the Alawis, was no longer influential within or representative of the group, Kazan said: "This is a case of sour grapes. He was very valuable until he joined the RP. Has he suddenly become useless after having entered the RP?" Asked if his party would nominate Alawis in localities where they formed the dominant constituency, Kazan said: "Of course. The issue is being discussed among the party's rank and file and the most popular individual is nominated as a candidate from the RP." When he was reminded of the fact that Alawi organizations were opposed to such an association with the RP, Kazan said that, on the contrary, his party was aware of the number of Alawis who supported a strong RP-Alawi relationship. Although Kazan said that the RP would indiscriminately welcome anyone who wanted to join the party, Alawis have stressed that a move to the RP would constitute a betrayal to their own history. It has been claimed that Dogan -- who is known as an Alawi dede, or prominent leader -- has been attempting to cooperate with rightist parties since the late Turgut Ozal's administration. His apparent goal was to merge Alawis with the right wing within the framework of a "Turkish-Islam synthesis" and reportedly held several meetings with Ozal in order to achieve this vision. Dogan said that the idea of creating an alliance with the RP came up during a visit to Germany after having met with Ali Yuksel, who identified himself as the Seyhulislam (grand mufti). Among other issues, the alliance addresses the allocation of an Alawi budget by the Religious Affairs Directorate (Diyanet), the provision of sites for the observance of Alawi religious ceremonies and the assurance that Alawis will have unobstructed freedom to worship. Dogan, who has been severely chastised by other Alawis for his move to the RP, reportedly has a history of establishing alliances with rightist parties, including the now defunct Nationalist Democracy Party (MDP), which was created by the military following the Sept. 12, 1980 coup and of which he was among the founding members. In addition to Dogan, who has been confronted by harsh criticism from Alawis and their organizations, it has been announced that Yildirim will be officially expelled from the Pir Sultan Abdal Association, a prominent Alawi organization. Murtaza Demir, the head of the association, has perhaps expressed the strongest opposition to reports of Dogan's collaboration with the RP. In a joint statement made with Hikmet Ozkan -- a relative of one of the victims of the Sivas tragedy -- on behalf of the people who were burned to death in Sivas, Demir said he and his colleagues interpreted Dogan's stance as a "betrayal of the Alawis." Demir continued saying that despite the fact that it was well known that those who incited and participated in the Sivas massacre were pro-Shariah, it was noteworthy that Dogan, who identified himself as an Alawi Dede and was a scientist by training, had deliberately chosen to establish close ties with the RP. Demir said that Dogan's decision to join a party whose platform was hostile toward the republic and to the principles of secularism and democracy was Dogan's own business. However, Demir added that he and his colleagues did not understand why Dogan insisted on establishing these ties in the name of the Anatolian Alawis and within his role as an Alawi Dede. Demir maintained that Dogan's move into the pro-Shariah fold has led Alawism to become a subject of controversy. Pointing out that he and other Alawis in the community regarded Dogan's association with the pro-Shariah party as an unpardonable offense, Demir said: "This is considered a betrayal of Anatolian Alawism. Alawis do not support pro-Shariah and undemocratic parties and organizations. They will not permit unqualified people to represent their personal interests." Yet another critic of Dogan's is Ahmet Sahin, the chairman of the Alawi Association for the Promotion of the Haci Bektas Culture. Sahin said that Alawis will simply ridicule Dogan if he attempts to claim to be representing Alawi interests as an RP member. He said that Dogan must have lost his mind if he believed that he was actually speaking on behalf of the Alawi community and added that Dogan's relationship with the RP is nothing but a betrayal to the Alawis. Asked if he and his colleagues would support any political party during the local elections, Sahin said they would make their decision according to the qualifications of the candidates. But, he did say that they would be backing only progressive and democratic candidates. Similarly, other Alawi organizations and publications also have criticized the establishment of ties with the RP, using almost the same style of speech and language. They went as far as to say that the formation of such an alliance could not even be possible. According to figures from the State Institute of Statistics (DIE), there are 12 million Alawis in Turkey, or 20 percent of the overall population. However, it is a well-known fact that Alawis have refrained from identifying themselves with any one organization or party, although in the past they used to cooperate with the Democrat Party (DP). In subsequent years, they seem to have moved steadily toward the social democrat and radical leftist parties. In fact, the community's reluctance to rally around only one organization or party, despite their large numbers, has become a subject of criticism among many Alawis, especially those who recognize their potential for political power within the country. However, recently, Alawis have increasingly begun to join right- leaning parties and have quickly moved up their ranks to hold top leadership positions. During the past one or two years, Alawis have started to lean more and more toward organizations that emphasize the importance of religious or cultural unity rather than that of political unity. Many cultural organizations and publications have been founded to pursue this goal, such as the Pir Sultan Abdal Cultural Association, the Association for the Promotion of the Haci Bektas Veli Culture, and the Cem and Nefes magazines. Meanwhile the social democratic parties have steadily been losing the support of the Alawi community, especially since the July 2, 1993 fundamentalist riot in Sivas, in which 33 participants of the Pir Sultan Abdal Cultural Association's conference were burned to death in their Madimak Hotel. The fact that the SHP was a junior coalition partner in the government during the exhibition of gross negligence by security forces during the incident, has angered many Alawis and soured relations between them and the social democratic party. However, due to the upcoming local elections, Alawis have now begun to discuss the subject of which party they will support. Meanwhile, in order to announce their candidacies before the deadline, many Alawis have returned to the SHP and plan to run on that party's ticket during the elections. Some Alawis, particularly those who lost relatives during the Sivas riot, have protested against the SHP alliance, however, many within the SHP rank and file claim that Alawi opposition to the SHP is only temporary and will diminish over time. In fact, this reconciliation between the Alawis and the SHP did not need much time at all as, following reports of Alawi movements towards the RP, prominent Alawi figures have accelerated their contacts with the SHP. It has been reported that most of the Alawis chosen to be municipal candidates are those who have lost relatives during the Sivas incident. Alawis are continuing to hold meetings to determine their final positions for the local elections. Reportedly, Alawis will favor progressive-democratic candidates, particularly those selected by the SHP; independent candidates; or those nominated by other leftist parties, depending on their qualifications and the situation prevailing in the specific locality. In any case, it is expected that the RP will receive neither political support nor participation from Alawi voters. While Alawis emphasize this point, they also note that it is well known that those 100 or 200 Alawis who have opted to join the RP, have done so only after aggressive coaxing by members of the RP rank and file. On the other hand, the RP has claimed that new Alawis continue to join their party and that the names of new Alawis members will be revealed during a ceremony in which the RP will announce its mayoral candidates for the upcoming elections. However, those that join the RP can expect to face strong disapproval from the Confederation of Alawi Unions in Germany, one of the fiercest critics of any Alawi movement toward the RP. The federation has rejected any Alawi who has joined the RP. Ali Riza Gulcicek, who heads the Alawi Unions Confederation, said that those who had decided to join the ranks of the oppressors cannot expect to continue to represent the Alawi community. Culcicek said: "Cooperation of the RP--which is the culprit of the Sivas massacre, the defender of the massacre and hostile to secularism and democracy--with the Alawis is a betrayal of Alawi belief and tradition. At a time when we are still suffering from the freshness of our pain and when a gang of murderers sits in the halls of justice as heroes who have committed a massacre in the name of God, such cooperation is the equivalent of having taken part in the crime and of having vindicated the murderers of their despicable crime." In its statement, the federation maintained that cooperation between the RP and Alawis would not serve the establishment of an Alawi-Sunni brotherhood. It stressed that those who advocated the conversion of Alawis to Sunni religious ideology could not possibly have any Alawi links. While the confederation said that it did not insist that those who wanted to cooperate with the reactionary forces stop, the confederation did emphasize that it would be in their best interest to sever their links to the Alawi community altogether. Stressing that Alawis would not cooperate the RP, the statement ended with the quote, "We do not want new Hiriz Pashas." During the Ottoman period Hizir Pasha, the then governor of Sivas, ordered the hanging of Pir Sultan Abdal, a renowned poet famous for his progressive ideology.
