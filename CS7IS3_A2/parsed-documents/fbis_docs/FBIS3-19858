In this way, Tietmeyer alluded to the Bundesbank's opportunities within the framework of its open-market policy. "We have been using all our room for maneuver on stability policies and we will continue to do so," the Bundesbank president said. However, the Bundesbank also must not fail to see the risks that still threaten stability. In this respect, the Association for the Protection of Savers is right with its statement that the war against inflationary forces has not yet been won. However, progress has been made on the road to greater stability. February inflation is still clearly above 3 percent, but without the gasoline-tax increase there would already be a 2 before the decimal point, Tietmeyer said. However, a considerable part of this improvement is due to lower import prices and thus not earned in Germany. The Bundesbank president also assessed the latest collective agreements as a positive signal for future monetary stability. After some wrong tracks in the past, the parties to collective agreements have now turned into the road of reason, he said. However, the Bundesbank is concerned about the strong expansion of the money supply. The M3 value, which increased by more than 20 percent in January, is the value for one month calculated on a yearly basis, and it is distorted by special factors. However, the liquidation effect resulting from the new tax regulation may not disappear in the short term, all the more so since the latest wait-and-see attitude on the capital markets has not yet been overcome. The money supply continues to be an important indicator for the bank, he said. However, the money supply is a yearly and not a monthly target, Tietmeyer stressed. Moreover, it is only an intermediate target on the road to the actual objective of price stability. At any rate, the latest development on the international capital markets has little to do with the development of the money supply in Germany and even less with the Bundesbank's policy. This is shown not least by developments on the foreign exchange market. Referring to the criticism of the trend of earnings of German banks, Tietmeyer said that it is precisely in periods of economic weakness that well-founded and highly profitable banks are important for the economy as a whole. They are a stabilizing factor in an altogether difficult and insecure environment. However, the Bundesbank president also added: "Of course, this does not mean that the ability to pass on relief from the Bundesbank is already being fully utilized by all banks." In the efforts to improve the efficiency of Germany as a financial location, the introduced reorganization and reduction of minimum reserves by the Bundesbank fits the new scene very well. "However, the reduction of minimum reserves is not the first step toward their abolition," the Bundesbank president stressed. The Bundesbank thinks that the instrument of minimum reserves continues to be indispensable, and it will advocate that minimum reserves will also become one of the monetary policy instruments of the future European Central Bank. In his speech, FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel made it clear that the FRG Government wants to continue to support the development of Germany as a financial location. However, when Waigel said that the tax on interest income is the best decision, he met with a clear response in the hall. Waigel countered by saying that the tax on interest income was developed with the participation of a representative of the association and he told the bankers present: "I will gladly pass on your annoyance to Karlsruhe, but you cannot vent it on the finance minister here in Bonn."
