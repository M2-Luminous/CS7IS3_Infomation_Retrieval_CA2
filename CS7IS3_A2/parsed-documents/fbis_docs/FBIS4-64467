Inacker report: "The Inspector General Calms the Troops"] [Text] Bonn -- In spite of the suspension of the plan to reduce the armed forces and compulsory military service, the Bundeswehr leadership expects considerable changes within the Bundeswehr by spring 1995. A coalition round stopped the "conceptional guidelines" by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) as recently as last week, according to which the strength of the Bundeswehr was to have been reduced from 370,000 to 340,000 or 320,000 men, and the length of compulsory military service from 12 to 10 months. This was the Defense Ministry's response to the drastic cuts in the defense budget, and it wanted to raise money for an increase in investments. Also, the fact was to be taken into consideration that about 40,000 recruits would be missing in the second half of the 1990s to preserve a strength of 370,000 men. According to information received by WELT AM SONNTAG, the inspector general of the Bundeswehr, General Klaus Naumann, prepared the armed forces in an "internal troop information" for the fact that there will be no restructuring in the election year 1994, but that fundamental changes are to be expected in 1995. With the telex that was sent to the troops on 21/22 April, the inspector general wanted to eliminate the unease among the troops that was caused by the public debate. The telex states that a political consensus and a corresponding "planning order" for the restructuring of the Bundeswehr are to be expected by the summer. Moreover, the general hinted that it might be possible to reduce the armed forces "to a limited extent," while at the same ensuring an increase to the original extent. Compulsory military service "might" also be reduced, Naumann announced, without mentioning details. However, a "decision on the implementation" of the plans in the Bundeswehr is not to be expected "before spring 1995," the general told his troops. Thus, Germany's young men are facing changes. If the Ministry's plans should be implemented, the young men will be able to organize their military service in a more flexible way than in the past: - If they join the "main defense forces," they will do a "condensed" military service of 10 months, but not be trained for full serviceability. - If they want to join the crisis-reaction forces, they can chose between a 12-month active service or service as "soldiers who sign up for a certain number of months" (SaM), with the option of between 15 and 18 months. - In addition, the conscripts can sign up for a certain number of years (SaZ) -- between two and 12 years. As early as the second half of 1994, some of the conscripts that are found unfit are likely to be called up for service, too. Changed fitness criteria should reduce the annual average number of 80,000 young men that are unfit for military service by up to 30,000. Whether they will actually join the Bundeswehr, whether they will refuse to do military service, or whether they will make use of other alternatives is unclear. Initial calculations at the Defense Ministry proceed from a number of at most 10,000 additional recruits with a "serviceability related to a certain activity." Whereas the duration of the military service is to remain unchanged, there will be certain exceptions regarding the training of those who are only fit to a limited extent, which, however, will not make the training of the "healthy" conscripts easier. WELT AM SONNTAG learned that the Bundeswehr has prepared a total of 4,000 positions (primarily positions on the staffs) for those who are only fit to a limited extent. Because of the drastic increase in the number of young men refusing to do military service, the discrimination against soldiers as compared with conscientious objectors is to be reduced. After the defense commissioner noted a growing inequality between those doing military service and those opting for alternative national service in his most recent report, the Federal Government is to draw up a report on the actual situation. Investigations by WELT AM SONNTAG revealed that, in some cases, graduated doctors fulfill part of their hospital training during their alternative national service. In an interview with WELT AM SONNTAG, the defense spokesman of the Bundestag group of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, Paul Breuer, suggested increasing the value of military service vis-a-vis the national alternative service. Breuer stated: "Only the young men who have done 12 months of basic military service must be prepared to defend the peace and the freedom of our people with their own lives." Thus, "no service in peacetime, however moral and noble it may be," can compare in any way to "risking one's life." Breuer complained that, in its current form, the alternative national service is no longer the "cumbersome alternative" that it should be according to a ruling by the Constitutional Court. Improved material incentives, the possibility to choose the place and type of work, that fact that the young men do not have to spend the night in barracks, but can stay with their families and girl-friends have improved the "quality of the alternative national service at the expense of military service" in the eyes of the young men. Breuer pointed out that the high reputation of those who are doing alternative national service mainly stems from the idea that they are taking care of extremely handicapped persons. The truth, however, is "that only 4 percent of all those doing alternative service are active in this sphere -- which is approximately 4,000 of a total of 100,000 young men doing alternative service." Thus, those "who do not want to adapt the duration of the alternative national service to that of the basic military service and who do not want to clearly tighten the permit procedures are not acting on the basis of the constitution," Breuer stated with a view to SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] calls for a reduction of the alternative national service.
