He is allowed visitors on Wednesdays. His wife Isabel, his closest relatives and friends, and his colleagues who share the prison with him have promised to organize a barbecue to celebrate his birthday during the two-hour visit allowed by the prison. Outside the Real Felipe prison, however, his assistants and friends are organizing another celebration: The birth of the 13 November Movement (M-13), a nonpolitical organization created with the objective of obtaining amnesty for military officers imprisoned at Real Felipe and the vindication of the name of those who suffered ill-treatment or persecution following the 13 November 1992 constitutional rebellion. The M-13 will be officially launched on 18 February (the first anniversary of Sedo's sentencing) during a news conference "somewhere in Lima." The place will be announced only hours before to prevent interference from SIN [National Intelligence Service] agents. The founding documents will be signed on 20 February during a spartan ceremony that is expected to take place at the Real Felipe prison yard before the arrested military officers. The M-13 is inspired by a UN resolution that condemns the imprisonment of the constitutionalist officers, and by a growing national and international support for the rebels release. It promises a hard legal battle that will create headaches for the military leadership that rules the country from behind the presidential chair. Surveys show that Salinas Sedo has the important support of 6 percent of the voters. He has become a serious presidential alternative, creating a new front to compete against Javier Perez de Cuellar and Ricardo Belmont's possible candidacies. For this reason the sponsors of M-13 stress: "The movement seeks amnesty for the arrested military officers and a ban on partisan politics in the barracks. The movement seeks to contribute to Peru's democratic stabilization through the support of all the institutions and individuals who want to live in a country where the Constitution prevails over authoritarian adventures." In an interview on the Radio Miraflores "Double Meaning" program, Javier Valle Riestra defined Salinas Sedo's possible presidential candidacy in these terms: "Some people go to jail from powerful positions, others rise to power from jail. General Salinas is a Peruvian citizen imprisoned for defending the Constitution. He is willing to fight for democracy. He has a military background and a seducing Peruvian character. This is why he must be pardoned. His sentence does not disqualify him from participating in elections." [passage omitted] We wanted to ask Salinas Sedo his opinion on the "Cantuta Law" which the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] approved rather hastily. [passage omitted] There were rumors of a possible coup the day the CCD approved the measure. Salinas Sedo was aware of the problem: "The rumor might be true, but a coup now would be entirely wrong. We must allow Fujimori to complete his term. We want the people to realize that his perpetuation in power is not good for the country." Salinas Sedo showed more concern for the possible consequences of the arrest of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Panaherrera, alias "Vaticano." I do not know if "Vaticano's report is correct, but if it is, it will have very serious repercussions and the effects will be worse than the revolt created by La Cantuta because the corruption caused by traffickers can destroy the Peruvian Army." [passage omitted] Concerning the National Police "reorganization" following the guidelines established by the SIN, Salinas Sedo recognized that many organizations need reorganizing. He said: "I do not understand why the government is seeking to minimize the activities of Dincote which, paradoxically, has given the government its best results. The only reason is the egoist and jealous attitude of the SIN."
