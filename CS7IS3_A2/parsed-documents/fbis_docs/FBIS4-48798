First and foremost, I would like to thank you once again and to pay you tribute for the courage, determination, and sense of civic duty you have displayed since the beginning of the process to democratize our country and our institutions. After the 6 and 20 February legislative elections, you entrusted the responsibility of managing national affairs on your behalf to the parliamentary majority comprising the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]. It is within the framework of this parliamentary majority and, therefore, the victory of yesterday's opposition--your victory--that I was appointed prime minister by the president of the Republic, by virtue of Article 66 of the Constitution which stipulates that the head of state shall appoint the prime minister from within the parliamentary majority. My sole concern, in accepting this post, was to save this parliamentary majority. My concern was also to give all the chances to the former opposition, together with all the political forces, to accomplish change, which remains the primary objective of the battle we have been waging for three years. We have all realized that beyond our individual personalities and political structures, there is our country Togo and all the Togolese people with their numerous everyday problems and difficulties. Centering the debate on how to jointly manage the present situation and to downplay our divisions seem to me, today, to be a major priority. It is with the interest of the suffering Togolese people who expect a better tomorrow in mind that I, in my capacity as prime minister, have just formed a government under the terms of the Constitution. I shall submit to parliament the joint government program agreed upon by the CAR and the UTD and leave it to each of the deputies, as representatives of the people, to study and decide on it. The problems which our country has to cope with are many and urgent. We must ensure that there is genuine national reconciliation by extending a brotherly hand to all. It is to this end that the CAR and the UTD accepted the idea of a government of national union proposed by the head of state. We must also settle, once and for all, the problem of our countrymen who are still living as refugees outside the country, as well as the problem of displaced persons within the country. We must ensure the regular payment of salaries of workers and pensions of the retired. We must stop the continuing deterioration of the economic situation of the state and enterprises which are faced with very great difficulties and adopt adequate measures that will help to keep under control the negative effects of the devaluation of the CFA franc on our economy and on the purchasing power of Togolese. We must create conditions that will allow women traders and the informal sector to recover their former dynamism. We must find solutions to the specific problems of our farmers and the rural areas in general. We must find appropriate measures to end the current malfunctioning of our schools and university -- the University of Benin -- and to restore hope in the youth by securing a more promising future for them. At the political level, we must rapidly give the democratic opposition a legal statute to enable it to exist legally, to fully play its constitutional role, and to work toward the return of all politicians into politics, regardless of their political leanings, through fruitful, open, and brotherly dialogue. We must adopt as early as possible the organic laws that will govern the institutions that are indispensable for the setting up of a law-abiding state and adopt measures for the law to be in the service of all. We must see to the reinforcement of public security and promote freedom of opinion, meeting, and association. In this regard, we must lay particular emphasis on the media code. Last, one of the major concerns of the government that I will lead will be that of sound and equitable management of state media in the service of pluralism, democracy, and development. Fellow Togolese and dear countrymen, I would like to call you to witness and to reaffirm to you my indestructible attachment to the common objective of change that we have set for ourselves. I reaffirm before the entire Togolese people my willingness to base government action on the common parliamentary majority program with openness and readiness to cooperate with all. We must avoid every kind of sectarianism by resolutely putting ourselves at the service of the entire Togolese people because national interests must override partisan considerations. I appeal for the union of all democratic forces and all people of goodwill so that we can consolidate our efforts in order to respond to the strong desire for change expressed by all Togolese. The broad-based government of national union will strive tirelessly for the attainment of its objectives which are national reconciliation, economic redress, and social integration. This government is perhaps not the one we would have wished to form but the delay in its formation and the suffering of the people have forced us to form it. It must set down to work and to try to safeguard the future. With outstretched arms, I hope that the appeal that I have just launched will be heeded by all political forces desirous of contributing to the redress of our country Togo. On my part, I can assure you that I will ensure that Togo is governed to the best of its interests. Long live democratic change. Long live Togo.
