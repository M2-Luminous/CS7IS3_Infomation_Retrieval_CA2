Regarding their assessment of the next six months, the companies were more optimistic. They are counting primarily on export business. According to Ifo, the reports within the framework of the economic development test permit the conclusion that orders received increased in March and that orders on hand were kept at the level of the previous month despite accelerated production. On average, orders on hand were sufficient for production of 2.5 months, which was as long as in December 1993. During this period capacity utilization increased slightly from 79 to 80.3 percent. According to Ifo, the production plans for the next few months show an upward trend. Sales prices have again declined in various fields; over the next few months the price climate is expected to be calm. A differentiation in line with economic branches shows "far less unfavorable business" for the producers of preproducts than the last months, particularly in the chemical industry. Investment goods producers largely assess the situation as negative, but it has still improved, the Ifo report continues. In particular machine-building registered an increase in orders. There, and in electrical engineering production, plans have "reached the threshold of the positive area." Expectations of East German Industry Only Cautiously Optimistic In the durable consumer goods industry the number of companies with a bad business situation has again declined "tangibly." Regarding further development, the participants in the test are, however, skeptical. The producers of nondurable consumer goods, particularly in the clothing industry, are still largely negative in their statements, but far less pessimistic than before. In east German industry the current business situation continues to be unsatisfactory, expectations are "only cautiously optimistic." At least, orders received in March were considerably higher; still, orders on hand declined slightly from 3.2 months in December 1993 to 3.1 months. According to Ifo, capacity utilization remained virtually unchanged at almost 76 percent, but it was considerably higher than in March 1993 (71 percent). Export prospects are still seen negatively; one-quarter of the companies complain about sales problems, 16 percent about problems with financing. Construction Sector in Old Laender Remains Skeptical In March, the construction sector in the west said that its current situation is still unfavorable; expectations are still largely characterized by skepticism. If weather is disregarded, building output and capacity utilization remained constant over the past months and is above last year's value. While the assessment of those polled in the branch of public works and foundation works was very unfavorable, in building construction one can see a slight improvement, just as in prefab building. In the east particularly that branch of building construction that is involved in housing construction expresses satisfaction. In the rest of the sector negative assessments continue to dominate. Prices have again declined in individual spots; most companies, however, expect a stabilization of the price level. According to the Ifo test, in March the business atmosphere in west German wholesale trade again improved "considerably"; company reports allow another recovery to be expected. Turnover probably exceeded last year's level; prices remained largely stable, which, in the companies' view, will probably also be the case over the next three months. In east German wholesale trade, negative assessments are still dominant, but the business situation has improved. Pressure by stocks has decreased; nevertheless, one-quarter of the companies consider their stocks too high. Retail trade in the west and in the east reported declines in turnover compared with the same period last year and, according to the poll, ordering is to be further limited over the next few months. While in the west individual price increases are reported, the trend in the east is going rather downward. In the west, only the consumer markets expressed satisfaction with the development; mail order companies, on the other hand, complain of a further deterioration of their business.
