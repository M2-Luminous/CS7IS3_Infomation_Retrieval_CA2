As we have learned unofficially, the government debated, among other topics, a reform of the labor law and collective labor agreements. Let us recall that a corrected version of the Labor Law Code was recently submitted to the Sejm by the government. The code is said to not regulate too many issues: the length of annual leaves, working conditions, and a maximum working time, among other things. The remaining issues would be settled through collective agreements signed between employers and employee representatives. A draft law on collective agreements, which is part of the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises, is to be debated by the Sejm very soon, as requested by the government. That was a demand put forward by "Solidarity" and by other trade unions which are negotiating over the "Solidarity" strike demands within the trilateral commission. Tougher Position on Disability Pensions The government most probably also debated reforms of social insurance. Work on the reforms has been proceeding without much vigor. Ministerial experts met to debate the issue as late as 27 April. The prime minister has announced that the direction of reforms will be announced in June. Among other things, the government intends to tighten the criteria for awarding disability pensions, it also intends to reform maternity, sick, and family benefits, and to introduce a so-called social pension. Persons over 75 years of age would be entitled to this kind of pension, and they would also have to be illegible for a retirement or other kind of pension; the pension would also cover disabled individuals over the age of 18 who are completely incapable of working. Principles of awarding social rent as well as its size, are currently being negotiated within a government-trade union team (without the participation of "Solidarity.") Beginning with 1995, a new system for deciding on disability would become effective, so as to avoid awarding disability pensions to young and healthy people. The new system would result in a 10-percent drop in the number of pensions being awarded. Waging a War on Unemployment The Central Planning Administration [CUP] has presented "Principles of Socioeconomic Policies for the 1994-97 Period." Among other things, those principles provide for the introduction of insurance against unemployment beginning in 1997. But employees would begin paying premiums as early as next year. The ratio would be as follows: Employers would pay two-thirds of the premium and employees -- the remaining third. For this year, CUP also predicts an increase in the level of salaries for budget sector employees by at least 1.5 percent, and also a 3.5-increase in retirement and other types of pensions. CUP wants to extend Social Insurance Agency premiums to all income from work, including contracts for performance of specific items and order contracts. Currently, one does not have to pay premiums on order contracts signed for fewer than 30 days and on contracts for performance of a specific item. According to CUP, the government's most important goals in the social area are, among other things, to decrease the unemployment rate among young people aged 19-24 (estimates are that in four years, it will increase by 412,000 people), and also increasing the number of jobs through a program to construct roads, telecommunication lines, and gas pipelines, as well as the development of low-income housing. Financial means for an active campaign against unemployment would increase by 22 percent by 1997 compared with 1993, and would amount to about 7.5 trillion zlotys. Valorization and Inflation CUP is in favor of changing the principles of valorization of retirement and other types of pensions, with the goal of making valorization follow price rises instead of the current system, where it shadows increases in average salaries. This would allow for the real value of benefits to be retained. A change in the principles of valorization is one of the strike demands put forward by "Solidarity." Other trade unions also support it. Finally, during its session in the Warmie resort, the government will deal with protection of forests and a draft law on reprivatization and reimbursements.
