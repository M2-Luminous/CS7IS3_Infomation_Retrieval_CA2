The senior General Staff source said that in the Gaza Strip over 15,000 soldiers are occupied with protecting 4,500 settlers. "At no stage during the negotiations did the army recommend a course of action based on an inability to defend settlements, but in the longer term, it will be impossible to maintain full-proof [as published] security," said the source. As for Judaea and Samaria, the source said the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] expects a rise in violence by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], and does not rule out riots in the major cities if the economic situation of the Palestinian population continues to deteriorate, or if the self-rule process fails to progress. "The PLO will try to co-opt Hamas into the political institutions being established, but we do not rule out a scenario in which economic hardships and political uncertainty combine to strengthen Hamas in the street," said the source. He added that while the territories are now relatively quiet, there are indications that Hamas plans violent activities. "One new phenomenon in Judaea and Samaria is the use of more sophisticated roadside bombs, detonated by wireless remote control devices. It is difficult to detect these devices, which is why it is difficult to guarantee the safety of settlers and soldiers moving on the main roads," he said. "There are over 20 platoons currently deployed in Judaea and Samaria, whose sole mission is to maintain road and settlement safety. These soldiers are not training as they ought to, and I do not think this can go on endlessly without compromising the quality of your military force," he added.
