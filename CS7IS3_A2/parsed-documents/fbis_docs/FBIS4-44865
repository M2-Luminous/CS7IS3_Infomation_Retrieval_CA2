These gate arrays conformed to past technical trends, and compared to the previous generation of gate array series, featured overall enhanced performance, faster signal propagation delay times per standard gate of roughly 200-250ps, and packed between 300,000-500,000 gates on a single chip. While achieving this kind of high performance, these 0.5�m gate arrays also reduced their supply voltage from the standard 5V to 3.3V, making them advantageous from the aspects of power consumption and operating noise. However, most applications of CMOS gate arrays are still 5V systems, and what is needed is technology that can be used in systems with dual 5V/3V power sources. And while the operating speeds of the logic gates in these gate arrays have been enhanced remarkably, inter-chip signal transmission speeds have not kept pace, and this unbalance has begun to make itself conspicuous. Premised on this unbalance, double clock technology is becoming prevalent in state-of-the-art microprocessors, and new technologies are in the process of being developed for gate arrays as well. This report focuses primarily on the move toward 3.3V supply voltage that is accompanying the introduction of 0.5�m CMOS gate arrays, and the high-speed inter-chip signal transmission technology for multiple chips that has recently begun to be supported by gate arrays. Switch From 5V to 3.3V Power Sources The switch to 3.3V power sources for 0.5�m CMOS gate arrays is highlighted by the fact that most of the leading-edge CISC and RISC processors announced between last year and this year were built for 3.3V power supplies. However, as will be understood from studying the CMOS gate array specifications listed in Table 1 and the trend toward higher speed illustrated in Figure 1, the main reason for the switch to 3.3V technology lies in the fact that, in order to maintain the trend toward faster operating speeds in 0.5�m generation devices as well, these devices employ MOS transistors with high drive capabilities, with 0.5�m gate lengths and extremely thin gate oxide films of plus or minus 100 Angstroms that are simply not built for 5V of power. Because 0.5�m transistors are optimized for 3.3V power supplies, even though their gate voltage has been reduced from 5V to 3.3V, they possess equal or better drive capabilities than previous generation transistors, and are approximately 20% faster than previous generation devices.

Trends in Number of Gates and Operating Speeds Another big reason for reducing supply voltage has to do with measures aimed at power consumption. It is well known that the power consumption of large-scale integration (LSI) CMOS devices comprised of complementary circuits is not a major problem since there are no direct current paths and quiescent power dissipation is practically zero. But even the power consumption of CMOS circuits, when operated at ultra-high speeds, increases on a par with bipolar circuits. The power consumed during operation is the switching-generated charging current of the parasitic capacity attached to the output node of the gate circuit, and is proportional to the average operating frequency, as well as to the scale of the gate corresponding to the parasitic capacity value. Although scaling down feature sizes reduces the average parasitic capacity value per gate, the effect of increasing the number of gates more than offsets this, the upper limits of operating frequency also rise, and most high-end applications suitable for 0.5�m devices will continue to use 5V, increasing power consumption significantly. This will make it impossible to use the now popular inexpensive plastic flat package (PFP), requiring instead the use of extremely expensive ceramic packages with low thermal resistance values and/or the construction of heat sinks, resulting in higher priced LSIs. Charging current power consumption is generally proportional to fcv[.sup]2[/] and the supply voltage multiplied by two. Designing devices capable of operating on 3.3V of power will reduce power consumption by roughly 1/2, enable inexpensive packaging to be used for most applications just like before, and will support the trend toward lower costs. Dual 3V/5V Technology Gate arrays with 0.5�m dimensions are being designed to operate on 3.3V of power, and 3.3V microprocessors, memory devices and other products are in the process of being shipped. However, hardly any of the general-purpose periphery LSIs are being adapted for 3.3V operation, and the standard for buses that run inside personal computers (PCs) is still 5V. This turn of events will lead to a situation where 3V and 5V circuit components will have to co-exist inside a single system, requiring that these systems incorporate interfaces to serve as bridges between the two types of power sources. However, since microprocessors and other general-purpose LSIs are not being designed to handle dual power sources, in the end, this role will fall to the custom-built LSI ASICs. However, as pointed out above, 0.5�m MOS transistors are not constructed to withstand 5V of power, meaning that 5V/3.3V conversion will be difficult to achieve in 0.5�m gate arrays. Some sort of circuitry solution will be required instead. Figure 2 illustrates a 0.5�m CMOS circuit capable of handling a 5V amplitude input signal. In this circuit, inserting the n-channel transistor serially into the input cuts off the high voltage so that not more than 3.3V is applied to the inverter circuit n-channel transistor, which has a 0V substrate bias. The in-line n-channel transistor gate has a bias of 3.3V, and this circuit is constructed so that not more than 3.3V of bias is applied to any gate regardless of changes in input from 0V to 5V. Figure 2. 5V Input Buffer There is no simple means of dealing with a 3V-to-5V output if, say, a through-current is not permitted in a 5V LSI input circuit, or if a CMOS level is required as a result of noise margin problems. Conversely, if a 5V LSI requires a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) level (0.8-2.0V), then it is possible to make the connection with a 0V-to-3.3V amplitude output as-is without doing anything. The problem lies with tri-state and/or two-way buffers. With an ordinary 3V buffer, when the buffer itself is in a high impedance state, 5V of voltage can be applied to the output pin from the outside, and that voltage level will flow backward (reverse current) from the MOS transistor drain region through the parasitic diode to the 3.3V power source. To prevent this phenomenon, as shown in Figure 3, the n-channel transistor must be inserted serially into the output pin similar to the way the input circuit was designed. Naturally, this transistor will function as an in-line resistor when the buffer is in the output mode, lowering the buffer's drive capabilities. At high-level output in particular, the back-gate bias effect also comes into play, greatly reducing drive capabilities. Besides this circuit, there have been reports of cases where complicated circuit configurations that use floating n-wells have been used to enhance high-level output characteristics. But in each of these instances, the characteristics deteriorated, and they were of little use in high-speed, high-drive-capable buffers. Figure 3. 3.3V/5V Tri-state Buffer An alternative course of action to the 3V/5V interface approach, albeit a complicated one, is to simultaneously fabricate 0.8�m transistors capable of withstanding 5V on top of the 0.5�m gate array, thereby creating transistors capable of 5V input and output. This is called the multi-oxide process because it alters the thickness of the oxide films on the gates of the 3V and 5V transistors. Table 2 provides an example of the specifications of a 0.5�m gate array product that employed the multi-oxide process. This approach makes metal layer switching possible at each pin for both 3V I/O and 5V I/O. Table 2. Example of Multi-oxide Gate Array TC183G I/O Buffer Characteristics Figure 4 shows an example of 3V/5V-conversion I/O buffer circuits that made use of the multi-oxide process. Although the process is complicated, the circuits themselves are clear-cut. The 5V input circuit can also be fabricated using a two-stage inverter circuit comprised of 0.8�m transistors, which compared to the input circuit illustrated in Figure 2, is faster, facilitates circuit threshold value control and also has a large noise margin. The 5V output buffer makes use of a level shifter circuit configured from 0.8�m transistors to convert the 3V signals coming from the logic circuit inside the gate array to the 5V level for output. Even though this level shifter circuit causes an additional 1ns delay, this buffer offers output characteristics on a par with ordinary 5V gate arrays. This buffer readily serves as a direct drive for buses that require large load drive capabilities, something the tri-state buffer circuit shown in Figure 3 has difficulty doing. This buffer is also being adapted for use with the PCI bus, which is rapidly coming into widespread use as a next-generation standard. Figure 4. 5V I/O Circuits That Utilize the Multi-oxide Process Because of the outstanding 5V I/O buffer characteristics of the multi-oxide gate array, they are not only finding application in dual 3V/5V systems, but are also being used as 5V input-3V logic processing-5V output devices in 5V systems that require the low power consumption and high speeds of 0.5�m gate arrays. High-speed Interfaces As the operating speed of the logic circuits inside gate arrays is enhanced, the slowness of signal transmissions between multiple LSIs is becoming more pronounced. If we adhere to past ways of thinking, it would seem that all we have to do is scale down the feature sizes in order to increase the drive capabilities and operating speed of the output buffer. But in actuality, numerous output buffers operate simultaneously in synch with the clock, in which case, the high speed, uniform switching of powerful drive buffers generates considerable noise on the order of 1V in the power source inside the gate array, which in turn causes malfunctions. Power source noise can be alleviated by fabricating numerous power source pins, but too-fast switching also inhibits high-speed transmission as the transmission waveform is distorted owing to the reflected waves in the conductors on the printed circuit board. Therefore, it has become commonplace for recent gate arrays to offer an extremely wide variety of buffers so that you can select those with the lowest noise from among buffers that offer combinations of the various load drive capabilities and permissible transmission times required in output pins. However, no matter how many different kinds of buffers there are, that alone will not improve transmission speed. Therefore, as one solution to low-noise, high-speed transmission, attention has recently focused on small amplitude signal transmission systems that enable high-speed transmission by limiting the output amplitude without aimlessly increasing load drive capabilities. Of these, the GTL system is the closest to practicalization, and is starting to gain support as a standard cell in 0.5�m gate arrays. There is also an emitter-coupled logic (ECL)-level small amplitude signal transmission system that has been in use for some time. But, although the ECL system makes it easy to design the circuit threshold level for bipolar circuits, it cannot be realized as readily for CMOS circuits, making the ECL system unsuitable for use with CMOS LSIs. But GTL system standards were established with CMOS LSIs in mind. As Figure 5 indicates, a GTL system driver consists of a solitary n-channel transistor. In actual circuits, driver-transistor-generated noise is reduced by adding a through-rate control circuit to gently control ON/OFF. And the input circuit is an ordinary CMOS P-top high-speed comparator. Table 3 shows the DC specifications for the GTL system. Note that maximum output amplitude is held to 1.2V, and the terminating resistance value is assumed to be 50_O_. This system is suitable for high-speed buses with large load capacities and long transmission lines. Table 3. DC Specifications for GTL Interface Figure 5.

Ordinarily, signal transmissions between chips are synchronized to a system clock supporting multiple chips, and transmission takes place in the space of a single clock cycle with the signal output from a certain chip's flip-flop being derived by another chip's flip-flop at the next clock timing pulse. However, as shown in Figure 6, since large-scale gate arrays distribute thousands of clocks in a single chip, a multi-stage clock buffer is located inside the chip, causing unnecessary delays. Thus, a large phase difference exists between the system clock on the PCB and the clocks that are actually supplying timing pulses to the flip-flops inside the chip. In a worst case scenario, this clock phase difference itself accounts for the greatest portion of the permissible transmission time. As the conceptual diagram provided in Figure 6 indicates, PLL technology eliminates this phase difference and lengthens the effective transmission time permitted by the buffer, thereby making high-speed transmission possible. Figure 6. Signal Transmission Circuit Employing PLL In gate arrays, the structure of the LSI makes it difficult to treat an analog circuit PLL as a macro cell. However, as shown in Figure 7, it is possible to integrate a PLL into a gate array as a cell if it is a digital PLL that uses the gate chain to delay the input clock nearly one clock cycle and adjusts phase. Increasing numbers of manufacturers are supporting PLL technology as a countermeasure to clock phase difference beginning with their 0.5�m generation gate arrays. Figure 7. Block Diagram of Digital PLL As described above, considerable improvements are being made in inter-chip signal transmission speeds via the joint use of small signal amplitude buffers and PLL technology in CMOS gate arrays. Conclusions Gate array technology, broadly speaking, is supported by device, EDA, packaging and testing technologies. In this report, we limited our discussion to device technology strongly reflected in CMOS technology. But needless to say, in designing the ultra-large-scale gate arrays unique to CMOS gate arrays, EDA technology that supports top-down design and technologies that facilitate testing techniques are essential. Gate array technology will most likely continue to become more and more integrated as scaling techniques work to increase gate array operating speeds and integration levels. Bibliography 1.
