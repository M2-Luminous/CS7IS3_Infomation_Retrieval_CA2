In the last few days, they had a tight schedule. Apart from attending the meetings, they met with representatives from various social sectors and found time to visit grass-roots people to understand how they lived. It is safe to say that by gearing themselves to the needs of Hong Kong people, having contacts with people from all walks of life and listening to their opinions, the mainland PWC members were blazing a new trail. Through understanding the real situation by having contacts with people at all levels through various channels, the PWC members, we believe, will formulate programs and policies more suited to Hong Kong's realities. With the date 1 July 1997 drawing near, the PWC must step up its work. To solicit opinions from more Hong Kong people, the PWC, at the suggestion made by many Hong Kong people, decided to move the venue for the meetings of the two subgroups from Beijing to Hong Kong so as to increase exchanges with Hong Kong people and draw more Hong Kong people into participation in the preparatory work in the transitional period. This arrangement once again showed that the PWC was determined to make efforts, together with Hong Kong people, to achieve Hong Kong's smooth transition. The task taken on by the PWC in the second half of the transitional period is arduous. The spirit displayed by PWC members in courageously shouldering heavy loads and working hard is praiseworthy. Anyone who hopes for Hong Kong's smooth transition will enthusiastically support the PWC in its work and help overcome contradictions and difficulties arising in the course of advance. Facts show that more and more people are doing so. It should also be pointed out that Chris Patten and a few of his followers have so far despised the PWC and unscrupulously belittled the PWC's role and achievements, saying the PWC "lacks credibility" and "transparency" and describing the mainland PWC members' trip to Hong Kong to attend meetings and solicit opinions as "adopting a lofty stance." By bringing such groundless discredit on the PWC they will in no way impede the PWC's work, nor will they damage the prestige the PWC has established among the Hong Kong people. On the contrary, they will enable more Hong Kong people to see clearly the stubborn position of Chris Patten, who continues to confront the Chinese side. They will also awaken Hong Kong people who are unaware of the truth and the latter will then appreciate and support the PWC's work. This is Hong Kong's present reality and trend and nobody will be able to change or resist it.
