(?Government) forces have been destroying bridges in an attempt to slow down the advance of the Rwandan Patriotic Army, especially in the southern part of the country. Two bridges have been destroyed, one at Gashora on the road from Bugesera to Butare and the other bridge across the River Nyabarongo on the road to Gitarama. The Rwandese Patriotic Front [RPF] now controls more than half of the country and this includes the entire borderline with Uganda, the borderline with Tanzania and a big part of the Rwanda borderline with Burundi. The current RPF military offensive is intended to stop the massacres by the illegitimate government in Rwanda, using the army and the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militia. The massacres have claimed more than 300,000 people, opposition officials and people of Tutsi origin.
