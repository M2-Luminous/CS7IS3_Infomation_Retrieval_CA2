There is "great possibility" that a war will break out in the Korean peninsula if the U.S. deploys Patriot missiles in South Korea and the U.S. and South Korea resume the military exercises, said Kim Kwang-sop, ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to Austria. In a statement published by the AUSTRIAN PRESS AGENCY, Kim also refuted Western allegations that the DPRK is making preparations for war. "The threat is from the South (South Korea), not from the North (the DPRK)," he said. The DPRK, which is strong enough to defend itself and advocates the settlement of conflicts through peaceful means, is not planning a war, he noted. The ambassador said the DPRK is capable of making missiles, but is not engaged in the production of nuclear weapons. Kim's remarks came amid mounting tension between the DPRK on the one hand and the U.S. and South Korea on the other over the issue of nuclear materials in the Korean peninsula. Earlier this month, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it still could not prove whether the DPRK has fissionable nuclear materials after an IAEA team inspected some nuclear sites in the country. The IAEA's board of directors, accusing the DPRK of barring the inspection team from visiting a radioactive chemical laboratory in Yongbyon, said the agency hopes to send experts to the DPRK again for further inspection of the nuclear sites. The DPRK has repeatedly argued its nuclear facilities are for peaceful purposes only. To apply pressure, U.S. President Bill Clinton has ordered Patriot missiles sent to South Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said he would discuss with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu the scheduling of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Meanwhile, U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said that "the door is still open" to high-level U.S.-DPRK talks, but only if the DPRK meets two conditions -- permitting the inspections and reopening discussions with South Korea about making the peninsula nuclear-free. But the DPRK ambassador said that any further IAEA inspections are conditioned on resumption of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks. Commenting on the IAEA's dissatisfaction over the inspections, Kim said the DPRK had given the IAEA an opportunity to prove that the country did not possess materials for making nuclear weapons and that all relevant agreements had been observed. Thus, the issues raised by the IAEA are "unnecessary," he said in the statement.
