The authorities detained and took away eight dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, over two days. The National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] will open in Beijing next week, while U.S. Secretary of State Christopher will also begin a four-day visit to China next week; the crack down by Beijing at this time has caused guessing on all sides. The Chinese Foreign Ministry yesterday confirmed that dissidents Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang Jiaqi have already been detained, and that Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng have been taken away by public security personnel. Wang Dan was later released, but Wei Jingsheng is still missing. The human rights organization Asiawatch revealed that two dissidents in Shanghai were also detained. Well-known pro-democracy movement figure Xu Minli, like Wang Dan, was also taken away for a "conversation." The authorities hope that he will leave Beijing next week, and Xu Minli was later released. Wang Dan was a student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy movement. During a long-distance telephone interview yesterday with our reporters after his release, he said that on the previous evening he and three friends had wanted to go to Zhengzhou; when the train was about to leave the station, several plain-clothes public security personnel from the First Department of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau took him to a police substation by the train station. Wang Dan asked them: "Why do you want to detain me?" A public security personnel said: "You say less words!" Wang Dan said that during the whole period of detention, the public security personnel did not say anything other than a few words to him. After 15 hours under detention, he found it unbearable, and started a fast, consequently, he was released early yesterday morning by the public security personnel after 24 hours of detention. He cited the public security personnel as saying that "it was a misunderstanding, and it is not quite convenient to tell you why there was misunderstanding." Wang Dan said that the public security personnel who detained him told him to leave Beijing during the period when American officials were visiting and during the NPC and CPPCC. Wang Dan refused. He said: "If the authorities do not force me to leave, I will not leave Beijing in March." Wei Jingsheng, another well-known pro-democracy movement figure, who just met visiting U.S. Undersecretary of State John Shattuck on Sunday, was also taken away by public security personnel yesterday morning. According to his secretary, at about 1000 [0200 GMT] yesterday morning, Wei Jingsheng was taken away by three public security personnel from his younger brother's home; he called in the afternoon and told her to cancel all his activities for the following one or two days, but he did not say why he had been arrested or when he would be released. Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his part in the 1978 Democracy Wall movement and who was released on parole last September, urged the United States to take a tough stance on China's human rights issue when he met Shattuck on Sunday. Reporters from this newspaper made a long-distance call to Wei Jingsheng's family and asked them whether they knew about his arrest, and they replied that they "did not know." They also said that Wei stayed at his younger brother's home which does not have a telephone; as for this younger brother's address, they only said that "it is in Beijing" and "far away." They also said that Wei Jingsheng usually "avoids going home as much as possible," and that he stayed in the homes of friends or relatives in turn. Wei returned home on the afternoon of 2 March to have lunch and called home on the evening of 3 March just to say hello and talk about family matters, without saying other things. A Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday confirmed that the public security department had arrested Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang Jiaqi, because they had "violated the criminal law." The spokesman said that China's law enforcement organs "base on facts, use the law as criterion, and handle cases independently." But the spokesman said he did not know that Wei Jingsheng had been taken away. Yuan Hongbing is a history lecturer at Beijing University; he is well-known for his courage in organizing activities opposing the authorities, and his book, "The Trends of History," which was published last year, caused controversy. Wang Jiaqi is a graduate law student at Beijing University, and Zhou Guoqiang is a signatory of the "peace charter," as well as the lawyer who represented Han Dongfang, a trade union movement leader who is currently stranded in Hong Kong. The authorities accused Zhou of producing prints on T-shirts to arouse discontent and arrested him for this reason. Recently, the United States has kept exerting pressure on China on the human rights issue. A number of officials have visited China lately. Secretary of State Christopher is scheduled for a four-day visit to China beginning next Friday. One of his important duties during the trip is to assess whether improvements in the area of human rights in China is sufficient to enable him to suggest the extension of China's most-favored-nation trading status. Undersecretary of State Shattuck, who has just concluded a five-day visit to China, yesterday dropped by Hong Kong on his way home. He talked about the new round of crack downs on dissidents in China and said he did not know whether such a move would affect Christopher's visit to China next week. U.S. Undersecretary of State Shattuck said: "Learning about China's detention of dissidents, I am very disappointed. I once again urge Beijing to release those who have been arrested simply because they express their views peacefully." Wang Dan, who was detained for 24 hours, analyzed that there might be two reasons why the authorities had detained the dissidents: First, Christopher will visit China next week, and the authorities fear that U.S. officials will meet these people; second, the NPC and the CPPCC will soon be held, and as overseas reporters will rush in, dissidents are also a focus of media attention. Wang Dan thought that the authorities' move to detain dissidents in the past few days was very unwise as it will only cause a tense atmosphere. In November 1991, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Baker wanted to see Dai Qing, a reporter with GUANGMING RIBAO, but Dai Qing went missing before the meeting; afterwards, it was confirmed that she had been "invited" to Beidaihe [a beach resort in Hebei Province popular with the PRC leadership] to "take a rest."
