His schedule included, among other things, a meeting with the command personnel of the Officers' Higher School of Mechanized Military Units in Czajkowskiego Street. General Koziej promoted his latest book entitled The Theory of the Military Art [Teoria sztuki wojennej]. After the meeting, he held a brief press conference, during which reporters fired a volley of questions at him. [Question] Following the NATO summit in Brussels, certain circles in Poland have come to believe that the decisions made at the summit have reinforced the situation whereby we are kept in a certain state of vacuum, in military isolation. Are there reasons for us to be afraid? [Koziej] The state of anxious concern is to a certain extent justified by our sense of finding ourselves in a "gray security zone." However, I would certainly be disinclined to dramatize this situation and to react to it nervously. From the viewpoint of Polish interests, the concept of "Partnership for Peace" defines the limits of what we can now realistically attain. However, we must not forget that, as a result of a concentrated diplomatic campaign conducted, among others, by President Lech Walesa and [Foreign] Minister Olechowski, the general formula for the partnership has acquired a tangible content. For example, we know that by following that path we will eventually come to NATO. I believe that much will still depend on our taking our own initiative. Poland should press for the signing of a specific agreement with NATO that would take into account the timetable of activities that can bring us closer to a rapprochement with the Atlantic Treaty. However, it must not be a register of wishful thinking on our part, but a cool political and economic calculation. [Question] How would our rapprochement with NATO look from the purely military perspective? [Koziej] The West has been putting out certain signals and directions. To begin with, it should involve participation by the Polish armed forces in joint exercises and maneuvers in order to achieve a degree of perfection in cooperation at headquarters level and in joint operations. In addition, our armed forces should take part in peace missions alongside NATO forces' soldiers. I believe that these are good ways of achieving mutual adjustment of our respective military structures. I will not deny that the greatest problem will be posed by our need to adjust to the high technology applied in NATO command, communications, and reconnaissance systems. On the other hand, we have nothing to be ashamed of when we compare the levels of theoretical and practical knowledge at the command of our officers' cadres, or the training of our soldiers. [Question] But are we prepared for the possibility that, despite all the declarations and promises, the entrance door to NATO will, in the end, be slammed shut against us--in our faces, so to speak? [Koziej] I do not share such fears. After all, certain changes and transformations are bound to take place even within the Atlantic Treaty itself. Even today, that structure is not altogether capable of coping successfully with all the tasks that the present day requirements place before it. I believe that, over the next few years, we will undergo an inevitable evolution of the entire system of European security. It is not outside the bounds of possibility that it will eventually become NATO's policy to accept all willing partners into the ranks of its self-reforming structure. [Question] Including Russia and Ukraine? [Koziej] Time will tell. Let me reiterate that, in my opinion, a joint security system will eventually evolve in Europe on the basis of NATO, and that the West will constitute its nucleus and its guarantor. [Question] General, could Poland be threatened by a military conflict likely to develop in Central Europe? [Koziej] We could be tempted into all manner of theoretical musings on that subject. For example, the Americans recently considered the possibility of a major invasion threatening Poland from the East and concluded that, in such an eventuality, we would be utterly defeated--a conclusion that is not particularly surprising when we consider the existing ratio of forces. Personally, I believe that we will not be seriously threatened with a direct and total military invasion from the East within a foreseeable future. I would rather perceive a real threat for Poland in the possibility of local conflicts erupting in the vicinity of our state borders--for example, if uncontrollable nationalistic feelings come to a head in Slovakia, Ukraine, or Russia. It would be relatively easy then for "offshoots" of those disturbances to penetrate our own territories. [Question] What is the current military potential of our own 250,000-strong armed forces? [Koziej] We have at our disposal a military potential that currently permits us chiefly to carry out effective defense. Insofar as our capabilities allow, we will strive to adjust to the requirements of the contemporary universal military art, drawing on the theoretical achievements of both East and West European armies. With the passage of time, our armed forces should increasingly assume the character of combined air-and-surface formations in consideration of the potential at the disposal of our hypothetical adversaries. The rule that the stronger of the two adversaries dictates the rules of the game will always hold true. [Question] Does this mean that certain changes in the Polish armed forces are inevitable? [Koziej] It would be difficult to deny that they are inevitable. It is not inconceivable that the Polish defense system could demonstrate a certain inefficiency even before the end of this year. Consequently, political decisionmakers should look at the problems associated with the functioning of the Army not only in the perspective of just one term of office but also in a longer time scale. For quite a while now, President Walesa and the National Security Bureau have insisted that adequate levels of budget resources be allocated for defense. In my opinion, we should aim to have a small but extremely-well-trained and well-equipped Army in Poland. I believe that we should gradually convert to professional, career military service assisted by contract military service. Of course, reserve military training should still be preserved in addition to those two main forms of military service. An army that is composed predominantly of career servicemen need not be more expensive to run than one made up of drafted soldiers; one European example that proves this thesis is that of the British military service. [Question] The alderman of Koscierzyna parish has offered to allocate 1 billion zlotys of his parish funds to benefit the National Defense Fund. Do you think that a nationwide collection, held in peacetime, for such a purpose is a good idea, or is it merely a case of a disproportionately emotive initiative that could only alarm our neighbors unduly? [Koziej] I would assess that particular initiative in positive terms. At the same time, I believe that it is an expression of an understandable public concern over the Polish armed forces' material condition. Perhaps as a result of it politicians will now turn their attention more closely to the problem it highlights. To go back to your question, however, we could easily picture a situation where each voivodship would make a contribution toward the purchase of three modern tanks by the Army. Surely there would be nothing wrong in such a scheme? In any case, I believe that the extramilitary sector is the weakest link in our defense system. I am thinking here of the levels of knowledge and awareness of a whole range of defense issues prevalent among our population. There is, however, a marked improvement on that score among the voivodas, which was noticeable as early as last year. Nevertheless, there is still much scope for improvement in our central administration and within individual ministries.
