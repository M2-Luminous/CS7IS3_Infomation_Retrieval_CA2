We must conscientiously study the documents of this conference, profoundly understand and master the basic guidelines of the conference, and comprehensively implement the guidelines in line with the reality of Liaoning.

It is of specially important and regent significance to strengthen and improve propaganda and ideological work. New situations and tasks have set new and even higher demands on propaganda and ideological work. To fulfill these tasks, the whole party must pay attention to further carrying out the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands.

In line with the overall arrangements and the strategic ideology for propaganda and ideological work during the new situation, set forth by the central authorities, we should exert efforts in the following six aspects: First, we should persistently arm the whole party with the theory of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, control the overall situation, and guide all the work on propaganda and ideological front. Second, by closely centering on economic construction, we should make great effort to give rise to a public opinion atmosphere of the whole party paying attention to economic construction and should concentrate the attention of all fields at higher and lower levels on the central task of economic construction. All departments on propaganda and ideological front should make full use of their respective advantages to carry forward their role in theoretical guidance, public opinion guidance, spiritual encouragement, cultural appeal, and external propaganda with a view to adding vigor to the province's economic development. Third, we should give prominence to reform, increase the dynamics of propaganda, and support reform in a clear-cut manner. Fourth, by closely seizing the key link of emancipating the mind, in line with the province's situation and the realities of respective localities, we should guide the people with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the essence of socialism and the theory of socialist market economy to truly make clear what is socialism, to foster a new concept suiting the socialist market economy, and to make innovations boldly and make progress positively. Fifth, we should energetically advocate the main melody, improve the quality of the people, and enhance the people's pioneering spirit to create a good social environment for reform, development, and stability. At present, we should particularly exert great efforts in straightening out cultural market and further perfecting the province's systems, rules, and regulations on management of cultural market so as to orient the management of cultural market to the orbit of institutionalization and regularization as early as possible. Sixth, we should always conduct propaganda and ideological work, with the people as the mainstay, and with the purpose of training new persons with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of discipline. Currently, centering on reform, construction, and social stability of the province, we should strengthen ideological and moral education with patriotism, collectivism, and socialism as the key contents and should guide the people, young people in particular, to foster correct ideals, belief, the outlooks on world, on life, and on value. Propaganda and ideological departments as well as the vast numbers of propaganda and ideological workers should fully understand their important duties, strive to arm their brains with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, correctly make explorations and improvements for the methods of propaganda and ideological work under the new situation, and constantly improve the level of propaganda and ideological work in order to suit the demand of building two civilizations.
