Delivering his opening address to the PWV Legislative Assembly at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center], near Soweto on Thursday, he also outlined various campaigns to combat crime and provide education and health. "The projected target for the provision of housing in the province over the next 12 months is 150,000 units." The premier said the units would be provided with all essential services including electricity, running water and telephones. But he warned the provincial government would not allow the scheme, which would be aided by private enterprises, "to create serviced informal settlements in the name of housing". Turning to hostels, Mr Sexwale said: "We have the responsibility of reintegrating hostel dwellers into the broader community. Hostel accommodation can be upgraded into family units and alternative housing provided. Hostel dwellers who wish to remain in hostels should be assisted to upgrade their facilities." Mr Sexwale also promised that township residents who fled their homes because of violence would be assisted in returning to their houses which would be restored. The premier also promised to create sustainable employment for the almost 50 per cent of people "without formal or adequate employment". Creating an enabling economic environment would depend on stability, which in turn would be created by urgent reconstruction and development projects. "We need a vigorous cycle of progress in the PWV." Mr Sexwale said education and health policies would be shaped for the province after central government had formulated its policies. But he promised free, compulsory and basic education to all school- going children, and an urgent immunisation programme. Reiterating his strong stance against crime, he said there would be gun control and a disarmament campaign. "A crime-free PWV has the potential to serve as the economic gateway not only to the rest of South Africa, but also to the sub-continent. Within the first 100 days we will establish a comprehensive and regularly updated economic data base to facilitate the marketing of our province and country." Mr Sexwale said the provincial government would maintain fiscal discipline and "use our resources wisely and efficiently". "We as government will stretch every rand before we can spend yet another rand." Throughout his speech, Mr Sexwale stressed partnerships in all policy formulation. "At a political level the government of national unity, characterised by the ongoing process of reconciliation in the PWV, has provided a tangible example of partnership in action that should pervade all aspects of our society." Earlier, the Provincial Assembly adopted an interim set of procedural rules. The PWV legislature will sit again on Monday.
