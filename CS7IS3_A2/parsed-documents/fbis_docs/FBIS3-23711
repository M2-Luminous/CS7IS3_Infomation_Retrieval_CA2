Minister of Communications Vladimir Bulgak spoke at the ceremonies and announced a number of innovations in the ministry's policies, including the toughening of requirements for the operating companies that have received, as a result of the competition, the right to acquire licenses to provide cellular communications services under standards GSM and NMT-450N in a number of Russia's regions. According to Leonid Varakin, the expert commission's chairman and director of the Central Research Institute of Communications, in selecting winners consideration was given, in part, to the completeness of plans and the possibility of their implementation, as well as to the "amount of the uncompensated contribution." In regions where only a single applicant submitted a proposal, it was decided not to determine a winner in order not to violate the principle of competition, despite the fact that the organization of cellular communications networks in those regions is put off at least until the next bidding. As Aleksandr Krupnov, first deputy minister of communications, reported, the losers will get their contributions back. The winners, on the other hand, still have to apply for licenses and pay for them within three months. According to Mr. Krupnov, the amount will be approximately $3.00 per inhabitant of a region. It is planned to spend the money thus collected to prepare regions' infrastructures for the development of cellular networks. Companies that won the competition must start offering cellular communications services before 2 February 1995. Otherwise, according to Mr. Bulgak, the operators will lose their license. Another example of the tightened controls over the development of cellular communications networks in Russia that the minister of communications announced will be the establishment of two regulating committees (one per standard). Their job, in part, will be to ensure the linkage between different regions' networks. Among the potential consequences of the competition that has just concluded, many specialists mention, first and foremost, a sharp intensification of competition among the producers of cellular communications equipment.
