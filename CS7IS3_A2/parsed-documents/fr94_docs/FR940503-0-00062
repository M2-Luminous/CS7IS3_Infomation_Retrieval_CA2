FR940503-0-00062 FR940503-0-00019 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 641 [Docket No. 909268&hyph;9277; I.D. 042694B] Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of closure. SUMMARY: NMFS closes the commercial fishery for red snapper in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico. NMFS has projected that the annual commercial quota for red snapper will be reached on April 27, 1994. This closure is necessary to protect the red snapper resource. EFFECTIVE DATES: Closure is effective 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994, through December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Sadler, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 641 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ). Those regulations set the commercial quota for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico at 3.06 million lbs (1.39 million kg) for the current fishing year, January 1 through December 31, 1994 (50 CFR 641.25(a)). Under 50 CFR 641.26, NMFS is required to close the commercial fishery for a species or species group when the quota for that species or species group is reached, or is projected to be reached, by publishing a document in the Federal Register . Based on current statistics, NMFS has projected that the commercial quota of 3.06 million lbs (1.39 million kg) for red snapper will be reached on April 27, 1994. Accordingly, the commercial fishery in the EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico for red snapper is closed effective 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994, through December 31, 1994, the end of the fishing year. A vessel with a valid reef fish permit having red snapper aboard must land and barter, trade, or sell such red snapper prior to 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994. During the closure, the bag limit applies to all harvests of red snapper from the EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico. The daily bag limit for red snapper is seven per person. From 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994, through December 31, 1994, the purchase, barter, trade, or sale of red snapper taken from the EEZ is prohibited. This prohibition does not apply to trade in red snapper that were harvested, landed, and bartered, traded, or sold prior to 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994, and were held in cold storage by a dealer or processor. Classification This action is required by 50 CFR 641.26 and has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866.
