Some observers predicted it could be the last congress, however, similar forecasts were voiced prior to all the previous congresses. As Mykola Rerikh once said: "The loftier the idea, the more dogs bark at it." The fifth congress, unlike previous ones, was held in an everyday atmosphere which is understood, because the Army, like the rest of society is living through hard times. When times get hard, people concentrate on the most acute problems. The Ministry of Defense leadership did not attend the conference, which demonstrated its attitude toward the SOU. On the eve of the congress, the ministry discussed whether delegates should be permitted to arrive in Kiev. However, some commanders had concealed the cable with the permission to hold the congress and a group of deputies failed to show up. Those who arrived said: "Banning the SOU is like banning love for Ukraine." When I was listening to their speeches, I became more and more assured that the strengthening of the national Armed Forces had become the primary goal in these people's lives. The union is currently being blamed for involvement in political activities. However, is it not politics to implement the national policy of safeguarding Ukraine's security? Or why not grant officers a right to express their opinions regarding reform in the Army? Yet, the military command believes that every serviceman can only express opinions regarding his post. Thus, a squad commander can only speak on behalf of his squad and not meddle in the company's affairs. Those officers refusing to live in accordance with the cobbler-should-stick-to-his-last principle are risking the lose of their posts and ranks. This information was made public at the congress -- Colonel Serhiy Dudko was relieved of duty for sending a report on embezzlements of military property to a local newspaper. Even generals are being persecuted for "dissidence." Not long ago, General Major Oleksandr Rol, deputy chief of staff of the Ukrainian Air Force, expressed his viewpoint on reform of the Air Force speaking to a VECHIRNIY KYYIV correspondent. For this, he fell into the Staff's and Council of Ministers' disgrace. Persecution of "dissidents" is under way at all levels. I met a former colleague of mine who is now a military reporter, and he said: "When I visit a military unit and people learn that I am a reporter, they run away from me." Not all the officers put up with this kind of mentality prohibiting independent thinking. Speaking at the congress, SOU Deputy Chief Hryhoriy Omelchenko said: "We must leave this conference hall having relieved ourselves from our slave mentality. Without this, one cannot be a genuine patriot." The congress demonstrated that not all the members of the union withstood the test. Some people backed out after abandoning hope of resolving social problems, others simply got scared in the face of reactionary command's attack. There was not a single regiment, battalion, or similar level commander among the delegates. Delivering a revision committee's report, Volodymyr Tymofeyev pointed out that the number of retired officers in the union is twice as large as that of active ones. Retired officers are even chairmen of some oblast organizations. When the union was being formed that situation was easy to account for -- people had nothing to lose. However, when the union was registered and entered the history of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as one of the most active forces supporting their development, a decrease in the number of union members gives ground for thought. I have already named some of the causes of the situation, but some demand separate consideration. Among SOU members, 85 percent are represented by Ukrainians, while the number of Ukrainians in the Armed Forces is much smaller. This is why delegates discussed the issue of reviewing personnel policy. Colonel Tsymbalyuk and Captain Second Rank Khryshchuk emphasized that the command is trying to ban SOU representatives from working in certification committees. The same opinions were voiced in the speech by Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil, who added that without reforming personnel policy we cannot build a national army capable of guaranteeing Ukraine's independence. Deputy Defense Minister Volodymyr Mulyava also spoke on working under new conditions. He called upon delegates to expand SOU's influence in all spheres of Army life. In his opinion, in the future the union should be transformed into a general association of officers and noncommissioned officers. The words "concrete measures" were not used at the first four congresses, because at that time, a program was being drafted. Not abandoning this line, the fifth congress paid more attention to resolving current problems, in particular, the union members' image as a model in combat training and social activities. Colonel Tretetskyy, chief of a unit's psychological service, said in this respect: "We used to have 17 officers in our organization; only 12 are left today, but they are real fighters for the cause of building Ukraine's Armed Forces. We are determined to serve as a model for others to follow. This opinion found its reflection in the resolution of the congress. Today, when our Army is experiencing hard times, officers' personal examples play a very significant role. Here are a couple of examples demonstrating how difficult it is for the military to perform their functions. The Army receives only 33 percent of necessary financing and even lacks money to pay servicemen's wages in timely fashion. Thus, it is no wonder that the Defense Ministry has recently bought only one T-80 tank produced in Kharkov. Shortages of fuel and spare parts have had a negative impact on training of airmen and led to the resignation of 170 young pilots. However, it takes a lot of determination to unselfishly serve the motherland in these conditions. The fact that the union appealed for personal examples means that the organization will see better times. The more difficult the situation in the Army, the higher its rating among the people. Today, 62.5 percent of Ukrainians have confidence in the officers' corps, while among farmers this figure reaches 83 percent. The people rely on its defenders for the protection of their most cherished values--freedom and independence. This gives the Army strength and inspiration.
