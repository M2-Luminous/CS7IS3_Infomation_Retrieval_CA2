ACTION: Notice of meetings and teleconferences. SUMMARY: The Assistant Secretary announces a series of meetings and teleconferences to discuss a preliminary draft of proposed regulations to implement certain provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 and 1993 (the Act). The meetings and teleconferences will allow interested parties an opportunity to review and discuss the draft proposed regulations prior to the publication of a formal notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register . This effort is part of a broader initiative to be more open to input from the various constituencies interested in the programs administered by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). The purpose of the meetings and teleconferences is to invite public comment on the draft proposed regulations, especially as these regulations interpret or clarify statutory requirements of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 and 1993.

An additional meeting may be held on May 5, 1994, in Oakland, California, if more individuals are interested in participating than can be accommodated at the May 4 meeting. The teleconferences are scheduled to be held on April 20, 1994, May 13, 1994, and May 18, 1994. All written comments may be received on or before May 27, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The draft proposed regulations would replace existing regulations under 34 CFR part 361 governing The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program. These draft proposed regulations, however, do not include the provisions relating to order of selection under 34 CFR 361.36 that were published in the Federal Register for comment on July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38482). Final regulations relating to the order of selection requirement will be published as a separate document later this year. In addition, these draft proposed regulations do not implement section 106 of the Act relating to evaluation standards and performance indicators for The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program. Proposed regulations implementing section 106 will also be published separately for public comment. Staff from OSERS and other offices of the Department of Education will be available at the meetings and teleconferences to discuss the draft proposed regulations and provide technical assistance and clarification of the proposed provisions. Participants are particularly encouraged to express their support for or raise concerns about specific sections of the regulations and, if possible, to provide alternative language if they disagree with the wording in the draft proposed regulations.
