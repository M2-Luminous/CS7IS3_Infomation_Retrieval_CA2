Mircea Cosea, minister of state, president of the Council of Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform: "I see the forum as a success. I think the forum is very important for three reasons: It has greatly contributed first to a change in the Romanians' manner of getting in touch with foreigners. Then, it has been rather large. There have been a great many companies, banks, and international companies interested in the way how one can invest, in what domains and priorities. There are a few proposals for the setting up of banks and many interests in oil processing, chemistry, agriculture, and, particularly, in the infrastructure and development of services. Third, Bucharest has arrested international attention again. It is an event that has called attention to us again. We have proved we do have facilities to organize international meetings." Teodor Melescanu, Romanian foreign minister: "This year's Crans Montana Forum was a meeting of European standing in a European country and I am very pleased with its organization and results as concerns Romania's image, in the political and economic domains." ``The possibility we have taken advantage of in order to demonstrate that our country can be a bridge between Europe and several zones confronted with big issues -- the Middle East, ex-Yugoslavia, Central Asia -- has not been wasted. ``Also, understandings of economic collaboration were concluded, inter-state relations were established, and these are the concrete results of the Bucharest meeting. ``On an internal plane, it has been an opportunity to demonstrate the Romanians' big possibilities to gather their energies when needed.'' Emil Constantinescu, president of the Democratic Convention of Romania, an opposition coalition of Romania: ``This event has been first of all meant, I think, to improve Romania's image abroad which -- as we all know -- is negative, and to sustain the idea that Romania is apt to ensure the holding of an international conference at a Western standing. And I think it has succeeded in their respect. ``I have noticed two tendencies: One to exaggerate the formal facet, based on pomp and formalism and which belongs especially to the Romanian organizers, in the well-known traditions, and, on the other hand, the tendency of the Swiss organizers of the Crans Montana Forum, who wanted to ensure the climate of informal events and meetings, in which the sincere, open talks are prevalent. Contingent upon the relation between these tendencies, we can expect the consequences. Sure, if important was only this protocol, then, it might be termed easily as having used for propaganda purposes the presence of many political VIPs in order to credit the current power with successes, especially for domestic use. The second tendency, however, could have substantiated something more serious and I think it has done so partly, that is, direct and facilitate concrete contacts'' National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca: ``I have a rather long experience as regards the participation in international meetings. So, I can say that those who do not have such experience could have been a little disappointed to see that concrete problems have not been settled. ``But meetings of this kind are not expected to settle issues right away. However, this stage of talks, probing, pioneering in some domains is absolutely necessary and it happens prior to the settlement of the respective specific issues. ``In this respect, the Crans Montana Forum in Bucharest, by its inspired theme `The Emerging Markets,' by the conditions of organization and especially by participation, has helped in the efforts Romania is making to tear down in a certain way the unnatural psychological barrier and also to join in the flow of ideas and values.'' Napoleon Pop, state secretary, head of the European Integration Department: ``This forum usually covers a wider area, not only one direction, and it has always happened so because the efforts for integration cannot be separated from what is happening as global phenomena in this world. Also, you have noted that the forum has pursued and emphasized precisely certain directions with which Romania is willy-nilly connected: the Middle East conflict, the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, the Balkans cooperation, the relations with the European Union, and the regional cooperation. All of them major themes of great interest to Romania. The decision for integration and all our efforts in this respect cannot be isolated from what is happening around us.'' Viorel Salagean, Romanian National Unity Party senator, member of the Senate Commission for Privatization: ``The Crans Montana Forum conference has definitely been a gain for the country, for the Romanian political class, and for businessmen, both Romanian and foreign, present here. ``I am sure to many of the foreign guests who have been in Romania for the first time now and who have participated in the forum, it has been a great surprise. ``I have noticed many concrete contacts and, what is even more important, foreign businessmen have had contacts with Romanian politicians and cabinet members.'' Aurel Ghibutiu, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry: ``For the international business circles, the Bucharest forum has been a unique opportunity to meet and start advantageous collaboration actions. ``For four days both in an organized framework and in the lobbies of the Parliament Palace, talks were conducted with businessmen from Romania and from a big number of countries, in Asia and eastern Europe. I have seen their full satisfaction at the opportunity they have had in Bucharest to establish contacts. ``The consequences will show up soon. We have already prepared a number of missions to go to several countries and materialize the talks conducted in Bucharest. So, I believe Romania has made a remunerative investment the results of which will be obvious very soon.'' Dan Matei Agaton, minister of tourism: "It is very difficult to appraise the immediate effects. Anyway, we have launched a new form of tourism -- tourism for conference purposes and I think we have launched it at a European level. So, I am sure we are able to organize any time any international meeting, at whatever level. I think it has been a test for everything tourism at top level means in Romania. Since the World Population Congress, held in the '70s, our country has not organized another event of such a wide scale. The travel companies have been directly involved. I think the test has been passed successfully. We are waiting now for the reactions of the others. I am sure the image of Romanian tourism will change for the better."
