The major tasks of this rural work conference held by the provincial party committee are to further implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, analyze the agricultural and rural situation under the socialist market economic conditions, study and devise plans for strengthening the agricultural foundation status, deepen rural reform and comprehensively develop the rural economic work tasks during the last two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, and push the rural economy to a new stage. 1. Correctly Analyze the Agricultural and Rural Situation and Realistically Strengthen the Agricultural Foundation Status Since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our province has witnessed tremendous and profound changes in agriculture and in the rural areas and achieved historical progress in the rural economy. The total value of agricultural production has shown an annual average increase of 11.4 percent, agricultural labor productivity has shown an annual average increase of 14.7 percent, and the average per capita net income of peasants has shown an annual increase of 8.3 percent and the food and clothing problems in the rural areas have been basically solved. The eighth plenary session of the sixth provincial party committee held in 1991 comprehensively summarized the agricultural and rural work during the 13 years of reform and opening up, raised the proposal of regarding the goal of becoming well-off as the banner to guide rural work in line with the characteristics that the rural economy has entered the stage of commodity production, and defined the guiding ideology of "readjusting the structure, raising efficiency, relying on science and education and invigorating agriculture." After the eighth plenary session of the sixth provincial party committee, the party committees and governments at all levels adopted a series of important measures to strengthen the agricultural foundation status and to accelerate the development of the rural economy. We should conscientiously implement the party's various rural principles and policies; stabilize and improve the family-based output-related contract responsibility system; establish the main market operational status of peasants, township enterprises and all sorts of rural economic organizations; strictly clear up the burdens of peasants; set ceiling prices for the means of production for agricultural use; exert efforts to solve the problem of issuing IOU's for purchases of agricultural products; protect and mobilize the production enthusiasm of peasants; formulate and implement the strategic plans of coordinating grain and livestock production with township enterprises, foreign trade with industry and agriculture, agriculture with science and education, and urban areas with rural areas; flexibly readjust the rural economic structure of production set-up and comprehensively develop the county economy; gradually decontrol the prices of grains and agricultural products; strive to organize agricultural production in line with market guidance; cultivate and build a market system for agricultural products; place township enterprises in a strategic position of the rural economy; promote the shareholding cooperative system; establish small industrial areas, link the urban areas with the rural areas; give priority to solving the difficult problems of funds, items, and personnel and promote a sustained and speedy increase of township enterprises; uphold the strategy of using science and education to invigorate agriculture; make overall plans to combine agriculture with science and education; carry out comprehensive agricultural development and enable agriculture to move toward the orientation of high-yield, high quality, and highly-efficient farming; give great emphasis to some policies and investments; support rich counties to accelerate development, and support poor counties to shake off poverty and become rich; give play to the advantage of border development; establish farm products export, production, and processing bases and actively develop export-oriented farming; expand the degree of changing the operational mechanism of industrial and commercial enterprises; transform county-run industrial units into state-owned people-run units or people-owned and people-run units and enhance the vitality of county economy; consolidate and improve the rural party branches, perfect village supporting organizations, conduct activities on running townships in line with the law; conduct ideological education focusing on enhancing the sense of commodity and strengthening the confidence in becoming well-off and strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the rural areas and of the party's grass-roots organizations; strengthen the functions of counties to take overall responsibility over local economic work; change from simply grasping agriculture into comprehensively developing all rural industries and from paying attention to financial revenue into cultivating financial resources and enable all kinds of economic sectors and all industries in counties to compete with one another during development; adopt the work method of using typical cases to lead the way, giving different guidance according to the merits of different cases and carrying out the work in the whole region; and give specific work guidance according to the characteristics of different economic ownerships and regional development and raise the overall level of rural work. We can say that in the past two years, the province has had a clear idea about rural development, effectively organized and guided agricultural and rural work, made the biggest strides for rural reform, and made the fastest economic development. In 1993, the province turned out 23.91 billion kilograms of grain, setting a historical record. The total grain output increased, the grain structure was improved, the grain quality was upgraded, and the efficiency from grain output increased. The diversified economy dominated by animal husbandry was comprehensively developed. The diversified economic output value accounted for more than 30 percent of the total agricultural output value. Town and township enterprises developed at a rapid speed. In the first 10 months of this year, the town and township enterprises' output value, profits, and tax revenues respectively increased by 68.1 percent, 71.3 percent, and 75.2 percent. The town and township enterprises have become a half of the rural economy. Great headway was made in export-oriented agriculture. The proportion of farm and sideline products in the foreign export trade volume was close to 30 percent. Each of the five major farm products created more than $10 million foreign exchange from exports. The per capita net income of the peasants reached about 1,000 yuan. The increase rate of the per capita net income of the peasants was higher than the national average level for two consecutive years. The total output value of the rural society increased by double digits. The county economy made more contributions to the province. More than 70 percent of the newly added portions of the total output value of society were created by the county economy. Generally speaking, the agricultural and rural situation continued to develop along with a good orientation. Although the province has made great headway in agriculture and rural work and the agricultural and rural work has tended to develop in a sustained, fast, and healthy manner, many new conditions and problems emerged in the course of system reform. We are still confronted with many contradictions that should urgently be solved in the course of realizing the fairly well-off target. The main contradictions are as follows: Our province has relatively abundant natural resources, but the degree of overall development is not high. Our province is a key grain production area as well as a large agricultural province. The output of major farm and sideline products ranks the province among the first 10 in the whole country. The deep development and the overall utilization of the farm and sideline products cannot keep pace with the increase in the total output. The province is still in the stage of producing raw materials and preliminarily processing major products. As a result, the rural economic results are reduced by a big margin. The commodity rate of the farm and sideline products continue to increase when the development and setup of markets are relatively slow. More than 60 percent of the province's farm and sideline products are marketable. Due to the failure to develop and set up markets and effectively coordinate production and management with domestic and foreign markets and affected by the fact that the supply and demand of ordinary farm and sideline products are even at home, the phenomena that the circulation of farm and sideline products is blocked still prominent exist. Thus, it is difficult to make the rural economic operation suit the demands for socialized production and unified markets. Due to the failure to effectively guide and organize the rural decentralized management, agricultural production and management are neither keen to the reaction of markets nor closely related to the market demands. As a result, it is difficult to have some products become readily marketable, to make some natural resources gain economic advantages, and to create large-scale economic results from the rural economy. Due to the slow development of nonagriculture, a large number of agricultural laborers have become unemployed. Affected by the traditional agricultural forms and restricted by production conditions, we made a late start in developing such nonagricultural industries as rural circulation trade, labor service trade, and town and township enterprises. As a result, increasingly more surplus labor forces due to the decrease in the per capita are transferred to other jobs at a slow speed. With a weak sense of the commodity economy, the nonagricultural industries lack motivation for development. With dual risks, the agricultural front lacks appropriate support and protection measures. Due to the insufficient input to agriculture, the weak infrastructural facilities, the high agricultural social benefit, and the low comparable effect, we are confronted with increasingly more risks in resisting natural disasters and developing markets. The mechanisms for supporting and protecting agriculture have not yet taken shape. So, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products become widened, the per capita income of the peasants increase at a slow speed, the rural economy is short of reserve strength for development, and the tasks for improving agricultural production conditions become heavier. These contradictions and problems indicate that if we fail to consider agriculture and rural work from a high level, to emphatically enhance the basic position of agriculture, and to optimize the structure of rural industries, it will be impossible for the rural economy to have a sustained and rapid growth. If we fail to unswervingly orient the rural economy onto the track of the market economy and to organize agricultural production and management truly according to the law of the market economy, it will be impossible for the rural economy to maintain its protracted vigor. These contradictions and problems, which in some cases have cropped up or developed in the course of shifting systems, must be dealt with by relying on deepening the reform. Those that have been caused by underdeveloped productive forces require us to fully regard development as a mandatory principle. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Improving agriculture to a new level represents a foundation for fulfilling the second and third strategic targets, and increasing per peasant income represents a foundation for the society as a whole to reach the better-off level. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have always attached great importance on agriculture and on problems encountered by rural areas and peasants. After the rural reform program was personally led and organized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping -- which has a historical significance -- he presented a series of brilliant expositions on rural reform and development and pointed out that the basic position of agriculture in the national economy will never be changed; that rural stability can decide the stability of the country as a whole; and that rural reform can affect and promote urban reforms. He also pointed out that agriculture is not only an important economic issue, but also an important political one; in developing the rural economy, we should rely first on the policies, second on science and technology, and third on inputs; and that it is imperative to enhance the party's leadership over agriculture and the rural work. In line with the persistent thinking of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has enhanced the agricultural position; developed the rural economy; and protected peasants' interests over the past four years by adopting many important and major measures. Heilongjiang is a large province that is endowed with agricultural resources and its rural economy and county economy occupy an important position in the province's economic pattern. It has more new economic growing points than other provinces, which represents the part that has large potential and vigor in affecting the economic development throughout the province. Only by boosting the rural economy can we promote the province's economy to achieve faster and better development. The rural economy is encountering an opportunity in which its development can be quickened. Along with implementing the spirit of the central rural work conference and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the understanding of units from top to bottom across the province regarding the enhancement of the basic position of agriculture will become more clear and definite; their confidence in successfully conducting agriculture and rural work will be further enhanced; and agriculture, peasants, and rural work will be emphasized. The central and provincial authorities have adopted a series of important measures and every possible way and means to develop the rural economy and to increase peasants' income. All of this will further bring into play the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, enable agricultural production to exert more potential, have the province's rural commodity economy achieve greater development, enable the economic and industrial structures to become rational, obviously upgrade the comprehensive productive capability, and have the province basically possess the material foundation for achieving sustained and fast development. We must seize the currently favorable opportunity. In line with the demands of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, we should deeply understand and implement the important expositions of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to agriculture and rural work; overcome the blind optimism on the consecutive bumper harvests; prevent the trend of neglecting agriculture; and realistically enhance the agricultural production and the rural work. We should also do a good job in organizing the rural reform of 1994 and the enforcement of tasks for developing agriculture and strive to enable the rural economy to be improved to a new level during the "Eight Five-Year Plan" period and to have the rural outlook be improved. This requires us to resolutely and unswervingly implement the principle of regarding agriculture as a foundation, to unswervingly place agriculture on the first position of economic work, to continuously hold high the banner of becoming better-off, to accelerate the establishment of economic operation mechanism that is suitable to the demands of the socialist market economy, to quicken the development of rural productive forces and the county economy, and to enable rural areas and peasants to become wealthy as soon as possible. 2. Deepen the Rural Economic Restructuring and Turn Rural Economy to the Socialist Market Economy Before Others The central rural work conference and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have already defined the objectives and general ideas for the rural reform. In line with the demands of the central authorities, we must accelerate the pace of rural reform, with focus on stabilizing the rural management system, cultivating the mainstay of market, improving market system, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. At the same time, we must rapidly establish a rural economic managerial system and operational mechanism that are suitable for the socialist market economy. A. We should stabilize and perfect the rural managerial system, energetically develop the shareholding cooperative economy, and cultivate and expand the mainstay of market. The household-based output-related contract responsibility system and the dual management system that integrates household operation with collective operation are the basic policy of the party in the countryside as well as the basic economic system in the countryside, and thus they must be carried out protractedly. The originally defined land contract relations in various localities should be stabilized and extended for another 30 years without changes. The period of contracts of a development nature, such as reclaiming barren land, building forest land, preventing the land from becoming sandy, and improving the fertility of soil, should be extended for another 50 years. Within the contracted period, we should carry out the method of "increasing persons but not land and reducing persons but not land." In conducting the appropriate-scale management of land, we should establish a land turnover mechanism compatible with the demands of market economy on the prerequisite of developing non-agricultural industries accordingly and promoting reasonable flow of rural labor forces. This requires us to consolidate ownership, stabilize contract right, enliven the right to use, and allow peasants to transfer on a paid basis, to lease, and to mortgage the land use right and to buy shares in order to enable peasants to independently solve the contradictions between different persons in line with the changes in management conditions and in accordance with the law of market and in order to raise the distribution efficiency of land resources. The non-agricultural industries develop more rapidly than others. The localities, that have conditions in various fields, may carry out the appropriate-scale management in line with the wills of peasants by proceeding from reality, but should not force all the peasants to join the management. We should strive to enhance the economic strength of the village-level collectives and strengthen the overall planning and service functions of the village-level collectives. The shareholding cooperative system is a new invented system to adapt peasants to market mechanism and to accelerate the development of rural economy, and is another major reform in the rural management system. This year, the development trend of the shareholding cooperative system in the province's rural areas has been very good. We must utilize this good trend to spread this system by regarding it as a major measure to accelerate the reform and development of the rural areas. At present, we should mainly spread this system among town and township enterprises. The newly initiated town and township enterprises should all adopt, in principle, this system. At the same time, we should use this system to renovate existing town and township enterprises to change the confusion in property right and the lack of funds. We should use about two years of time to change more than half of village collective enterprises to shareholding cooperative enterprises. We should also extend the shareholding cooperative system to the spheres of the serial development of the cropping industry, the circulation of agricultural and sideline products, and the rural collectivized service. All kinds of economic organizations, institutions of higher learning, scientific research institutes, and peasants should be allowed to buy shares with funds, equipment, plant houses, technology, land, and labor forces. In spreading the shareholding cooperative system, we must give guidances based on respective cases. The areas which have not yet introduced the shareholding cooperative system should try the system first and then popularize it as quickly as possible. The areas which are experimenting with this system should primarily reduce the restrictions on policies and allow peasants to carry it out freely. The areas which have achieved relatively great progress in carrying out the system should be guided in a timely manner to deepen towards the orientation of standardization and systemization with the purpose of gradually making their distribution of shares reasonable, their organizational structure perfect, their management system perfect, and their profit distribution appropriate. B. We should accelerate the establishment of socialized service system and gradually realize all-process socialized service to production, operation, distribution, and consumption. Since the household-based contract system was instituted, socialized service networks composed of rural collective economic organizations, agriculture-related departments, and various intermediate organizations have been improved step by step and have made great contributions to rural economic development. However, the service functions and service scope of these service organizations still fall far short of the demand for developing rural productive forces. The service entities run by peasants are not well organized, and village-level service are universally uncoordinated. The quality of service provided by county and township agricultural departments has weakened, the service of agriculture-related departments is at a low level, and the degree of socialization of the entire service system is not high. To solve the above-mentioned problems and make independent operations more compatible with the unified market, we should regard establishment of the socialized service system as an industry to develop. Agriculture, science and technology, commerce, grain, supply and marketing, finance, and material departments should adhere to the purpose of serving agriculture and peasants, actively explore the fields of service, strengthen their service functions, coordinate their services, and establish a sound service network by combining the supplies of funds and means of production, the dissemination of technology, and technical training before production, the technical and operational guidance during production, and the processing, storage, transportation, and marketing after production. We should give play to the role of rural production and managerial experts, encourage and support them to operate or establish service organizations or service entities, and gradually turn the service organizations run by peasants into specialized associations performing the functions of self-service and self-protection. We should improve community service organizations, provide particular assistance for the townships and villages with weak collective economy to establish service organizations, and guide them to gradually enhance their service strength and improve their service level by starting with technical service and expanding their collective economy. We should step up efforts to improve county and township agriculture stations (centers), update their technology and equipment in a planned manner, strive to increase the wages of agricultural scientific and technical personnel, provide grass-roots agriculture-related units with necessary means of service, enable their technical personnel to have ease of mind in their service work, and continuously improve their service quality. After this, we should establish a provincewide socialized service pattern with sound organizations and functions. C. We should lift control on and protect the prices of farm products and cultivate and establish the market system more rapidly in order to provide favorable conditions for developing the rural commodity economy. The key to cultivating and building rural markets is to let the prices of farm products take shape chiefly through the market. To establish a new mechanism for the prices of farm products, enliven rural circulation, and increase peasants' income, the province, beginning next year, will keep the amount of grain to be purchased under contract unchanged and purchase all the contracted amount of grain at market price. When the market is lower than the state-fixed protection price, we will purchase at the protection price. We will continue the method of paying extra money for peasants to cover the difference between the government prices and the market prices of chemical fertilizers and diesel oil supplied to peasants according to their purchasing contracts and supply them with chemical fertilizers, diesel oil, and deposits linked to the contracted purchase in a timely manner. We should do a good job in the coordination and preparations for the reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system, regard it the priority of next year's work to improve the grain markets and the marketing contingents, establish the grain risk fund system as soon as possible, and improve the grain reserve system. The prices of all farm and sideline products will be lifted in the future, business channels will be liberalized, and all obstacles will be removed so as to provide equal opportunities and environment to various business organizations and peasants. Establishment of the market system is the basis of the market economy. We should develop, cultivate, and build markets more rapidly. With wholesale markets as the center and rural fairs as the supplement, We should establish as soon as possible a framework of the market system under which the markets for commodities and the markets for essential elements of production are developed in a coordinated manner, rural areas are linked with urban areas, and markets are rationally distributed, have sound organizations and complete functions, exercise standard management, and are highly efficient and unimpeded. The provincial authorities should give priority to building the agricultural product wholesale markets and the futures markets to serve the whole country; all cities and towns should give priority to building agricultural product special wholesale markets with local superiority; and all townships and towns should give priority to building country trade fairs. We should actively cultivate the markets of essential production factors, such as the markets of banking, property right, technology, information, and labor forces. In cultivating and building markets, we must manage things in line with market law, give full consideration to conditions for the flow of commodities and personnel and for collection and distribution of commodities, extensively conduct activities to invite business, and persist in making scientific plans and seeking gradual development. We should strengthen the building of infrastructure facilities, including telecommunications, road and warehouses, develop banking, insurance, notary, commercial, catering, and service industries and give priority to improving the conditions of special wholesale markets which have attained an initial scale. We should improve the laws and regulations for market transactions, business activities and market competition, establish arbitration organs to settle disputes in transaction and in honoring of contracts, set norms to keep the market business within proper bounds, and protect fair transactions and legal competitions. Meanwhile, we should be determined to cultivate and develop a batch of contingents to sell farm products and major products of township enterprises, give priority to supporting major commodity circulation units, develop intermediary organs, continue to give play to the role of state and cooperative commercial units as the main circulation channels, do a good job in linking production with the market, and invigorate commodity circulation in the rural areas. D. We should strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control of the rural economy and promote a sound rural economic development. It is impossible for the market mechanism to spontaneously strengthen the agricultural foundation status. In the process of establishing the socialist market economic system, we must strive to strengthen and improve the government's macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture. Governments at all levels should stand on the high plane of taking overall responsibility, act in line with their functions of "guidance, support, protection and macro regulation and control," follow the law of value, apply the economic levers, and give correct and effective control over rural economic performance. We should grasp the trend of agricultural development and market changes, make rational plans and readjust the distribution of rural productive forces and promote an coordinated development in various trades and regions and between the economic and social sectors. We should regard such major affairs as the readjustment of the proportion of industrial and agricultural investments, the agricultural investment structure, major agricultural capital construction projects, the price parities between industrial and agricultural products, the readjustment of rural production set-up, and the development of industry to support agriculture that affect the overall situation as the priorities of regulation and control and adopt more economic and legal means to manage agricultural production. We should strengthen rural economic legislation, gradually improve regulations and laws on supporting agricultural development, protecting agriculture and safeguarding the interests of peasants, deeply carry out the work on running villages and townships in line with law, and raise the degree of standardization of rural economic performance and the level of legality. We should strengthen the building of rural market information system, develop information research and consulting organs of various ownerships in a planned manner, do a good job in market forecast for agricultural products and information dissemination and induce peasants to develop agricultural production in line with market changes. Continued efforts should be made to promote comprehensive reform pilot work in counties and urge pilot counties to further emancipate the minds, expand the reform strength, take the lead in establishing market economic operational mechanism and set examples in county reform for the whole province. 3. Hold Aloft the Banner of Becoming Well-Off, Accelerate the Development of County Economy and Strive To Build a Prosperous and Civilized New Countryside In a final analysis, the issues of agriculture, the rural areas and peasants are the issues of development. Realizing the goal of becoming well-off is a common desire and new pursuit of the broad masses of peasants after they have enough food and clothing as well as the fundamental motivation for accelerating the development of agriculture and the rural economy. The core of development is to unceasingly increase the income of peasants. This is a major change in the idea of rural development. Party committees and governments at all levels should consider accelerating the development of rural productive forces and county economy and unceasingly increasing the income of peasants as the fundamental starting and resting points of rural work. A. We should vigorously develop high-yield, good-quality, high-efficient, and export-oriented agriculture in line with the demands of domestic and foreign markets to increase the rural economic results. Over the past years, particularly this year, under the guidance of markets, all localities have positively developed and produced various good-quality farm and sideline products that are suitable to the consumption demands and have made noticeable achievements in increasing production and economic results. Facts fully showed that the development of high-yield, good-quality, high-efficient, and export-oriented agriculture is an essential demand of the tendency for suiting the market demands and the changes of the foodstuff structure, ensuring a stable increase in the output of basic farm products, and comprehensively improving the agricultural production level as well as an accurate choice to optimize the internal agricultural structure and increase the rural economic results. So, we are required to shift the focus of agricultural production from the increase in quantities to the improvement of quality and to increase agriculture's economic results through readjustment of the agricultural structure. On the basis of stabilizing development and optimizing grain production, we should vigorously develop readily marketable cash crops and forage crops and ceaselessly increase the benefits from grain production and the overall utilization rate of natural resources. We should persist in the target of building animal husbandry into a pillar industry of the rural economy; focus on developing the breeding of milk cow, meat cattle, lean hogs, and poultry; promote the coordination of agriculture and animal husbandry to increase the output value through transformation; and strive to make our province become a large grain and livestock production province. We should fully use mountain, water, forest, grass, and mineral resources and bring into play the advantages of suburban areas, the areas along both sides of roads, and gardens to develop the cash crops and breeding industries that have big markets, to develop new production spheres, and to expand new revenue sources. Our province has the advantages of opening its border areas to the outside world. This is a favorable condition for developing the export-oriented agriculture. According to the international market demands, we should set up, in a well-planned manner, a group of export farm product production and processing bases; expand the production of readily marketable products; ceaselessly improve the quality and standing of commodities; strive to increase the proportion of export farm products; and increase the market competitiveness. B. We should persistently pay equal attention to development and improvement, vigorously develop town and township enterprises, and accelerate the pace of industrializing the countryside. Our province has rich natural resources, registers a faster increase in the total output of farm products, and has favorable conditions for developing town and township enterprises. However, the farm product processing and utilization rate is rather low. This indicates that the town and township enterprises have great potential for development. Although our province has speeded up the development of town and township enterprises, their results are not high, only a small number of town and township enterprises are engaged in industrial production, their product standing is low, and their market competitiveness is weak. The strains on capital, projects, and skilled persons still restrict the development of town and township enterprises. We must unswervingly regard the development of town and township enterprises as a strategic priority of the economic work; persist in the principle of paying equal attention to development and improvement; vigorously carry out the "leap-over project;" strive to ensure that the town and township enterprises realize more than 70 billion yuan of output value by the end of 1995; and improve, at the same pace, output value, results, and enterprise quality. To this end, we must persistently coordinate the setup of high-tech and export-oriented town and township enterprises with large markets with that of town and township enterprises with fewer investment and faster economic results so as to support the development of town and township enterprises. We should strengthen the construction of projects for town and township enterprises; cultivate a group of specialized ranks engaged in the development of projects; and develop high-tech processing projects with high market demands, fewer investment, and faster efficiency so as to provide timely service for town and township enterprises. All localities should be geared to the needs of markets, continue to bring into play the advantages of natural resources, and try every possible means to build a group of projects with fewer investment and faster economic results. Being based on this, the province, prefectures, cities, and counties should concentrate necessary funds and technological forces to establish and develop a group of large-scale town and township enterprises with high starting points and to strengthen the lineup of key town and township enterprises. We should develop small industrial zones of town and township enterprises and increase their economic results. In township enterprise investment, we should particularly ensure the construction of small industrial zones, and concentrate fairly high starting points for new township enterprises there. In small industrial zones with favorable conditions, we should establish township enterprise groups that have advantages in their scale, in a timely manner. We should also greatly increase the proportion of town and township industries. We should develop both resources, new products, and industries and facilitate the scientific and technological advance of township enterprises. We should formulate and implement the brand-name strategy for developing township enterprises, accelerate the development of new products and the improvement of key products, actively bring in and disseminate applicable advanced technology, and enable township enterprises to develop a series of products. Meanwhile, we should establish the personnel markets in service of township enterprises, resolve township enterprises' shortage of personnel by training some operation experts, bringing in some backbone technical personnel, and selecting some managerial personnel, and strive to improve the technological quality of township enterprises and increase the competitive edges of their products. We should raise funds on our own through various channels and bring in funds from outside to increase the money investment in township enterprises. The 2-billion-yuan investment in township enterprises we arranged for next year should be in place, the major part of the accumulation of rural collective economy should be used in developing township enterprises, and townships, villages, enterprises, and peasants should be mobilized continuously to raise funds by themselves to develop the processing industry. Finance departments at all levels should earmark a certain amount of funds to pay the interest of the loans for township enterprises. All finance organizations should adopt every means possible to lend money to township enterprises and, at the same time, take advantage of geographical position and blood relation to conscientiously implement the "township enterprise demonstration project in eastern and western parts," extensively develop joint operation and cooperation with developed localities, and bring in more funds for townships, villages, and township enterprises. We should further improve the operating mechanism of township enterprises and enhance township enterprises' ability for market competition. We should reform the internal managerial system, strengthen the status of township enterprise directors and managers as representatives of legal persons, and change the situation in which township enterprises are attached to governments and there are too many administrative interventions. Focusing on increasing the market shares of the products of township enterprises, we should also launch in-depth activities to improve product quality and increase the marketing rate of products and the profit-tax rate of output value, and strengthen the production and management of the enterprises. We should conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for attaining the targets of supporting township enterprises and launch extensive activities to link urban and rural areas. Departments directly under the province should define and implement their supporting measures as soon as possible according to the targets and work assigned them. In line with the principles of mutual benefit, mutual supplementation with each other's advantages, and common development, universities, large research institutes, and large plants should focus their coordination and cooperation activities on arming small industrial zones so as to support the sustained and rapid development of township enterprises. C. We should implement regional distribution and specialized production, establish the production and operation systems whereby trade, industry, and agriculture are integrated and production, processing, marketing a coordinated process, and improve the industrialization of the rural economy. Selecting and establishing the leading industries and highly competitive products with regional comparable advantage is the premise of participation in domestic and foreign market competition; and organizing specialized and large-scale production according to the demand for socialized production is the basis to win the regional comparable advantage. Geared to the domestic and world markets, we should adopt every means to develop, cultivate, and expand our advantageous industries and products, improve the level of rural industries, and extend the industrial chains. Judging from the situation of the province, we should exert great efforts to develop the intensive processing of such staple grain crops as corns and soybeans, such major economic crops as flax and beets, such animal by-products as milk, meat, and feathers, and such natural resources as forests and mineral reserves. In this way, we can develop a series of finely processed foods, feed, flax cloth, dairy products, sugar, tobacco, leather, furniture, soft drinks, medicines, and building materials to increase the value of farm products. In line with their advantages in natural resources, products, and technology, all cities, prefectures, and counties should work out good plans for developing their local economy so that respective guiding industries and superior products dominate, should organize and guide peasants to do business centering on guiding industries and key products, should advocate the practice of "one village engaging in one product and one township engaging in one trade," and should develop specialized production and scale management. To increase industrialization of the rural economy, we must focus on establishing a production and management system characterized by a close combination of cropping, breeding, and processing of production, supply, and marketing, of internal and foreign trade, and of agriculture, industry, and commerce. We should also accelerate the development of organizations that integrate industry and agriculture with foreign trade. Working to form a framework in three years and perfecting mechanism in five years, the province should emphatically grasp the work concerning the organizations which produce, process, and market product series with grain, flex, dairy products, and beets as their raw materials. Meanwhile, all cities and prefectures should emphatically cultivate trade-industry-agriculture integrations embracing local industrial and product advantages. All counties and townships should give full play to the role of corporations, associations, and able persons to help improve the management efficiency of existing integrated organizations. In building and developing trade-industry-agriculture organizations, we must break with the limits of administrative division and integrate raw materials production belts and processing bases with commodity distributing centers in order to commonly develop production-processing-marketing integrations. Meanwhile, we must emphatically cultivate and strengthen leading enterprises; accelerate the development of new products and markets, technological transformation, and the change in the operating mechanism of these enterprises; and enable these enterprises to play an even greater role in bringing along a number of specialized villages and specialized households and in running a number of production bases. In addition, we must pay attention to the profit linking of trade-industry-agriculture integrations and develop the economic groups that share risks and profits and that are closely connected, in line with the principle of improving efficiency. State farms are an important component part of the rural economy and are provided with relatively good conditions for developing rural industries and large-scale production. We should continue to deepen the restructuring of state farms and reinforce the position of production and management organizations as the mainstay of markets. We should exploit overall advantages to appropriately promote large-scale management around the development of guiding industrial series. Centering on improving economic efficiency, we should develop diversified management and fine and deep processing, initiate secondary and tertiary industries, make great efforts to increase accumulation, and continuously improve the living standards of staff and workers. We should also continue to organize the "state farm-county joint building" activities and exploit the demonstration role of state farms. D. We should further integrate agriculture with science and education and make great efforts to increase the technology content of agricultural products and to improve the scientific, technological, and cultural quality of peasants. A decisive factor for the sustained increase in total output of the province's agricultural products, for the constant improvement in the quality of agricultural products, and for the rapid development of the province's rural economy lies in the successful implementation of the strategy of invigorating agriculture with science and education for many years running. Next year, we must implement in an even better manner the measure of invigorating agriculture through science and education and must further orient the development of rural areas to the orbit of depending on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers. With the improvement in the quality of agricultural products and in economic efficiency of agriculture as the center, and with the development of fine products and the popularization of practical technology as the emphasis, we should seize the opportunity provided by the readjustment of the agricultural product mix and rural economic structure to further enhance the level of integrating agriculture with science and education, expand from the integrations within our own regions to the integrations with other regions, and expand integration in the agricultural sphere to the non-agricultural sphere. We should expand the integrations from single-item technologies to comprehensive technologies. We should further expand the scale of agriculture-science-education integrations. The integrations should be made universal gradually in the province's rural areas while paying attention to the work of some counties and townships where the integrations are being experimented with. We should further improve the quality of agriculture-science-education integration. Agricultural departments should continue to organize the implementation of the "bumper harvest plan," expand the coverage of areas applying advanced practical technologies, and define in a timely manner, the joint-research projects that may promote the progress of agriculture. In line with the demands of agricultural development, scientific research departments should organize forces to strengthen the selection and cultivation of new breeds of animals and plants of good quality, high output, and high resistance to diseases. We should strengthen research in stay-fresh, storage, package, and transport techniques for agricultural products and foodstuffs; strengthen implementation of the "spark" plan; vigorously develop brand-name, fine-quality, special, and new products; and successfully run new agricultural high-tech park zones and practical technology demonstration zones. Educational departments should increase the number of labor and technology courses among rural middle schools in line with the process of popularizing advanced agricultural techniques, conduct adult education with a focus on improving the technological expertise of peasants, and train all kinds of specialized talents for developing the rural economy. E. Efforts should be made to increase inputs in agriculture, to enhance the construction of agricultural infrastructures, and to reinforce the reserve strength of agricultural development. We should be determined to readjust the distributing pattern of national income and truly to enforce special policies for agriculture. The increased scale of financial spending budget for agriculture in 1994 should surpass that of the total financial spending budget by over two percentage points. Funds raised by localities for supporting agriculture should show a 10 percent increase each year and loans released for agriculture should show a 20 percent increase. Various loans and funds for supporting agriculture must be assuredly released in a timely manner and in line with the fixed volume. In order to meet the reform in the investment systems, it is imperative to expand the investment channels for agriculture while doing a good job in conducting reform among the rural financial organs; and to encourage peasants and rural collectively-owned enterprises to increase their accumulations through labor work and their funds for investments. It is also imperative to encourage peasants and these collectively-owned enterprises to broaden their fund resources by increasing the charges of non-agricultural land and to enliven their rural funds by successfully operating rural credit cooperatives and establishing cooperative foundations. Efforts should be made to enhance the management over agricultural funds, to upgrade the efficiency of fund utilization, and to prevent fund outflow and illegal diversion. By upholding the farmland capital construction with the focal points of improving soil, taming rivers, and planting trees, we should concentrate our efforts on building a large number of large and backbone projects of preventing flood; draining flooded fields; conducting irrigation; generating power; storing water; and diverting river water while accomplishing the repair, rebuilding, and improvement of the existing water conservancy facilities. Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace in consolidating the serious soil erosion in some areas; to regard as a focal point the tree planting aimed at greening the waste mountains; to accelerate the pace of fostering forests alongside water areas, used as a shelter for agricultural production, and aimed at maintaining the water resources; and to pay attention to developing the follow-up resources of forestry. A good job should be continuously done in carrying out comprehensively agricultural development on the Sanjiang and Songnen plains, accelerating the improvement of medium-and-low-yield farmland and of grassland, continuously fostering soil fertility, protecting farmland, and improving the agricultural ecological environment. When formulating their economic and social development plans, various localities should give preferential consideration to the construction of rural infrastructures and do a good job in carrying out an overall design. They should also integrate the improvement of agricultural productive conditions with the agricultural development, the project construction with the ecological construction, farm machines and agricultural technologies with land utilization and maintenance, and the improvement of peasants' living conditions and the ecological environment with the construction of new rural villages so as to improve the province's construction of rural infrastructures to a new level. F. Efforts should be made to accelerate the construction of small towns, to further enforce the integration between urban and rural areas, and to promote the harmonious development between the urban and rural economy. Small towns are major carriers of secondary and tertiary industries and represent a fundamental way to realize the urbanization of rural areas. Party committees and governments at all levels should regard the construction of small towns as a strategic measure of developing the rural economy and the county economy and put the construction on their major work schedule. They should strive to enable the province's construction of small towns to achieve greater development by the end of this century and foster or establish a large number of star towns that possess their own characteristics, have obvious strong points, are exerting large influence, and are stronger in playing a role of bringing along others. Efforts should be made to further improve the plan for small town construction, to make rational arrangements, to make breakthroughs in key areas, to enforce the plan step by step, to give priority to building up the county seats in the recent period, and to emphatically develop organic towns along border areas as well as railways and highways. We should uphold the principle of developing industries to build up towns and to make them prosperous and integrate the construction of small towns with the development of processing and tertiary industries. We should also enforce preferential policies in this regard and direct the rural cooperative economic organizations to open an enterprise in urban areas and the secondary and tertiary industrial enterprises in rural areas to jointly move in small towns. Efforts should be made to encourage peasants to join in industrial work in urban areas, to open a business such as food services, and to engage in the undertakings of transportation and construction so as to reinforce the cohesion and influence of small towns. In order to promote the construction of small towns and the development of secondary and tertiary industries, county seats may adequately broaden their scale as long as they have achieved faster development in the economy and basically possessed the conditions in various fields. We should emancipate our minds and actively conduct the pilot work of reform among the systems of urban resident registers. Peasants who are running industrial plants or business firms in urban areas as well as who have bought a house there, had a relatively stable job, and paid a certain volume of urban construction fees, may be allowed to become urban residents and their family registers may be put into ordinary management. G. We should step up efforts to promote the reform of county-run industrial enterprises by turning them into ones owned by the state but managed by the people or ones owned and managed by the people and greatly develop individual and private economies to cultivate and expand the county-level financial resources. The reform of the financial and tax systems to be promoted by the state next year will create some new conditions in the county-level finance. An important link to conform to the new conditions is to cultivate and open up new financial resources. County-run state-owned industrial enterprises constitute an important factor affecting county-level finance. To make county-run industrial enterprises successful, the provincial party committee, in August this year, held a forum on the reform of state-owned small industrial enterprises, deciding to combine the property right reform of the county-run industrial enterprises with their technical transformation to remold their systems and organizations. However, the work has proceeded in an uneven manner. Effective measures should be adopted to promote it more greatly. Judging from long-term development, domestic and foreign funds and technology should be used to renovate the enterprises who possess advantages in their products and whose economic efficiency is fairly good. The cooperative shareholding system should be applied to those whose products are still marketable but have no good prospects, and they should be leased or sold out to have their property right transferred and organization innovated. Those whose assets cannot cover their debts and who hold no promise of ending their deficits should close, suspend their production, and even go bankrupt so as to cast away their burdens. All cities and prefectures should attach great importance to this work and devote some time to giving specific guidance to promote this work in the counties and cities under their jurisdiction. All counties and cities should step up classification of their industrial enterprises and define realistic reform methods and adopt feasible measures to accelerate their reform. We should strive to complete the transformation of the systems and mechanisms in more than one-third of the county-run industrial enterprises in the province within next year. Practice in the county-level economic development showed that individual and private economies should be developed bravely because they are the new growing points of the rural economy and another important source of county-level revenues. We should further liberalize the scope of their business and allow individual household industrial production or business and owners of private enterprises to engage in all the production and business other than those prohibited by the state in explicit orders. We should further liberalize the methods of business and allow individual and private enterprises to contract, lease, merge, and purchase state-owned and collective small enterprises. H. We should attend to the two civilizations simultaneously and be competent in both so as to promote their coordinated development. While promoting the rural material civilization, we should conscientiously strengthen the spiritual civilization to make rural areas develop along the direction of affluence and civility. We should strengthen rural ideological and political work, intensify the education on the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and continue the education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism to guide the vast number of peasants to foster a spiritual pillar of the new era. We should launch extensive activities to build civilized villages and civilized households and guide peasants to establish a good practice characterized by plain living and hard work, thrift in running homes, respect for the old and love for the young, support for the poor, and help to those with difficulties. When summarizing the work to achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living in this winter and next spring and when implementing the "agriculture law," we should emphasize the education on the market economy and legal system and guide peasants to enhance the sense as the mainstay, the sense of competition, and the sense of self-protection. We should actively develop rural education and further improve the conditions for running schools. We should increase the number of students enrolled in and following through the nine-year compulsory education, reduce illiteracy, and prevent new illiteracy. Colleges and secondary specialized schools should enroll more students from rural areas and increase the students trained for certain organizations and those to be assigned to certain organizations. We should do a good job in improving rural cultural facilities and the contingent of literary and art workers to enrich the rural cultural life. We should succeed in the rural medical reform focusing on improving rural cooperative medical service, develop rural public health, and conscientiously resolve peasants' difficulties in receiving medical service. We should strictly enforce the family planning policies, coordinate the family planning work with the development of the rural economy and the improvement of the social guaranteeing system dominated by the old-age pension system, and control the natural rural population growth rate. We should further strengthen the overall management of social order; carry out the leadership responsibility system and the system that the activities of making assessment through comparison and awarding the advanced must not be held when the family planning targets are not attained; mobilize the masses to improve social order; deal strict blows to the gangs of hooligans and thefts and the criminals who engage themselves in train marauding and waylaying that run amuck at home villages and towns; strengthen the management of social order among the rural markets, entertainment centers, railway stations, and wharves; and create a stable social environment for developing the rural economy. 4. Strengthen and Improve the Party's Leadership Over the Rural Work and Ensure the Smooth Progress of the Rural Reform And Construction The key to strengthening agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy and accelerating the pace of rural reform and development is to strengthen and improve the party's leadership. Particularly, in the course of setting up the socialist market economic system, the party committees and governments at various levels must pay attention to the issues relating to agriculture, the rural areas, and the peasants; realistically control the overall rural work situation; and gain the initiative in rural reform and development. First, the party committees at various levels should strengthen organizational leadership over agriculture and rural work and upgrade the ability in controlling the overall rural market economic situation. The fundamental way for strengthening and improving the party's leadership over the rural work is to deeply understand and accurately apply Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and deeply understand and accurately implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the central rural work conference. According to the arrangements of the provincial party committee, the party committees at various levels should regard the study of the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the documents of the two sessions of the central authorities as a prominent political task and a prerequisite for improving the leadership level, and conscientiously and carefully organize party members and cadres to engage in the study. We should coordinate the ideological reality and the rural work reality with the rural reform and development tasks; grasp the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; grasp the main line that development is an established principle; and solve the problems that the people are not inspired with enthusiasm, fail to widen the way of thinking, stick to old conventions, and are satisfied at small wealth; enhance the firmness of implementing the basic line of the party; and upgrade the awareness of grasping agriculture and the rural work. The enhancement of the party's leadership over agriculture and the rural work should be reflected by the strong rural leadership system. The prefectural and county party committees should focus their work on agriculture and the rural work and assign principal leaders to take charge of the rural reform and development tasks. As far as the central cities that take charge of guiding the work of counties are concerned, their party committees should strengthen the leadership over agriculture and the rural work and study ways for solving the problems relating to agriculture, rural areas, and the peasants in a timely manner. The party committees at or above the county level should further assign deputy secretaries in charge of agricultural work and also assign vice mayors and deputy county heads in charge of industrial work. We should continue to carry out the system where counties and townships elect and assign deputy heads to take charge of town and township enterprises and the scientific and technological work. The agricultural committees are the overall departments in charge of agriculture and the rural work under the party committees and the governments at the same levels, and should bring their functions for coordination, management, service, and guidance into full play. The improvement of the party's leadership over the rural work should be reflected by the formation of the leadership form that is suitable to the requirements of the market economy. We should treat agriculture and rural work from the angle of the market economy, organize rural reform and agricultural production with the guidance of the market economy, always attach importance to developing the role of the market in allocating resources, lose no time in adjusting the rural production structure and product mix according to market changes, and organize and guide peasants to develop commodity production in broader fields. We should persist in the methods of using typical examples as guides, giving different guidance according to different conditions, and promote work regionwide. Following the 10 strong counties and 100 strong towns and townships, we should cultivate and foster a number of comparatively well-off counties, townships, and villages to serve as examples for rural areas to achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living more rapidly. We should further strengthen work guidance to mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, plain areas, border areas, and suburban counties and lead all types of counties to carry forward their local advantages and develop the county economy with their own characteristics. We should continue to support prosperous counties to accelerate development, help impoverished counties shake off poverty and achieve affluence, implement the preferential policies provided by the provincial party committee and government, strengthen the supporting, helping, and promoting work, and carry out the measures for rewarding attainment of targets to lead these counties to accelerate development. Second, we should improve rural grass-roots organizations and exert great efforts to train groups of persons capable of leading rural areas to prosperity. Rural grass-roots organizations are the organizational foundation for the party to exercise effective leadership over rural work. Aiming at developing rural productive forces and increasing peasants' income, we should put more efforts into improvement of village-level organizations with village party branches as the core while improving party committee leading bodies at all levels. In line with the principle of emphasizing political integrity and abilities, we should adjust, replenish, and improve party branch leading bodies in a timely manner and attach importance to optimizing their overall structure. Good party branch secretaries should be selected from local outstanding party members, from the cadres transferred from counties or townships, or from town and township reserve cadres. We should rectify incompetent party branches with slackened morale a group at a time and strictly carry out the regular activities of the party organization to improve their combat effectiveness and unity. We should regard the training of groups of persons capable of leading rural areas to prosperity as a long-term and strategic task of improving rural grass-roots organizations and conscientiously carry it out. All cities, prefectures, and counties should draw up work plans for this task and exert more efforts to implement it. We should promote town and township major responsible persons by attaching importance to their performance; optimize the structure of rural grass-roots cadres by selecting the people with higher political quality; expand the contingents of town and township entrepreneurs by training them and developing the rational mobility of trained personnel; and give play to the demonstration role of large specialized households through policy support. In three to four years, we should strive to turn most township and village party and government responsible persons into experts in organizing and leading the rural market economy and most responsible persons of township enterprises into modern entrepreneurs meeting the need of the market economy. Every village should have several large specialized households and demonstration households who can play a larger promoting role. While improving party branches, we should also improve villagers' committees, militia organizations, women's federations, and the Communist Youth League and develop their due role. As rural grass-roots cadres shoulder heavy and difficult work and are often the focus of contradictions, party committee and governments should make great efforts to understand, respect, show concern for, cherish, support, and protect them while conducting regular education and management to help them improve work styles and maintain close ties with peasants. Party and government departments at all levels should further enhance the sense of service, regard it as an important principle to serve, improve, and invigorate grass-roots organizations, make sure that grass-roots cadres direct production and perform work in an independent and responsible manner, reduce the work burdens on grass-roots cadres, and help them solve the specific problems in their work and life so that they can have ease of mind in and dedicate themselves to organizing and leading peasants to work diligently and achieve affluence. Third, we should ensure the implementation of the party's policies toward the rural areas and fully mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production. All prefectures, cities, counties, and departments concerned should resolutely, conscientiously, and solidly implement the numerous party Central Committee and the State Council's current policy measures for agricultural and rural economic development; and strive to make noticeable achievements within a short period of time. We should positively work out serviceable measures for promoting the implementation of policies, proceed from reality, and creatively implement the decisions of the central authorities and the instructions of higher levels. At the time of strengthening the mechanism for restricting the implementation of policies, we should strengthen organizational restrictions and strictly follow the working procedure of working out policies, organizing forces to implement policies, and giving examinations and instructions so as to institutionalize the implementation of policies. We should also strengthen the supervision by the masses; have the broad masses of the people understand, be familiar with, and grasp policies and gradually handle affairs according to policies; fulfill our duties according to laws; and resist the activities in violation of policies. Particularly, we should implement the policies on supporting the poverty-hit counties, coordinate the work of having the poverty-stricken areas free themselves from poverty and subsidies with the realization of the target of being fairly well-off, increase the input to the support of the poor, promote the support-the-poor work on a large scale, and promote even economic development among various regions. Fourth, we should mobilize the forces of all fronts to support agriculture and rural work and unite with one another to develop agriculture and make the peasants rich. Organizing and mobilizing all social forces to pay attention to, support, and develop agriculture should be regarded as a key link of strengthening and improving the party's leadership over rural work. The departments under the party committees and the governments should strengthen the investigations and study on agriculture and the rural work; achieve information feedback, supervision, and examination; be advisers on guiding agricultural production and the rural work to the party committees and governments; organize personnel affairs departments to prominently grasp the construction of the county-level leading bodies, the rural grass-roots organizations, and the cadres contingents and the exchange of skilled persons; and cultivate increasingly more persons to help the rural areas seek wealth. The propaganda and cultural departments should strengthen the propaganda on agriculture, the rural areas, and the peasants, arouse public opinion on protecting and supporting agriculture, and also make efforts to enrich the cultural life of the rural areas. The law and discipline enforcement organs should strictly investigate and handle the cases of harming, cheating, and apportioning expenses from the peasants; and protect the legal rights and benefits of the rural economic organizations and the peasants. The overall economic departments should organize large and medium-sized enterprises to positively introduce technologies, products, and skilled persons to the rural areas and to conduct cooperation with town and township enterprises. According to the state industrial policies, the economic lever departments should positively support the localities to develop the industries with their advantages and develop the private and individual sectors of the economy. The internal and external trade departments should calculate and report market information, organize the circulation of the rural areas, and help counties and cities build export commodity production and processing bases in a timely manner according to the changes of the domestic and foreign markets. Financial organizations should promote the flow of capital in the rural areas, grant more loans to agriculture, and help the rural areas optimize the industrial structure according to the principle of efficiency and in line with the credit policies. The Communist Youth League organizations, the militia organizations, and the women's federations should deeply launch various activities of promoting rural reform and development and bring into play the broad masses of rural young people, militiamen, and women's role as shock brigades, main forces, and half the sky. Only when the party and government leaders at various levels pay attention to agriculture and the whole society supports agriculture, will a brand-new situation in rural economic and social development emerge and the peasants' degree of wealth be greatly upgraded.
