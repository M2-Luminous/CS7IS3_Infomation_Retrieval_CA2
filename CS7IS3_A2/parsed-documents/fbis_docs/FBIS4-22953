Kulzhanov by correspondent M. Ambartsumyan; date and place of interview not given; UDC 368.06: ``Budget-Supported Health Insurance--the Will of the Day''] [Text] The matter of the draft law of the Kazakh Republic ``On Health Insurance for Citizens'' (second reading) was placed, among other issues, on the agenda of the 10th Session of the Kazakh Republic Supreme Soviet. Our correspondent M. Ambartsumyan interviews Deputy Minister of Health M. Kulzhanov on what health insurance includes, and what the limits of its possibilities are. [Ambartsumyan]Maksut Karimovich, many readers have gained the impression that budget-supported health insurance is a panacea for all economic ills in public health. [Kulzhanov]That's far from so. According to calculations by economists of the republic's Ministry of Health, this form of providing health care will help to ease the difficulties that accumulated over the entire existence of the former public health system by a maximum of only 30 percent. Let me begin with the basic program of budget-supported insured medicine, which includes a guaranteed volume of all forms of ordinary health care (with the exception of specialized care provided to tubercular and oncological patients), AIDS centers, children's sanatoriums, dairy kitchena, blood transfusion stations, cardiac surgery, grafts and transplantations of tissues and organs, and all forms of preventive immunizations. This is the part of health care for which state public health will assume responsibility, providing it to the part of the population that is still unemployed and to budget-supported organizations. [Ambartsumyan]Everyone is troubled by the main issue--treatment of the sick. On what principle will it be provided under insured medicine? [Kulzhanov]Therapeutic assistance that will be rendered under the conditions of mandatory health insurance is now acquiring the form of a commodity. It is with regard for this that medical economic standards, which include mutual settlements between insurance companies and medical institutions, have been developed. The cost of treating the most widespread diseases, the average duration of health care, possible predictable complications, the results of treatment and continuity of its stages are all written into these standards. The medical economic standards are of the necessary volume guaranteeing the quality of treatment. This program is planned for 3 years, during which time we will be able to break the system in and introduce the appropriate adjustments that will certainly be needed. [Ambartsumyan]Maksut Karimovich, the editor's office is receiving anxious letters in which people, its seems, are not very trusting of this innovation, and ask again and again for information on the system of mandatory health insurance. [Kulzhanov]Any form of insurance, be it voluntary or mandatory, requires a controlling and distributing body which could coordinate and manage the enormous amount of financial activity at the basis of insurance relations. Thus if we take an oblast as an example, we propose establishing a trusteeship council within its administration, to be headed by the administration deputy chief for social problems. The representatives of this council include the chiefs of the public health administrations, of the oblast financial administration and of the tax inspection office, trade union workers, and the chief executives of major enterprises. Were we to represent our insurance system in the form of a diagram, the third link would be a health insurance fund receiving money transferred from the state budget and from enterprises. However, the rather complex problem of receiving money into the fund's clearing account arises in this stage. I don't think that there will be any difficulties with appropriations form the state budget--they'll come in properly. But how are we to organize transfer of funds from the enterprises and the various organizations, especially considering that there are hundreds of them in the capital, not counting the small enterprises and joint ventures? Many of them will deliberately avoid payment, and drag their heels in carrying out this procedure, so unpleasant to them, citing unprofitability and other factors. I feel that the tax inspection office should become a powerful influence in relation to mandatory payments. It is interested in proper transfer of financial deductions, and the wages of workers of the inspection office will depend directly on the amount transferred to this fund. [Ambartsumyan]As with anything new, insured medicine harbors unforeseen complications; to what extent are you prepared for them? [Kulzhanov]They may arise chiefly between the patient and doctor. Expert groups consisting of the main unaffiliated specialists will be established under the health departments for this purpose. It is they who will be able to resolve conflicts with the greatest objectivity, performing the role of arbiters between therapeutic and preventive institutions, patients and the insurance companies. This form of their activity will be paid for by the guilty party. An accrediting and licensing bureau is, I believe, of no lesser significance. It will perform an important role in registering small enterprises, and small and midsized medical institutions occupying premises satisfying the necessary requirements of epidemiological oversight. It would also make sure that the personnel working in them are highly qualified, because there already have been many attempts to register ``therapeutic institutions'' having not a single physician, or even a nurse. Also, persons having nothing to do with medicine but possessing dubious credentials, such as extrasensory practitioners, bioenergetic surgeons and so on, have tried to ``take over'' therapeutic activity. [Ambartsumyan]In what practical ways will relations between insurance companies and medical institutions be maintained? [Kulzhanov]In each case the cost of the course of treatment for a patient is to be determined by the medical institution. After that, if the insurance company feels it to be excessive, it will have the right to appeal to an expert group. Thus the new economic relations are creating conditions in which the rights and interests of the patients are protected foremost. And as for the insurance companies themselves, it would be to their advantage to have well-equipped medical institutions with the corresponding top-class team of specialists, and to materially support this necessary balance. [Ambartsumyan]We haven't yet broached the question of rural public health in our interview: The opinion exists that it must remain under the support of the budget, because in view of their small amount, insurance premiums will simply be unable to provide for the level of health care that existed before. [Kulzhanov]Naturally in these days when agriculture is basically an unprofitable sector, the system of budget-supported insured health care foresees pooling of resources received from insurance premiums as a supplement to basic budget financing of rural public health. Monetary resources will be redistributed from the stronger regions to the weaker ones. And then we can talk about stabler provision of health care to rural laborers.
