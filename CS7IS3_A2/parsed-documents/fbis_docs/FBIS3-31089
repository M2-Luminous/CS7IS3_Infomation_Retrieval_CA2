I was one of the cofounders of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and have spent an intensive part of my life with it. In the elections, I assumed my share of responsibility for the movement's policy. I have received with pleasure reports about the growing sympathy for myself within the HZDS. This growth, which represents up to 15 percent, has occurred despite the escalating attempts, particularly within HZDS ranks, to discredit the president. It has become apparent, however, that HZDS members and sympathizers think otherwise than individuals in the Republican Board or in the HZDS Club of Deputies. [PRACA] There is constant talk about certain tension between the Castle and the government. Views are being foisted upon the public to the effect that you are building some kind of a second center of executive power in the state. [Kovac] The assertion that I am building some kind of a second center of state power is untrue and absurd. According to the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, executive power in the state is executed by the president and the Government of the Slovak Republic. The president has had to build his chancellery with its own experts to be able to exercise his constitutional powers. Hence, there do not exist any two centers of state power. The existence of political centers of power is another matter. One cannot speak about a single political center in a pluralistic political system; several such centers exist. However, on the basis of election results, one, two, or more political entities that come to an agreement on a government program form the government. Even the president of the Republic helps to implement this government program from the position of the head of state. I painstakingly see to it that I engage in this activity within the framework of my constitutional powers. The discussion about a second center of power reminds me of the fatal policy practiced by dogmatists of the former totalitarian regime. After all, the prerequisite of a functioning democracy is the division of power, which is clearly defined in Slovakia by the Constitution of the democratic state. [PRACA] How do you explain the existence of views that, even though it was the HZDS that won the elections, people from the Public Against Violence movement, the Civic Democratic Union, and Czechoslovakists have conquered the Castle, have surrounded you in the Office of the President, and act as your advisers? [Kovac] This is an untrue assertion. I will cite only a few basic facts. Of the nine key posts in the Office of the President of the Slovak Republic, four are held by people who come from the HZDS or are HZDS sympathizers, one is from the Slovak National Party [SNS], three have declared themselves independent, and I regard them as such, and one is from the Christian Social Union. Another group of staffers consists of former HZDS deputies to the Federal Assembly who are acting as department heads or desk officers. They are complemented with staffers professing allegiance to the SNS, and two come from the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. The majority are without party affiliation, both originally and at present. In the election campaign, the HZDS campaigned for the idea of filling posts with professionally qualified and morally competent people. I tried to achieve this also in building the Office of the President when I gave priority to the criterion of professionalism. There is not a single staffer here who would not identify with the existence of an independent Slovak state, no one who would not swear loyalty to the sovereign republic. I cannot accept the criticism that people are working in the Office of the President who had opposed the partition of the CSFR because this would run counter to basic human rights, my philosophy, and the position of the president as a representative of all citizens. I accept the criteria of loyalty toward the state and its constitutional bodies, moral irreproachability, and professionalism and expertise. How will my present critics come to terms with this approach, should a coalition be formed, either now or after the elections, involving the HZDS, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the Conservative Democratic Party, and the SNS, should the government be joined by members of the KDH, the SDL, or other parties? After all, the prime minister has received such an offer and he did not reject it. Therefore, I consider the criticism of the composition of the Office of the President to be only a pretext for attacks against the president of the Slovak Republic. I reply to all my critics: Do you think that the president of the Slovak Republic does not feel sufficient responsibility for the kind of people who are working for him, [that he does not care] in whose favor and in favor of which cause they are working? Is it necessary to remind the president of such elementary matters?
