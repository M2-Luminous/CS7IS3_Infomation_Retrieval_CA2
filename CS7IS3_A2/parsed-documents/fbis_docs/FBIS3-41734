As reported to us at the Sanitary and Epidemiological Station of the Russian Federation Ministry of Health, last week WHO reports were received about an outbreak of a new cholera-like disease in India. At the same time, two clinical patients appeared at a Rostov Hospital, whose symptoms resembled cholera, but the old testing methods did not confirm this diagnosis. As it was learned, the victims had returned several days earlier from a tour of India.... The disease occurs in serious clinical forms. Thus far there are no means of controlling or detecting it. At present, the leading Russian scientists are working on the virus.
