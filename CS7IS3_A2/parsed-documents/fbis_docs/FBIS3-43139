IT IS BASED ON FOREIGN MEDIA CONTENT AND BEHAVIOR AND IS ISSUED WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT COMPONENTS) Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-008--CHINA EVOLVING POLITICAL CARTOONS: THE "YEAR OF THE CAT" The cat has become a common symbolic subject of political cartoons in China since Deng Xiaoping said "It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white as long as it catches the mouse." This sentence is often interpreted by reformers as Deng's defense of a pragmatic, non-ideological approach to economic reform. The cartoons presented in this Foreign Media Note reveal that during 1993 the symbolic message behind the cat has gone from positive to negative. The cat has been portrayed as a successful mouse catcher and money maker to a corrupt official who takes bribes from the mouse in exchange for power, as a cat that is at the disposal of the mouse who is now the successful businessman, as an official who awards the mouse with a certificate of good citizenship in exchange for a bribe, and finally as a street book vendor, selling books for mice entitled "How To Escape the Pursuit of Cats." Cartoon number one was inserted here on hard copy "The Year of the Cat" (Beijing, Zhongguo Qingnian Bao 2 Feb 93 p5) In this cartoon the cat's eyes are represented by traditional Chinese coins and the cat is holding a mouse with coins around its tail, all of which encourages the positive pursuit of monetary rewards. Cartoon number two was inserted here on hard copy "Why Isn't the Mouse Afraid of the Cat"? (Beijing, Guangming Ribao 10 Dec 93 p 2) In this cartoon the cat is dressed in a black cadre hat and black overalls that say "corrupt." The fish in the cat's hand is his reward, which says: "personal gain through power." The bag on the mouse's back says "bribes." Cartoon number three was inserted here on hard copy "Now That the Mouse Has Money" (Tianjin, Tianjin Ribao 18 Jul 93 p 9) In this cartoon, the mouse, with a western business suit symbolyzing success and money, has enslaved the cat. Cartoon number four was inserted here on hard copy No title (Jinan, Shandong Huabao Oct 93 p 60) In this cartoon the cat is wearing a cadre uniform and is presenting a certificate of good citizenship to the mouse. The fish under the cat's tail reads: bribe. Cartoon number five was inserted here on hard copy "News From Book Stalls" (Kunming, Yunnan Ribao 16 Oct 93 p 5) In this cartoon the cat is hawking books entitled "How To Escape the Pursuit of Cats."
