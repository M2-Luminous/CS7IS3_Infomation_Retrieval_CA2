A statement from the office of the chief of general staff says the legislators could be allowed to repay the loans in accordance with the terms of payment entered into when such loans were obtained. The government also directed administrators to ensure that public funds were no longer deposited with finance houses. Instead central banks should be used for that purpose. Meanwhile, deposits by prospective candidates for the abortive 1993 local government elections are to be refunded. A directive to that effect from the presidency in Abuja asked state administrators to ascertain the amount the politicians spent on the abortive elections and where the money was deposited. They are also to identify bona fide candidates and make arrangements for their refund.
