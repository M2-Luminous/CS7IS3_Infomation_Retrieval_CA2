The founding conference of this organization, scheduled for Thursday, did not take place because organizational and technical preparations for it were not completed in time. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY predicted in its 13 May issue, the majority of opposition leaders today are not particularly interested in the accord. The prospects for the Accord in the Name of Russia project still look uncertain. The movement initiators will apparently have to abandon their plans to encompass the entire opposition or at least a greater part of it. Ilya Kostantinov, the leader of the once notorious National Salvation Front, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY that he for one does not know anything about the organizational efforts by Mr. Zorkin and company and expressed doubt that the accord's founding conference will ever take place. Apart from project coordinator Valeriy Zorkin, some activity toward the accord is being shown by Aleksandr Tsipko, Sergey Glazyev, Aman Tuleyev, and Petr Romanov. At the same time the initiative group has somewhat distanced itself from Aleksandr Rutskoy, who is now engaged with his own "Russian" organization, The State [Derzhava], as well as from Aleksandr Prokhanov. The initiators have shifted to the center somewhat and, unlike the ex- vice president, act on the assumption that the hopes for early presidential elections are unrealistic and therefore do not consider the question of presidential candidates. True, they say that Mr. Zorkin would like to see Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as leader of the nation. No doubt, the more time elapses between the emergence of the idea of the Accord and its structural organization, and the more stable the political situation in the country becomes, the farther the interests of the movement initiators are drifting apart. Thus, observers point out that Gennadiy Zyuganov can now act independently. Aman Tuleyev and Petr Romanov are playing out a Siberian regional card; some other people would like to create a kind of industrial division of the Agrarian of Democratic Party. In this light, it is only "an opposition leaders club" whose formalization appears more or less realistic. Importantly, no one here possesses any substantial monetary resources; only communists and agrarians have human resources; and only Mr. Zorkin is trying to create an apparatus. So far, as movement cofounder Vasiliy Lipitskiy told KOMMERSANT-DAILY, a conference of movement supporters has been scheduled for 28 May which will apparently proclaim itself a National Council. The organizers hope for large and representative delegations to arrive from Siberia, Central Chernozem Region, and the South of Russia. Apparently the failure of the unification project will indicate that the crisis in the opposition has aggravated further. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report on the conference results on 31 May.
