According to a plan announced by the Chinese Government earlier this week, China is determined to wipe out abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothing shortages for its now-remaining 80 million poverty-stricken citizens. The ambitious plan is significant in the history both of the Chinese people and mankind, for the rights to subsistence of 1.18 billion Chinese, which make up a quarter of the world population, will soon have this fundamental human right secured. Most of the 80 million people, about the same number as the whole German population, live in remote mountain regions, rocky regions, Loess plateau areas and remote deserts. Their lives are disastrously affected by acute shortage of water and poor public transport services, which make agricultural production difficult, not to mention industrial development. The per capita share of water in the poor areas is between a 16th and a 24th of the world's average. Electricity, education and transport services are hardly available to most of the areas. Compared with the poverty eased among about 45 million poor people during the 1986-1992 period, the remaining poverty facing 80 million Chinese is much more difficult to wipe out than the steps taken by China in 1978-1985. The population of the poor decreased from about 200 million in 1978 to 125 million in 1985, when China abolished the commune system and introduced the household contract responsibility system. The reform resulted in a sharp increase in grain output and farmers' incomes. During the eight-year poverty-reduction drive since 1986, China earmarked about 30 billion yuan worth of grain, clothes and other consumer goods for poverty alleviation, and allocated about five billion yuan in aid or discount loans to help the poor areas. For the next seven years, in comparison, China should do at least twice as much. It should help 11 million escape from poverty each year during the coming seven years, while, on average, only 6.4 million poor people did so each year in the past seven, by getting enough food and clothes. Despite the difficulty, China has many positive factors in its fight against poverty, such as the growing government investment, the priority given by the central and local governments to social and economic development in the poor areas, and support given by all walks of life and the international organizations. A recent government decision stipulates that when preparing national and regional budgets, a set sum of money should be used for poverty reduction by the central and local financial departments. To beef up the poverty reduction drive, the central government also made a decision to increase its investment in the "work for food program" by one billion yuan each year before the end of this century, and also extend one billion yuan discount loans to the poor areas. The investment in the program would total four billion yuan in 1994 and 1995, respectively. China's opening of its developing inland areas, particularly the border areas, has promoted local businesses and benefited from their trade with their neighboring countries or other areas. The booming Chinese economy also contributed greatly to poverty alleviation, offering many jobs to surplus laborers in the poor area. About 10 million surplus farmers in China's most populous Sichuan Province were employed last year by businesses in and outside the province, who earned a total of 10 billion yuan. Past practice shows that if a laborer from a poor rural family is hired by a business, the money earned by the laborer will enable the whole of his poor family to get enough food and clothes. In addition, the poor areas, which are rich in resources, will earn much more money as China is reforming its commodity circulation and pricing systems, including a gradual lifting of its control over prices of raw materials and primary goods. All these factors, together with other efforts, such as making water, power, education, public health and transport services available to the poor, will certainly ensure the realization of the plan to wipe out abject poverty in China.
