Maragay] [Text] National Security Adviser Jose Almonte said yesterday the stalled peace talks between the government and various insurgent forces have been a cause of alarm for the Ramos administration but added that the government could not be faulted for the slow progress of the talks. In an interview with Malacanang newsmen, Almonte admitted it was very difficult to give a time-frame for the conclusion of the peace negotiations with the communist rebels, Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and rightist rebel soldiers. "It depends on several factors which are not within the control of the government," he said. The exploratory talks between the government and the National Democratic Front (NDF) scheduled this month in Vietnam have been shelved anew because of certain conditions being demanded by NDF leader Jose Maria Sison which are unacceptable to the government. The peace talks between the government and the MNLF have also bogged down because the government has rejected a demand of MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari that he be allowed to have 500 armed security men while attending the negotiations outside of his base in Sulu. The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] (RAM) led by former army Colonel Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan has been very critical over the lack of progress in the peace talks. Almonte expressed the view that the various rebel groups will not go back to the hills to resume the fighting just because the peace process has been faltering. The national security adviser said the basic reforms which the government has instituted has "pulled the rug from under the feet of the rebels." "There was a pre-emption of the cause of the rebels," he said, stressing that the government's programs also reflect the cause of the rebels in many ways. "Therefore, there is no reason for the rebels to continue fighting the government, in addition of course to the changes happening in the world," he said. "Insofar as the socio-political framework is concerned, we could say that the nation is ready for the economic thrust as defined by the government," he added. Almonte rated the restoration of social and political stability as one of the major accomplishments of the Ramos administration during the past 540 days. He said the best indicator of stability is the fact that the various rebel groups are talking with the government about the peaceful resolution of the armed conflict. Asked about his opinion on the current confrontations in the political arena, Almonte said these are indicative of a vibrant democratic process. "We expect these activities. We should be worried when they no longer take place," he said.
