In a statement to Radio Novi Sad, Bulajic specified that the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina had classes in its mother tongue from kindergarten to university, that it had radio and TV programmes in Hungarian as well as its own theatres, cultural, art and sports associations. Bulajic's statement was prompted by his meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky in Novi Sad on Sunday. Jeszensky urged Yugoslav and Serbian authorities to meet the requests of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM) for a cultural autonomy. Jeszenszky paid an unofficial visit to Vojvodina to attend the centennial commemorating the death of Hungarian revolutionary Kossuth Lajos which was organized by the DZVM. Bulajic underscored that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, more than any other neighbouring country, enabled all minorities to exercise their human rights, even beyond the standards and norms stipulated by international documents. Commenting on the conclusions of the U.N. Commission for Human Rights adopted at a recent session in Geneva on an alleged violation of human rights in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bulajic stressed that the commission was presented with misinformations coming from the secessionist movement of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo-Metohija. The Yugoslav diplomat said he was confident that such misinformations and accusations did not exist in Vojvodina, because human rights of national minorities were respected in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia more than in any other neighbouring country and even beyond international standards.
