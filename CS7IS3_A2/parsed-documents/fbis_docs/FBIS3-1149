[Begin Manuel recording] Good morning, dear listeners. No understanding has been reached yet concerning the issue of government for this country. The mediators and observers may try to get the two sides to meet today to overcome the deadlock. According to a source, yesterday the mediators gave UNITA yet another document for it to analyze. That document was drawn up on the basis of the offer made by the Angolan Government. UNITA promised it would reply some time today. Despite that, observers here in Lusaka have admitted the possibility that negotiation may break down should UNITA remain steadfast in its current position. The (?peace talks) continue to focus on ministerial portfolios and provincial government issues. UNITA has accepted what the government has offered but it continues to say that it is not enough. It wants more so-called key ministerial portfolios and more provinces to govern. [end recording]
