This is an attempt to pressure the Haitian military coupists into giving up power. The sanctions include intensifying the embargo on crude oil and military products and equipment, in addition to an interdiction on all financial and commercial transactions with the Haitian military regime. According to some observers, the embargo, to which the UN Security Council agreed on 6 May, could have disastrous consequences not only for the country's economy but also for the Haitian people. Politicians and journalists in several countries continue to ponder how much longer the United States will be able to wait before it resorts to any pretext in order to justify a military invasion. Meanwhile, U.S. President William Clinton has signed an order barring all U.S. corporations from any type of commercial transactions with Haiti.
