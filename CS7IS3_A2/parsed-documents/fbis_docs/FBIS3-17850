There is an acceptance of the resolution about the events of January 20, 1990 on the agenda. As it was announced that last week Milli Majlis discussed the question for three days, but failed to adopt a final decision. During today's discussion the Speaker Rasul Guliyev and his deputy Afiaddin Dzhalilov closely support the draft of the document, however the oppositional and independent deputies are against the document. As it was earlier informed, the aim of the document is to accuse the Popular [People's] Front of Azerbaijan [PFA] as well as the former leadership of Azerbaijan (Mutalibov and Vezirov) in the bloody events of January 1990. However, the number of the deputies supporting the former leadership and the Popular Front of Azerbaijan in today's meeting is considerable. As TURAN NEWS AGENCY was informed by one of the Milli Majlis members "though President Aliyev and his supporters try to make decisions in favour of their ideas, they will fail".
