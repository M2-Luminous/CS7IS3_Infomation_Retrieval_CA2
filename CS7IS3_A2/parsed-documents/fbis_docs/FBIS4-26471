Security Council approved today a French initiative of sending troops to Rwanda on a humanitarian mission despite strong opposition from Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who has claimed that such an intervention is against the U.N.-back Arusha agreement. The Tutsi-dominated RPF said the Arusha peace agreement, which was signed in August, 1993, permitted no foreign military presence in Rwanda, thus it regarded sending French troops to Rwanda as a violation of the agreement. The vote on the initiative is 10-0, with five abstentions by China, Brazil, Pakistan, New Zealand and Nigeria. Under the resolution, France will deploy as early as Thursday [23 June] a French-commanded 2,700 French and Senegalese troops in Rwanda with the mandate of saving lives and setting up safe havens for refugees. The mission will last two months. The Council said in the resolution that is was deeply concerned by the continued slaughter of civilians and by an expected delay of at least two months before all U.N. peacekeeping troops can be deployed. Speaking to reporters after the Council meeting, Gerald Gahima, spokesman for the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) said the Council resolution was "totally unacceptable." The United Nations may have its "choice" of sending troops to Rwanda, but it has also to bear the "responsibility" for its action. He demanded the U.N. withdrawal from Rwanda the U.N. Assistance Mission for Rwanda (Unamir) because the mission had become groundless for U.N. violation of the Arusha agreement. [sentence as received] "We can not handle with two forces at one time," he said. The RPF has long accused France siding with the Hutu-dominated government and said the French Government trained the Hutu presidential guard, which has done most of the killings since April, after the Rwandan president was killed in a plane crash. China said, before the Council's voting, that gaining support and cooperation from warring parties is an indispensable condition for the success of any U.N. peacekeeping operation. Since there was no assurances of cooperation from the warring parties, China would abstain the draft resolution, said Chen Jian, deputy permanent representative to the United Nations. Chen also reminded Council members of the lesson of the U.N. mission in Somali, which has been widely regarded as a U.N. failure in injecting forces without the consent of the warring parties.
