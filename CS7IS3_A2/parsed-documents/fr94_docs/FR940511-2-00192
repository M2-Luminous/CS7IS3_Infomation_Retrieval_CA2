FR940511-2-00192 FR940511-2-00122 [Docket No. 93&hyph;74; Notice 2] Withdrawal of Petition for Import Eligibility Determination The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (``NHTSA'') published notice in the Federal Register on October 26, 1993 (58 FR 57666) that it had received from Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania, a Registered Importer of motor vehicles, a petition for a determination that a 1993 Jaguar XJ6 that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States. Such a petition may be granted under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and 49 CFR part 593 if the Registered Importer demonstrates (1) that the vehicle is substantially similar to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) that it is capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards. Following publication of the notice, Champagne Imports informed NHTSA that it was unable to demonstrate such compliance for the 1993 Jaguar XJ6 and that, accordingly, its petition was being withdrawn. NHTSA possesses insufficient information to determine independently whether the 1993 Jaguar XJ6 is capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards, and therefore will make no decision regarding that vehicle at this time. Authority: 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) and (C)(ii); 49 CFR 593.7; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. Issued on: May 3, 1994. William A. Boehly, Associate Administrator for Enforcement. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11414 Filed 5&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;M
