He said the Radicals "are totally wrong and their arguments are groundless" and charged that the press was "indulging in press terrorism." This was the president's answer to a document on regional economies disseminated by the UCR and information published by a Buenos Aires newspaper saying that the government was seeking to promote Navy officers accused of torturing French nuns. The UCR "is again swallowed by a sea of contradictions," the president said, because at the same time UCR politicians were releasing the document criticizing the government, economists, including Ricardo Lopez Murphy, were asking it to increase the depth of the adjustment program and speed up things. The UCR document says the economic plan "has increased the gap" separating the poor and "the economic model implies an irresponsible trust in the spontaneous market capacity to correct inequalities." The head of state said the provinces "are not at a boiling point" even though some people "would like to create that type of climate." The president stressed that the provinces "will continue to receive the funds due them according to the co-participation program, without ruling out some type of additional help in emergencies." Menem made these statements during an impromptu news conference at the Olivos residence today. In an interview that appeared in today's issue of a Buenos Aires paper, Menem says the election of constituent delegates would take place, in principle, on 20 March. He added that his ideal running mate for 1995 would be Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde. The president said he favors a "limitless reelection" of presidents. He recognized, however, that the projected constitutional reform will only allow him to continue as president until 1999, that is, if he is reelected next year. Menem expressed the wish, however, to run again in 2003. "I am not Matusalen, but I can wait four years and then run again. I will be 73 by then and I will still be fit" to do it, Menem said. The president said he was sure he would be able to extend his mandate until 1999. Menem minimized the importance of the chief of cabinet, a position that will be created with the reform, by saying that it "will not mean any reduction of presidential powers." Menem did not mention any possible candidates to occupy that position but admitted that he already had a candidate "in mind." [preceding two words in Latin] Menem said there are "indications" of the presence "of leftist militants such as MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] followers among the agitators that provoked the disorders in the northern part of the country." The president was referring to the incidents in Santiago del Estero. The president said he favors increasing the number of ministries from eight to 12 when the new Constitution takes effect. Menem said the new portfolios might be Science and Technology, Environment, and Production. Regarding the Senate discussion on the constitutional reform bill, Menem warned that if the bill is approved without reducing a senator's mandate to four years "it will have to return to the Chamber of Deputies for a revision." Menem admitted, however, that the issue "is no longer in the hands" of those who signed the pact: Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin. "We will try to make it stick, but we cannot do anything else. A pact between political parties is important but it cannot go over congressional authority," the president emphasized. Menem dismissed "the possible danger" of constituent delegates going beyond what was agreed with Alfonsin "as long as the essence of the pact is respected." Regarding the crisis in the provinces, Menem reiterated the need for "a rational transformation," stressing that the private sector "will be able to absorb dismissed public servants even in the poorest districts such as Santiago del Estero or La Rioja." In his renewed attack against the press, Menem said journalists "indulge in press terrorism" when commenting on a report published by the Buenos Aires newspaper PAGINA 12. The newspaper article said the government intended to promote Navy officers accused of having tortured French nuns. "There are no chances of a promotion," the president said after characterizing the article as "a coarse lie" and an "aberration." The new presidential attack against the press included the media that reported the government intended to build a "ring-side" [preceding word in English] over the destroyed Olivos mausoleum where the remains of Juan Peron and Eva Duarte used to lie. "You can only doubt a journalist's honesty when he lies so shamelessly," Menem said, admitting that the issue "really upset him." "On top of all that, CRONICA on 27 December used the information to build up a petty scandal based on something that is not true," the president stressed. Menem said the report saying that he and UCR President Raul Alfonsin would campaign for the reform was "inaccurate." The president categorically denied that groups of activists linked to Julio Cesar Araoz, former health and social action minister, had participated in the incidents in Santiago del Estero. Menem accused legislators of acting "from behind curtains and at midnight" for including a 120 million peso increase for national universities that previously had been vetoed by the government in the 1994 budget. "They did not take into account how that spending would be defrayed. They acted without thinking," Menem said, adding that the Federal Law on Education already includes a 20 percent increase for education in 1994. The president also criticized the approval of the 120 million pesos as "a strictly political and demagogic maneuver." "Of course when we veto this type of legislation we are the bad guys and those who arbitrarily or carelessly included it in the budget end up receiving laurels and a crown," the president complained. Menem said public employees who lose their jobs as a result of "transformations" in the public administration "will collect compensation and will be able to seek a more profitable job in the private sector." "As long as we continue insisting on reducing production costs, what is called the Argentine cost, the possibilities for the establishment of new companies in Argentina, which is called, within quotes, poor, will increase," the president stressed. Menem concluded by reiterating that he plans to meet with the governors, possibly at the Chapadmalal summer residence, "between 18 and 20 January."
