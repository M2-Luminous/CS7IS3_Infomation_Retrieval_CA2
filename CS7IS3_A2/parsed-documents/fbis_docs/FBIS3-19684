At the weekend, several leading FDP politicians demanded that the party make a quick statement in favor of its current coalition partner, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. At the Hesse FDP party conference in Melsungen, land Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt warned his party not to "behave like a flock of chickens and ask about a new coalition," following the party's failure to pass the 5-percent hurdle in the Lower Saxony elections. The FDP cannot make politics with the "old Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]." Bundestag Group Chairman Hermann-Otto Solms also spoke out clearly against an alliance with the SPD. Speaking to DIE WELT, Solms said he cannot imagine any other coalition than the existing one. This is clearly the position of the majority within the FDP. A final decision can, however, only be made by the party conference in September. Juergen Moellemann, chairman of the biggest FDP land organization in North Rhine-Westphalia, on the other hand, called upon his party to free itself from the "downward trend of the CDU/CSU." The FDP will have to sharpen its own profile over the next few months. The former economics minister said that stopping the "soaring public indebtedness" must have top priority at the moment. FDP presidential candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher made a statement to similar effect. Speaking on Deutschlandfunk radio, she warned against a "complete" commitment for an alliance with the CDU/CSU. The FDP must not "get itself into a cul-de-sac." If the election results are accordingly, the Bonn coalition should be continued. But the FDP must also take responsibility in the event of other constellations, be it as opposition or in a coalition with a different partner. FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel demanded an end to the coalition debate. The party must not let itself be driven into an early commitment. Yet, in the upcoming election campaigns, the FDP will have to draw a more distinct line to its partner in government. CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble has urged the FDP to make a quick coalition statement in favor of the CDU/CSU. The Lower Saxony land parliament elections have shown that an unclear position about its future course has disastrous effects on the FDP, Schaeuble said.
