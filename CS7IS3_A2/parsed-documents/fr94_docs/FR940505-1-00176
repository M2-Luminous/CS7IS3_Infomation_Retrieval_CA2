FR940505-1-00176 FR940505-1-00012 EPA does not believe this is a concern for the South Coast region for at least three reasons. First, approximately half of the power generated in California is generated by technologies that do not generate harmful ground-level ozone-producing air pollutants. 96 Second, the NO X emissions that are discharged by the generation of electricity using technologies based on petroleum products (primarily natural gas) are much less than those that are generated by today's ships for the same amount of energy. 97 This is because onshore electric power plants operate at optimal steady-state conditions, are required to use emission control systems, and generally use cleaner fuel than that used in ships. Finally, the power plants from which the electricity would be drawn for hotelling are located far from South Coast population centers. This means that any increase in emissions at the power generation source will occur away from the South Coast area, in areas that have less severe, if any, air quality problems. 96 EPA calculations, based on figures from ICF, Inc., ``Methodology for Analyzing the Environmental and Economic Effects of Electric Vehicles: An Illustrative Study,'' prepared for US EPA, September 1991 (Draft). 97 See ICF., Inc. study, cited above. EPA solicits comments on whether the full discount as proposed above should be allowed, or if that discount should be reduced to account for the displaced emissions. EPA also solicits comments on how the discount is calculated. (d) Control Strategies_Discount for Staying Outside the Region. Emissions from marine vessels operating in the Santa Barbara Channel can be transported onshore by prevailing winds and can contribute to onshore air pollution in the South Central Coast Air Basin (which includes Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties). Particularly of concern (for FIP purposes) are the offshore NO X emissions that drift onshore and that can impact Ventura County's air quality. As discussed in section III.H. of this NPRM, ships are estimated to represent 15 percent of Ventura's total current NO X emissions. Most of the offshore sources that contribute to NO X emissions include: Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activity (which represents support crew and supply boats), exploratory drilling vessels and oil platforms, tugs and tankers, recreational marine, U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels, and large foreign and U.S. vessels. Because of the reported 1990 emission inventory from marine vessel activity that occurs offshore and external requests to evaluate moving the shipping channel lanes, EPA is proposing to offer, as part of the emission reduction strategy described in this proposal, incentives for ships to use a relocated Santa Barbara shipping channel. This relocated channel would take marine vessels farther from land and reduce the amount of emissions that are transported inland. These incentives are intended to reduce the impact of marine vessel emissions on ozone concentrations in Ventura County. The proposed control strategy for Ventura County targets both NO X and VOCs for reduction in order to attain the ozone standard. Because the emissions from marine vessels represent a substantial portion (CARB estimates show approximately 12 percent statewide) of total emissions of NO X , control of marine vessel emissions is potentially an important control strategy. EPA's proposed control strategy focuses primarily on the reduction of NO X emissions from vessels, since they are nominal contributors to VOCs in Ventura County. Summertime meteorological data for Ventura County indicate that emissions from marine vessels could be transported to Ventura County by prevailing air currents. This is also consistent with the meteorological data for the specific episode days chosen for photochemical modeling. The meteorological data indicates that the emissions from marine vessels could be transported onshore, and therefore have the potential to impact ozone concentration in Ventura County. However, the actual impact of the emissions on the ozone concentrations in Ventura County depends on the time the emissions arrive in the onshore area as well as the interaction of the marine vessel emissions with the emissions from other sources. CARB has suggested that emissions from up to 100 miles out from the coastline have a significant impact on ozone concentration in the California coastal air basins. EPA is in the process of evaluating CARB's data to justify this distance. EPA believes that these uncontrolled mobile sources have the potential to affect the air quality onshore. EPA further believes that the farther out from shore the ship's activity, presumably, the more apt those emissions are to disperse before reaching the coast. EPA requests comment on the effect of offshore activity on onshore air quality and the proper distance to which the channel should be moved. EPA believes that it has authority to offer port charge rebates for operational changes such as controlling speed, cold ironing or, as described here, moving offshore. EPA FIP authority under section 110(c) of the Clean Air Act allows EPA to regulate sources contributing to air quality degradation provided EPA is not so prohibited. While the U.S. has historically allowed that nations do not have sovereignty in truly international waters, a surcharge provision of this type is significantly different. It applies charges to ships while they are in U.S. waters, and merely discounts the charges in light of operational changes the ships make, at their option, within and outside U.S. waters. EPA is unaware of any provision of a statute or international agreement that would prohibit such an approach.
