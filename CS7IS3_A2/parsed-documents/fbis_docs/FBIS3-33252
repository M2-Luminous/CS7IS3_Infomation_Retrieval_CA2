This has prompted the authorities to increase security. A special security council meeting is under way at this hour at the Cundinamarca governor's office. Presiding over the council are Governor Manuel Guillermo Infante, 13th Brigade Commander General Norberto Adrada, and Cundinamarca Police Commander Colonel Roberto Fajardo. Departmental authorities are considering the serious public order problem which affected at least five towns in the department this weekend. The authorities are considering new strategies to counteract the guerrillas' actions and security measures to guarantee the electoral campaign. This weekend in Cundinamarca, the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] implemented a strategy aimed at isolating Bogota, which was drafted at the most recent guerrilla summit in La Uribe. The guerrillas operate on four fronts. In the south, they are located in the municipalities of Fusagasuga, Cabrera, Pasca, Gutierrez, Chipaque, and Fomeque. In the east, they are located in the municipalities of Ubala, Chacala, and the Chingaza area. In the northwest, they are located in Yacopi, Caparrapi, and Topaipi in La Palma and Villa Gomez on the Boyaca border.
