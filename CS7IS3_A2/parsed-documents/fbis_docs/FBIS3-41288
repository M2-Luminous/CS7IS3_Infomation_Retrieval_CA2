This Was How Viktor Yerin Described the Chief Task of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs"] [Text] The thesis that the accumulation of initial capital has always been criminal everywhere has been proved by life. You have only to look at the realities of our market existence today: The pages of the daily papers are literally full of reports of thefts, robberies, and shoot-outs. In the past analysts predicted that individual criminal groupings would start consolidating themselves, dividing up spheres of influence, strengthening international ties, bribing officials, and politicizing themselves. It is obvious now that this phenomenon has outgrown the criminal framework and become a real threat to the state's security, jeopardizing Russia's political and economic development. There is quite a lot of evidence of this. Thus, in the opinion of specialists, economic elements are increasingly frequently entering the sphere of interests of criminal structures, and the credit and banking system is being undermined. Between 70 and 80 percent of privatized enterprises are already the victims of extortion, and most commercial banks in the capital and in Russia are under the control of criminal groupings. Another aspect of the problem is the fact that organized crime poses a threat to the already weak legal policy. I have already spoken of the trend toward its politicization. This means that criminal elements are being enabled to influence the adoption of particular decrees and laws through corrupt officials and politicians. Incidentally, during the first half of last year alone employees of law-enforcement organs put a stop to 8,800 official crimes, and 40 percent more instances of bribery were also stopped. According to the analysts' conclusions, the mafia's influence over the disposition of political forces will increase. These are the gloomy forecasts, and yet, according to the official data of the Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], although the crime situation remains complex and the growth of crime is increasing, it is already possible to speak of a reduction in the rate of growth. The clear-up rate for crimes, including economic crimes, is also improving--which has made it possible to return 1.688 trillion rubles to the state. Army General Viktor Yerin cited these data in his report at the all-Russia conference-seminar of leading personnel of internal affairs and internal troop organs, which opened in Moscow 8 February. The minister of internal affairs dwelt in detail on the results of internal affairs organs' operational service activity during 1993. The minister named as particularly alarming trends the growth in the dynamics of serious criminal infringements, the increase in drug trafficking, the growing scale of weapon thefts, and the unprecedented rampant corruption. As though confirming his words, news came of the 7 February confiscation of 5.618 kg of dry opium from operators in the drugs business by employees of the capital's Internal Affairs Main Administration and the Russian MVD. "We will not make progress along the path of reforms unless we launch a determined offensive against crime," Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, emphasized in his address to the conference. He reported that a federal program to combat crime in Russia in 1994-1995 has been prepared and will be adopted in the very near future. The head of government particularly noted the importance of adopting a new legislative base, as the previous one is obsolete and does not meet the demands of the times. Well, can the "beloved city" now sleep tight? For the news is reassuring, you might say. But it is right here that a doubt arises. For all this is already painfully familiar: to "mount," "broaden," "deepen...." I recall how as long ago as January last year the president announced the start of a "frontal offensive against crime." The federal program for combating crime was to have been submitted to the Security Council for approval before 1 October 1993. But it is already 1994.... While the upper echelons are bestirring themselves, the lower echelons can no longer live in the old way. Thus, a department to combat racketeering has been set up under the All-Russia Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In short, the "drowning" people have decided to save themselves....
