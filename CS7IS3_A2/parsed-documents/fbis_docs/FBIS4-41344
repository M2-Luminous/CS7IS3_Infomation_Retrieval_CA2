Chelyabinsk Oblast's second largest power station, the Yuzhnouralskaya GRES [South Urals Rayon power station], has been shut down owing to the suspension of gas supplies. Accordingly, the Uraltrak joint-stock company, the Chelyabinsk automatic engineering works, and a whole series of other large enterprises that have failed to pay their debts to the power engineers have been completely disconnected from the supply of electrical energy. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by Viktor Makhortov, chief engineer at Chelyabenergo [Chelyabinsk energy directorate], the debt is currently in excess of 400 billion rubles [R] and has grown by R50 billion in the past six months alone. At the same time, the power workers owe a total of R43 billion to Uraltrasgaz [Urals gas line]. The association's chief engineer regards the situation as deadlocked and may cause the South Urals economy to collapse. Indeed, if one imagines the electric furnaces at the huge iron-and-steel plants here being de-energized or -- God forbid -- the power supply to the nuclear complex being suspended, all this threatens far greater consequences than just the closure or shutdown of an engineering plant.
