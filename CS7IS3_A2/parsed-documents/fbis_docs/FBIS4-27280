Investigative sources quoted the caller as menacingly saying Tuesday morning that "unlike the rightist in Tokyo, we will not fire at a ceiling." The office has filed a charge against the anonymous caller with Kumamoto prefectural police, the sources said. Police are questioning the president of Seinen Aikokuto, a right-wing group in Kumamoto. Hosokawa escaped uninjured after Masakatsu Nozoe, a former member of the right-wing organization Shokonjuku, fired a gun toward the ceiling from behind the former premier at Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo, where a party reception was being held. Nozoe, 52, was arrested immediately after the incident. The suspect said he had no intention of killing Hosokawa but wanted to "threaten" him for Hosokawa's remarks on Japan's wartime aggression and his economic program, police sources said. An investigation revealed that Nozoe had checked into the hotel under a false name about five hours before the incident, according to police sources.
