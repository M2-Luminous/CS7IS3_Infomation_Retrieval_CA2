FR940119-0-00021 FR940119-0-00005 3. Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), Exception From the Requirement for Complete Highwall Elimination for Continuously Mined Areas at Underground Mining Operations Colorado proposed to recodify existing Rule 4.14.1(2)(f) as 4.14.1(2)(h) and add a new Rule 4.14.1(2)(f). At Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), Colorado proposed requirements for underground mining operations that have highwalls or face-up areas that were in place prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and have continued to operate in the same location after that date. In this rule Colorado proposed an exception from the requirement for complete elimination of face-up areas and highwalls for underground mining operations of an applicant demonstrates in writing to the Division that the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall and face-up area so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3. Such face-up areas and highwalls would have to be eliminated to the maximum extent technically practical. Furthermore, Colorado proposed at Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v) that (1) all reasonably available spoil in the permit area shall be used to backfill the highwall and that reasonably available spoil in the vicinity of the operation shall be included in the permit area, (2) the backfill shall be graded to a slope that is compatible with the approved postmining land use and that provides adequate drainage and meets a minimum static safety factor of 1.3, (3) the highwall remnant shall be sufficiently stable so as not to pose a hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment and the operator shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Division, that the highwall is stable, (4) exposed coal seams, toxic and acid-forming materials, and combustible materials shall be adequately covered or treated in accordance with Rule 4.14.3, and (5) spoil placed on the outslope during mining operations that occurred prior to August 3, 1977, shall not be disturbed if such disturbance will cause instability of the remaining spoil or otherwise increase the hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment. The Federal backfilling and grading regulations at 30 CFR 817.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) allow an exception from the requirement for complete highwall elimination for underground mining operations that remine highwalls in ``previously mined areas,'' which by definition are those that existed prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and are not subject to the standards of SMCRA. These regulations allow for the incomplete elimination of such highwalls where the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the reaffected or enlarged highwall. Colorado's proposed rules differ from the Federal regulations in that Colorado proposed to extend the exception for incomplete highwall elimination to underground mining operations where highwalls or face-up areas were in place prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and have continued to operate in the same location after that date. The Director has approved similar proposed regulations for Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah (52 FR 49398, 49399, December 31, 1987; 56 FR 21304, 21330&hyph;21331, May 23, 1990; 58 FR 48600, 48603, September 17, 1993). Colorado's proposed rules and Kentucky's, West Virginia's and Utah's approved regulations address the situation of operators attempting to reclaim face-up entry areas that are created prior to the passage of SMCRA. Many of these underground mines have been in existence for many years and the earthen material necessary to eliminate the face-up entry is either no longer available or has been completely revegetated and its handling and use would cause new environmental damage and disruption. This problem is unique to underground mines where highwall areas do not move with the coal removal operations (as with surface mines) but exist in a static state for many years. The problem is not encountered in surface mines where post-SMCRA operations are continually creating new highwalls rather than extracting coal from pre-SMCRA highwall areas. In passing SMCRA, Congress addressed the surface impacts of underground mining and surface extraction of coal in a generally similar manner, but it did provide for important differences. In section 516 of SMCRA, Congress affirmatively established certain performance standards applicable to underground mines and incorporated by reference other performance standards at section 515. One of the performance standards incorporated by reference, section 515(b)(3), requires highwall elimination. However, section 516(b)(10) also requires that the Secretary shall make such modifications in the requirements imposed by this subparagraph as are necessary to accommodate the distinct difference between surface and underground coal mining.
