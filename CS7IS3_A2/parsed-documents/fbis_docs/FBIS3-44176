It called for a 50-percent general salary increase. The BEN also denounced the negative effects of successive structural adjustment programs. This reaction follows the 50-percent devaluation of the CFA franc. At the end of the meeting, the BEN issued a statement read here by Mamadou Doumbouya. [Begin Doumbouya recording] The UNTM National Executive Bureau held an extraordinary session on 24 January. Drawing lessons from decades of development, it observed that Mali has been engaged in structural adjustment programs for more than 12 years. Mali is one of the rare countries to have fully implemented all the social and economic measures jointly adopted by the IMF, World Bank, and the government to ensure the country's economic and financial balance. The structural adjustment programs created great chaos by sanctioning the liquidation of state companies and enterprises, causing the reduction of the salaried workforce through a wave of unprecedented retrenchments, and fostering voluntary retirement. The Malian franc, which is the expression of national sovereignty and an independent national development work tool, disappeared in favor of the CFA at the pegged rate of Fr1 to one Malian franc. The country's return to the West African Monetary Union [UMOA] in 1984, the recent devaluation of the CFA franc, and the adoption of a blind liberal economic system have currently led to a dramatic erosion of workers' purchasing power by 117.50 percent. This has also led to unbridled price increases despite appeals by government and the Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Mali. The various kinds of privatizations accepted by workers and the Malian people have only resulted in the deterioration of their living conditions, which they hoped to improve in the new multiparty and democratic context. Now more than ever, Mali, like former French colonies, is no longer free to determine its own economic and political options in the spirit of safeguarding African dignity. Consequently, the BEN strongly calls for the return to the use of a local Malian currency within a time period compatible with the Malian people's thirst for dignity. In default of this, Mali must pledge to strive for the creation of a common independent African currency. The BEN calls for the total and immediate payment of promotion arrears that have accumulated from 1987 to 1993; a 50-percent general salary increase; a 50-percent reduction in IGER [expansion unknown] and its total abolition for salaried female workers; and a 50-percent rise in the guaranteed minimum wage, as well as a corresponding readjustment of retirement and widows benefits. The BEN warns the government against any eventual failure to ensure state authority in the enforcement of the freeze on essential commodities and the effective and permanent control. In the face of the capitulation of the UMOA heads of state summit on 10 and 11 January in Dakar, the UNTM, which is traditionally attentive to state problems, cannot endorse measures that assault the dignity of Africans and the real independence of our country and forever compromise Africa's development. It makes a vibrant appeal to all Malian workers and the entire people to get mobilized wholeheartedly for the defense of national interests. It calls on African trade union federations to get more involved to work for the emergence of an economically integrated, politically free, and socially prosperous Africa. [end recording]
