Some of the laws, which carry long prison sentences, were drafted early in the century. Article Nine of Chapter 200 of the Laws of Hong Kong states clearly that a seditious intention is an intention: 1) To bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the administration of justice in Hong Kong. 2) To raise discontent or disaffection among Her Majesty's subjects or inhabitants of Hong Kong. 3) To promote feelings of ill will and enmity between different classes of the population of Hong Kong. Article 14 of Chapter 200 says the police have the power to "break open any outer or inner door of any premises or place" and to "remove or obliterate any seditious publication". The laws have not been enforced by the Hong Kong government for decades. Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] leaders, now meeting in Beijing, say the laws could apply in Hong Kong as long as some colonial terms like "Her Majesty" are replaced with "the central government". It is understood that the PWC's advice to Beijing to retain these laws after 1997 has alarmed the Hong Kong government, which is looking at various options on how to localise the laws before the hand-over. A government official said the laws were extremely sensitive and the problem had to be tackled. He pointed out Singapore and Malaysia's internal security acts as examples of similar laws left behind by British administrations which could be used as a means to restrict civic freedom. The legislator Christine Loh said the Hong Kong laws would have to be reformed and clarified in order to fulfill Article 23 of the Basic Law. "Laws of treason and sedition are complex, not clear, difficult to interpret and referring to old cases," Loh said. "Many lawyers have said they don't like the notion of loose interpretation of 'seditious intention'. "Hong Kong will need tighter legal drafting terms to narrow their definitions." Loh said that unless there was an independent judiciary and a independent prosecution in Hong Kong after 1997, such laws could be abused. "One would hope that after 1997 the SAR [Special Administrative Region] government would continue to take a relaxed approach," Loh said. "The Basic Law has been finalised since 1990. "One would have hoped the Government could have done more reform before now. "Whether it is sensitive or not it still has to be done." Loh urged the Government to reform these laws as soon as possible, preferably before July 1995 within the current legislature. Liu Yiu-chu, a Hong Kong delegate to the National People's Congress (NPC), said if the term "Her Majesty" in these laws was replaced with the term "Chinese central government", Hong Kong's freedom of the press would be extremely vulnerable. Liu said the British legal system allowed people to challenge any government. "It would not be seen as seditious. This concept of sedition is entirely different from that defined by the mainland," Liu said. She urged the PWC to study this more closely. Berry Hsu, a law lecturer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said the PWC attitude was fair. "What is the alternative?" Hsu asked. "If you do not want the seditious and treason laws to be maintained, you may leave the Chinese government with no options but to apply national law. "That is even worse." He said the way to minimise the prospect of abusing these laws was to uphold a completely independent judiciary.
