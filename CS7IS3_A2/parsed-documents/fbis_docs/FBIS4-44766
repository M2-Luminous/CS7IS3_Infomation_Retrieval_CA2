The French group will be among the number of investors in the future satellite communications system Globalstar. Seated together with the American firms Pactel and Qualcomm, Italy's Alenia, Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, Great Britain's Vodaphone, and Korea's Dacom and Hyundai, at the 1.6-billion-franc [Fr] round table being hosted by the American firm Loral (35 percent), Alcatel is contributing Fr200 million for an 11-percent share. The project, whose total cost will exceed Fr10 billion, calls for using 48 satellites in low orbit. Globalstar will offer voice and data transmission, telescopic, and location and tracking services, all to be accessible by fixed and mobile terminals from any point on the planet. It is expected to be operational in 1998 and to have 10 million subscribers within 10 years from then. Alcatel, the world's number one in telecommunications, could not afford to remain on the sidelines in the face of the large-scale alliances that are being forged. Satellite networks are one of the stakes in the mobile telephony battle of the coming years. Motorola has rallied some 20-odd groups worldwide around its Iridium project. Microsoft and McCaw Cellular have recently announced their Teledesic project. By joining Globalstar, the French group is strengthening the American positions it has already gained by way of joint ventures. Since 1991, Alcatel has been working together with Loral within its subsidiary Space Systems/Loral, in which Alcatel acquired a 49 percent stake together with Italy's Alenia. Alcatel also operates a company, Euteltrac, which it owns jointly with Qualcomm, in the satellite locating and tracking sector. Industrially, Alcatel will be responsible for designing and producing the payloads to be carried aboard Globalstar satellites. These amount to 45 percent of the cost of the satellites, and their production will be spread over a period of four years. This will ensure an ongoing workload at Alcatel's Toulouse plants at a time when orders from European manufacturers are at a low ebb. Major Projects Worldwide Globalstar: 48 satellites to be launched into orbit beginning in 1998. Loral and eight groups will invest Fr10 billion. Iridium: 66 satellites to be in service beginning in 1998. Motorola and 20 groups will invest Fr20 billion. Teledesic: 840 satellites to be in service beginning in 2001. A joint Microsoft-McCaw Cellular project at an estimated cost of approximately Fr52 billion. Odyssey: Under preparation by TRW. P21: Under preparation by Intelsat.
