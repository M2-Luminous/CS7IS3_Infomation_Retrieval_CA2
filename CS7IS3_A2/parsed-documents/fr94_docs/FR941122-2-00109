FR941122-2-00109 FR941122-2-00079 5. Any Administrative Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders of Service Shares need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 6. The trustees of the Trust will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subjected to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 7. Dividends paid by a Portfolio with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that payments made by Service Shares under the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Administrative Services Plan, and any Class Expenses, will be borne exclusively by that class. 8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between those classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Trust that the calculations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Trust (which the Trust agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Trust for such work papers, by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset values, dividends and distributions of the two classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.
