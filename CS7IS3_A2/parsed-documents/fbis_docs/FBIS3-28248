Yohei Kono, president of the former ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), told reporters that the process of scrapping the tax plan shows the Hosokawa administration is controlled by a few members of the coalition. Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and a chief strategist in the coalition, and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, reportedly played key roles in drawing up the plan. Kono blasted the irresponsible array of the cabinet, saying, "if it is not Hosokawa who decided the plan, than who heads the cabinet?" He said the turmoil could deepen the public's distrust in politics. [passage omitted] LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said in a party meeting in Yokohama, "what is going on with the responsibility of Hosokawa? (the government and the ruling coalition parties) are in a state of anarchy with no political responsibility." Mori, meanwhile, urged the government to raise the envisioned tax cuts worth 6 trillion yen, including income and residential tax reductions, saying "I'm skeptical about whether the 6 trillion yen will be effective (in boosting the sluggish economy)." He also insisted on separating cuts and increases in taxes, saying that financial resources to cover tax reductions should be considered after the economy begins to recover. On an idea calling on the LDP to join the coalition, Mori said "the LDP will not move to join (the framework of the coalition)." Earlier, the LDP Secretary General told reporters that the coalition partners should have consolidated their opinions before the announcement because the system deeply affects the people. The new tax plan was part of the government's expected pump-priming package worth 15 trillion yen designed to lift the economy out of the worst recession in the postwar era. Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affaris Research Council, also lashed out at Hosokawa, saying, "how is Hosokawa feeling about the significance and the responsibility of the remarks (he) made at the press conference?" "I will pursue (this matter) in the Diet," he said at a press conference in Miyazaki, western Japan. Hashimoto, a former finance minister, also expressed concern that the scrapping of the new indirect tax plan could affect the summit talks between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton next week.
