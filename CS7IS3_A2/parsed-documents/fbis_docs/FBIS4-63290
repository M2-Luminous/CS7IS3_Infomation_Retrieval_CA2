According to this law, Estonian Radio and Estonian Television will continue as independent legal entities. The Riigikogu concluded that it would be unjustified to merge the two. Both Estonian Radio and Estonian Television may broadcast advertising material for up to five percent of the day's broadcasts. This permission has been given in order to provide them with proper funding. The Riigikogu will set up a broadcasting council before taking its summer recess. The council will be the top authority for both Estonian Radio and Estonian Television. It is expected to be set up in June. As recommended by experts, several clarifications were included in the broadcasting law. For example, the procedure for issuing broadcasting licenses to privately owned broadcasting stations has been made more specific. The law adopted today regulates the rights and obligations of the electronic media, including those on the basis of which private radio stations operate in Estonia.
