It surpasses the others in its magnitude. A 300-meter sector of the 1,000-mm gas pipeline was blown up and put out of order at the place where it crosses the Kura River in Azerbaijani-inhabited Gardabanskiy Rayon. Moreover, a 800-meter-long sector of the pipeline was displaced by some 5 meters. Specialists from the Armenian State Gas Enterprise have left for the site of the accident. In their opinion, the Kura River should be diverted and large-scale earth moving should be carried out at the location of the explosion in order to be able to repair the pipeline.
