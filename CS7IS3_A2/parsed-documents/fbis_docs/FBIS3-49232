Among other things, the document says that they discussed ways in which the economic interests of the Hungarian ethnic minority could be protected and agreed to elaborate the rules according to which the UDMR's economic council is to function. To avoid ethnic discrimination within the privatization process of the state property, it was assessed that a first step would be seeing to it that experts of that ethnic minority are also represented among the dignitaries of the State Property Fund who are to be appointed by the government. The UDMR Executive Presidium also discussed the agenda of the conference that is to be held with the chairmen of the UDMR county branches on 8 January in Miercurea Ciuc, as well as a report on the preparations made in view of the conference that will concentrate on the issue of self-government, scheduled to take place on 15 January in Odorheiul Secuiesc. Learning about President Ion Iliescu's assessments of the 1989 events in Romania and the ethnic conflict that took place in March 1990 in Tirgu Mures -- which were published in the [Iliescu's] memoirs -- the UDMR Executive Presidium considers them unacceptable, as they represent the falsification of history owing to political considerations. The need to establish the historic truth compels the UDMR Executive Presidium to urgently publish the critique based on sound arguments of that booklet [brosura], the communique released by the UDMR press bureau says, adding in conclusion that the presidium has sent a telegram saluting the conference on the self-government of the ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia, scheduled for 8 January in Komarno. The presidium considers that event as an important step made in the spirit of current European processes, and not merely in view of the maintenance of the national identity of the Hungarian community living in Slovakia, but also that of all other Hungarian communities with a minority status.
