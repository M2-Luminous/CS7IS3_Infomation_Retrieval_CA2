At the invitation of Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe of Germany, the conference participants -- defense ministers and deputy defense ministers, experts, scientists, and journalists from 14 countries -- assessed the results of the recent NATO summit and the "Partnership for Peace" program. The Berlin meeting had an informal nature but it is regarded by political circles as significant from the standpoint of shaping public opinion. It was the first meeting of this kind after the recent NATO summit and it was important for countries of Central and East Europe -- including Poland -- because it served the purpose of providing information on positions taken by the individual countries. The participants at the Berlin meeting unanimously agreed that the outcome of the NATO summit is positive. There were differences of opinion with regard to assessing the role of "Partnership for Peace." Representatives of the countries of East and Central Europe which are making efforts to become NATO members emphasized that the "Partnership" program should be regarded as a step on the way to membership in NATO. Such a view was aired among others by the Polish Deputy Defense Minister Jerzy Milewski. He said "Partnership for Peace" is a kind of program which should well serve to prepare Poland soon for full NATO membership. But Milewski also stressed that what is also needed is political protection against political dangers which are occurring. Such a protective shield could be provided by the status of associate NATO or Western European Union membership, or at least the function of an observer in NATO's political agencies. A Euro- Atlantic security system is indispensable in the future which would be based on volunteer membership by countries of North America and Europe, including Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic states. Such an alliance should then sign a treaty of cooperation with Russia. Speaking before Polish journalists, Minister Milewski said that the position he presented was received with quite a bit of support among conference participants. Similar views were expressed -- among others -- by the Slovak defense minister and the Hungarian deputy minister. A different position was taken by Russia's representative -- Sergey Karaganov who is a deputy director at the European Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and an advisor to President Yeltsin. He said widening NATO to cover the area all the way to the Russian border would create the danger of a military, economic, and social isolation of his country for many years to come. According to Minister Milewski, Germany is currently our most important partner in implementing the goal of European unity and Poland's integration with the European Union and with NATO. Jerzy Milewski talked in Berlin among others to Jorg Schoenbohm -- a secretary of state in the Federal Defense Ministry -- about bilateral cooperation between the two countries' defense ministries against the context of European processes and the "Partnership for Peace" program.
