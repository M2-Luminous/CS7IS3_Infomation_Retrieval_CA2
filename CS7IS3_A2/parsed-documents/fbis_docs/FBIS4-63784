He stressed that entrepreneurship was developing in Kyrgyzstan and that a class of entrepreneurs had appeared in the Republic. Akayev pointed out that the larger this class the more stable the Kyrgyz community would be. However, Akayev admitted that the society in the Republic was quickly being divided into the rich and the poor. That is why the state policy must concentrate on social security, Akayev remarked. He announced that the World Bank would allot from $40 million to $60 million for support of the social sphere. Akayev said that the state treasury was failing to collect all due taxes. He considered this to be one of the main problems in the Republic. In 1993 all taxes collected amounted to 14 percent of GNP. "As a result we cannot pay people their salaries and pensions and cannot finance urgent social and economic programs, Akayev pointed out. However, he added that Kyrgyzstan had the lowest inflation rate in the CIS (4.9 percent in April). He said this had become possible due to the tough monetary credit policy pursued by the National Bank and to the support of the IMF and the World Bank.
