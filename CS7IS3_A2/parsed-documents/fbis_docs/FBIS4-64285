In order to prevent this, a great deal depends on the Left. But a great deal also depends on the majority, on what signs we issue: In our choice of ministers and in the procedures to reform the Constitution. This, because government responsibility is ours and because otherwise there would be a system of clubby politics. The formulation of the rules is another matter which concerns the whole of parliament." [Marroni] One thing at a time, Mr. Maroni. What do you mean when you say that a great deal depends on the Left? [Maroni] I mean that the Left must decide what to do. It is not I that should tell you this. Do they want to entrench themselves in their citadel, do they want to continue making an issue about [lower house speaker] Pivetti's being anti-Semitic? Well, they are entirely free to do so. But they must realize that this will have an effect on the government's composition. [Marroni] In what way? [Maroni] Look, I do not think that people can believe that the League is speaking out on the question of the ministries simply because it is seeking some for itself. There are some specific political issues behind this. One of them concerns the functioning of the Interior Ministry, the need to bring together all the responsibilities regarding local government which are at present divided between four or five ministries -- those of the interior, public works, finance, public administration. Local authorities must be given certainties; they must not be confronted with the fact that on the same issue -- do you remember the repayment of the ICI [Municipal Real Estate Tax]? -- the Finance Ministry issues a circular which says one thing and the Interior Ministry another which states the contrary. But that is not all; we are raising a much wider issue.... [Marroni] Namely? [Maroni] It is obvious: We do not want to force the Left to seek street confrontations. To this end it is important that the key ministries not be occupied by representatives of a single party: If Berlusconi thinks he can claim the prime ministership and the interior, foreign, treasury, and defense ministries, then he is very much mistaken. [Marroni] Why, is Berlusconi seeking a confrontation? [Maroni] Not at all. I have spoken with Berlusconi; he is very much aware of the problem. In any case, pardon me for asking, but why is he so keen on having [Radical leader] Pannella in the government? [Marroni] Yes, why? [Maroni] Because Pannella has led him to believe that he is the link with the Left. Whereas, in fact the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] does not care about Pannella in the least. And this is why Pannella is now attacking us -- because it is we who are conducting a dialogue with the Left, because we could constitute this link. [Marroni] Well, perhaps in fact he is attacking you because you do not want him as a minister.... [Maroni] Look, on the whole I have nothing against it. The National Alliance was the first to veto Pannella's becoming foreign minister. And with regard to the Justice Ministry, I agree with much of what Marco [Pannella] has to say. But, I repeat: If the aim is not to seek a confrontation, what is the point of provoking the magistrates by making Pannella justice minister? Because, if that happens, a conflict is guaranteed. [Marroni] As far as you are concerned, however, your real dispute with Berlusconi seems to be over the Interior Ministry. A separation cannot take place in a matter of weeks.... [Maroni] I know, but the law is clear: There is six months in which to transfer responsibilities. There could be many solutions in the meantime. [Marroni] There is something else that is not clear, however: Do you really want to be minister of the interior? [Maroni] Of course. The problem is that someone, let us say someone very high up, does not want a League member as interior minister.... [Marroni] Because of the business of the three Italies.... [Maroni] Not at all: That is a pretext, the result of the fact that you journalists insist on portraying Miglio as the "League's ideologue." No, look, nobody is afraid that we will quietly start erecting border fences. They are afraid -- and rightly so -- that closets will be opened at the Interior Ministry, that people will discover what has happened in past years, what happened at Ustica. This is why Costa or Cossiga are being mentioned -- to keep the lid down tight.... [Marroni] Who does Berlusconi want as interior minister? One of his own men, or who? [Maroni] It seems to me that [Judge] Di Pietro's name is emerging again, is it not? [Marroni] Is he Berlusconi's candidate? [Maroni] Let us say that it would please him greatly.... But, you know, it is difficult to know what will happen, with so many people putting themselves forward to serve the country as interior minister.... [Marroni] Why, is Di Pietro putting himself forward? [Maroni] No, I was not talking about him. It is just that it is not we who are having meetings with Di Pietro....
