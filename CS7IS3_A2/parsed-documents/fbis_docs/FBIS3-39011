Either the UN withdraws the blue helmets and lifts the arms embargo to make the Bosnians' legitimate self-defense easier, and leaves Bosnia to its fate, or the UN -- represented by NATO -- wages war against the Serbs and Croats. An ultimatum for pacifying Sarajevo, addressed to the Serbs, is, in the worst case -- and one has to proceed from that premise -- just an overture of a war with ground forces. However, who would be willing to wage such a war, in view of the probable heavy losses, a confrontation with Russia, and without any obvious prospect of a time when a sensible, feasible policy will once again replace the war? FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU asks. STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN, too, is skeptical: The NATO ultimatum will give new hope to the desperate, often disappointed people in Sarajevo. However, what political effect can air strikes have? Are they more than a late sign of collective, helpless outrage? Bombs against resignation, because a solution to end the bloodshed continues to be elusive? And surely anyone who wants to break the siege around Sarajevo for any length of time necessarily needs the will to drag those ruined villages out of the claws of violence, those villages that lie off the track of international attention and cannot hope for a worldwide outcry against the atrocities? This was STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN. MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG is also critical: Cease-fires for Sarajevo -- how many have there been? Yet again hope arises for the inhabitants of the Bosnian capital -- a hope that may be deceptive. No one will guarantee that the Bosnian Serbs really want to take a first, serious step toward negotiations by loosening the siege around the city. There is too much that indicates that this announcement is just another attempt to lull the outraged world public. In particular since only NATO's threat of military force has given rise to some movement among the parties to the conflict in the Balkans, doubts about the seriousness of the plans for withdrawal are more than appropriate, MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG stresses. [passage omitted] FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, discussing Russia's resistance to attacks on Serbian positions, notes: Even though there has never been any doubt about the solidarity of the Eastern Orthodox Slavs with the Orthodox Serbs, now Moscow for the first time has threatened quite clearly to veto air strikes on the Serbian besiegers of Sarajevo. The fact that the accusation against UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, which was made at the same time, namely that he has exceeded his authority, happened to coincide with the NATO deliberations about a potential ultimatum addressed to the aggressors on the Balkan battlefield was no coincidence, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE notes.
