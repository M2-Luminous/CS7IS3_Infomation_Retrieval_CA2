Yuliy Vorontsov said on Wednesday [9 March] at a Security Council meeting on the situation in Abkhazia. Vorontsov noted that "the Russian Federation confirms its most serious concern over the continuation of the Abkhazian conflict. "Outstanding important issues of a political settlement as well as humanitarian problems, above all a return of several hundred thousands of refugees and displaced persons to their homes, create a real threat of a new bloodshed on a large scale. "To prevent such a tragedy, the international community should take energetic steps to give resolute support for the peace process. We regard it very important for the Security Concil to respond positively to repeated requests by the Georgian leadership and the Abkhazian side on the immediate start of a full-scale peace-keeping operation in the zone of the Abkhazian conflict." Vorontsov noted further that the Russian Federation "attaches much importance to progress in the negotiating process, including the achieved understanding on a full-scale settlement based on the unconditional respect for Georgia's territorial integrity as well as ensurance of statehood and rights for Abkhazia's multinational people". "The Russian Government is firmly convinced that it is necessary to deploy immediately a peace-keeping force in the zone of the Abkhazian conflict to stimulate the peace process and to lend it a successful and, eventually, irreversible character. "It is obvious that the final settlement of Abkhazia's political status is impossible while over 50 percent of its population is outside the republic and active stepts are being made to change Abkhazia's ethnic composition. "The Russian Federation fully shares the Georgian Government's position that only the deployment of peace keepers in the conflict zone can effectively ensure a ceasefire, guarantee a safe and mass return of refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia and implementation by the sides of earliers understnadings, including that on disengagement of Georgian and Abkhazian Armed Forces, as well as disarmement and withdrawal of all armed groups which arrived to participate in the conflict from abroad. "The Russian Federation favours proposals on immediate deployment of peace keepers in the zone of the Abkhazian conflict. Loss of time works against a settlement of the conflict. The international community should prevent a new bloodshed," Vorontsov stressed.
