He strongly rejected the idea of introducing federal government in Prigorodnyy Rayon. This will be, in his opinion, a deadlock that may cause a new tragedy in the North Caucasus. Galazov left for Moscow today to take part in a meeting of the Federation Council, which will consider the situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the extension of the state of emergency in some parts of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The president believes that peaceful negotiations should be the main thrust in settling relations between the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia.
