In the course of the visit, I. Butnaru held intensive talks at the Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry with Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Krylov, deputy foreign minister and head of the Department of CIS countries. He also talked to Michael Emerson, the head of the European Union's delegation in Moscow. A wide range of issues on Russian-Moldovan relations and assistance to Russia in the settlement of the Dniester problem were the main topics at the talks with Andrey Kozyrev held on Thursday [13 January]. This is a most complex process, and the main thing for us, Andrey Kozyrev told journalists at the end of the talks, is to persuade both sides -- the Moldovan Government and the Dniester leadership -- to seek ways of achieving political accord and political solutions. He described the conversation that took place as a useful and informative conversation which proceeded "in a professional and business-like manner." Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrey Kozyrev said that the Dniester problem would be examined at the Russian-U.S. summit, which is currently taking place in Moscow. We are conducting a dialogue with the United States and other countries since the region is a matter of concern for the CSCE and United Nations. At all bilateral meetings, we are seeking to expand the range of countries involved to enhance our efforts in resolving similar problems.
