A high percentage of young people have been drawn into the business world. A hundred times more money can be earned in deals, in buying and selling, than behind the desk at any, even the most important scientific research institute. After graduating from lower schools, preference is given to the economics, law and commerce faculties and to universities. What is being done in order to enhance the image of the so-called nonprestige science faculties, such as is the situation for education in general in our country, and is there still a pull of young people toward science, despite its present day status? These matters are discussed by Kupzhasar Naribayev, rector of the Kazakh State University imeni Al-Farabi. Naribayev: I cannot speak for the entire educational system. We now have a good many higher educational institutions, including private ones. But our university, the oldest in the republic, is intended for training specialists in the fundamental sciences, and without question there are difficulties. Although I assume that we somehow like to paint a dark picture and, incidentally, constantly lay it on thick. Now is a complex period, but I figure that a solution will be found in one way or another. I think it would be incorrect to say, for example, that we are erecting a tombstone over science, on which the very development of society is dependent. In the most difficult time a Ministry of Science was organized, which, incidentally, does not fund groups, as was the case earlier, but scientific projects. But many scientific organizations have been accustomed to being funded in advance and at the present time they are left confused. We, however, have received about 1.5 billion rubles, demonstrating the timeliness of the themes which we have proposed. It is difficult for science and the education system, but it is indeed clear: that country wins out which devotes attention primarily to them. If we, let's assume, purchase technology in the West, it must be adapted to our conditions. Who will do this? Yes, scientists are going into business and students are engaging in it. The budget is weak. Businessmen produce nothing. It is necessary to have a system of laws which will favor the development of goods production and then specialists also will be needed. This time, I am sure, will come. The state, recognizing the problems involved in our own development, must determine the special role of science and education even against the background of deep social and economic difficulties and do everything for their thorough development. Dobraya: Kupzhasar Naribayev, and what now is the flow of those entering the science faculties: physics, philosophy, chemistry? Naribayev: It seems that it's not that small, the true devotees of science have not been diverted. Yes, and to call these faculties nonprestigious due to the fact that there is a not very high competition for entrance would be incorrect. After all, today there are many who are simply materially unable to allow themselves travel for study in the capital and because of this the flow of those matriculating in the higher educational institutions in Almaty has been reduced. It is precisely the university graduates who must develop and further improve new highly scientific technologies in different branches of physics, chemistry and biology and their knowledge is the basis for the further development of nuclear power, environmental protection and the development of new materials. And this sort of activity cannot be called nonprestige. As the economic situation stabilizes it also will be natural to expect an increase in the motivation for study in the natural science faculties. The formation of such a long-term motivation requires a definite period of time. Dobraya: What is the percentage of foreign students who are selecting the university? Nabirayev: A total of 257 persons from 29 countries of the world, which is 1.8% of the total number. Dobraya: Are they coming from America and Europe? Nabirayev: Yes, there are students from America, Germany and Poland. Our education is recognized in the West. Dobraya: But it is assumed that this is not the case. Is it not true that our diplomas are not valued there? Nabirayev: It is impossible to make such a categorical assertion that our diplomas are not valued in the West. This problem has its juridical aspect. In world practice there are agreements in force among countries on the reciprocal recognition of certificates of education. The former all-union model of education, having primarily an ideological character, naturally could not be a partner of the Western system for the training of personnel. Indeed, in actual practice there have been no forms of cooperation with the West in the field of training of personnel that would make it possible to speak of any discrimination against our diplomas. In individual branches, such as in economics, there could be no such cooperation. But nevertheless the quality of training of specialists, especially in the natural science fields of specialization, in our country always was and still is at a sufficiently high level for it to be recognized in both Europe and America. Here we have the example of numerous cases of successful cooperation between our scientists and those in the West in different fields of science and technology. Our graduate students and young scientists are successfully working in research centers in America and Europe. However, the radical transformations now transpiring in the education sphere in our country have the tendency toward organization of an educational system more adapted to world standards. Since 1992 our university has switched to a two-level teaching system such as adopted in many countries. And beginning with the current academic year this system has been introduced in a number of other universities of the republic. Such a changeover was not at all dictated by any striving to imitate the Western instructional system. It must be noted that in world practice a high evaluation was given to the former Soviet education system based on 5-6 years of instruction. But from the point of view of the feasibility of the expenditures on such an intensive training of specialists, most of whose knowledge then remains unused, it is preferable, to be sure, to have a multilevel structure of education. The striving for an increase in the quality of education induced us to study the experience of academic institutions in many countries in the field of monitoring and evaluating the knowledge of students. The rating system for checking the knowledge of students introduced in our university incorporated the most effective and optimum approaches to the certification of students and is combined to the maximum with the multilevel training of specialists. We are inviting the cooperation of Western specialists in the market economy and international law fields in the training of our people. Agreements have been concluded on cooperation in the field of training of personnel with universities in France, Japan, Great Britain, South Korea and Turkey and for the second year joint work is being done with the World Bank in Washington on the retraining of our instructors in the principles of a market economy. All these measures, it is believed, will facilitate an increase in the quality of instruction in our university. Dobraya: Is there a plan for work with the gifted? Naribayev: There is. Our instructors are participating in olympiads, such students are assigned to assistant and full professors, are carrying out individual types of departmental work and are being sent abroad for study. But, unfortunately, only those can remain as graduate students who have material resources: a very small stipend. And I also wish to add that there are few applications for specialists to enter from scientific research organizations. On the one hand, to be sure, they themselves are not in the best situation: they are being cut back and are poorly funded, etc., but in science there always is a need, so to speak, for a new infusion, and then it will develop. This is one of the reasons why our students, even talented ones, are going into the business world. A sign of the times, but we will hope that it is temporary. Dobraya: University science earlier was regarded as a pariah. It was assumed that fundamental science was being developed only inside the walls of scientific research institutes. What's the present-day situation? Naribayev: Fundamental science is developing in the Academy of Sciences and in our university. We have large laboratories and three scientific research institutes have opened: theoretical and experimental physics, new chemical technologies and modern problems in biology. A scientific research humanities center is in operation. We intend to open institutes of applied mathematics and ecology. But there is a very difficult problem: science and production are not working hand-in-hand and for the time being tests are being carried out nowhere in the country. Once again it remains to hope that these are temporary difficulties. Just take a look, the realities of today are unquestionably imposing an imprint on the educational process. One would think that against the background of a decline in the prestige of education it would be natural to expect a decrease in the general intellectual level of the student body. But each year we are meeting at the university threshold young people desiring to study Persian and Japanese literature, the history of the Far East, space physics, the theory of numbers, genetics and molecular biology. Precisely these young people constitute an enormous intellectual potential for our country. Without such young people we cannot construct in our republic that which we want to build. A tombstone must not be erected over science.
