Could you explain your true intention? [Yonezawa] To beat the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] under the single-seat constituency elections, the coalition must be united. I think the LDP is becoming well-prepared for general elections compared with coalition parties. However, it is still uncertain whether or not the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] ties up with us. SDPJ members would react strongly if we start preparing for election without them, but they may not take any action if we keep waiting. We are in a dilemma. After the Hata administration became a minority government, the opposition began to seek a dissolution of the lower house through a no-confidence motion against the cabinet. Under such circumstances, the election may be held earlier than expected. When we discuss election strategies, we have to consider whether coalition parties should promote joint election campaigns within the existing framework, or form a new party. The coalition must have uniform policies even under joint campaign to back multiparty candidates, or voters would say the joint campaign is nothing more than a marriage of convenience for election only. Hereafter, coalition parties will have more opportunities to coordinate their policies, and I guess policy debates for election ties-up may become the key to the next stage of political realignment. In that case, political realignment would be accelerated by policy debates. I think members of the "Kaishin" can start policy talks anytime. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] are expected to open policy talks at the initiative by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo].... [Yonezawa] We are wondering if the SDPJ can return to the coalition, if we can tie up with each other in election campaigns, and if we can jointly seek political realignment. Since the present situation is very delicate, it is good to have frank talks between the two parties. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As the condition for its return to the coalition, the SDPJ is calling for a mass resignation of the Hata administration. Does the coalition intend to compromise with the SDPJ if it asks for a "full reshuffle of the cabinet"? [Yonezawa] If the prime minister says he "voluntarily dissolves the cabinet," he would immediately lose his leadership. From a common sense standpoint, he cannot make such a pledge right now because it would damage political power balance. There may be various possibilities of the "full reshuffle," but that should be discussed to strengthen the coalition. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The coalition's tax reform negotiations are entering the final stage. Do you think the coalition should indicate to what degree the consumption tax should be increased? [Yonezawa] I think the coalition must clearly indicate the rate of tax hike. However, the timing, the scale, and methodology of tax reform ultimately depend on results of consultations with the LDP, SDPJ, and the Sakigake. When certain accords are obtained, those must be clearly written in our proposal. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you evaluate Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa? [Yonezawa] I agree with their opinions but this does not mean I agree with anything they say. The DSP supports their ideas according to its own judgment. So, I do not understand why some people say "the DSP flatters the Shinseito and the Komeito." I think they are both capable men. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you resolved to become the last leader of the DSP? [Yonezawa] When the new party is formed, all participating parties should take off old clothes. In this sense, everybody else will share the fate with the DSP chairman. I want to complete the new party during my term as the DSP chairman.
