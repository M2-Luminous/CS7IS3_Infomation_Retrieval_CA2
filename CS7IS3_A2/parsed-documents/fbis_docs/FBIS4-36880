It added that the roads linking Mosul with the Kurdish cities of Dahuk, Irbil, and Karkuk were closed after the start of the fighting, in which it said "the commander of a brigade from the al-Jubur tribe and another from al-Ghazlaniyyin tribe" participated. Al-Jubur officers were one of the influential blocs in the Iraqi Army until two years ago when a group of them were accused of planning to overthrow and kill President Saddam Husayn. Scores of them were executed and hundreds subsequently dismissed from service. A UINC official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone yesterday from his office in Salah al-Din in Iraqi Kurdistan that the roads between Mosul and the Kurdish areas were reopened yesterday and that he had received information that clashes took place a few days ago among Iraqi military units stationed around Karkuk. The Iraqi Dispatch Authority said that "three successive explosions occurred in Baghdad 30 May." And that the first explosion occurred "in Saddam Husayn's new house in Corniche al-A'zamiyah" on the Tigris River and the second "in the Ba'th Party's headquarters in al-A'zamiyah." On the situation in the Kurdish areas UINC sources said that the fighting among the warring Kurdish militias has stopped in the Halabjah area adjacent to the border with Iran. And that the cease-fire and disengagement of the forces were holding in the Qal'at Dizah area yesterday.
