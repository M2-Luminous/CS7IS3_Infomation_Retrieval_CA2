FR940921-0-00153 FR940921-0-00016 (20) For liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines: Composition of the liquefied petroleum gas-fuel used during the test. Each hydrocarbon compound present, through C 4 compounds, shall be individually reported. C 5 and heavier hydrocarbons may be reported as a group. (21) The stabilized pre-test weight and post-test weight of each particulate sample and back-up filter or pair of filters. (22) Brake specific emissions (g/BHP-hr) for HC, CO, NO X and, if applicable, OMHCE, CH 3 OH and HCHO for methanol-fueled vehicles for each test phase (cold and hot). (23) The weighted (cold and hot) brake specific emissions (g/BHP-hr) for the total test. (24) The weighted (cold and hot) carbon balance or mass-measured brake specific fuel consumption for the total test. (25) The number of hours of operation accumulated on the engine after completing the test sequences described in Figure N84&hyph;10. 115. The title of subpart P is revised to read as follows: Subpart P_Emission Regulations for New Gasoline-Fueled, Natural Gas-Fueled, Liquefied Petroleum Gas-Fueled and Methanol-Fueled Heavy-Duty Engines and New Gasoline-Fueled, Natural Gas-Fueled, Liquefied Petroleum Gas-Fueled and Methanol-Fueled Light-Duty Trucks; Idle Test Procedures 116. A new section 86.1501&hyph;94 is added to subpart P to read as follows: §86.1501&hyph;94 Scope; applicability. This subpart contains gaseous emission idle test procedures for gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, and for gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle light-duty trucks. It applies to 1994 and later model years. The idle test procedures are optionally applicable to 1990 through 1993 model year natural-gas fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and Otto-cycle light-duty trucks. 117. A new section 86.1504&hyph;94 is added to subpart P to read as follows: §86.1504&hyph;94 Section numbering; construction. (a) The model year of initial applicability is indicated by the section number. The two digits following the hyphen designate the first model year for which a section is effective. A section remains effective until superseded. Example: Section 86.1511&hyph;84 applies to the 1984 and subsequent model years until superseded. If §86.1511&hyph;85 is promulgated, it would take effect beginning with the 1985 model year. Section 86.1511&hyph;83 would apply to model years 1983 and 1984. (b) A section reference without a model year suffix refers to the section applicable for the appropriate model year. (c) All provisions in the subpart apply to gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, and to gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle light-duty trucks. 118. A new section 86.1505&hyph;94 is added to subpart P to read as follows: §86.1505&hyph;94 Introduction; structure of subpart. (a) This subpart describes the equipment and the procedures required to perform idle exhaust emission tests on Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and Otto-cycle light-duty trucks. Subpart A sets forth the testing requirements, reporting requirements and test intervals necessary to comply with EPA certification procedures. (b) Four topics are addressed in this subpart. Sections 86.1505 through 86.1515 set forth specifications and equipment requirements; §§86.1516 through 86.1526 discuss calibration methods and frequency; test procedures and data requirements are listed in §§86.1527 through 86.1542 and calculation formulas are found in §86.1544.
