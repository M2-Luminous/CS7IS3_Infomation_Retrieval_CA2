FR940606-1-00046 FR940606-1-00008 Information collected on cleaning solvents also showed that some hand-wipe cleaning solvents have both a very low vapor pressure and a very low evaporation rate. Available data indicate that low evaporation rates also contribute to minimizing emissions. These cleaning solvents are demonstrated technology for limited applications and their use would reduce organic HAP emissions as much as or more than the proposed vapor pressure limit. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to encourage their use by including an approved composition list for cleaning solvents in the proposed rule. The EPA welcomes comments on this list and proposals for adding to the list before final promulgation of the rule. Based on data provided by aerospace facilities in response to the section 114 questionnaires, spray guns used to apply coatings are cleaned either manually or in enclosed gun cleaners. Based on information obtained during plant visits, enclosed gun cleaners are demonstrated to reduce emissions. Each of the 61 facilities that reported a spray gun cleaning method was classified as to whether the spray guns were cleaned manually or with an enclosed cleaner. Eighteen of the 61 facilities (29 percent) reported using enclosed gun cleaners; therefore, enclosed gun cleaners were considered to represent the MACT floor level of control. The EPA also received information from the industry on the use of cleaning methods other than enclosed gun cleaners. After review of this information, the EPA determined that adequate technical justification was presented to show that the alternate cleaning methods were as effective as enclosed spray gun cleaners in controlling organic HAP emissions. Consequently, in addition to enclosed spray gun cleaners, the EPA is proposing to allow the use of: (1) Unatomized discharge of solvent into a waste container that is kept closed when not in use, (2) hand cleaning in a vat that is kept closed when not in use, and (3) the use of atomized spray into a waste container fitted with a device designed to capture atomized solvent emissions. Based on information received from the responses to the section 114 questionnaires, plant visits, and industry meetings, the EPA learned that there are certain cleaning operations for which low VOC, low HAP, or low vapor pressure cleaning solvents do not have widespread use that would constitute a demonstrated technology. The EPA, therefore, is proposing to exempt these cleaning operations from the requirements to use cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition list and the proposed vapor pressure limit of 45 mm Hg at 20 ○C (24.1 in. H 2 O at 68 ○F). These operations are listed in §63.744(e) of the proposed rule. The use of cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition list is not yet demonstrated for the proposed exempt cleaning operations. However, there are many new cleaning solvents being developed, some of which are very close to being used within the industry for some of these proposed exempt cleaning operations. To encourage the use of available compliant cleaning solvents and the ones being developed, the EPA considered imposing a limit on the annual usage of non-compliant cleaning solvents for exempt operations. However, no data were available for use in establishing this limit. 2. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations As noted above, over 12 percent of the aerospace industry is located in four districts in California. The SCAQMD, Ventura County APCD, Imperial County APCD, and Sacramento Metropolitan AQMD rules all require high transfer efficiency coating application methods. The application methods specified in these rules were adopted as the MACT floor. The specified methods are electrostatic application, flow coat application, dip coat application, roll coating, brush coating, and HVLP spraying. The EPA recognizes that there may be other application methods that achieve a level of emissions equivalent to the application methods allowed in the proposed rule. Therefore, the EPA is requesting comments identifying these other application methods. These comments should include test data demonstrating that, in actual production conditions, the application method achieves a level of emissions at least equivalent to the level of emissions achieved by HVLP or electrostatic spray application methods. The EPA will review these comments and, where adequate technical justification exists, amend the list of approved application methods. The EPA also examined whether or not there are demonstrated low organic HAP content primers or topcoats that could be used in conjunction with high transfer application methods to establish the MACT floor to reduce emissions. To this end, the EPA examined State and local regulations and the data obtained through the section 114 responses.
