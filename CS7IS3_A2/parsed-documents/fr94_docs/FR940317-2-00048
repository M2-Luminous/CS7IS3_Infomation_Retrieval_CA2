SUMMARY: Section 5(a)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture or import a new chemical substance to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import commences. Statutory requirements for section 5(a)(1) premanufacture notices are discussed in the final rule published in the Federal Register of May 13, 1983 (48 FR 21722). In the Federal Register of November 11, 1984, (49 FR 46066) (40 CFR 723.250), EPA published a rule which granted a limited exemption from certain PMN requirements for certain types of polymers. Notices for such polymers are reviewed by EPA within 21 days of receipt. This notice announces receipt of 12 such PMN(s) and provides a summary of each. DATES: Close of review periods: Y 94&hyph;34, 94&hyph;35, January 11, 1994. Y 94&hyph;38, February 10, 1994. Y 94&hyph;39, February 15, 1994. Y 94&hyph;40, February 16, 1994.
