"There is a whole range of areas where more transparency is sought," Sutherland said, citing concerns among GATT members over the uniform administration of its foreign trade regime, especially in the area of import quotas, licences and standards. "I believe that China would be well advised to take these concerns seriously," said Sutherland, who held talks on the membership issue Tuesday with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi and other senior officials. China, which was a founder member of GATT but left after the communists came to power in 1949, has made it clear that it attaches great political significance to being readmitted before GATT is replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on January 1. While such a timeframe is possible, Sutherland told reporters that it would be a "difficult task." "It depends ultimately on the willingness ... of the Chinese side to be immediately responsive to the concerns about transparency and other issues and for the rest of the world to respond rapidly to the political demand made by China for early accession." He also pointed out that the WTO provides precise guidelines as to the types of instruments -- such as import quotas and tariffs -- that governments may resort to in pushing individual economic and trade priorities. "Transparency is the only vehicle by which multilateral scrutiny of such instruments can be achieved. And full transparency is the basis on which China's request for resumption will be judged," he said. Another serious obstacle to early re-entry is the ongoing Sino-U.S. row over China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status, which Washington has threatened to withdraw in June unless significant progress is made in China's human rights record. If MFN is withdrawn, "it may signal difficulties vis-a-vis the conclusion of China's entry to the WTO," Sutherland said. Because MFN is an "important principle" within the GATT, "the U.S. attitude, as a major contracting party to the Chinese integration into the world economy, will be of considerable importance to the conclusion of the negotiations for China's full accession into the WTO." That attitude "will be signalled one way or another by events in the MFN issue," he added. On the Chinese side, Wu Yi warned Sutherland that without Chinese participation, the WTO would be "incomplete and lack universality." In a policy speech made later Wednesday to an international symposium, Wu insisted that China had in fact made "remarkable" progress in improving market access and engineered a "considerable rise of transparency in its foreign trade regime." China has complained that it has not received adequate recognition for its trade liberalisation programme and that the requirements laid down by some GATT members for readmission could not be met without jeopardising the reform process. However, while praising China's "real commitment," Sutherland stressed that GATT membership could not be granted on a basis which erodes any of the fundamental principles of the multilateral trading system. "Therefore there is a responsibility on the part of China to show flexibility and to give adequate assurances" that would address the concerns of GATT members. In effect, the deadline for concluding the current negotiations is much closer than December, with the GATT looking for a protocol agreement on China's re-entry to be reached before the next GATT Working Party on China talks scheduled for late June. "In order to have any realistic possibility of concluding this negotiation in time, that protocol and agreement as to the terms of the protocol must be a priority," Sutherland said.
