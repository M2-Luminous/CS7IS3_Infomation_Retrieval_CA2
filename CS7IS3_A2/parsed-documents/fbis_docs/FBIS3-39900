They disclosed that official creditors in the Paris Club recently granted Russia a four-month extension -- until the end of April -- on last year's agreement to reschedule over ten years a massive 15 billion dollars of debt service and interest arrears due in 1993. Group of Seven (G7) finance ministers are expected to assess the implications of the latest political upheavals in Moscow when they meet near Frankfurt on Saturday. Their agenda is expected to include a review of the closely linked issues of Russian debt, economic stabilization and reform efforts and the flow of external aid to back them. The creditors' decision, described by debt negotiators as a "short-term measure," was therefore seen as a significant development by Paris experts. The extension, according to diplomats associated with debt negotiations, may ease the Russian debt service burden by an estimated 2.0 to 3.0 billion dollars during the January-to-April period. They stressed it was agreed in the hope "that by then the Russians will be able to negotiate a new programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)." Monetary sources indicated Wednesday that talks underway in Moscow since February 1 on a new IMF arrangement with Russia were marking time. The Russians "have not made enough progress in drafting their policies" and have been unable to present "a sufficiently serious" programme, one official explained. The result was a joint decision to put off until later a planned secrecy-stamped visit to Moscow this week by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus, the same sources said, stressing this did not mean that an understanding would not eventually emerge. With some G7 countries -- in particular the United States -- urging the IMF and other international institutions to provide a larger share of Western aid to Russia, concern has been mounting that Chernomyrdin's reshuffled, conservative cabinet may delay much-needed economic stabilization and reform moves. Camdessus, who is to present an interim report to the G7 ministers, is likely to voice his concern about the absence of action by Moscow to check rising inflation and reverse the growth of Russia's balooning budget deficit. This would be among conditions that Russia must meet in order to secure the disbursement of the second and last 1.5 billion dollar installment of a special IMF credit granted Moscow just before last July's Tokyo summit of G7 leaders. Monetary sources ruled out any easing of the conditionality required under the IMF's charter. The Fund has recently drawn fire from some U.S. Administration quarters on this count but has secured firm support from U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and from other G7 members, they said. "We need to see the Russian (reform) process moving ahead, so that aid may follow," a senior European official commented. The World Bank, which has so far granted Russia loans totalling about 1.4 billion dollars, meanwhile has a project pipeline of nearly 6.5 billion dollars, but finds it difficult to speed up disbursements. "Nobody can accuse us of not trying," a senior Bank official said, but "it takes two sides to implement a project." Besides unblocking an additional 1.5 billion IMF credit, an accord with the Fund would give the go-ahead for serious Paris Club talks on a rescheduling of debt service falling due this year on an estimated 60 billion dollars of official debt, from a total ex-Soviet debt now set at about 85 billion dollars. Recent IMF figures show that last year's 15 billion dollar rescheduling accounted for nearly half of Western financial aid for Russia announced for 1992-93 and so far actually delivered. At their Tokyo summit the G7 countries endorsed a 43.5 billion dollar package of bilateral and multilateral aid for 1993, which contained some of the components of a similar 24 billion dollar package initially unveiled by then U.S. President George Bush early in 1992. Out of the total of 55 billion announced, only 38 billion had been delivered as of last month, including the debt relief offered by the Paris Club, IMF data show.
