Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has also asked the international donor community for $10 million to supplement Zambia's Public Service Wage Bill. President Chiluba told an International Monetary Fund representative in Lusaka that Zambia was looking for additional funds to increase the salaries of poorly paid civil servants. President Chiluba said the decision to forego salary increments for top politicians and civil servants was a demonstration of his government's commitment to the country's economic restructuring program.
