(Footnote 1) (See the three articles by Maurice Allais on "Rethinking European Integration" published in the "Opinions" section on 26 April, 3 May, and 9 May 1994.) In the belief that they had been won over to what he calls a "pro-free-trade" mentality, he regards them as "personally and directly responsible" for innumerable miseries, as the "heroes of a vast mystification," and as the "gravediggers of European integration." Finally, he says, even if they are "ignorant and thoughtless, they are nonetheless responsible and blameworthy." The context suggests that this is as applicable to de Gaulle, President Mitterrand, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Helmut Kohl, Sir Leon Brittan, and Margaret Thatcher as to Jacques Delors. The excessive passion of the author of this polemic should not be allowed to obscure the real questions this economist is posing. And his renown should not prevent us from answering these questions. As a contribution to this end, I would like to recall certain facts and pose certain questions. Reestablishing the Facts 1. None of the French leaders of the past 40 years, whether socialist or liberal, Gaullist or centrist, has defended a "pro-free-trade" ideology. They have tolerated the gradual opening up of our markets, parallel to the actions of our European partners, first of all, and those elsewhere subsequently. Where the Anglo-Saxons are concerned, the French view of international trade has always favored trade that is "free but fair." For us in France, freedom is differentiated from anarchy by the existence of rules, penalties, and judges. 2. The "free-trade" theory is the doctrine of the econometricians, whom Mr. Allais has indeed a right to attack, but the term does not reflect the real situation in current international trade relations. From the origins of the GATT to the beginning of the Uruguay Round, or in other words from 1947 to 1986, only two issues were dealt with. They were the progressive lifting of import quotas and the reduction of the rates for the customs duties imposed on industrial goods. There many other obstacles and distortions that have as yet been dealt with only imperfectly, even within the single European market, and were only partially broached for the first time in the Uruguay Round. They include technical and health norms, national and local public markets, legal or de facto monopolies on imports, systematic recourse to counterfeiting, denial of the right to establish businesses in foreign countries, discriminatory subsidies or tax systems, foreign investment regulations, etc. 3. The GATT agreement remains incomplete and imperfect. But it marks a turning point in world trade policy, one particularly favorable to the interests of our country. - Not only does it not challenge Community preference, but, for the first time in the GATT negotiations, it recognizes its legitimacy. The mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are valid, as is our French and European aid for cinematographic and audiovisual development ("the cultural exception"), as well as the subsidies we allocate to our least-favored regions or for technological research. - This agreement deals with several of the new trade distortions, beginning with counterfeit goods, on which penalties will be systematically imposed. Our protected regional designations of origin, our textile and clothing industries, and our luxury industries (47 percent of the world trade in this sector) will be the first to benefit from these measures. Also, the United States will no longer be able to use its system of federalism to justify its refusal to open up its public markets to European competition. Our public-sector businesses will be able to submit bids in Massachusetts or in California--and France is one of the "giants" in the civil-engineering sector. - The "family circle" of GATT members is broadening, as is the scope of its regulations. The newly industrialized countries, which have to date only participated to the extent of 20 percent of their trade, will henceforth have an involvement extending to more than 75 percent. And so, finally, our business will have access to the Asian markets where we have only been selling five percent of our exports. - Better still, the GATT, an Anglo-Saxon concept, will cease to exist, giving way to a veritable World Trade Organization (WTO) with a French concept and name for which we won acceptance against the initial American position. The member countries of this organization undertake not to have recourse within the organization to unilateral legislation like Section 301, and in world trade, there will finally be a real judge--an independent authority protecting the weak against the abuses by the strong or the those willing to cheat. - Finally, this organization has already placed action on "ecological dumping" on its agenda. And we have also obtained the support of the United States itself for the inclusion on that agenda of the problem posed by the countries that refuse to respect the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) on the basic rights of workers. An Armed Peace As we have no desire to ignore reality, we know that the commercial peace negotiated in this way will remain an armed truce for a long time yet. That is why we have further strengthened the capacity of Europe as a deterrent force by providing ourselves with a more flexible and efficient antidumping apparatus. Without waiting for the implementation of this provision, for example, we have already reduced the import quota for Chinese footwear by 40 percent, imposed antidumping fees of 100 percent on Japanese television sets, and persuaded the Americans to reject the "buy American" requirement with regard to the public- sector market. All of this has been accepted by 117 countries. We did not have the power to force their agreement, but we were able to persuade them. Who could hope for more, in France or elsewhere? To the extent that we think within the national framework alone, alternative policies are possible, and insofar as we confine ourselves to the world of ideas, there is no limit on flexibility. To be sure, one can dream of a an imaginary republic--an administrative autarchy according import quotas on a discretionary basis to the more civilized or the more barbarian nations. However, harsh international realities force us to move from the realm of pure reason to that of practical reason. Of course, we are not naive. We know that there are ulterior motives everywhere, and that goodwill is not universal. We are all too aware that the U.S. Congress is not enthusiastic. Everything will depend on the capacity of the Europeans to remain united in implementing the agreement, just as they were united in negotiating it, and on the determination of our governing leaders. Edouard Balladur's government will not flag. The Debate on Jobs So much for the documents. Let me proceed to the questions we are all asking ourselves. In the past 40 years, world trade has developed more rapidly than world production. Exports have been the permanent motive force behind growth, particularly for the European countries. However, would trade with the countries characterized by low wages destroy jobs? Yes, unless we were capable of resisting this competition. But if that is the case, how can it be that our country has an enduring surplus with almost all of the countries with low income levels? Even within the EEC, we have a surplus with Spain--more than 15 billion! The same is the case with Portugal, Greece, and eastern Germany, while there is a serious deficit with western Germany, despite the fact that the wages there surpass ours by 22 percent. Let us turn toward the east. We have a surplus with the countries of Central and East Europe, whose deficits with us have even doubled in the past three years. Let us look southward. Despite our purchases of hydrocarbons from Algeria, we have a surplus of eight billion francs in our trade with the Maghreb. Turning to the Far East, we have a surplus, overall, with regard to the Asian "dragons," including South Korea. China, which boycotted our products for political reasons, is the sole notable exception. And so, all in all, a reduction in our trade with the countries characterized by low wages would destroy a substantial number of jobs in France. Fortunately, the United States did not suffer in the 1950's from the blind egotism that is urged upon us today. At the time, the per capita income of a Europe in ruins was only a third the figure in America. After the protectionist misconstructions of the 1930's, the OECE [Organization for European Economic Cooperation] and the GATT brought about the rebirth of a more or less fair trading system, which proved of tremendous benefit to all the participants therein. New Consumers Let us dwell for a moment on the position of America as the richest country in the world, one technically capable of producing everything better than the others can. If one were to follow the theory of sacred egotism, it could be claimed that the United States should not trade with any other country, since any imports would destroy jobs there. Obviously, this is absurd. Unless the term "ignorant and thoughtless" is applicable to Messrs. Bush and Clinton, who agreed to a free-trade agreement with Mexico, as did the members of the Congress who ratified it. But how can it be, in fact, that with a given level of growth in production and/or foreign trade and/or the trade balance, the same apparent effect on jobs is not produced in all countries? Why is it that for 10 years, Switzerland, Sweden, West Germany, and more recently, Great Britain--all neighboring countries with economies comparable to ours, and equally open to the world economy, have had substantially lower unemployment rates? Why is unemployment among the young a specifically French malady? Rather it would appear as if the changes in the job sector--the pairing of job elimination and job creation--depend on three main factors. On the one hand, there is technical progress, and on the other, the social and administrative rigidity that slows the adaptation of our productive system to this progress. And, finally, there are the changes in society itself that affect either the active population (rates of activity among young people or women) or the distribution of services within the market economy (meaning jobs for which the market provides remuneration), public intervention (meaning the jobs financed by taxes), and, finally, family solidarity (meaning activities outside the official economy). If this is the case, how can one deny that international trade is one vehicle, among others, of progress? And that the emergence of Asia and Latin America from underdevelopment thanks to trade is good news for all of mankind, including ourselves, since it means hundreds of millions of new customers for our manufacturers of automobiles, trains, planes, telephones, and even luxury products, as well as for our highway, port, and airport engineers, and for our suppliers of banking and software services. In short, for everything that we do better than others do. On one proviso, obviously a basic one. And that is that the trade conditions be equitable and fair. This is why we wanted the GATT replaced by the WTO. When I was in grade school, the blue on the atlas indicating French possessions covered half of Africa, part of Asia, and could be found on all five continents. As a world power, France, like Great Britain--pink in the atlas--could dictate conditions to its trade partners, which occupied an inferior, indeed a subordinate, position. Times have changed. There is just one world economy, and all of the partners are equal in dignity. The population of the planet has tripled in one generation. The leading motive dynamic force is no longer (for the time being?) to be found on our continent. Moreover, we need allies, even for the defense of our vital interests. This is indeed the leading purpose of European construction. Now, while we no longer control the economic game, it is a fact, on the other hand, that the institutions we have devised to regulate world regulations, beginning with the new World Trade Organization, are accepted as legitimate by all the actors on the stage. Let us be wise enough to make the best use of this fact. Let us not blame the poorly-paid Polish worker for the miseries that are due first and foremost to our own very French rigidity. Let the demagogues claim that the ailment should be treated by making the germs illegal, and that the unemployment problem should be resolved by putting the agents who punch tickets back on the stagecoaches. Let us also leave to them the monopoly on invective toward the scientists and statesmen who are courageously pleading the case for progress, minor but essential, in human relations. Let blind egotism yield, little by little, to enlightened egotism.
