This statement was made by deputy chairman of the Russia's Choice faction, Boris Zolotukhin, at the faction's meeting. Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar stated on behalf of the faction in the State Duma today that the faction was prepared to sign the document. Russia's Choice member Yuliy Rybakov suggested that the State Duma would not give State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin a mandate for signing the agreement proposed by the president. Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, has insisted that the State Duma take a vote on whether Rybkin be granted the right to sign the document on its behalf. Zolotukhin was certain that if the State Duma did not give the appropriate authority to Rybkin this would expose the Duma's majority as a force not seeking stabilization of the situation in society. Deputy Bella Denisenko said the draft agreement provided for nothing except the idea of accord itself and the faction would have to sign just the title since there were no real moves towards accord mentioned in the document. She said that the document had already worsened the situation and brought different political forces into confrontation. Former social security minister, Ella Pamfilova, recommended that the faction seriously speak to the president in the presence of all members of Russia's Choice. She said it was not clear what the president sought and in what the faction should back him and whether Boris Yeltsin needed this support.
