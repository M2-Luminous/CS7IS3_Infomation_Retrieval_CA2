This was stated by the Chechen Foreign Ministry today. The Chechen Foreign Ministry said Britain had tried to stain the honor and dignity of the Chechen people blaming it for a vendetta. "Unwilling to cause any additional troubles and problems for the Britain [as received] and in order to avoid new provocations and incidents unpleasant for Britain," Chechnya decided not to participate in the Sytex-94 international exhibition. The Chechen president's service told Interfax that the statement was due to the assassination of Karin Reed in London. Karin Reed was a relative of an Armenian terrorist Ter-Oganesyan who had taken part in the assassination of the Utsiyev brothers. Currently, he is serving a life-sentence in a British prison. After the assassination of Karin Reed several London editions suggested that this had been a vendetta on the part of relatives of the Utsiyev brothers sent to Britain more than a year before and killed by Armenian terrorists. The official reason for the Utsiyevs' trip to London was to legalize the order for printing Chechen currency units and stamps. Scotland Yard suggested that the Utsiyevs had come to Britain in order to buy missiles and to re-sell them to the Azerbaijani party. Blaming the foreign special services for attempts to discredit Chechnya, the Chechen Foreign Minister stated that the British special services seemed not to know well enough customs and traditions of "Chechens for whom the assassination of a woman an elderly person or a child is a national disgrace."
