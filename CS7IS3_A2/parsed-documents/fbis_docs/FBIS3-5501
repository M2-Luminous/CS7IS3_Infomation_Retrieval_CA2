"Carrying out the role expected of Japan in an extremely important body such as the Security Council is important, and a large number of countries expect this (of Japan)," said the former vice foreign minister in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Owada, 61, who is the father of Princess Masako, wife of Crown Prince Naruhito, also said trade friction with the United States should not be allowed to cause a deterioration in the bilateral relationship. He said that in the relationship with the U.S., "there are many areas where security, the economy and society overlap." "Becoming antagonists is out of the question," Owada said. "It is dangerous to surmise that friction will occur periodically." Owada said the achievement of an early resolution of economic problems between the U.S. and Japan is vital. "Restructuring the economic relationship with Japan is an important mission of the administration of President Bill Clinton," he said. Owada, who resigned as the Foreign Ministry's top bureaucrat last August, replaced Yoshio Hatano in the New York posting earlier this week.
