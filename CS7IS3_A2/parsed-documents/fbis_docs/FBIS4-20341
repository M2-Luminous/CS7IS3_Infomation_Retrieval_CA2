Reform and opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have brought life and vitality to the nation's growth on the one hand but have also posed a serious challenge to the nation's public security. This article uses Shanghai as an example to bring up some national issues. Rising Trend of Serious Crimes According to statistics compiled by Shanghai's Public Security Department, the number of criminal cases had declined somewhat in 1992 compared to previous years, but the number of serious crimes had increased. Between January and June of this year, there were 8,535 criminal cases, a 13.5 percent increase, but there were 4,303 serious crimes, a 38.4 percent rise compared to the same period a year ago, which was fairly substantial. Murder, robbery, rape, fraud, theft, and drug trafficking and other major crimes also increased by varying degrees. Crimes such as brutal murders, disfigurement, and kidnapping which never or rarely happened in the past are happening today. Serious crimes endanger the lives and properties of the people, jeopardize economic construction, and seriously undermine social stability. Crimes Are Mostly Committed by Drifters According to the relevant departments, currently Shanghai has a mobile population of around 2.5 million people. The undesirable elements and drifting criminal elements among these outsiders are posing a serious threat to Shanghai's public security. From January to July of this year, the municipality arrested 4,975 criminals who were from outside of the area, 2,526 of them for committing serious crimes. These represent increases of 75.5 percent and 82.3 percent respectively. Of the total number of criminals, 53.1 percent were from outside of the area, and among those responsible for serious crimes, 52.4 were outsiders. These represent increases of 10.3 percentage points and 10.5 percentage points respectively compared to the same period last year. In terms of vicious crimes, the absolute number of murders, robberies, rapes and other vicious crimes committed by outsiders has increased 82.1 percent compared to the same period last year; in terms of crimes committed by gangs, nearly half were committed by gang members from outsider the area. In the course of reform, social contradictions and instability have become prominent factors. They have become very serious in some instances. Intensified Social Contradictions Lead To Violations of the Law and Crimes 1. Contradictions occurring as enterprises change their operating mechanisms: Statistics compiled by the municipality's relevant departments show that currently, 5,600 of the municipality's enterprises have changed their operating mechanisms. Among the 2.17 million workers in these enterprises implementing the whole staff labor contract system or the employment contract system on a trial basis, there are 107,000 laid-off workers and 34,000 workers looking for work; they account for 5 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, of the total work force. Reform will continue to deepen this year, and the number of laid-off and unemployed workers will continue to increase. Based on the estimated figures of 6 percent laid-off and 3 percent unemployed workers, out of the municipality's 4.2 million workers, there will be 250,000 laid-off and 120,000 unemployed workers. Because the reform is broad in scope and massive in impact and the economic system is in the midst of being restructured, traditional concepts will still have some impact, and in addition, some enterprises have not been doing a good ideological work nor handling the relationship between cadres and the masses properly, nor have they made proper arrangements for the workers, and so the contradictions caused by enterprises' changing mechanisms are quite serious. Some workers left destitute have repeatedly appealed to the higher authorities for help. 2. Contradictions caused by land leases that forced people to move from one place to another: First, group appeals have increased. Second, the residents are moving en masse, creating many contradictions in their work, study, and everyday life and causing dissatisfaction. Third, arguments have erupted within some families over who got better housing or more properties, and these in turn have led to family feuds and disputes. Lastly, in the land leases, some enterprises and institutes are moving entire plants, but mistakes in hammering out the agreements or resolving the property rights have resulted in lawsuits and so on. 3. Negative and corrupt phenomena are a major factor contributing to social instability. The negative and corrupt phenomena the masses object to the most today are the following: a) The practices of abuse of power for private gains and trading power for money have made a come-back under the new conditions. In some law enforcement and supervisory and administrative departments, there is a serious problem where a handful of workers have to be bribed to work; some do a haphazard job even after they are bribed, and some make up all kinds of excuses to extort payments and so on. b) Some people eat, take, withhold, and make demands; they spend public funds on entertainment, gifts, and trips, and they squander and waste money. Their entertainment and gift-giving are increasingly more extravagant: their dinners often cost several thousand yuan and their gifts are expensive, with increasing "gold content." c) There is growing resentment among the masses toward formalism, bureaucracy, and fraud and trickery, but little is done about them. Enterprises are subjected to a lot of useless evaluations and examinations, but problems that affect the masses' immediate welfare just drag on and are never resolved. Contract management is riddled with fraud and trickery, and the use of deceptive means to gain profit and fame is commonplace. d) Problems are emerging in new territories: In the real estate market, taking advantage of the randomness in who may lease land and for how much, some people are giving and taking bribes; malpractices for personal gains are common. Some government departments have been converted to intermediary organs after given new functions; everybody must go through them in order to obtain a license or have a project approved by the appropriate department. Nothing will get done without paying off the middle-men. A handful of government employees have joined the ranks of agents to get into the market, using their official position and power to recruit business and earn commission and payoffs. Meanwhile, some people take advantage of the lecture circuit or news media to broadcast false information and mislead stock market trends as ways to profit themselves. Economic Crimes Are Getting Increasingly More Serious 1. Corruption, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, and other economic crimes among state workers are common. Ordinary crimes have declined, but serious crimes have increased. According to data compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate, between January and May of this year, there were 168 major cases of corruption, bribery, and misappropriation of public funds. They accounted for 71 percent of all cases filed, an increase of 30 percentage points compared to last year for the same period. The biggest corruption case involved more than 5 million yuan, and the biggest case of misappropriation of public funds involved 3.07 million yuan. 2. Crimes are showig up in the stock and securities exchanges. The municipal procuratorate's statistics show that between January and May of this year, there were 16 stock-related criminal cases. Among them were 12 cases where employees in bank security departments were taking advantage of their position to engage in stock speculations. As much as 11 million yuan were involved in those crimes. 3. Public security problems are emerging as the stock market develops: First, it has triggered criminal offenses. Based on the public security department's incomplete data, between August 1990 and May 1992, there were a total of 70 stock market-related criminal cases. Second, there are hidden security problems. Between August 1990 and May 1992, there were 28 public security-related cases in the vicinities of Shanghai's stock market. The majority were cases involving fights that broke out in the black market exchange of stock subscription certificates and traffic problems and so on. Third, there are new social conflicts. In particular, there has been an increase in civil suits and economic disputes related to the buying and selling of stocks. Data compiled by the court system show that the municipality's courts handled a total of 102 stock-related disputes in 1992. 4. Debt-related disputes have continued to increase. Statistics show that from July 1992 to March of this year, in excess of 400 million yuan were involved in cases mediated by the economic dispute mediation center of the municipality's courts. Most of the disputes involved payments in arrears in business transactions and loans for trips taken abroad and so on. 5. Trademark infringement cases have multiplied. Counterfeiting well-known, fine products and trademarks has become an important way for some enterprises to compete and reap exorbitant profits. Between January and May of this year, 26 trademark infringement cases were filed, accounting for 10.9 percent of all cases filed, and it was 3.7 times more than the number filed last year during the same period. Prior to the East Asian Games, a random check of 1,352 businesses on Fourth Street showed that 560, or 41.4 percent, were selling counterfeit products. Failure To Curb Prostitution Despite Bans 1. For the sake of money, some unscrupulous people are circulating low-class, crude, lewd, and obscene "spiritual products," corrupting people's souls. According to the municipality's music and video control department, in 1992, more than 40,000 illegal video tapes and more than 30,000 illegal audio tapes were seized; 184 vendor's stalls were shut down, and 40 people were arrested by the public security department--14 of them have been sentenced. In examining 8,390 video tapes (containing 10,285 shows,) 5,981 shows, or 57.8 percent, were deemed obscene. In May of this year, the municipal public security bureau together with the industrial and commercial bureau uncovered a case involving the sale of pornographic films; a batch of such films were seized. 2. Despite concentrated rectification efforts year after year, prostitution, although curtailed to some extent, still has not been swept out, and in some places, is still spreading and growing. In 1992, more than 3,000 women and more than 800 procurers of prostitutes were rounded up and sent to undergo reeducation. Between January and June of this year, 792 cases involving prostitution were investigated and processed; 1,585 people were arrested. Particularly serious are the pornographic and gambling "services" provided in some public places: Some dance halls provide closed KTV boxes and have bikini-clad girls put on shows to attract customers. Despite the municipal party committee and the municipal government's repeated orders banning the "three services," many places are still secretly doing this type of "business." 3. The manufacturing, trafficking, and taking of drugs and illegal growing of drug-producing plants are still a serious problem. From January to April of this year, the municipality investigated and prosecuted 40 such cases; 55 people were arrested, and 470,000 illegally-grown opium poppy plants were eradicated. 4. The management and administration guiding ideologies of some cultural and entertainment centers are flawed. First, some guest-houses, hotels, and inns are only concerned about their occupancy rate and profit and are disregarding the issues of social benefit and clean social environment. They ignore regulations, fail to register guests, and are remiss in management. Of the 229 prostitution-related cases in Xuhui District, 92, or 40 percent, took place in the guest-houses and hotels. Second, amid the intense market competition, some plant supervisors and managers have developed unhealthy management ideas and are providing immoral services as a means to promote their products and negotiate business and are offering substantial financial rewards to abet and entice young girls to sell their looks and even their bodies.
