The entire peace process has been jeopardized by the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The sources indicated that this plan is grounded in providing protection for the Palestinians of the occupied territories to entice the Arab sides back into the negotiations in early April. News reports from Washington said that, with regard to protection for the Palestinians, the U.S. Government has formulated proposals on the measures that can be taken and announced in order to pacify the Palestinians of the occupied territories. The reports added that it is not unlikely that the United States will make an effort to persuade Israel to accept a reduced presence of unarmed international observers in the occupied territories as part of protection guarantees for the Palestinians in accordance with the provisions enshrined in the Declaration of Principles signed by the Palestinian and Israeli sides. The U.S. sources asserted that the U.S. plan, which contains specific proposals, will be the focus of consultations to be held with the concerned parties within the next few days, particularly with [Israeli] Prime Minister Rabin, who is scheduled to visit the United States next week. The sources noted that an outline of this plan was discussed by senior officials of the U.S. State Department and a PLO delegation headed by brother Dr. Nabil Sha'th during the meetings they held recently. Dr. Nabil Sha'th met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday. He also met with the U.S. team assigned the task of following up on the Middle East peace talks. The sources pointed out that it is not unlikely that the consultations held in this regard will be continued with the concerned parties during a tour of the region by Dennis Ross in the second half of March. The sources went on to say that Christopher himself might undertake this mission if he finds that this is warranted to ensure the reactivation of the peace process and bring it back on track as soon as possible.
