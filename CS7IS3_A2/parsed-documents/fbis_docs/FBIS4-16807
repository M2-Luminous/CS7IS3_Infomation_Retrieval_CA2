Moldova cannot repay the debt of 131 billion Russian rubles with money from its treasury, Cunev said in a television program. "The (state) budget is well-balanced and its deficit must not exceed 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product," which prompts a "very simple" solution -- "if you can't pay cut down your consumption," he said. Moldova consumes no more energy today than four years ago but "produces much fewer goods," Cunev said. He said it would be cheaper for Moldova to buy crude oil in the Middle East and have it refined in Romania. But Moldova does not have enough hard currency to pay for this, while oil-exporters in the Commonwealth of Independent States accept Moldovan goods as payment. Russia has pledged to provide Moldova with 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas this year, while the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom a few days ago axed by one-third its supplies to Moldova due to the latter's arrears.
