During Demirel's visit to Romania, the sides have examined concrete means of further cooperation, especially in the economic sphere. During the news conference the sides stressed the importance of cooperation in the Black Sea area and of next month's meeting in Bucharest within the framework of the International Forum of Crans Montana. Demirel said that the friendship between Turkey and Romania does not harm anybody and added that it is most important to ensure stability in our countries and throughout the region.

Similarly, President Demirel wished to stress the extremely important mission incumbent on our countries, namely, to be a bridge connecting Europe and Asia. In reply to journalists' questions, the Turkish president declared that he welcomed the U.S. initiative in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a way to stop the bloodshed, regardless of which sides might cause it. President Demirel also said that he did not understand the international opposition to having Turkish soldiers sent to Bosnia within the framework of the peacekeeping forces, given that this is a decision made by the United Nations. In turn, President Ion Iliescu said that Romania will not send soldiers to the peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia in view of the UN decision stipulating that direct neighbors should not contribute to the peacekeeping forces. During the news conference the Turkish president mentioned that he had invited Romania's president to pay an official visit to Turkey, and Ion Iliescu had accepted the invitation with pleasure.
