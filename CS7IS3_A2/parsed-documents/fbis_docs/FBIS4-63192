However, Boris Yeltsin does not intend to yield to lobbying and to permit its sharp rise: such a disbalance is fraught with an increase in social tension. The press secretary called attention to the fact that "communist-Zhirinovskiy opposition", speaking in words about their loyalty to the army, voted at the Russian parliament lower house for a minimum defence budget for tactical reasons. According to Kostikov, it wants to give hand-outs to the army, causing dissatisfaction there, and to put it at loggerheads with the president. Kostikov also expressed the president's concern over the continued campaign in some media against Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. "The president does not see clearly reasons behind it. There are no real grounds to say that there is misunderstanding between the president and the defence minister," he stressed. "The president declares his full political and moral support for Pavel Grachev. But at the same time, he does not want to show that he has no serious claims to the minister," Kostikov continued, adding that Yeltsin is not satisfied with progress of the military reform.
