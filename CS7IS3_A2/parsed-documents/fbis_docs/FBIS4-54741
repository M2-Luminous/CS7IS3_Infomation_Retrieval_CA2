FBIS4-54741 "dreeu086__a94034" FBIS-EEU-94-086-A Daily Report 3 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Hungarian Leader Calls For `Triple Coalition' Hungarian Leader Calls For `Triple Coalition' AU0305173894 Prague CTK in English 1438 GMT 3 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0305173894 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) Bela Bugar expressed today his party's maximum effort to run in elections in a triple coalition with the Egyutteles movement and the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS), two other parties of ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia. "We want no Hungarian vote to be lost and left-wing forces to win in Slovakia," Bugar said. He added that the "left wing" means the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS, led by ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar), not the coalition Democratic Left Party (SDL). The MKDH's partner -- the Egyutteles movement -- has not approved as yet the extension of the ethnic Hungarian coalition by the MOS, which, according to polls, is supported by less than one percent of the voters. The MKDH-Egyutteles coalition can rely on seven to nine percent of the voters. Commenting on the alleged problem of one minister of the present government coalition with the screening law, Bugar said his MKDH would never support a government wanting to rescue its positively screened member at any cost. "If the speculations are confirmed, the minister must quit," Bugar emphasized. The screening law, passed by the Czechoslovak parliament in 1991, bars people linked to the former communist-run StB secret police, high Communist Party officials and members of the People's Militia from high government and economic posts until 1996. The screening procedure is carried out by the Interior Ministry which issues certificates on whether or not a person was among those listed by the law. Speculations on the screening purity of one of the cabinet members, allegedly representative of the SDL, emerged in the press on Monday [2 May]. The Hungarian coalition is not directly represented in the cabinet of Jozef Moravcik, but its support made possible this government's birth. Bugar also pointed to the destructive methods applied by the ex-Prime Minister's HZDS in the parliament since the fall of the Meciar's government. According to Bugar, Meciar himself has called on his deputies to propose the dismissal of one cabinet member at each parliamentary session. The HZDS will always collect the 30 signatures necessary for opening discussion on the issue in parliament. This method aims to discredit parliament and "make the impression that it is unable to take positive steps," Bugar stressed. Bugar's MKDH has five deputies in the 150-seat Slovak parliament.
