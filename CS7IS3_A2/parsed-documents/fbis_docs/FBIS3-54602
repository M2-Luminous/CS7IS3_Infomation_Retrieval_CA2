This announcement of the stance of the Zionist regime has once again contradicted Yasir 'Arafat's optimism. 'Arafat had hoped that after the Zionist regime's violation of its earlier promise to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho, he would be able to be in charge of the internal affairs of the Gaza-Jericho autonomous region within the next month and a half. Mockingly, Rabin said that one should congratulate an optimistic person such as Yasir 'Arafat. The prime minister of the Zionist regime has indirectly admitted that there is a feeling of disappointment and despair among the Palestinians regarding the process of the compromise. However, the disappointment and despair of the Palestinians is a double-edged sword, one side of which is turned towards 'Arafat and the other is aimed against the Zionist regime. When 'Arafat signed the autonomy accord, he portrayed a false picture of it for the Palestinians who were under the oppression of the Zionist regime. He tried to give rise to this false hope that after decades of struggle there would be a Palestinian state, at least within the limited area of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and that the noble Qods [Jerusalem] would be the capital of the Palestinian state. In addition to that, with the creation of a Palestinian state, the Palestinian refugees would be able to return to their land and all Palestinians prisoners would be set free. However, now, four months after the signing of the accord and after the shattering of the veils of deception and the crushing of the weak foundations of the hope built upon 'Arafat's false promises, all that is left of the accord is despair and despondency among the Palestinians. This has led to an escalation of the Islamic intifadah of the Palestinians. 'Arafat has lost most of his popular and administrative support, as well as his political and revolutionary legitimacy, without having in practice gained anything from Israel. In the same way, Israel has lost many of its winning cards without being able to ensure the security of the occupiers and without harming the intifadah whose flames she has tried very hard to extinguish. In fact, Israel's strongest card, which has now been used and has been made worthless, is 'Arafat himself. Now it has been made clear to the Palestinians that, contrary to the false hopes that 'Arafat had aroused, there will be no Palestinian state or government as the result of the autonomy accord. Israel, which has used the size of the Jericho region as an excuse for the nonimplementation of the accord, will never give up other occupied territories including the West Bank and noble Qods. Furthermore, Zionist settlements will remain in the autonomous regions as the military outposts of the occupying regime and as bases for ensuring the continued military and political presence of that regime. Communications between the autonomous region and the outside world will also continue to be under the control and supervision of the Zionist regime. As regards 'Arafat's occasional statements about Jerusalem being the capital of the Palestinian state, it is sufficient to refer to Rabin's warnings and his arrogant telling off of 'Arafat during the talks in Cairo to make it clear that it has been nothing but a propaganda ploy by 'Arafat. The fact that on the basis of the accord the return of many millions of Palestinian refugees who left the occupied territories in 1948 is out of the question, and that the return of the refugees who left in 1967 is also conditional, demonstrates that the Gaza- Jericho Accord was indeed signed against the interests of several million Palestinian refugees. Now, there is only 'Arafat, Israel, and many dashed hopes. Israel is trying to ensure the security of the occupiers at the expense of all those dashed hopes. Consequently, she refrains from withdrawing by resorting to various excuses. However, this has further inflamed the rage of the Palestinians and has further intensified the intifadah, as a result of which the prospects for the security of the occupying regime have also become much dimmer. The approach of the Palestinian strugglers has even encouraged the members of 'Arafat's Fatah movement to gradually separate their paths from that of 'Arafat and to turn toward the successful experiment of the Islamic intifadah.
