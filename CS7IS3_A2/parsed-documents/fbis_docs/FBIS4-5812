Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, said his panel will provide options such as a hike in the controversial consumption tax, an increase in social insurance premiums or no raise in social security costs to meet an aging society. "But it will be understood naturally the best way is a raise in the consumption tax," Kato said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The issue of how to respond to the nation's aging population with tax measures has been in the spotlight for some time. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed two months ago to sell a proposal to introduce a national welfare tax to fund more than welfare alone. The Finance Ministry has been pushing for a hike in the consumption tax as a way to raise funds to meet the needs of an aging society. Kato is viewed as close to Finance Ministry bureaucrats. Kato, a professor emeritus at Keio University, also points to the need to implement administrative and fiscal reforms and to rectify the heavy dependence on direct taxes for state revenue. But Kato said no one can expect administrative and fiscal reforms to save government spending in the short run, and a sweeping reform of the so-called unfair taxation system could result in additional tax revenue of only 1 trillion yen. As for a local consumption tax proposed by the Home Affairs Ministry, Kato said he would like to discuss it in the form of a possible retail tax instead. He also said his panel will take up the issue of whether or when to introduce a taxpayers' numbering system. "It's no good to say just 'we'll consider it.' I hope to draw a conclusion on the issue, including whether to introduce it, by setting a deadline," he said.
