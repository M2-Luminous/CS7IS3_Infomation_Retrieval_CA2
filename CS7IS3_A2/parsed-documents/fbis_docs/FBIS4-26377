After the secretary for civil service affairs made the announcement, the overseas civil servants revealed more inside stories. It was said that the Hong Kong Government had promised to pay compensation to A- and B-class expatriate officials in the policy-making branches who could not be promoted. As the expatriate officials in the policy-making branches will be forced to retire ahead of the retirement age or will not be promoted, they will bring a suit against the Government, which has harmed their "human rights." The suit brought by the overseas civil servants against the Hong Kong Government was based on the "Human Rights Act" formulated by the Hong Kong Government. They held that taking legal action against the government on the basis of the new act certainly would drive the Government into an awkward predicament in the proceedings. Such handling of the personnel arrangements for secretary-level officials by the Hong Kong Government obviously was a deliberate ploy to leave some loopholes so that excuses could be found to make compensation before its power comes to an end. The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the administration of the British Hong Kong Government will come to an end on 30 June 1997; and the Basic Law stipulates that the secretary-level officials will be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of Hong Kong. Therefore, the British Hong Kong Government cannot sign any employment contracts with expatriate civil servants which extend beyond 1997. Moreover, the Hong Kong Government has long announced its civil service localization policy. When Edward Youde and David Wilson were governors, local Chinese officials were promoted to be branch secretaries and department directors. This fact never aroused any controversy. However, after Chris Patten took the governorship in 1992, the Hong Kong Government took such measures as the naturalization of expatriate civil servants and the adoption of the Human Rights Act, and this thus led to the troublesome legal proceedings taken by the expatriate civil servants against the government. Why did the expatriate officials at the posts of branch secretary and department director obediently retire without taking legal proceedings before Patten took the governorship? There were two reasons. First, according to the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, all officials must obey the governor, and the governor does not need to give any explanation when deciding to promote or not to promote any official, or to require any official to retire. Second, all expatriate civil servants signed employment contracts that did not extend beyond 1997, and the contracts were normally two-year or four-year ones. Moreover, the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions were constitutional documents, which naturally took precedence over any local legislation. According to newspaper reports in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Government and the secretary-level expatriate officials have reached a secret agreement, and the government will pay HK$2.9 million in compensation to them. The local public was not consulted before this arrangement was made, and the Legislative Council was not briefed. After this is made a fait accompli, Hong Kong taxpayers will be forced to pay the bill without an opportunity to say no. According to usual practice, if the employment contract of an expatriate civil servant is not to be renewed, the government will give notice 10 months ahead of its expiration. Once the contract expires, the expatriate civil servant will have to leave office, and the government will not have to pay any compensation. In the current cases, however, some expatriate officials received the relevant notices 18 months ahead of the expiration of their employment contracts, and they had sufficient time to seek new jobs in private institutions. How could they be paid special compensation, or bring a suit in court? Will the expatriate civil servants whose employment contracts were not renewed before Patten took office also take similar legal proceedings so as to claim compensation? If no compensation is paid to the latter, how will the Hong Kong Government justify its double standard? In the Common Law areas, the expiration of the employment contracts indicates the termination of the employment relationship between the employer and the employee, and there exists no issue of compensation. Now the Hong Kong Government is showing its "generosity" by bestowing the Hong Kong people's money in violation of legal principles and standard practice, and without regard for the interests of Hong Kong people. The present state of affairs shows that the "Human Rights Act" is a carefully calculated plan of the British Hong Kong authorities ahead of their withdrawal. On the surface, the act was aimed at guaranteeing Hong Kong people's human rights; in reality, it served some different purposes. According to the "Human Rights Act," those who try to evade taxes or dodge their creditors may flee Hong Kong without being held up by the court and without being detained. What a disorderly situation will this cause! From the Hong Kong Government's plan for the naturalization of the expatriate civil servants to the arrangement for huge amounts of compensation for expatriate civil servants who leave office after the expiration of their employment contracts -- all these facts show how the colonial rulers are using public office for private gain. The Hong Kong people now are worried that the expatriate officials in the Mass Transit Rail Corporation, the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, and the Provisional Airport Authority will follow the example of the expatriate government officials in taking away a huge amount of compensation before 1997.
