Politicians should react calmly to what the military do in the interests of enhancing combat training. This is the opinion of Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. Today in an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent he stressed that every politician should strive to enhance the army's combat readiness and for this every means is important, including the possibility of cooperating with another army. That is why he believes it is expedient to hold Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises at the Totsk training ground in Orenburg oblast. Answering to those opposing the exercises, who are indignant that "Yankee feet should step" on Russian soil, Vladimir Shumeyko said that in this case "not an aggressor, but an ally is stepping on our soil."
