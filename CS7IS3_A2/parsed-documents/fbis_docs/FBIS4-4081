He said: On the whole, our province's economy operated normally in the first quarter of the year, and was characterized mainly by the following facts: spring plowing got off to a good start; production of grain and edible oil was stable; industrial production maintained a momentum of comparatively rapid growth; fueled by key construction projects, fixed-asset investment increased quite rapidly; the consumer goods market grew steadily; the financial situation was fairly stable; money lending was put under strict control; and in foreign trade, the volume of exports was higher than in the same period last year. With regard to the problems cropping up in current economic operation, the spokesman said: The chief reasons are that commodity prices have climbed continuously; state-owned enterprises have been beset with difficulties in production and operation; and a relatively great number of enterprises has partially or completely suspended production. The provincial statistics bureau suggested that to promote the development of the province's national economy and attain the goals set by the provincial party committee for this year: 1. It is necessary to develop markets, maintain rapid and effective economic growth, closely follow market changes and developments, do a good job in readjusting the product mix by gearing to market demand, organize production by centering on the market, make greater efforts to promote sales, and ensure that production is linked with sales and that the economy develops rapidly and effectively. 2. It is necessary to strengthen price supervision and inspection, and to curb excessively rapid price increases. Apart from strengthening price supervision and inspection, establishing a system under which goods are sold at the prices marked, and maintaining a normal price order, the province should focus on increasing residents' income, properly developing production of agricultural means of production and the Shopping Basket Project, and should ensure a stable supply of basic daily-use consumer goods so as the boost residents' capability to withstand the strains resulting from price reform. 3. It is necessary to revitalize state-owned enterprises and energetically help them get out of the present depressing situation. For this purpose: 1) We should focus our efforts on alleviating the problem of fund strains among enterprises, ensure the supply of enterprise production funds, and establish a normal production and operation order; 2) In order to create favorable conditions for state-owned enterprises to develop, we should study and solve the problem of essentially increased tax burdens resulting from the policy of regulating tax reductions and exemptions which was implemented among enterprises following the introduction of tax reform. 4. It is necessary to make great efforts to help loss-making enterprises turn losses into profits, and help enterprises that have partially or completely suspended production to increase their ability to overcome adversity through greater production; gradually to accumulate experience by conducting experiments in selling and leasing small enterprises, and introducing the reform of allowing state-owned enterprises to be run by the non-governmental sector; and to improve operational regulations so as to deepen enterprise reform.
