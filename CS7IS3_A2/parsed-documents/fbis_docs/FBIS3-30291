This aide memoire has been signed by UDMR President Bela Marko and Executive President Csaba Takacs, the UDMR press bureau reports. The document emphasizes that the UDMR supports, without reservation, the recommendations made by the Council of Europe, which it views as mandatory in the democratic transformation process that is taking place in Romanian society. The aide memoire sent to the rapporteurs for Romania in the Council of Europe divides the recommendations into four categories to which Romania has pledged to abide, but in the implementation of which certain political forces -- that is Romania's Government -- do not manifest the necessary political will: the signing and ratification of certain international accords; problems regarding rights of ethnic minorities; legislative problems; and the law-governed state. Without claiming to exhaust all problems, the document lists those problems that, according to the UDMR, are expected to be solved: Use of the mother tongue in the administration, justice, and education of all grades; use of bilingual inscriptions; ensuring equal chances for the assertion in the economy, especially in the area of privatization; adoption of the law on ethnic minorities and of the education law; separation of the powers in the state; the independence of the judicial power; decentralization; restitution of nationalized church properties; the genuine independence of the audiovisual media; the urgent solution of the situation of those who have been sentenced on ethnic grounds; and so forth. The UDMR believes that the solution of these problems is indispensable for Romania's integration into European structures and expresses the hope that the international body -- the Council of Europe -- which has shown trust in Romania by admitting it as a member with full rights will seek more efficient ways and means to enable it to support our country, so that Romania can be integrated in European structures, the UDMR emphasizes, as cited by ROMPRES.
