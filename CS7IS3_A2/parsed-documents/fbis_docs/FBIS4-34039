It is an unfounded assertion, stated Vatican spokesman (Joaquin Navarro). It should be recalled that on 13 June, the Information Ministry announced the Vatican signed an agreement on 27 May to supply 75,000 tons of wheat, worth $32 million, with the provisional government of Judge Emile Jonassaint. According to the Ministry, this agreement was signed in Italy by the foreign minister and by Charles David for the Jonassaint government. The Vatican's spokesman, (Joaquin Navarro), asserted, however, that no political representative from Haiti was received in the Vatican.
