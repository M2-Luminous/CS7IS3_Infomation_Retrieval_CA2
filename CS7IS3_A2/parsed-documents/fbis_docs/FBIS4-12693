FBIS4-12693 "drnes070_l_94012" FBIS-NES-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Shamgar Commission Hears Testimony of Waqf Guards Shamgar Commission Hears Testimony of Waqf Guards TA1004134894 TA1004134894 BFN [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1030 GMT on 10 April reports that "Waqf official Muhammad Abu-Salah testified this morning before the Hebron massacre commission of inquiry that Barukh Goldstein struck him to the floor when he tried to stop him from entering the Muslim prayer hall. Three Waqf officials are testifying today after being ordered to do so after they initially refused." Later in the report, Qol Yisra'el notes that "Muhammad Abu-Salah said Goldstein had caused some problems in the past, but not as much as other settlers. He had refused to leave the Muslim section when asked to by Waqf officials but no specific complaint had been made against him." Abu-Salah said that "he had tried to stop Goldstein entering the Muslim hall on the morning of the massacre. Goldstein said: `I am an officer,' pointing to his officer's insignia. Abu-Salah said he was still not allowed in and Goldstein hit him with his rifle. Abu-Salah fell to the ground and Goldstein walked past him and opened fire on the worshipers." The first Waqf official to testify, 'Isma'il al-Shilmun, said he had seen Goldstein a few times in the past, although he was not one of the regular Jewish worshipers. He said Goldstein was the only person to fire shots at the Muslim worshipers. Al-Shilmun admitted that there were only six Waqf guards on duty at the time of the massacre instead of eight. He described a history of tension and acts of provocation by Jewish worshipers and claimed that on numerous occasions he had informed the military governor and Civil Administration officials but nothing was done to change the situation. According to al-Shilmun, in the past Jews poured acid or placed sharp objects on the Muslim prayer mats, offered the Muslims alcohol, and repeatedly shouted insults and opened the door dividing the Jewish and Muslim sections before the allotted time. On the night before the massacre, the settlers celebrating Purim told the Muslims to drink wine, threw a toy grenade, and shouted out such things as `this is our land and you are our dogs.' Muslims responded with shouts of al-Qassam, al-Qassam -- after the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam terrorists -- and God is Great. The Waqf officials denied that there were chants of Kill the Jews. Al-Shilmun said that some of the Jewish worshipers came to pray without provocation and respected the sanctity of the place. He also said that some of the officers in charge of the site were strict with the settlers and clamped down on any provocations, but others were less strict and failed to act against the settlers. Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 10 April, in a similar report on the commission hearings, adds: "the three Waqf officials testified that they did not see another man with Barukh Goldstein. One of the guards leveled sharp complaints against Dov Stelman, the Army commander at the Cave of the Patriarchs, and said that tensions between Muslims and Jews had risen sharply after Stelman's assignment to the post. Contradictions were found between one guard's testimony today and his original statement to the police. The guard, Muhammad Sulayman Abu-Salah, told the police that he had seen four soldiers and an officer outside the prayer hall, but told the Shamgar Commission that he had not seen any soldiers."
