Addressing the rally, SDS leader Filip Dimitrov said the union will use all parliamentary means to make the cabinet step down. He called upon the people to flood into the central square and remain there until the cabinet resigns in case the parliamentary means prove ineffective. The demonstrators chanted their approval. "The Communists (the successor to the disbanded Bulgarian Communist Party is the Bulgarian Socialist Party) are ruling this country, pulling the strings of straw man Berov (the prime Minister)," said Ivan Kostov, MP of the SDS and former finance minister. "The choice is elections provoked by the SDS. Only the force that can bring about elections can be sure of winning them in this chaos," said Kostov. SDS floor leader Stefan Savov said the SDS needed to poll not 35 percent but 51 percent of the vote to form a strong government. The SDS scored a 34.6 percent victory at the 1991 polls, which was not enough to form a stable cabinet. The speakers charged the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and the New Union for Democracy with allying themselves with the Communists by backing the present government. President Zhelev was also accused of helping form the cabinet and supporting it so far. For the first time at the rally, new songs written especially for the SDS election campaign were performed. The speakers called on people not to despair and go to the polls. The rally chanted the name of exiled Bulgarian King Simeon and sang the old Bulgarian anthem (from the monarchy days) banned by the communist regime.
