A few weeks ago, Taloustutkimus saw the SDP rise already beginning to culminate and turn downward. Now the situation has returned to the earlier trend. Support figures for the SDP as measured by both leading polling organizations, Finnish Gallup Oy and Taloustutkimus Oy, are quite similar. The Finnish Gallup poll for March showed the SDP at 34.1 percent, and the poll conducted by Taloustutkimus in the March-April time frame was 33.6 percent. The margin of error in the results is around 2 points upward or downward, meaning that in practice the organizations' figures are the same. The most recent Taloustutkimus poll was based on interviews conducted from 11 March through 17 April. The were some 1,800 voters interviewed. This poll was commissioned by the national daily SUOMENMAA. Support for the Center Party in the poll remained around the same figures as previous months. It is now 18.3 percent. The Conservative Party may have even dropped a little since early March; its support was calculated at 17.5 percent. Accordingly, the Center Party in this poll went ahead of the Conservatives. There were no great gyrations in support for any party. Taloustutkimus shows the problem-ridden Rural Party at 1.5 percent. Taloustutkimus also asked whether Esko Aho's government should now resign. Of the 500 respondents, 37 percent answered "yes." In January the "yes" replies amounted to 43 percent. In practice there may have been little change, since the margin of error with this small a sampling is around 4 percent.
