The charge informed ministry officials that on February 27th at about 2300 [2200 GMT] hours during a normal check of a car with Yugoslav plates in the village of Zelenovice of Ulqin district, police arrested Zeqo and Beqiri because they had no visas for Yugoslavia. They apparently had entered Yugoslavia illegally by crossing Lake of Shkoder by boat. On March 4, the Albanian Government demanded that the Yugoslav authorities describe the conditions of the detainees and say what measures have been taken against them, but Yugoslav Embassy had no further information. The Albanians have lodged a protest demanding that visas be issued for three persons who are supposed to be in touch with the arrested men. At the same time the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade was informed, and the charge d'affaires was sent to Montenegro immediately. Several demands have been sent to the Yugoslav Embassy in Tirana, but so far no news has been received about the arrested men and no visas have been issued to those who like to visit them.
