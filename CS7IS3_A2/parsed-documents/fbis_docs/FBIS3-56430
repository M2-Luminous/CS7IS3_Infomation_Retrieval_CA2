He said the reason for his position is that decisions have recently been taken in the government "in a way in which I took no part and with which I categorically disagreed." Yegor Gaydar gave just two examples: the signing of an Interbank agreement uniting the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, and also the government's decision to construct a new building for parliament (the provisional cost of which is nearly $500 million). "I cannot simultaneously be in the government and also in the opposition. I cannot be responsible for the reforms without being able to avert actions like those that have been mentioned here and without having the necessary levers to consistently pursue an economic policy of whose correctness I am convinced," Yegor Gaydar said. "Therefore, I deeply regret that I am forced to decline the post of first deputy prime minister that has been offered me."
