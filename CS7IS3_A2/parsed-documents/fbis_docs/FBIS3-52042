Taking a break during the presidential visit to Leticia, [a Colombian city] on the Brazilian border, Correa stressed: "There is a nationwide phenomenon, seeking purity and clarity in public affairs." He mused: "The Judicial Branch judges citizens. If they were to conduct an investigation, an inquest ..." In Brasilia, Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal Party-Para State], the chairman of the budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee], endorsed the idea of a "self-examination" by the Judicial Branch, but reminded that this branch has considered such a proposal offensive. Passarinho noted: "If we want Brazil to bathe in ethics, it should not just take place in the Legislative Branch." He added that the Judicial Branch auditing office [corregedoria] should operate more clearly and thus facilitate monitoring by public opinion. He complained: "The Brazilian judicial system operates like a corporation." Minister Mauricio Correa stated that the three branches are independent and that the formation of a commission to investigate probable irregularities in the Judicial Branch would have to be decided by the courts themselves. Recalling the irregularities committed the INSS [National Social Security Institute] judges, Correa said: "Such an initiative would be welcomed by society." Mauricio Correa emphasized that, as a senator, he favors the formation of a commission outside the Judicial Branch to control it, adding that he has not considered it in the name of the government.
