Ludmila Muskova (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS) told the plenum shortly after 1600 that deputies for the HZDS and the Slovak National Party [SNS] had been discriminated against at yesterday's meeting of the parliamentary culture committee because they did not receive background documentation for a discussion on the statutes of the Slovak Television Council. [passage omitted] Subsequently, a part of opposition deputies did not present themselves during a vote and NRSR Deputy Chairman Peter Weiss (Party of the Democratic Left, SDL), who chaired the meeting, had to declare the meeting closed because Parliament did not have a quorum. At the outset of its meeting yesterday, the NRSR took note of the Slovak Prosecutor General's report on the state of legality in 1993. [passage omitted] Subsequently, deputies decided with final validity on the fate of the NRSR law of 18 February 1993 on the payment of the state compensatory allowance and child allowances. The fate of this law has been undecided for more than a year after, on 1 March 1993, then Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar returned the law to the NRSR for another discussion because it did not place families under the obligation to furnish evidence of the level of their income. On 22 February 1994 the Slovak Constitutional Court confirmed the validity of the law's return and Parliament therefore discussed the law anew yesterday. Opening the debate on the law, Minister of Labor, Social Affairs, and the Family Julius Brocka (who, as deputy, had submitted the original draft) said that, at the time of its submission, the aim of the bill was to speed up the drafting of a new, more equitable, and more specifically targeted law on child allowances. According to Brocka, the government has already prepared the draft of such a new law and the law of 18 February 1993 has therefore lost justification and Parliament should reject it. After polemical statements by some opposition deputies, the NRSR finally abolished the returned law. [passage omitted] After the lunch break, the plenum elected by secret ballot Jozef Kosnar (SDL) as chairman of the NRSR National Economic and Budget Committee and Bohumil Kacmar (Democratic Union of Slovakia, DEUS) as chairman of the NRSR Committee for Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management. Stefan Kvietik (National Democratic Party-New Alternative) became chairman of the NRSR Committee for Education, Science, and Culture, after Marian Andel (SNS) failed in the vote. Parliament also elected new members of its commission that deals with the problems of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros system of hydroelectric power projects. Jan Weis (SDL) was elected chairman of the commission and Jan Krivcik (Christian Democratic Movement) and Jozef Prokes (SNS) were elected commission members. Subsequently, at a closed meeting, the deputies assessed a report on the submission of political parties' and movements' annual reports on their financial management in 1993 and agreed with its being made public. Of the 54 registered parties and movements, 13 failed to submit their annual reports to Parliament. [passage omitted covered by referent item] The report states that, in contravention of the law, several political entities did not announce the names of donors who had donated one-time gifts with a value of more than 10,000 korunas or a total of more than 50,000 korunas in the course of the whole year. Parliament's report did not specify, however, which parties did not meet this obligation. [passage omitted] After the discussion of annual financial reports, Parliament was supposed to vote on supplementing the parliamentary commission for supervising the activity of the Slovak Information Service. Because of the incident described above, however, the meeting was suspended and is to continue today.
