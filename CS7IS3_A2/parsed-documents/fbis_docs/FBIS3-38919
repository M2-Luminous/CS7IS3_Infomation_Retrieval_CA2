The initial reaction by the West to the Saturday tragedy proved that the dynamic of a blunt clash, of a "dirty war," could at any time upset the priorities and planning of diplomacy: The open wound of the battlefront in the besieged Bosnian capital means not only terror and blood for the civilian population but, at the same time, it is a time bomb capable of blowing up all that has been achieved through difficult negotiations among the three opposing sides. Therefore, defusing this time bomb becomes an urgent priority. The fact that not only the international community but also the Serbian leaders in Bosnia seem to realize this is a message of optimism. At the same time, it is obvious that every time the strong ones in the West are obliged to deal with the feasibility of a military intervention in Bosnia, an open war front, they add to the repercussions of every decision they make the potential confrontation fronts in the Balkan south. It is clear that even hostilities on the most limited scale against Serbian targets would give a "green light" to all those who like to revise the status quo that was formulated with the Bucharest treaty in 1913: The vision of a Greater Albania and a Greater Bulgaria, and Ankara's irredentist legacies [ipothikes] in Bulgaria would cease to be the "worst possible scenario" of the NATO staff maneuvers on paper and would become the result of an uncontrolled Balkan complication. Of course, the planning with which the "12" foreign ministers yesterday approached the dramatic developments in Bosnia does not mean that the nightmare of a general conflagration in the Balkans has been removed once and for all. This likelihood will remain open until a final settlement, with the guarantee of the international community, of the pending issues that emerged from the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation.
