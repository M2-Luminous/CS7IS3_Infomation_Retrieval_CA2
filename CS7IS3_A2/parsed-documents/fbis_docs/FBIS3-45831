Liu Jiang said at a national conference on agricultural work here: In order to further deepen rural reform to cultivate markets, all localities should seriously explore the following this year: -- It is necessary to accelerate the reform of the circulation system and the construction of markets for agricultural products. Beginning this year, the state will adopt a series of policies and measures to promote reform of the agricultural product circulation system, with emphasis on reform of the grain purchase and marketing system. All localities and agricultural departments should step up investigation and study and promote the implementation of these policies. The emphasis in building markets for farm products should be put on the wholesale markets and on making the central wholesale markets, regional wholesale markets, and urban and rural farm product markets become gradually better coordinated. All localities should integrate the implementation of the "shopping basket" program with the development of wholesale markets for selected farm products in production areas. At the same time, it is also necessary to build wholesale markets for agricultural and sideline products in marketing areas. In addition, all localities should actively explore the cultivation and construction of markets for production elements. In particular, attention should be paid to building a rural workforce market to ensure a rational and orderly workforce flow. -- It is necessary to promote an integrated operation of trade, industry and agriculture. The integrated operation of trade, industry and agriculture is an inevitable trend of agricultural development and rural economic development. When an agricultural institution runs an economic entity, it should do all it can to become an integrated trade-industry-agriculture operation. It should constantly expand its area of service and set up various stations and workshops to serve farming households. In running village and town enterprises, particularly those processing agricultural and sideline products, we should develop integrated trade-industry-agriculture operations and set up economic associations and enterprise groups featuring strong industries, famous-brand products, or backbone enterprises. We should popularize development by letting market forces guide production bases and linking production bases with farming households, and we should gradually develop one socialized service for regionalized crop cultivation, specialized production, and integrated operation. In short, we should develop various forms of integrated trade- industry-agriculture organization to link the small-scale production of farming households with the big markets. -- It is necessary to perfect the basic rural operation system. The central authorities have decided to extend current agricultural land contracts for 30 more years and permit compensated transfer of the right to land use according to law. All localities and agricultural departments should provide good guidance in this regard. At present, we should pay attention to two problems. One is that we must not use any pretext to cancel or change the contracts before they expire. The other is that we must not arbitrarily increase fees for contractual operations, nor increase the peasants' burden in a disguised form. We should also promote timely reform of the animal husbandry system this year, with the emphasis on implementing the compensated grassland contract responsibility system. -- It is necessary to actively develop the rural share-holding cooperative system. The share-holding cooperative system is a new form of property right created by peasants in recent years. We should actively support it, provide correct guidance for it, and gradually standardize it. -- It is necessary to promote healthy development of the rural cooperative foundations. Agricultural management departments at all levels should, as always, guide and support the development of rural cooperative foundations. Correct guidance should be provided to solve problems accompanying the development of some rural cooperative foundations. Existing regulations should be applied to govern the development of the rural cooperative foundations. -- It is necessary to accelerate the reform of state-owned agricultural enterprises. At present, state-owned agricultural enterprises generally have problems such as inflexible operational mechanisms, weakness in adapting to market demand, and low economic efficiency. We should increase the weight of reform. All localities should pay more attention to the central link -- invigorating operational mechanisms -- and enhance the self- development and ability to compete in the market of those enterprises. It is necessary to broaden the concept of reform in accordance with the requirements of the modern enterprise system, and to take greater steps to reform the system of property rights. In reform of small enterprises which operate on small profits or even losses, we should boldly introduce the leasing system, reorganize them into share-holding cooperative firms, or sell them through auction. State-owned land reclamation enterprises should continue to stabilize and improve the agricultural operation system of "small farms within big farm." At the same time, they should actively practice the land lease system on a trial basis. Liu Jiang also emphasized: To meet the needs of deepened rural reform, we should enrich the contents of the experiment on rural reform experimental zones, properly readjust their geographical distribution, and do an even better job in integrating experimental reform with economic development.
