In an article by Nuri al-Marsumi published today, the newspaper says that this conspiracy is being carried out within the systematic conspiracies and aggressions against the Arab world, starting with the aggression against Iraq -- the aggression by the United States, NATO, and the agent regimes. The newspaper adds that after Iraq, Yemen is the most important of the countries that reject aggression and dependence. Yemen's success in overcoming economic problems and entrenching unity will certainly constitute a shining light that frightens the Saudi rulers and their masters. The paper says that these rulers had been much provoked and the moment the unity [agreement] was signed, long before 2 August 1990, mobilized their forces against Iraq, Yemen, and Jordan. The newspaper emphasized that the declaration of secession is a crime whose destructive results are no less than the first secessionist crime in the Arab history in 1961 [between Syria and Egypt]. Concluding its article, the newspaper said: The socialists have gone too far in coordinating with the suspect rulers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. They forgot principles and history. Before that, they forgot that they are no more than tools to destroy their homeland and future.
