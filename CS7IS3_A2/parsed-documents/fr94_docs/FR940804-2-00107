FR940804-2-00107 FR940804-2-00060 Bureau of Reclamation Information Collection Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act The proposal for the collection of information reproduced below has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). An expedited review has been requested in accordance with the Act, since allowing for the normal review period would adversely affect the public interest for the reasons given below. Approval has been requested by July 30, 1994. Comments and suggestions on the proposal should be made directly to the bureau clearance officer listed below and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1006&hyph;XXXX), Washington DC 20503; Telephone 202&hyph;395&hyph;7340. Title: Glen Canyon Environmental Studies Passive-Use Values Study. OMB Approval Number: 1006&hyph;XXXX. Abstract: Individuals who may not physically use certain unique or significant resources may hold some value for their existence and preservation. Passive-use or non-use economic value is a monetary measure of this value. Studies completed under the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies Program have shown that the operation of Glen Canyon Dam affects downstream natural and cultural resources in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Grand Canyon National Park. If individuals hold passive-use value for resources affected by the timing and amount of the releases from the dam, the magnitude of these values could be influenced by changes in the way the dam is operated. A small (pilot) test survey was completed earlier (OMB clearance number 1006&hyph;0013). Data obtained during the pilot test supported the hypothesis that members of the general public hold passive-use value for these resources and that the magnitude of these values may change across operational alternatives. A full scale (final) survey is now proposed. Information for the final survey will be collected from a random sample of the U.S. population in an effort to quantify passive-use value for a range of dam operation strategies. This information will be available for use by decision makers as they assess the trade-offs between recreation benefits, power production benefits, and passive-use benefits associated with different strategies for operating Glen Canyon Dam. Reason for Expedited Review: Data collected under this information has been requested for possible consideration in reaching a Record of Decision on the final Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement (GCDEIS). The Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 stipulates the completion of the final GCDEIS by October 30, 1994. In order to meet this schedule, it will be necessary to begin survey administration as soon as clearance is obtained. Frequency: Once. Description of Respondents: Residents of the U.S., aged 18 or more. Estimated Completion Time: 1/2 hour. Responses: 5,950. Burden Hours: 2,975. Bureau Clearance Officer: Larry Schulz, 303&hyph;236&hyph;6769. Dated: July 13, 1994. Murlin Coffey, Chief, Supply and Services Division.
