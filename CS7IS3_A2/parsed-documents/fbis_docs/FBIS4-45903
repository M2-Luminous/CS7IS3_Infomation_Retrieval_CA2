Inger Stilling Pedersen of the Christian People's Party and Bjarne Orum of the Radical Liberals did not quite agree over when and how severely unsafe sex should be punished. But they did agree that an HIV-positive person who knowingly engages in sex without protection should be punished. [passage omitted] "We want to end this wanton recklessness. This is not criminalizing the AIDS disease," Olsen said after the meeting. Consequently, he has instructed his officials to determine how the penal code can be changed without having HIV-positive persons and AIDS-infected people in general criminalized by the politicians. Decriminalization was the motivation for Folketing's abolition of the law on sexually transmitted diseases in 1988. At the same time, however, it also eliminated the basis for punishing reckless sexual acts.
