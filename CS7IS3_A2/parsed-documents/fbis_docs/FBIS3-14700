He was interviewed by our party affairs correspondent Menashe Raz: [Begin recording] [Sharon] I think every effort should be made to avert an evacuation. I would like to urge all Israelis to engage in passive resistance to the evacuation. I am against harming IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers or the security forces in any way. I am speaking about passive resistance by tens of thousands of people, who should come empty-handed -- I stress, empty-handed, without any weapons whatsoever, because provocation of any kind should be prevented -- people who should persistently engage in resistance. If, God forbid, they manage to evacuate a certain place, tens of thousands of people should return there and resist the evacuation in a passive manner. In my view, right now this is the only, the ultimate move that can be undertaken against the insane actions of the government which is surrendering to PLO dictums -- although it says the decision was its own -- by evacuating Jews. [passage omitted] [Raz] Will you be there yourself, when the time comes? [Sharon] I will be there in person. [end recording]
