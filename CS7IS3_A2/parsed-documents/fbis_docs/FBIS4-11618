FBIS4-11618 "drlat083_t_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Venezuela President Appoints Central Bank President President Appoints Central Bank President PA2904034194 Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in Spanish 0048 GMT 29 Apr 94 PA2904034194 Caracas Venezolana de Television Network Spanish BFN [Address to the nation by President Rafael Caldera on the appointment of the new president of the Venezuelan Central Bank on 28 April; place not given --live or recorded] [Text] I have the satisfaction of delivering to the Venezuelan people news of great national interest. The crisis created following the resignation of Dr. Ruth de Krivoy as president of the Venezuelan Central Bank [BCV] has been admirably overcome. The crisis was resolved in two days and the Senate unanimously ratified the appointment of Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez to fill the vacancy caused by Dr. Krivoy's resignation. Current BCV law establishes that the president of the Republic appoints the BCV president, but this requires a two-thirds Senate vote. Of course, one would think that in a Congress as diverse as this one, where there could be so many opinions, it would be very difficult to reach this majority, and only after laborious efforts could the end be reached. There was awareness among parliamentary faction representatives and their concern coincided with the government's urgent need to make this decision in order to give full confidence to Venezuelans and foreigners who conduct economic transactions with our country through financial system operations. The BCV is a very important institution. It is an institution that is the working hub of the network essential to every country: the banking network, the financial system. Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez is a Venezuelan with broad experience in administrative services, in the BCV itself, and serving Pdvsa, Venezuelan Petroleum -- the institution most important to the country's economy. I must explain that he was presented while the dialogue was under way. He was not initially proposed by the government. Talks were begun, the proper atmosphere was created through dialogue, the names of many important Venezuelans were studied, but when the name of Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez surfaced, there was such a positive and stimulating response that the Senate, as I have already said, approved the appointment without a single dissenting vote; it was unanimous. This should give Venezuelans full confidence in our institutions. The feeling of strengthened institutions is reinforced. The national government guarantees full respect for the BCV's autonomy. We have had this respect in the past and we have it now. We had certain conceptual differences with Dr. Krivoy in the handling of the BCV. She felt that these differences warranted the decision she made. The BCV has always had the respect and the absolute assurance of the president. We expect a harmonious relationship, harmony that will only be set by Venezuela's interests -- the country's utmost interests, the interest of the productive sector and all participants in the country's economy. All my fellow countrymen can have this assurance. The presidents of the legislative chambers accompany me in reiterating to our country the confidence people should have that in moments of great difficulty there will always be a possibility and a need to understand one another because the bottom line is that we are all Venezuelans and for us, Venezuela's interest must come first and foremost, above any other interest. I ask my fellow countrymen to receive this news with pleasure. Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez at this moment is in London. He represents Venezuelan Petroleum's affairs in the UK and in other European countries. He has accepted the appointment and tomorrow he should return to Caracas to take up this delicate and important post. I have complete faith that in the midst of all the problems we are experiencing and despite the attitude of some people, who without realizing it, without caring what harm they can cause to the country, place their concerns and interests above the national interest. [sentence as heard] I believe that any financial unrest that may have been generated following the events of these past few days has been overcome in a truly marvelous way. The Senate president was telling me that this is the first time the Senate has made a unanimous decision. This is a good sign; this fills us with hope for Venezuela's future.
