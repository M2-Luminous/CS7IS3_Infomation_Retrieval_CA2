FR940627-2-00002 FR940627-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Office of the Secretary Price Undercutting of Domestic Swiss Cheese by Imported Swiss Cheese From Austria, Denmark, and Germany AGENCY: Department of Agriculture (USDA). ACTION: Notice. On May 18, 1994, the U.S. Department of Agriculture receive a complaint alleging price undercutting of domestic Swiss cheese in the United States by imported subsidized quota Swiss cheese produced in Austria, Denmark, and Germany. Under section 702 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;39), the Secretary of Agriculture must conduct an investigation and make a determination as to the validity of the allegations no later than 30 days after receiving a complaint. Based on the investigation of the Director of the Dairy, Livestock and Poultry Division, Foreign Agricultural Service, conducted pursuant to the regulations at 7 CFR 6.40&hyph;.44, I have determined that the duty-paid wholesale price during the period December 1993 through April 1994 in the New York-New Jersey market area was $1.55 per pound, $1.56 per pound, and $1.12 per pound for Swiss cheese blocks imported from Austria, Denmark, and Germany, respectively. I have also determined that during the same period in the same market area, the duty-paid wholesale price was $1.80 per pound and $1.69 per pound for cuts, slices, loaves, etc., of Swiss cheese imported from Denmark and Germany, respectively. During the same period in the same market area, I have determined that the price for Swiss cheese trims and end pieces imported from Austria was $1.37 per pound. In addition, I have determined that the domestic wholesale market price during the period December 1993 through April 1994 for U.S. produced Swiss cheese in the New York-New Jersey market area was $1.76 for blocks, $1.85 cuts, slices, loaves, etc., and $1.54 for trims and end pieces. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Department of Commerce, has determined that the average daily export restitution payment provided by the European Union during the investigation period was $0.74 per pound for Swiss cheese imported from Denmark and $0.73 per pound for Swiss cheese imported from Germany. In the case of subsidies provided by the Government of Austria export restitution payments ranged from $1.847 per pound to $2.261 per pound during the investigation period. I have, therefore, determined that price undercutting of U.S. produced Swiss cheese in the United States by imported subsidized quota Swiss cheese from Austria, Denmark, and Germany is taking place, and I have notified the United States Trade Representative accordingly. Done at Washington, D.C. this 21st day of June, 1994. Richard Rominger, Acting Secretary of Agriculture. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15503 Filed 6&hyph;22&hyph;94; 1:34 pm] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;10&hyph;M
