In selecting suitable investments, the Envirotech Partnership will focus on the following technology sectors, among others: alternate and renewable energy technologies; environmental and waste treatment technologies and services; energy efficiency technologies, processes and services; electrotechnologies used in the reduction of medical waste; technologies and processes promoting alternative energy for transportation; and other technologies related to improving the generation, transmission and delivery of electricity. The term of Envirotech Partnership shall be for 10 years from the date of the partnership agreement, subject to extension for up to two years upon agreement of the General Partner and limited partners holding 662/3% of the combined capital contributions of all limited partners. Subject to certain limitations set forth in the partnership agreement, the management, operation, and implementation of policy of the Envirotech Partnership will be vested exclusively in the General Partner.
