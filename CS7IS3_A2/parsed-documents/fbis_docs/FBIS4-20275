In a statement to BRT [Bayrak Radio and Television], Atun recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side took chances by displaying its goodwill when it accepted the package in principle so that the talks would continue. Atun added, however, that the advantages to the Turkish Cypriot side did not materialize in the package. Indicating that the Greek Cypriots changed the package to their favor, Atun said the Turkish Cypriot side's requests and concerns are always disregarded. Pointing out that the UN officials asked for other areas in addition to Maras [Varosha], Atun stressed that it is out of question to accept a package which is unacceptable to the people, in which embargoes are not eased, and in which there are no concrete gains for the Turkish Cypriot side.
