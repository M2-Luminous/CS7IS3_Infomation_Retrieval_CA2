At present, we should especially heighten vigilance against the possibility that while creating political confusion, some people might try to work in secrecy under the cover of nice words and fashionable "decorations" in an attempt to empty Kong Kong's economy by creating chaos. Li Ruihuan said: Over the past decade and more, compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao have made significant contributions to reform, opening to the outside world, and economic construction on the mainland. Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have made indelible contributions to the emergence of a situation on the mainland characterized by rapid economic growth and economic prosperity. Of course, stability and development on the mainland have also provided a reliable guarantee and forceful support for prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao. Stability and prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao cannot be separated from those on the mainland. With the approach of 1997 and 1999, this supplementary relationship between Hong Kong and Macao on the one hand and the mainland on the other will manifest itself more explicitly. Both Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and the people of the whole country should reach this consensus: It is necessary to closely link the stability and prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao with that on the mainland, to take it as our bounden duty to safeguard and promote stability and prosperity, and to do our utmost to contribute to such a cause. He said: Continued maintenance of stability and prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao is not only a political principle but also means the common economic interests of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and of the people of the whole country. After resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, the Chinese Government will, vigorously and yet prudently, handle issues concerning Hong Kong and Macao. All should rest assured regarding this question. Li Ruihuan pointed out: The British side must be held solely responsible for the suspension of Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong. Under the cover of democracy, the British side attempted to take advantage of its remaining years of colonial rule to create division and confusion in Hong Kong in a bid to hinder its peaceful transition, and to influence and manipulate Hong Kong's political situation after 1997 as much as possible. This is something we absolutely will not allow. We did not wish to see the talks break down, but it is not terrible now that they have, because there can only be two possibilities: You will not listen to what I say and I will not recognize what you do. After we resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, it is reasonable for us to end colonial rule and all arrangements not commensurate with the Basic Law. Regarding the issue of the political system, the important thing is we should all work together with one heart to make arrangements for work after 1997 to enable the Special Administrative Region's political framework to be formed quickly and to operate effectively. Li Ruihuan said: What is important now is that while we are concerned about the political question, we must not neglect the economic question. In the past, the colonialists openly carried out plundering, but they are now using a modern method of raking economic benefits. Hong Kong's money belongs to the people of Hong Kong. If they lower their vigilance, their money will be hallowed out, and economic confusion will result, thus leaving a huge financial burden for the future government of the special region and for Hong Kong compatriots. This matter merits serious attention, and we should prevent it from happening. He pointed out: The Chinese Government supports the construction of the new airport in Hong Kong, but the British Hong Kong Government has raised the construction cost to an unprecedented level in violation of the provisions in the relevant understanding reached between the governments of the two countries. It is possible to calculate how much money is needed for building an airport and how much is needed for reclaiming land from the sea. There are examples in the world we can follow. As the situation in Hong Kong is special, it is understandable that the construction cost may be somewhat higher, but as the cost of construction is exceptionally high, one cannot help thinking: Who are the contractors? Who is taking away the money? Finally, Li Ruihuan said: For years all of you here today have done a great deal in safeguarding the stability and prosperity of the Hong Kong and Macao areas. It is my hope that you will continue to work hard to make still greater contributions. I am convinced that with your unity and cooperation, and with the backing of the thriving motherland, Hong Kong's bright future is fully guaranteed.
