FR941221-0-00018 FR941221-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 520 and 556 Animal Drugs, Feeds, and Related Products; Albendazole Suspension AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a new animal drug application (NADA) filed by SmithKline Beecham Animal Health Products. The NADA provides for use of albendazole suspension (Valbazen ® ) as an anthelmintic in sheep. The regulations are also amended to establish a tolerance for albendazole residue in sheep liver. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Melanie R. Berson, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;135), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1643. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: SmithKline Beecham Animal Health Products, 1600 Paoli Pike, West Chester, PA 19380, filed NADA 140&hyph;934, which provides for oral use of a 4.55 percent albendazole suspension (Valbazen ® ) as an anthelmintic in sheep. It is used for removal and control of: Adult liver flukes; heads and segments of common and fringed tapeworms; adult and fourth stage larvae of certain stomach worms (brown stomach worm, barberpole worm, and small stomach worm); adult and fourth stage larvae of certain intestinal worms (thread-necked intestinal worm, Cooper's worm, bankrupt worm, nodular worm, and large-mouth bowel worm); and adult and larval stages of lungworms. The NADA is approved as of November 10, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.45a to reflect the approval. Additionally, the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 556.34 to establish a tolerance for albendazole residue in sheep liver. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)), this approval qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning November 10, 1994, because the application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
