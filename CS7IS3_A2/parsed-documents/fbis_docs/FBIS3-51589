Munoz met with Colombian Acting Defense Minister General Ramon Gil Bermudez and other ranking officers. General Jose Tagliaferro D'Lima, Venezuelan Army commander, and General Pedro Jose Romero Farias, Venezuelan National Guard [NG] commander, accompanied the defense minister on the trip to the Colombian city of Bucaramanga. Division General Jose de la Cruz Pineda, chief of the Directorate of Military Intelligence [DIM], and Brigadier General Fernan Eurroso Fuenmayor, chief of Cofan [expansion unknown], were on hand to welcome the Venezuelan mission. These two officers worked out the details of the agreements on the exchange of intelligence information between the two armed forces based on a draft prepared by DIM. The two ministers reviewed the work conducted by officers of the Colombian military and police forces and Venezuelan National Armed Forces [FAN] officers. They pledged to create a standing officers committee to review compliance and monitor the agreements signed. The committee will immediately handle any situation that may arise in the performance of military and police functions in the two countries. It was reported that the Colombian military and police representatives created a very cordial climate, indicating that "not even the statements by Colombian politicians and demagogues would create problems in the close relations of cooperation between them." During the course of the meeting, the NG helicopter that had crashed in Colombia was returned. The helicopter had been held in Colombia and not one Venezuelan representative was allowed to witness or participate actively in the investigation of the crash, as the laws mandate. Thus, simultaneous work by the military forces of the two countries will continue as it is now with each side working on its territory, although stress was placed on continuous exchange of military information to fight criminals who operate along Venezuela's enormous border with Colombia. There was no information, much less confirmation, from the Colombian officers on the statement made to the media by the Colombian Army commander. Oddly enough, the Colombian officers and police chiefs did not present the list, ranks, or intelligence reports that reportedly demonstrate that a group of NG officers sold FAN weapons to Colombian guerrillas. They did not present a list of serial numbers of the alleged FAN weapons that the Colombian military had found or seized from Colombian guerrillas, as had been reported.
