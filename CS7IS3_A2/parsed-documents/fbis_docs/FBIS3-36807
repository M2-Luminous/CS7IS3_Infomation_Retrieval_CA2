Russia's Foreign Ministry, he noted, is drafting a statement in connection with NATO's decision. He said he hopes that his own "preliminary view" coincides with the content and tone of the statement. As Adamishin said, "if nothing changes, Russia will insist on convening the UN Security Council urgently in order to 'dot all the i's' and return the role of peacekeeper to the UN, or press for 'peace by force,' if all members of the Security Council decide so." According to Russia's first deputy foreign minister, this role cannot be transferred to NATO. "Other countries - our partners - do not want to convene the Security Council for a session," he complained. According to Interfax's interviewee, Russia stands for resolving the conflict in Bosnia as soon as possible. "Russia's attitude to the acts of violence and massacre in Sarajevo's market is as indignant as that of other countries. There is no controversy in this. The only issue is how to gain the common goal." he said. Today the main problem is how to unblock Sarajevo, demilitarize the city and place it under UN administration temporarily, Adamishin said. "The Serbs are willing, before a comprehensive solution is gained, to single out this question and resolve it on the following basis - demilitarize Sarajevo and place it under UN administration temporarily. Naturally, this should relate to both sides: the Serbs and the Muslims," he said. According to the diplomat, NATO's ultimatum raises several issues. "Why should NATO resolve settlement problems, in the form of an ultimatum at that, and threaten to use military methods? This belongs to the competence of the UN, not NATO," Adamishin said. He disagreed with the arguments under which the UN Secretary- General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, "granted NATO the prerogative of launching air strikes to unblock Sarajevo." "We do not agree with such an interpretation, because it is wrong. Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked NATO if it is prepared to make its aircraft available, if such a need arises. However he never transferred UN functions to NATO. This has to be sorted out," Adamishin stressed. He also called for considering how NATO's ultimatum will affect the Geneva talks attended by spokesmen for all Bosnian warring sides which began on Thursday. "How will the talks on unblocking Sarajevo proceed, if the Muslims know that this ultimatum is hanging over the Serbs, that they will have to withdraw their artillery, if they do not want to run the risk of being subjected to air strikes? It's clear that the Muslims will have no great incentive for reaching agreements," the diplomat said. According to him, Bosnian Muslims "have already become virtually the main obstacle on the road to settlement, since they are preparing for military actions, and are waging military actions, particularly with Croats." "They are trying to gain on the battlefield what they failed to gain at the negotiating table, though at the negotiating table they have gained more than they would have gained by fighting. It is clear that NATO's decision undermines the agreement that should be implemented with the UN participation," Adamishin noted. According to him, NATO's decision was motivated largely by the public outcry caused by the heart-rending scenes in Sarajevo shown on TV. "However, investigations into that affair have not been concluded yet. In the meantime leaks from the UN office indicate that the Serbs are not necessarily responsible for it. There is no proof of their involvement," Adamishin said. According to him, "there is an impression that NATO's decision was taken under a scenario worked out by the U.S., France and some other countries, while other nations expressed rather serious doubts on this score." "It's natural that we shall contact the direct participants. President Boris Yeltsin has already sent several messages to President Bill Clinton, warning him against the use of military methods. They will not only fail to lead to a political solution, but may considerably aggravate the situation, make it chaotic, uncontrollable," Adamishin said. In the near future the Russian president is to have telephone conversations with the leaders of Western countries, including the U.S. and Germany.
