The two leaders also recommended the holding of a regional summit of east and central African states and governments to discuss the issue of refugees in the region. This was disclosed by President Museveni at the opening of bilateral official talks between the delegations of the two countries at the Lake Victoria Hotel in Entebbe this afternoon. The two leaders have just concluded their fruitful tete-a-tete at which they reviewed the general situation relating to Rwandan refugees. President Yoweri Museveni welcomed President Habyarimana, who was making his third visit to Uganda in three years. He said the two countries, like others in the region, shared a lot in common among their peoples, especially their common languages and historic linkages, which, he noted, were ready infrastructures that could be used by leaders in the region to unite the people and work towards giving them good life and better living standards other than trying to divide them. The president assured his guest that Uganda is ready to do everything possible to assist in the process of establishing lasting peace in Rwanda. On his part, President Habyarimana said he recognizes Uganda's contribution towards the implementation of the Arusha peace accord which put in place institutions of transition to lasting peace in his country. He was optimistic that these institutions will be firmly established in Rwanda to solve the problem of refugees and to allow the people of his country to fully enjoy peace and stability. He said that the meeting being organized by church leaders and by the special representative of the United Nations in his country make him optimistic about the process of establishing these institutions. The Rwandan leader further explained that the contacts he is always making with President Museveni are always aimed at restoring peace and stability in the region and to see how their people can resume living together in peace as before. He also said that the two neighboring countries should look towards the future with confidence and optimism. In a joint communique signed by the two leaders at the end of President Habyarimana's working visit, President Yoweri Museveni commended President Habyarimana and through him the entire people of Rwanda for the efforts made so far in implementing the peace agreement signed between the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front on 4 August 1993 in Arusha, Tanzania. He expressed the hope that the deadlock which has delayed the installation of the transitional government would be overcome soon so that the long- awaited era of peace, national reconciliation, and development of the people of Rwanda and stability in the subregion could begin. The two heads of state, the communique adds, expressed appreciation to the United Nations for its role in overseeing the implementation of the peace accord. They renewed their call to the international community to render both moral and material assistance to facilitate the implementation of the peace agreement. The two leaders reviewed the relationship between their two countries and renewed their commitment to enhancing cooperation. In this regard, they noted that traffic within the northern corridor is still badly affected by the situation in Rwanda and that it has adversely affected the economies of the countries in the subregion. They called for the reopening of the transit route as soon as possible. The two presidents discussed the Rwandan refugee problem and confirmed their commitment to resolve the matter once and for all. With regard to the Kagera Basin Organization, KBO, the two leaders reviewed the progress made in the implementation of its projects and programs and reaffirmed their commitment to the objectives of the organization. Answering questions from the press shortly before departure, President Juvenal Habyarimana said he was committed to full implementation of the Arusha peace accord and called on the parties concerned to do the same. He accused some factions of two political parties in the opposition in Rwanda of placing obstacles to peace and of lack of seriousness in observing the recommendations of the peace agreement. On the allegation of ambushes by government troops against the Rwandan Patriotic Front, particularly at (Gasaka) in northern Rwanda, President Habyarimana said he had asked the commander of the UN force in the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda to investigate and report back. He said he is still waiting for their findings. Asked about the hurried return of Rwandan refugees from Uganda now under way, President Museveni assured the international community that there is no pressure on them to return home. He, however, observed that Ugandan political opportunists resented their presence and used them as a scapegoat to problems in the country. In this connection, the refugees themselves felt the indignity of their status in a foreign country and were naturally anxious to return home. [passage omitted] President Habyarimana was later seen off at Entebbe Airport by President Museveni, cabinet ministers, ambassadors, and senior government officials.
