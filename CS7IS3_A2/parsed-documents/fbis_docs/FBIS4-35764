FBIS4-35764 "drnes107_n_94009" FBIS-NES-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 LEBANON Government Reacts to Israeli Raid on Hizballah Camp Government Reacts to Israeli Raid on Hizballah Camp Buwayz on Raid, Water Issue NC0206141794 Beirut Radio Lebanon in Arabic 1115 GMT 2 Jun 94 NC0206141794 Beirut Radio Lebanon Arabic BFN [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with unidentified correspondents at Foreign Ministry Headquarters in Beirut on 2 June--recorded] [Excerpts] [Correspondent] At dawn today a massacre was committed in the 'Ayn Zarzarah area of Ba'labakk. Would you tell us what measures Lebanon will adopt to confront Israeli aggression? [Buwayz] The military operation that the Israeli army conducted at dawn today is a blatant aggression on Lebanese sovereignty and security. It also constitutes a major challenge to the peace process. We believe that this operation is tantamount to an all-out war against Lebanon. It clearly reveals Israel's intentions concerning the peace process, contrary to what it says to the world -- pretending to seek peace. In a few moments, the Higher Defense Council will convene. It will review the details of this operation before adopting a suitable stand. [Correspondent] Is Lebanon going to file a complaint with the UN Security Council concerning this massacre? [Buwayz] I believe that the proper decision will be adopted after reviewing the various aspects of the matter. It should be noted that the massacre has claimed some 45 lives so far. [Correspondent] Was one of the objectives of that operation to cover up the issue of Israel's diversion of Lebanese water? [Buwayz] As far as the issue of water is concerned, I would like to be accurate about this matter. Of course, Israel's intentions and ambitions in Lebanese lands and water are neither surprising nor new. Information circulated over past few years is not new. We repeatedly wrote to the United Nations with requests to send fact-finding committees to verify information that we received from several sources. The UN reply clearly emphasized that there was no evidence of water theft, either on the surface or underground, through pipes, pumps, or tunnels. [passage omitted] In any case, we sent a message to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali this morning, requesting him to dispatch an experts committee to inspect al-Khardali area and tell us whether Israel is, or is not, stealing water directly or indirectly. Hence, we are waiting for the UN findings after its contacts with UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia [ESCWA]. I believe that UN official spokesman Timor Goksel made a statement this morning, which said that press reports citing international forces are false, that these forces took part in no committee, and that they have no information on the issue. Hence, we are waiting for the UN secretary general to appointment an experts committee, instead of relying on speculations or analysis that can never be accepted as documents. If circulated reports are confirmed, we will file a complaint with the UN Security Council, demanding the adoption of the necessary measures. [Correspondent] There is an impression that you and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri disagree on this matter, particularly since your return from Amman. [Buwayz] Speaker Birri made statements yesterday based on press reports. We cannot rely on press reports alone. We have assessed what we received from ESCWA and discovered ESCWA does not adopt a specific stand on circulated information. This information is not based on findings of a specific committee or a field inspection; it is based on analysis and estimates. We share ESCWA's concern over Lebanon's waters. But there is a big difference between this concern and documented facts. [passage omitted]
