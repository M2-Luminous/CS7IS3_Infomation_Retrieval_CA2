Presentation of New Navy Commander On 13 October Minister of Defense Colonel General Vitaliy Radetskyy presented the new Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral V. Bezkorovaynyy, to the Navy command component in Sevastopol. Radetskyy expressed gratitude to outgoing Navy Commander B. Kozhyn for his significant contribution to the establishment of Ukraine's Navy and stressed that Ukraine, as a maritime state, must have its own navy.

Head of the Directorate for Cadres Captain 1st Rank V. Polevoy delivered a report to the Council on progress in bringing the officer corps up to strength and eliminating the shortfall between navy requirements and the projected number of graduates out to the year 2000. He noted in particular that staffing for the Navy, Rear Services, and the Naval Aviation Directorate was at 60 percent. In his address to the Council Commander of Naval Aviation and Deputy Naval Forces Commander for Aviation Major General Mykola Volovin discussed the role of reconfiguring the Sevastopol Naval Institute in bringing naval aviation up to strength and training aviation specialists. (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 20 Nov 93 p1) Navy Commander Assesses Progress, Prospects In an interview prepared on Ukrainian Armed Forces Day, Navy Commander Bezkorovaynyy pointed out that starting from almost nothing in April 1992 the Navy today has surface ship formations, marine sub-units, and almost 20 units of various types and staffing for the Navy Rear Services and the Naval Aviation Directorate is at 6O percent. He assessed the situation as follows: "During the 1993 training year Naval Forces continued their work in forming and establishing control organs, guaranteeing the timely conducting of plant and state tests of ships under construction and their introduction to the body of forces on constant readiness, and also in guaranteeing control over navigation in the Black Sea Basin. Plans for combat, operational and mobilization training have been almost completely carried out. Analysis of measures showed that the level of training of staff and command organs in the Navy has risen markedly in comparison with past years. "An important result of this was the Navy's attainment of international recognition; foreign political and military leaders relate to us as to a state structure and an armed service branch of a maritime power. Participation of Navy representatives in international symposia on military policy questions, speeches, exhibits of naval equipment and armaments, visits to Ukraine by warships of other countries, visits to our ships by highly placed personnel from several states, and meetings at Ukraine's naval headquarers with military and naval attaches bear witness to this. "The concept of establishment of Naval Forces was made more precise in Ukraine's Basic Military Doctrine. We have a clear view of this problem. The basic principle in establishment and development of Ukraine's Navy is the optimum composition of a combat nucleus, sufficient to defend the State's interests against any possible agressor by sea. Therefore, well-planned work must proceed for establishment of naval force sub-branches, especially surface and submarine forces, naval aviation, costal defense forces, formations and units of combat, special and rear services, and a scientific program." (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 6 Dec 93 P 3) Funding Problems In an article commenting on difficulties in establishing the Navy, Captain 2nd Rank Myroslav Mamchak noted that the construction and repair of many ships has been frozen due to a lack of funds in the Ministry of Defense. One "flagrant" example cited by Mamchak is the as yet unfinished aircraft carrier "Varyah," whose sale would generate substantial hard currency for the State, he noted. The author further stated that the absence of a State program for establishing a Navy has precluded concentration of national security efforts against a threat from the-sea. He discussed local contributions from the public to build and outfit warships bearing the regional name an alternate source of funds. (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 23 Dec 93 p2) NARODNA ARMIYA cited such an example of moves to solicit funds from the populace to equip warships. By agreement between rayon leaders and the naval command a campaign was begun in Syanynskyy Rayon, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, to collect funds to equip a newly built warship to bear the name Pokuttya. A special bank account was established and 3.8 million karboantsy collected, of which 3.7 million have been allotted to equip the ship. According to the report, the remainder is in an account in the Ukraina Agrarian Bank for additional contributions at a later date.

Major General Mykola Volovin was named Naval Aviation Commander, and experienced aviators were appointed to 60 percent of the positions. The directorate is based at an air garrison near the city of Skay (Crimea). (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 6 Oct 93 p 1) Battalion Established in Sevastopol A new battalion was established under the Sevastopol garrison commandant Vladimir Zverev to guard military installations, conduct patrols, and accompany freight trains. It was scheduled to begin service in mid-September. (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Russian 10 Sep 93 p 1) New ASW Ship Added to Fleet Commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces Vice Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy, Ukraine's presidental representative in Sevastopol Ivan Yermakov, and Hero of the Soviet Union Vice Admiral (ret.) Vladimir Pilipenko greeted the arrival in Sevastopol of the new ASW (anti-submarine warfare) ship "Lutsk" on 21 November. The "Lutsk" had just successfully completed sea trials in the Black Sea and was reported to be the fifth ship to fly the Navy flag. Ship commander Captain 3rd Rank Viktor Zaremba praised the performance of his youthful crew, only 20 percent of whom had previously been to sea. (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Russian 23 Nov 93 p 1) The "Lutsk" was referred to as the fourth, rather than fifth such ship to fly the Ukrainian flag in an article published two weeks later. Elaborating on the impact of economic difficulties on the ship's building, the article reported that for a time the fate of the "Lutsk" was in doubt: construction was brought to a halt immediately after independence due to funding problems. The fine points of funding--problems which were formerly resolved in Moscow- -were "not well understood in our newly established Ministry of Defense," and as a result the ship stood idle at the Kiev Ship Building plant. The problems were subsequently resolved through the efforts of the Kiev shipbuilders and Military Acceptance Commission representatives Captain 1st Rank Petro Polyakov and Captain 3rd Rank Ihor Tyshchenko.
