Production is expected to be suspended in 1994 and suspicion has been raised within the military of possible mishandling of the project. The JCS held a meeting of the Arms Systems Deliberation Committee on 30 December last year and decided on three types of aircraft as the final ones for negotiation after three years of pondering. The three types of aircraft are: one large aircraft, the French Dassault Falcon 50; and two medium-size aircraft, BAE-125 built by U.S. Raytheon and Citation III built by U.S. Cessna. However, since the two medium-size aircraft fall short of the performance necessary for military operations required by the user unit, such as payload capacity and duration of flight, the procurement of Falcon 50 has virtually been decided. The Falcon 50 the JCS has decided to procure has never been developed for military use and its production is supposed to be suspended this year. Moreover, the large Canadian Challenger jet, which has been developed for military use, has been dropped from the list of aircraft to be negotiated on, arousing doubt within the military about the decisionmaking process. The Defense Security Command, therefore, is reported to have undertaken an investigation of the case. The electronic warfare aircraft project is supposed to procure eight reconnaissance planes from 1996 through 1999 so as to take over the role of the reconnaissance unit of the U.S. forces in the ROK which will be withdrawing toward the end of the nineties. According to Defense Ministry and JCS officials, the JCS excluded the Canadaire Challenger--which had already been developed and in use for intelligence purposes in 1989 when the JCS began to push ahead with the project--from the prospective list of procurement from the outset. Instead, the JCS included in the list only the Falcon 50, and the two medium-size aircraft which are incapable of competition as they fall short of the performance required for military operations. In response to the decision, the Canadian Government sent a letter through the Canadian Embassy in Seoul in 1991 to then Defense Minister Choe Se-chang protesting the exclusion of the Challenger, which was the only model in the world developed for military reconnaissance purposes [as published] and was used in the Gulf war. Minister Choe ordered Vice Minister Kwon Yong-hae to include the Challenger and make a new presentation. The Defense Ministry and JCS officials, however, said the JCS disregarded the order for nearly three years and suddenly held the Arms Systems Deliberation Committee meeting at the end of last year, right after former Minister Kwon was replaced, and decided to negotiate on the Falcon 50 and two medium-size models, excluding the Challenger again. The officials said that because of the decision, the Falcon is almost certain to be selected as the final model beating the medium-size models. According to the officials, before the Arms Systems Deliberation Committee meeting was held in early December 1993, the working-level meeting of the project had notified the deliberation committee members of its conclusion that the medium-size models were not appropriate and that the Challenger should be selected. The officials said that it was suspected from the beginning that the decision makers wanted to select Falcon 50 by including in the list Falcon 50 and the two medium-size models and excluding the Challenger, because a large-size reconnaissance aircraft was the one they needed. A high-ranking JCS official said, "The Arms Systems Deliberation Committee made the decision by vote of its members on the judgment that the performance comparison presented by the user unit was right.
