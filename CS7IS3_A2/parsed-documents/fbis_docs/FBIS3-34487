It is 61.7-meter long and 7-meter wide, and its maximum displacement is 488 metric tons. The vessel will be equipped with sophisticated modern means of warfare, including an electronic combat system, a ship- detecting radar system, aircraft and missiles, a control and monitoring system, Gabriel missiles, Harpoon missiles, Vulcan and Phalanx antiaircraft guns, and Barak, the Israeli-developed antimissile missile. The vessel's maximum speed is 31 knots, and it will accommodate a crew of 45 officers and soldiers. [passage omitted]
