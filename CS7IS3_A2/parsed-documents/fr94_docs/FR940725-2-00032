FR940725-2-00032 FR940725-2-00022 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;5020&hyph;5] Acid Rain Program: Notice of Final Permits AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of permits. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing, as a direct final action, 5-year Phase I Acid Rain Permits to 12 utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). DATES: The permits will become final on September 6, 1994, except those permits on which EPA receives significant adverse comment by August 24, 1994. If EPA receives significant adverse comment on a permit, EPA will withdraw the direct final issuance of that permit and simultaneously repropose the permit. Such reproposal will provide an opportunity for public comment and requests for a public hearing. ADDRESSES: Administrative Records. The administrative record for the permits, except information protected as confidential, may be viewed during normal operating hours at these locations: For plants in Illinois and Indiana: EPA Region 5, Ralph H. Metcalfe Federal Bldg., 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, IL 60604. For plants in Missouri: EPA Region 7, 726 Minnesota Ave., Kansas City, KS 66101. Comments. Send comments to the following addresses: For plants in Illinois and Indiana: EPA Region 5 (A&hyph;18J), Air and Radiation Division, Attn: David Kee, Director (address above). For plants in Missouri: EPA Region 7, Air and Toxics Division, Attn: Jon Knodel (address above). Submit comments in duplicate and identify the permit to which the comments apply, the commenter's name, address, and telephone number, and the commenter's interest in the matter and affiliation, if any, to the owners and operators of all units in the permit. In the comment, include objections to the permit and the legal, factual, or other basis for the objections. This information will be used by EPA to determine if the comment is a significant adverse comment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans [sections 404 (b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act]. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below, EPA approves for 1995&hyph;1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996&hyph;1999 in the draft permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated to each unit for 1995&hyph;1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft permits. The additional allowances discussed below, according to the settlement, are a one-time allocation and entail a simultaneous deduction of an equal number of allowances in a future year. Upon activation of conditionally-approved plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the remaining years the plan is in effect. EPA issues the following permits: Hutsonville in Illinois: 9,661 substitution allowances for each year and 368 additional allowances to unit 05; 9,837 substitution allowances for each year and 936 additional allowances to unit 06. Elmer W Stout in Indiana. Tanners Creek in Indiana. Hawthorn in Missouri: 6,927 substitution allowances for each year and 37,614 additional allowances to unit 5. James River in Missouri: 2,536 substitution allowances for each year and 2,532 additional allowances to unit 3; 4,304 substitution allowances for each year and 5,048 additional allowances to unit 4; no change for unit 5. Labadie in Missouri. Meramec in Missouri. Montrose in Missouri. Rush Island in Missouri. Sioux in Missouri. Southwest in Missouri: 3,906 substitution allowances for each year and 32 additional allowances to unit 1. Thomas Hill in Missouri. Dated: July 19, 1994.
