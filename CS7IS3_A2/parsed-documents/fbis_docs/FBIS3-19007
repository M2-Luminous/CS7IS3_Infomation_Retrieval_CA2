Taking part in a debate here Thursday [10 March] evening, Fabbri said he would not want it said in years to come that Europe had been guilty of appeasement when faced with a situation in the former Yugoslavia that smacked of the Middle Ages and of the Nazi Holocaust, and the minister reiterated Italy's readiness to send soldiers into Bosnia if the United Nations advanced such a request and if all the factions in the field agreed. For the moment, however, no such official request had been forthcoming, he noted. Fabbri said that the firmer stance taken by Europe had eased the stranglehold on Sarajevo and halted the massacres underway there and he was confident that peace prospects had been enhanced. Asked about possible reprisal action against bases on Italian soil, the defense minister said that the allied forces were able to moniter both naval and air space and to throw up a virtually impenetrable shield if the need arises. There is always a risk of terrorist attacks but security has been bolstered at all the bases, he added.
