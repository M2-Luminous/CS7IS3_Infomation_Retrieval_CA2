He had to pay a high price for his hesitant attitude toward Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti. The credibility and predictability of U.S. foreign policy have been damaged. All the conflicts mentioned, however, pale before the exacerbating crisis surrounding North Korea. North Korea is an isolated and desperate country whose regime is capable of incomprehensible actions. It is trying to blackmail the whole world with its nuclear facilities. The big question is: Are patience and diplomacy suitable weapons to respond to this provocation or is it time to reply with the same toughness to this blackmail, as shown by George Bush in the Gulf war against Saddam Husayn? It is certain that the policy of cautious patience that has been adopted so far is no longer sufficient. Slow-motion reactions are not appropriate for a regime that is trying to gain time because time gives birth to tough nuclear realities in this conflict. CIA leader Woolsey proved this recently by pointing out that, in all likelihood, North Korea possesses the first nuclear weapon. Everything suggests that Clinton will continue to seek a diplomatic solution, enriched with gestures of a military threat and economic sanctions. For the time being, he rules out a military confrontation. It may well be that the time for toughness -- as adopted toward Saddam Husayn at the time -- has not yet come. However, if Washington wants to exert diplomatic pressure, this can only take place with the willing cooperation of the most important partner in this conflict -- that is China. Thus, it is all the more incomprehensible that Clinton risked direct confrontation with Beijing in his policy toward China. Diplomacy may still be the most important weapon in relations with North Korea but only so long as one does not use it to shoot oneself in the foot.
