After a meeting was dispersed by police, demonstrators took to the streets. There were clashes and a number of policemen were killed, apparently murdered. A civilian also died. On the line, Jeremy Skeet asked our Dakar correspondent, Djadje Ba, what the situation was today. [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Skeet] Are the government saying that any one particular opposition party is behind these demonstrations? [Ba] Well, according to an official communique read today on the national radio, an Islamic group called the (Mushashidin wa al-Mushashidadi), which means in Arabic Youth, Young [Men] and Women following the truth, is banned starting from today in the territory of Senegal. It seems that from the government's point of view now, according to observers here, the people who were behind yesterday's demonstrations are definitely the (Mushashidin wa al-Mushashidadi). [Skeet] Now, that's the government's version. You were on the streets yesterday. Do you think the demonstrators only belong to this Islamic party or do you think they came from other opposition parties? [Ba] Personally, I have heard yesterday among demonstrators some young people chanting Islamic slogans in which they were saying that well, all the hardship is due to the ruling party and that they wanted to get rid of the current government. Well, this is one thing. Another thing, there were also some other youngsters who were saying that they were simply in the streets, simply because they are tired once again of the economic hardship. They don't belong to any of the parties here in Senegal but are simply Senegalese who want a better life and were on the streets because they wanted to live better. [passage omitted] [end recording]
