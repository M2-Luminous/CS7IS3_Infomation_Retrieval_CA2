Most presidents agreed it was very hard to define Central Europe. Polish President Lech Walesa said it would be better to talk about united Europe. A number of problems, like "Chernobyl and other nuclear power stations", surpass national borders and so [as received] be discussed in a pan-European context. Czech President Vaclav Havel, who is hosting the summit, said Central Europe's idiosyncrasies should not be a reason to consider the region a "special independent political entity" of some kind. German President Richard von Weizsacker said Germany considered it vital that all the countries of Central Europe enter the European Union [EU]. Only then would the Union justify its name, he said. While discussing relations with Russia Weizsacker said the West did not want to provoke it but to cooperate -- though not on terms Russia would dictate. Walesa emphasized that Central European countries had to act together and defend their common values together to deprive "certain groups in Russia" of the possibility of exploiting Central European irresolution. He said Russia "does not understand what partnership is" in reference to Moscow's cautious attitude towards the Partnership for Peace project. Havel stressed the need to "categorically reject" elements on the Russian political scene which believed "Russia has a special right to advise us on what we may and may not do". Slovenian President Milan Kucan said the international community had made some errors which significantly influenced the course of the war in the former Yugoslavia. The fundamental mistake had been the inability to understand that the federation had to fall apart. The military pressure NATO was now applying, he said, could only continue till the three warring sides, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb, come together at the negotiating table. All the presidents speaking in the debate, which was hosted by French public affairs commentator Jacques Rupnik, agreed admission to the European Union was desirable but accepted Havel's observation that EU entry was less important than the adoption of the values and principles on which the EU was founded and the willingness to bear their share of responsibility for the fate of the world.
