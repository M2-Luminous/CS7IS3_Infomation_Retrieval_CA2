It is beyond all doubt that taking vigorous action regarding state-owned enterprises will be an inevitable necessity for in-depth reform, hence action is imperative under the circumstances. What worries people, however, is that before the beginning of wide-scale reform, the dissatisfaction of enterprise staff and workers has burst out in many ways. If the policymakers do not realize this soberly and take effective measures to cope with it, the pace of reform very soon will be held up by this continually spreading dissatisfaction, and the grand and dynamic reform will die away without being noticed. A survey indicates that the dissatisfaction of enterprise staff and workers has vented itself in many ways. The following are just a few examples: It Is Difficult To Maintain Basic Living Conditions First, the excessively sharp increase in commodity prices has aroused dissatisfaction among staff and workers. In the first half of 1993, controls on the prices of grain and edible oil were lifted for the first time in several decades in more than 1,300 counties among 90 percent of provinces and cities throughout the country. In the meantime, the state adopted a policy of combined regulation and relaxation of the prices of some essential means of production, whereby the state has successively lifted control of factory prices for steel products, partially unified the allocation of coal, and made appropriate adjustments to the prices of some heavy oil products. This move caused prices to rise by 13.9 percent in June 1993 over the corresponding period in 1992, more than doubling the rise of 6 percent originally set for the whole year. Enterprise staff and workers were weighed down by the pressure of this price surge much more than indicated by the figures released by the authorities. The overly rapid price surge has affected the basic lives of staff and workers and has aroused their intense dissatisfaction. According to a survey conducted by the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions among 10,000 staff and workers across the province in September 1993, 41 percent of them felt that the price surge had caused their families' living standards to decline. Second, the poverty of staff and workers became an increasingly conspicuous problem. The findings of an authoritative survey show that among the ranks of staff and workers in China, more than 5 percent of personnel who have retired or are still working (totalling about 8 million) now live in poverty. If their dependents are included, the total population of impoverished staff and workers and their families is approximately 20 million. The salaries of some staff and workers are unsecured, and for several consecutive years, a small number of them have received only scores of yuan each month to live on. Some enterprises could not even afford to pay this sum as basic living expenses. Take the Xinjiang production and construction corps as an example. In the five divisions of this corps in northern Xinjiang, nearly half the staff families have less than 50 yuan per head to live on. Under circumstances in which basic livelihood can hardly be maintained, some people have had to live on borrowed money and grain or to sell their own furniture and clothing; others were forced to divorce, commit suicide, or steal. Owing to livelihood problems, instances of presenting petitions, staging demonstrations, and collectively appealing to the authorities for help have occurred frequently. Third, the income of staff and workers has declined substantially in the name of reducing material benefits. As China has a large population but a weak economic foundation, there originally were few and relatively low-level welfare services. Some enterprises, however, improperly reduced welfare services in the name of reform. As a result, some units arbitrarily distributed money or things to staff and workers, which led to sharp increases in welfare expenditures on the one hand, but on the other, necessary welfare services were neglected. Moreover, some units turned former welfare facilities -- such as nurseries, cafeterias, bathrooms, and barbershops -- into profit-making commercial service networks, but did not increase the income of staff and workers correspondingly. This has directly sapped their revenue. Fourth, encroachment on the rights and interests of staff and workers has occurred frequently. According to a survey, 615 staff members and workers were fired, laid off, or dismissed from 178 enterprises in Shijiazhuang between April and December 1992, and 30 percent of them were relieved of their posts without being gived any explanation or without trade unions being advised in advance of the reasons for the termination of their services. Staff Members and Workers Gradually Feel Doubtful About Reform Measures Fifth, unfair distribution and the wide gap between rich and poor engender resentment and dissatisfaction. There are still 6 to 7 million poor families among the urban staff members and workers, with the income of high salary earners being 10 times higher on average. Even among the residents in cities and towns, the gap between the 10 percent of high income earners and the 10 percent of low income earners is close to 5 times. Certainly, there are irrational portions in this high income. According to a survey of the tax department, the amount of tax evasion in China has reached approximately 100 billion yuan per year, of which the individual sector accounted for more than 90 percent, and more than 80 percent of private enterprises evaded taxes. The drastic widening of the income gap in society has led to serious psychological imbalance in quite a number of staff members and workers. Other phenomena -- including acute employment contradictions, housing difficulties, default in the payment of salaries, the lack of protection due to child-birth, old age, illness, and death, and so on -- are causes of intense dissatisfaction among staff members and workers. The ever-growing dissatisfaction and psychological imbalance have aroused doubt or even resentment among some staff members and workers toward the reform and open door policies, so that their support for reform has declined noticeably. An opinion poll conducted during the Seventh Five-Year Plan indicated that more than 80 percent of staff members and workers gave their support to reform, with the highest percentage reaching 95, whereas the latest survey shows that only 72 percent of staff members and workers support reform. Overcome by dissatisfaction, staff members and workers have sought countermeasures to gain benefits and avoid losses, which has exacerbated social disorder and bred a hidden peril to reform and development. Over the past few years, sudden incidents stemming from material interest problems have increased notably. In this connection, people must not take it lightly in the course of instituting a modern enterprise system.
