Ait Ahmed is president of the Front of Socialist Forces, a very influential party in the region of Kabylia. Mr. Ait Ahmed appealed for dialogue. Farida Ayari asked him why he is making such an appeal: [Begin recording] [Ahmed] Because civil war is the worst thing that can happen to our country. I refuse this possibility because a civil war is an insult to intelligence and to reason. [Ayari] One is tempted to ask why dialogue, since the only two real forces in Algeria today are the army and the Islamists. If those two talk, might one not end up with an alliance between the army and the Islamists, as has happened in Iran or in Sudan? [Ahmed] You speak of dialogue between two protagonists. This is the very problem. You still know nothing about Algeria, unknown Algeria, with its population which refuses to side either with the authorities or with the Islamists, and which just suffers. We do not have one section of the Algerian people taking up arms against another section. This is why I say that there is not a civil war. So dialogue yes, between the protagonists, but especially between the representatives of the most representative political parties. [end recording]
