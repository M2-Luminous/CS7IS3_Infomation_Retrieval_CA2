It is not known how the two U.S. officials will try to help or whether they will make any new proposals or plans to facilitate the talks that have essentially come to a halt. If Lamb and (Oxman) are coming to Nicosia merely to persuade us to agree to implement the confidence-building measures [CBM's], we believe their mission will be useless. The Greek Cypriot side will not accept pressure or suggestions about the CBM's. It has repeatedly raised its arguments, which foreigners have described as reasonable and realistic! So our side has permanently closed the door to further concessions on Famagusta's fenced-off area and Nicosia Airport. Every side believes next week should be decisive for future developments, particularly the future of the proximity talks. This is because, as Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, revealed, the UN envoys will make some new suggestions. So we will wait to see the new suggestions that are being prepared by the UN envoys in Nicosia. UN circles implied that the new ideas "will break the deadlock." Developments in the Cyprus issue are expected in the third and last phase of the proximity talks, which is believed to be the last, the decisive one, for future developments. If the new round of talks achieves no positive result because of the Turkish side's insistence on its known positions, essentially, to hold hostage those Greeks who return to Famagusta and acquire "state" rights for Nicosia Airport, then the New York talks will be useless. The chapter of the talks will close and we will start preparing to get out of the deadlock created by the Turks, which is tolerated by insincere foreigners.
