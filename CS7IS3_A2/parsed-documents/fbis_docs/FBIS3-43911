It is not a long time, but it is enough time for many things to happen which may determine, or at least greatly influence, the voting inclination. Thus, even if the opinion polls give a clue, it is not very wise to advance any predictions. The weekly DOMINGO/Gestinform barometer of December notes an interesting aspect: the rise of almost all political leaders, with the exception of only three out of 11. The spectacular rise was that of Joaquim Chissano, chairman of Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front], by more than one point. Chissano rose from 5.8 points in November to 7.1 last December, a rise of 1.3. Why did Chissano rise from five immediately to seven? It is difficult to discover the reasons of those interviewed, but one is led to believe, as it has always been said, people forget very easily. The residents of Maputo -- where all the counting was carried out -- may have already forgotten about the fuel price increases decreed by the government, which led to the rise in the transport fares. This may be the case, since the Maputo residents won the battle, and the prices of the private taxi fares remain the same. This rise should also be viewed, however, as a reward in view of the measure taken by the government, recommending an annual bonus... Afonso Dhlakama's countrywide tour may probably have produced the desired effects, judging by the 0.9 point increase. The person who is getting more and more popular of late despite his silence is Dr. Maximo Dias, leader of the Monamo [Mozambican Nationalist Movement]. The people are little by little discovering the consistence of his speeches and political positions. Some observers of the Mozambican process describe him as a new Sergio Vieira, who is emerging in the national parliament. The 0.4 rise explains it. The person who is always active, flexible, and "champion" of press releases is Wehia Monakacho Ripua, the leader of Pademo [Mozambique Democratic Party]. The rise from 4.6 in November to 5.5 in December only proves that despite the fact that he is considered "comic," the Maputo residents are getting to know him better. The trip of Dr. Domingos Arouca, chairman of the Mozambique United Front-Democratic Convergence and National Reconstruction Party [Fumo-PCDRN], to Europe may have increased his credibility and seriousness among the public. With his 4.8 points in December, Domingos Arouca is still far from his most direct rivals in the presidential elections, Joaquim Chissano and Afonso Dhlakama, but his 0.3 point rise should certainly encourage him. Lutero Simango, secretary for foreign affairs and member of the PCN [National Convention Party], acts quietly and subtly and is little by little scoring points, so that in December he rose by 0.1. It is difficult to understand how this politician acts and the reason for his acceptance among the public. Perhaps his recent statements on the death of his father may have influenced this. Carlos Reis, who is a businessman and chairman of the Mozambican National Union [Unamo], is also rising in the grace of those interviewed, with an increase from 2.7 in November to 2.9 in December. A list of political leaders who have lost points follows: Padimbi Kamati (1.0), Casimiro Nhamitambo (1.5) and Martins Bilal (0.8). Neves Pinto Serrano appears for the first in the opinion poll. For a person who dreams of residing in the "Ponta Vermelha" Palace in October, the points he received, 1.9, are not encouraging. After a fall of 2.2 points from October to November, Foreign Affairs Minister Pascoal Mocumbi rose considerably from 4.0 to 5.6 in December. This is probably due to the calm and thoughtfulness which characterize his activities in the current "hot potato" of the Mozambican diplomacy: the "Young pioneers" case. In turn, Armando Guebuza, head of the government delegation in the CSC [Supervision and Control Commission], is still seeing his efforts in the tiresome exchange of words with Raul Domingos recognized by those interviewed in this opinion poll. His 0.1 point justifies this. The one who seems to be navigating in bad waters is Prime Minister Mario Machungo. Since October he has been continually losing popularity. In that month he had 3.2 points, in November 2.8 and in December 2.0. However, it is easy to guess that Machungo's decrease in popularity is well justified by those complicated sums which only ended up increasing the Mozambican people's cost of living... All of the opposition figures decreased! Ululu decreased by 0.3 points, a decrease for the party of Jose Castro, whose trips through the country have not been assisting him to be popular. Raul Domingos, Afonso Dhlakama's "loud speaker" [preceding two words in English], neither rose nor decreased.
