FR940207-2-00175 FR940207-2-00080 7. In the future, the Fund, on behalf of a Series or class thereof, may enter into non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services agreements (``Shareholder Services Plan'') with certain financial institutions (which may include banks), securities dealers, and other industry professionals providing for the performance of certain services. In the event that a Series or class thereof is subject to both a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan and a Shareholder Services Plan, services provided under one plan will augment, rather than duplicate, services provided under the other plan. 8. Each class of a Series will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and will be identical in all respects except for: (a) The compensation and other arrangements permitted by different distribution plans and Shareholder Services Plans for each class; (b) voting rights with respect to any matter specifically affecting that class, including the distribution plan and Shareholder Services Plan for that class and expenses related to the cost of holding shareholder meetings necessitated by the exclusive voting rights with respect to the distribution plan of each class (and, if applicable, Shareholder Services Plan), except as provided in condition 16 below; (c) the impact of any expenses directly attributable to that class, as described in the following paragraph (``Class Expenses''); (d) any differences in distributions and/or net asset value per share resulting from differences in Class Expenses; (e) any differences in features for purchasing, redeeming, exchanging, or converting shares of each class and/or in distribution arrangements for the offer and sale of such shares; and (f) the designation of classes. 9. Class Expenses may include the following: (a) Distribution plan fees (including service fees) or Shareholder Services Plan fees; (b) transfer and shareholder servicing agent fees and shareholder servicing costs; (c) professional fees relating solely to a particular class; (d) trustees fees, including independent counsel fees relating solely to a particular class; (e) printing and postage expenses for materials distributed to shareholders of a particular class; (f) Blue Sky and SEC registration fees relating solely to a particular class; and (g) shareholder meeting expenses for meetings of a particular class. 10. Expenses that are attributable to a particular Series but not to a particular class (``Series Expenses'') will be allocated based on the net assets of each class. 11. Class A shares on which a sales charge has been paid will be exchangeable at net asset value for Class A shares of any other Series (including the Money Market Fund), but not for Class B or Class C shares. Class B shares will be exchangeable at net asset value for Class B shares of any other Series (including the Money Market Fund), but not for Class A or Class C shares. No Class B CDSC will be imposed on shares acquired by exchange where the exchanged shares would not have been assessed a CDSC upon redemption. Class C shares will be exchangeable at net asset value for Class C shares of any other Series (including the Money Market Fund), but not for Class A or Class B shares. In the future, applicants may permit exchanges of shares of any class of a Series for shares of the same class of other open-end investment companies sponsored by the Adviser or the Distributor that hold themselves out as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services. Applicants will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 as to any exchanges. 12. All Class B shares, other than those purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, will automatically convert to Class A shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes six years after the end of the calendar month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. All Class C shares, other than those purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, will automatically convert to Class A shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes not later than ten years after the end of the calendar month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. For purposes of calculating the holding period, Class B (or Class C, as the case may be) shares will be deemed to have been issued on the sooner of the date on which the issuance of the Class B (or Class C) shares occurred, or for Class B (or Class C) shares obtained through an exchange or series of exchanges, the date on which the issuance of the original Class B (or Class C) shares occurred. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions in respect of Class B (or Class C) shares will be treated as Class B (or Class C) shares, except that each time any Class B (or Class C) shares in the shareholders account (other than those purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions) convert to Class A, an equal pro rata portion of the Class B (or Class C) shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions also will convert to Class A. The portion will be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's Class B (or Class C) shares converting to Class A bears to the shareholder's total Class B (or Class C) shares not acquired through dividends and distributions. Of the initial classes of shares, only Class B and Class C will have a conversion feature (additional classes created in the future also may have a conversion feature).
