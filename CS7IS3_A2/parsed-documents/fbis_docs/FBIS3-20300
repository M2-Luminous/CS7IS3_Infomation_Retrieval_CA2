Nevertheless, the annual rate of 3.4 percent worked out in February is still too high. "The basic trend suggests that price increases, which are influenced by domestic policy, will continue to slow down in the next few months" Tietmeyer said in Frankfurt on Friday [25 March]. Nevertheless, he was rather cautious as far as the Bundesbank's room for further interest cuts is concerned. At a time of nervous markets, new expectations of inflation might flare up quickly. "This is why we will stick to our policy of a quiet hand in the future, too." According to preliminary figures from three laender, price increases are expected to slow down again in March. On Friday, the Statistical Land Office in Wiesbaden noted that in Hesse, consumer prices were 3.2 percent (previous month: 3.4) higher than one year ago. Yesterday, North Rhine-Westphalia reported an annual rate of 3.1 percent (3.2), and thus the lowest increase in almost three years. The figure for Baden-Wuerttemberg was also 3.1 (3.4) percent. Tietmeyer said that the wage policy of the trade unions and the employers has been favorable for price stability this year. "Decisions in connection with wage policy have so far done justice to both the requirements in terms of stability and growth and employment to a greater degree than last year." Even the public sector has displayed growing awareness of the problems regarding the revision of financial policy. Yet, according to Tietmeyer, the strong expansion in the money supply advises to be very careful. The projected annual rate of 17.6 percent, which was announced the previous day, must "not simply be taken as the yardstick for the development in the further course of the year," the Bundesbank head said. "On the other hand we cannot and must not simply ignore these results." Continual high growth rates might mean the development of a new potential for inflation.
