President Kim Il-song published the famous work at a conference of model transport workers on May 11, 1954, 40 years ago. In the work he reviewed the successes and experiences gained by the railway transport workers during the war (June 1950-July 1953) and put forward highly important tasks to develop railway transport after the ceasefire. Yi Yong-mu, chairman of the Transport Commission, in his report said the great leader's work served as an inspiring banner in powerfully arousing all the transport workers to performing shining feats again in the postwar rehabilitation and construction in the same spirit and stamina as was displayed in the wartime. The great leader made sure that May 11, 1954, was set as the day of railway workers, which marked an occasion in bringing about an epoch-making turn in the development of railway transport, and has shown deep trust and loving care to railway transport workers, he said. He stressed that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il set forth a policy of making revolution in transport and led the whole party, the whole country and the entire people to give a powerful assistance to the railway transport so as to further strengthen the material and technical foundations of railways and thereby effected a new revolutionary upswing in the railway transport. He called upon all the railway transport workers to work with the conviction of sure victory and firm will in the same revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude as was displayed by the transport workers during the war and achieve brilliant success in the fulfilment of the first year tasks of the period of adjustment to add lustre to the Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses.
