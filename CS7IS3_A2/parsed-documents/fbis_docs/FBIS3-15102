The message forwarded on Wednesday expressed hope for further development of cooperation between CSCE and Tajikistan. "It is not only Tajikistan that is interested in CSCE, but CSCE is interested in Tajikistan as well; therefore, it is extremely important to develop the concept of" Tajikistan being CSCE southern gates," the message said. Alimov pointed out that CSCE might render Tajikistan not only economic and technical assistance, but help carry out market reforms in the republic and hold general democratic elections in autumn, 1994. Touching upon the internal situation in Tajikistan, the Tajik Foreign Minister pointed out that the Tajik Government reiterates its adherence to the sublime idea of a law-governed democratic country and regards this process as a long and difficult road leading, primarily, to comprehensive guarantees and defence of human rights in the country. It was pointed out in the message that unless reliable guarantees of human rights are ensured all other democratic principles are pointless. According to the Tajik minister, Tajik leaders managed to achieve certain stabilisation in the republic and begin the restoration of the economy. Military operations have been practically ceased in the republic. Efforts made to this end helped reach certain social and political stabilisation and the cessation of military operations on the Tajik territory. It was announced that a nationwide referendum would be held on problems of the Tajik statehood and general democratic elections scheduled in autumn, 1994. Declaring their readiness for a dialogue with political forces of different orientation, Tajik authorities are taking concrete measures to launch negotiations with their opponents in the near future. These talks are expected to be attended by the special envoy of the U.N. secretary general in Tajikistan, Ramiro Ballona.
