The move is apparent in the new power plant development project master plan being revised by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), from which the nuclear option has been deleted along with other problematic schemes. According to Nopphadon Salitdisuk assistant chief of EGAT's generation system development planning division, the authority does not wish to proceed with the plan, which saw the first two of six 1,000-megawatt nuclear power units being commissioned in 2006. Mr Nopphadon said yesterday that EGAT will not seek to undertake the nuclear project at least in the period 1994-2011, making the possibility of such a project being implemented look remote. Other "less socially sensitive" and conventional thermal power houses, using for instance imported natural gas and coal, will substitute for the suspended nuclear plant scheme, he said. He cited the lack of public acceptance of nuclear power plants as the prime factor behind EGAT's decision to withdraw the plan. But he said that the project may not be abandoned entirely, and EGAT will continue to study various aspects so that "when the time of public acceptance comes" the project can be relaunched. Prathin Phatthanaphon, deputy governor of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT), yesterday confirmed EGAT's move. He said that among other things, the question of safety is uppermost in the minds of the public, and the extremely high investment cost of the nuclear facilities make the project itself financially unviable. The cost of building a nuclear power plant is some U.S.$2,000 per kilowatt compared to $1,200 for one using imported coal and $650 for a combined cycle plant fuelled by natural gas. Dr Phiyasawat Amranan, deputy secretary general of the National Energy Policy Office, said the Government does not need to come to a decision today on whether to proceed with the nuclear project because there is still insufficient information with which to make a decision. "We have 12 years before the planned nuclear power plant is envisaged. We still have a few more years (to decide)," he said. But Dr Phiyasawat, a key state energy planner, suggested to Business Post that nuclear energy is destined to have a lower priority in the overal] near-term energy plan. There are energy alternatives which can be made available to meet the country's fast-growing electricity demand more easily than nuclear, he said. "Why don't we first look into imported coal and LNG (liquefied natural gas)? More natural gas from the Gulf of Thailand will become available for power plant fuels," he said. "Furthermore, there is the potential for increasing power supply to Thailand from hydro- electric projects in Laos, and there is potential for tapping huge hydro-electric resources in Burma," he added. State energy planners' latest stance on nuclear energy comes less than three months after Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said Thailand may have to take the nuclear option in order to arrest the country's fastgrowing electricity demand. In his first public remarks on whether Thailand should build nuclear power plants, the Premier said the Government can neither overlook nor reject nuclear as a possible source of power generation. Alternative energy sources for Thailand have their limitations, Mr Chuan said, while acknowledging public concern about the safety risks and the high cost of nuclear power. Mr Chuan said public sentiment on the issue will be the most important factor deciding whether nuclear plants should be built here. The World Bank has suggested that Thailand drop its nuclear power plant project, which it sees as more expensive than other options. It advises Thailand to turn to natural gas, particularly imported LNG, and insists that nuclear power be considered only as a last option.
