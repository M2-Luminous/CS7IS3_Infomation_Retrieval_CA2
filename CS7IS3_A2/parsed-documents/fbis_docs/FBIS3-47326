Saito said: "There has been no change in our basic policy of abiding by the principles and spirit of the Japan-China Joint Communique; that is, relations with Taiwan will be limited to areas other than political. In line with this policy, we will decide on each individual visit after looking carefully at the substance of the visit and other relevant factors." This is believed to leave the possibility open for visits by high-ranking government officials in connection with economic issues or international conferences. Touching on a statement made by Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, at a news conference in Beijing negating the possibility of cabinet members visiting Taiwan, Saito said: "This was in reply to the question `will there be visits to Taiwan in the near future, for instance, before the end of 1994?' It did not mean anything more than that." He indicated that the foreign minister's remark would not restrain visits by cabinet ministers to Taiwan in the future.
