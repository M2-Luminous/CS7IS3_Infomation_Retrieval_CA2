Mucins, parliamentary secretary of the Latvian Interior Ministry, by A. Borovkov; place and date not given: "Evasive in the Meantime"] [Text] [Borovkov] First of all, I would like to find out what are the duties of the Interior Ministry parliamentary secretary. [Mucins] The interior minister and I are the political leaders of the ministry, while Colonel Staris, Interior Ministry state secretary, is the highest "uniformed" official in our department. There are three major groups of my official functions. First of all, I am responsible for relations with the legislature. There are a lot of committees in the parliament and Minister Kristovskis himself is working in one of them. Thus, at the sessions of committees, and even sometimes at the Council of Ministers, I have to represent the interests of my ministry. I sometimes speak at plenary sessions on behalf of the council, including the presentation of certain draft laws. Secondly, the parliamentary secretary takes part in the sessions of the Council of Ministers and its three committees. For example, I have recently reported on adopting a new progressive system of penitentiary institutions. We are eliminating camps and adopting the system of prisons. Finally, the third direction of my activity is so-called ministerial. It includes the drafting of documents, for example the ministry's charter, reorganizing our structures, and the like. Alas, whether someone likes it or not, sessions take up half of my working time. [Borovkov] To what extent does the legal footing correspond to the current realities? [Mucins] Unlike other people, I have nobody to blame for this. If a necessary law does not exist I am the very person who is supposed to draft it. However, the analysis of criminal activities in the Republic shows that there is a need for certain corrections in the legal sphere. [Borovkov] What kind of corrections? [Mucins] Take car thefts for example. It is easy to reach a conclusion about improving the procedure of trading and registering cars, adopting other measures. Last year, more than 1,800 cars were stolen and only 10 percent of those thefts have been investigated. This is much less than in other categories of crime. [Borovkov] Does organized crime exist in Latvia? [Mucins] Of course there is organized crime, and car thefts are a prime example. What is organized crime? First of all, this is a sociological rather than legal term. We will hardly have an article on organized crime in our criminal code. It is enough to have an article envisioning responsibility for being an organizer of a crime. However, we have had virtually no cases where we could prove this crime. Frankly speaking, we have only been arresting small fries. On the basis of operational data, we can only guess that this or other person is an organizer of a specific robbery, murder, or case of racketeering. Organized crime means a precise division of duties. Speaking of car thefts, there are people who learn that a new car has been registered (this also means that information leaks occur), others learn where the car is being kept, still others steal it, drive across the border, sell it, and so on. [Borovkov] What about the term "Mafia," which is so loved by the press? [Mucins] We are using this term to denote the merging of organized crime with state structures. For example, the merging of criminal groups with the militia was noticed as far back as the 1970's. This trend has hardly been decreasing ever since. It must be at the same level, if not higher. [Borovkov] However, almost the entire bureaucratic machine has been replaced in Latvia. [Mucins] I cannot cite any facts or concrete accusations in this regard, but the trend remains. We keep this in mind. A hundred hares do not amount to a single horse; a hundred suspicions do not amount to a single fact. In one particular case, an investigator acted as a middleman between an executive body official and a man who wanted to privatize a facility on favorable terms. However, these kinds of crimes should be fought by special structures. Regular police methods do not work. The police here work like a fire brigade, rushing to those places that are already on fire. Thank God, we somehow manage to do this, but we need specialists who could work on prevention, analyze data, and plan in advance. [Borovkov] Speaking of fighting economic crime, how are things going in this regard, given that the Department for Fighting Thefts of Socialist Property has been disbanded? [Mucins] This is both good and bad. People from the department joined other structures, because they would not be able to work up to the new economic realities. On the other hand, we must form a structure for fighting thefts of not only socialist but all kinds of property, corruption, fake bankruptcy, and the like. However, we need new people with a new kind of knowledge. When we are through reorganizing the general structure of the ministry, we will get down to reorganizing individual departments.
