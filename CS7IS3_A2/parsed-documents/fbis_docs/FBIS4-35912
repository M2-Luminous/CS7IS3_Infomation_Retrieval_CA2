They also stress that the success of this peace process depends on commitment to the basic principles stipulated in the Madrid conference that unleashed the peace negotiations between Israel and the Arab parties directly concerned with the Arab-Israeli conflict. If we review what the peace process has thus far achieved, we will simply find that it continues to face one major obstacle, represented by the issue of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Such a withdrawal is a basic principle. Peace cannot be achieved or entrenched without implementing this principle in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy, particularly Resolutions 242 and 338. Moreover, without a full and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, any talk about peace will continue to move in a vicious circle, so any achievement on the path of peace will merely be like building peace on sand. The repeated visits to the region by the U.S. secretary of state and the Russian envoys, as well as the continued consultations held bilaterally and collectively as part of the bilateral and multilateral negotiations, have thus far failed to effect a clear Israeli commitment to full withdrawal from the occupied territories. The issue of withdrawal is still part of the Israeli maneuvers designed to fragment the Arab side, set timetables, propose phased solutions, and give only in installments. This will deprive the land-for-peace principle of both the meaning and legitimacy according to which the peace process was launched in the first place. The issue of full withdrawal in exchange for full peace is an essential link in any comprehensive solution that will securely resolve all issues pertaining to both the Palestine question and the overall conflict in the Middle East. However, this fact, which is ignored by the U.S. and Russian co-sponsors, has failed to spare the peace efforts of the Israeli attempts designed to conclude partial and separate deals. The emphasis by the U.S. and Russian governments on their good intentions, as well as the Arab parties' commitment to both the peace process and its principles, are not sufficient to force Israel into committing itself to the bases and principles of peace as long as such statements are nothing more than utterances of mere diplomacy. Political moves, whether U.S. or Russian, should be serious in order to promote the peace process in the right direction. These moves should be joined by the Israeli side, which rejects the concept of full withdrawal in exchange for comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict. Otherwise, the visits, moves, and tours will continue to revolve in a vicious circle of action and reaction, and they will never succeed in pushing the peace process forward.
