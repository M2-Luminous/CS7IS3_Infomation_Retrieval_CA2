In a statement to the Split weekly NEDELJNA DALMACIJA Prlic said that Bosnia-Herzegovina can only survive as a union of the republics of the three constituent nations -- Moslems Serbs and Croats, and that if such a state is formed Herceg-Bosna would not secede. Asked if Herceg-Bosna and the republic of Bosnian Serbs (RS) would recognize each other Prlic said that this would automatically take place if the union is formed for it provides for the existence of three mutually recognized republics. Even though the Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Serbs assured one third of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina the Moslems asked for at the last round of peace talks in Geneva and Brussels last month, the Moslems again turned down the plan saying that they were dissatisfied with the quality of the territories. What the Bosnian Moslem leadership wants is a Moslem-dominated unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was confirmed Wednesday by Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic who said that the Moslems have to fight for a united Bosnia and the preservation of Islam there and called for new military operations. He also stressed that his troops were now 200,000 strong and that things were now different. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina broke out in April 1992 because Izetbegovic insisted on a unitary state, which was first rejected by the Bosnian Serbs and later by the Bosnian Croats, who declared their own states within the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.
