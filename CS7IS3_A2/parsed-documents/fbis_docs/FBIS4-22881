Sobolev (Teploelektroproekt, Moscow) and Candidate of Technical Sciences G.G. Karpov (Rostovteploelektroproekt)] [Abstract] Scientific research and design planning work aimed at development of seismically stable thermal power plants and electric power networks is conducted by Teploelektroproekt in cooperation with VNIIG imeni B.Ye. Vedeneyev, Rostovteploelektroproekt and Energosetproekt. The first draft of additional requirements to the design of TPPs [thermal power plants] located in seismic areas has been developed. The work was necessitated by a substantial increase in the frequency of seismic activity in earthquake prone regions of the country where thermal power plants operate, are being built or scheduled for construction. Analysis of the effect of the 1988 Spitak earthquake on power generating facilities corroborated the need for this work. Causes of earthquake caused damage to power plants were determined, and specific ways to improve seismic stability of their buildings and facilities have been outlined. Foreign experience was also taken into account. The additional requirements have been substantiated. At present a TPP is considered seismically stable if it remains ecologically and technologically safe in a maximum rated earthquake (MRE) with a once in a 1000 years probability and provides uninterrupted supply of electric power and heat after a design earthquake (DE) with a once in a 100 years probability. Because TPP buildings and facilities have different functions, a differentiated approach to designing them for seismic stability is used. However, it is suggested that it is more expedient to design all TPP buildings, facilities and equipment for the same level of seismic action with the frequency of once every 100 years. Based on the analysis and results of the work 13 additional requirements are presented.
