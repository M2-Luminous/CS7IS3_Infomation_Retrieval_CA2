Apart from this, in his opinion it is a matter for historians. Even if such sales did take place, they would have been secret and could now probably only be traced in the Ministry of National Defense. Zbigniew Ostrowski pointed out that the most modern Soviet weapons have never been available to Poland, so they could not have been sold to the Americans. He also emphasized that the United States does not make available the most modern weapons to its allies, either.
