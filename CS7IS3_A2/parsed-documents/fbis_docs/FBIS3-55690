I welcome the invitation to participate in the program called Partnership for Peace which was presented this morning by the heads of the NATO states and partners in cooperation. This is the road for Lithuania for complete integration into NATO political and military structures. Lithuania looks positively at the efforts made by NATO to respond to the changes in Europe and in the world and to ensure a stable entrance into the 21st century. I believe that the document defining the nature of partnership signed by Lithuania and NATO will be a consistent supplement to the efforts made by Lithuania to set up a democratically controlled military force and relevant relations between military and civilian institutions. I have entrusted the government and the leaders of relevant ministries to take the necessary steps and get ready to sign the document on partnership, to assess the supplies, the resources, and the forces, and to prepare a program of measures through the implementation of which all the common objectives of partnership will be achieved.
