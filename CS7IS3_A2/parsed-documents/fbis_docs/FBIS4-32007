In the article in TINERAMA, journalist Ioan Itu supposed the former priest had belonged to the Romanian Securitate, and to prove it, the journalist published in the above mentioned issue the facsimile of Tokes' engagement paper with that organization. The mentioned newspaper also told about a 20,000 lei-bill handed over by Laszlo Tokes to a Hungarian secret service officer. On June 16, the Episcopal Reformed Diocese Office belonging to Piatra Craiului also mentioned in an official statement that the main reason for this slander is to discredit the [1989] revolution started in Timisoara and to disgrace the heads of revolution and the democratic opposition.
