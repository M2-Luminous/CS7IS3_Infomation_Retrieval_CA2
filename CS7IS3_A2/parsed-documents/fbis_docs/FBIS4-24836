The leader of the group, Vice Legislative Speaker Wang Chin-ping, said consultations would be on already-confirmed debts, and that the Taiwan delegation would ask, on behalf of an association formed by the Taiwanese soldiers and their relatives, for compensation 7,000 times the soldiers' original salaries. Wang said the demand is many times what the Japanese Government has said it would pay -- about 100 times the original salaries -- and that therefore, no concrete results are expected. Although not expecting any breakthrough in this trip, he said he would try his best to make Japan realize the urgency of the matter and his hope for an early resolution. Wang said the group would meet Thursday with Japanese officials on reparations, and will also call on leaders of the Japanese Diet during their stay. Wang and his group will return to Taipei on Sunday.
