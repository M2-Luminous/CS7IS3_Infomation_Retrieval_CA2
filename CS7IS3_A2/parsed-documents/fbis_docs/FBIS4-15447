FBIS4-15447 "drsov068_v_94011" FBIS-SOV-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Lithuania Board: Polish, Lithuanian TV To Share Channel Board: Polish, Lithuanian TV To Share Channel WS0704163394 Tallinn BNS in English 1306 GMT 7 Apr 94 WS0704163394 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS -- The Lithuanian state radio and TV board decided on Tuesday [5 April] that channel 38 will be shared by the Polish TV Polonia and the Vilnius-based Baltijos TV. The state-run TV Polonia, which recently replaced Polish national TV on the channel, will show its programs every second day three times a week. The private Baltijos TV, which is a Lithuania-USA joint venture, will have four days on the channel. Gintaras Songaila, Baltijos TV director general, said he will bring action against the board. In his words, politics is mixed up in the board's decision and in its activities in general. Gediminas Ilgunas, chairman of the radio and TV board, agrees that the decision is not very good. He added, however, that a suggestion to divide time on the channel by hours was not perfect either. Ilgunas said the dispute over channel 38 started last December when the board decided that Polish state TV would broadcast for 45 hours a week and the remaining time would be rented by way of contest. But Polish TV and Baltijos TV, which won the remaining time on the channel in a contest, failed to agree on air time, he said. In Ilgunas' words, Polish TV complained that Baltijos TV ignores its interests and interrupts its programs whenever it wants. "The Poles got what they wanted," Songaila said. He noted that his station is able to fully cover time on channel 38. Songaila said the board's decision violates laws regulating media activities in Lithuania. According to the existing legislation, a media company must be registered in Lithuania and the share of foreign capital in it must not exceed a half of its stock capital. Why doesn't this apply to TV Polonia, Songaila said. But the board has not yet discussed the situation on a channel rented by TELE-3, a private TV station that broadcasts throughout Lithuania. Liucija Baskauskaite, the station's owner, presented document to the board confirming that the station paid all bills to communication services. Ilgunas said the station's debt reached 165,000 lits in mid-March. The Lithuanian radio and TV transmission center earlier submitted a claim for arbitration demanding to cancel its contract with TELE-3 because of its debts for transmitter rent. The center accused the station of violating other terms of the contract. But the state arbitration failed to pass any decision Wednesday.
