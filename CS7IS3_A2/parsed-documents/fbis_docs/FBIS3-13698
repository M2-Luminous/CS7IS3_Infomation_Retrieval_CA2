It also officially accepted Resolution 715 on 26 November 1993. Likewise, it has demonstrated its willingness to cooperate with the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to enforce the monitoring mechanism and achieve the objectives set forth in Resolution 687 in this regard. It has extended all necessary facilities in this regard. Of particular importance in this regard is the fact that Iraq pledged in October 1993 that the Special Commission and the IAEA would be able to conduct the required inspections, even after Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 is implemented per Document No. S/26,571, Paragraph 13. The very text of Resolution 687 provides that the UNSC shall fully implement Paragraph 22 of the said resolution immediately after Iraq officially accepted Resolution 715, something which has failed to materialize. In accordance with the promises made by Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the Special Commission, contained in Annex 3 of the joint report submitted to the UNSC in the aftermath of high-level technical talks held in New York in September 1993, per Document No. S/26,451, Paragraph 14 of Annex 2, and Paragraph 7 of the report, the Special Commission was supposed to have quickly embarked on the official implementation of the monitoring measures enshrined in Resolution 715 as of 1 December 1993, particularly since Iraq officially accepted the said resolution on 26 November 1993. Similarly, the chairman of the Special Commission should have submitted his report to the UNSC on Iraq's compliance within a period not exceeding six months from the aforementioned date so that Paragraph 22 may be implemented. Also worth mentioning in this regard is the fact that the six-month period Ambassador Ekeus spoke about last fall was not originally mentioned in the text of Resolutions 687 and 715. The chairman of the Special Commission imposed it by himself or upon the request of certain states. However, what happened is that after about four months after Iraq's official approval of Resolution 715 on 26 November 1993, the chairman of the Special Commission still did not announce the date of the official start of the implementation of the monitoring system although monitoring procedures actually began before Iraq's official approval of Resolution 715. This is proven by the installation and operation of cameras in October 1993 in the al-Rafah and al-Yawm al-'Azim locations to monitor missile testing. Moreover, three inspection teams observed temporary monitoring measures for three months starting from the beginning of 1993 at the Ibn-al-Haytham Center for Missile Research and some other important installations. This is in addition to the continuous presence of UN teams for over one and a half years in the al-Muthanna establishment in connection with chemical weapons. Helicopters have been continuously and intensively conducting sorties for surveillance purposes since 1991. It is also worth mentioning that the IAEA emphasized in October 1993 that it started monitoring procedures 15 months earlier and that it was convinced that the surveillance plan was being implemented satisfactorily and that all the IAEA needed to inform the Security Council of Iraq's compliance with its commitments in accordance with Paragraph 22 was Iraq's official acceptance of Resolution 715, Document F-26571, Paragraphs 16 and 19. This position by the Special Commission means the Commission will be late in presenting its report on Iraq's compliance with Section C of Resolution 687 to the Security Council so that the latter will consider the implementation of Paragraph 22. This means the postponement of the implementation of Paragraph 22 to an unspecified date. The technical pretexts and excuses being used to justify this behavior are baseless because there is no technical reason whatsoever to make the Special Commission abstain from officially declaring the start of the monitoring plan. It has become clear to us that the Special Commission's stand is a premeditated political stand instigated by specific parties in the Council, which do not wish to lift the unjust embargo on Iraq and want to impose on Iraq conditions that have nothing to do with the Council's resolutions. They announce policies that are not related to the Council's resolutions, as contained in the article "Confronting the Renegade Countries" published by Anthony Lake, the U.S. President's adviser for national security affairs, in the March 1994 issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine and the other statements along the same line by U.S. officials. These quarters exploit their influence in the Council and in the Special Commission to impose the continuation of the embargo on Iraq. Second: It is impermissible to make the question of maintaining the embargo on Iraq a diplomatic or political game. The embargo has led to the death of Iraqi citizens and to depriving an entire people of normal living conditions. The reports by the UN agencies confirm the tragic results of this unjust embargo, which has been imposed for four years. Warning 237 issued in July 1993 by the joint mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] and the World Food Program and the report by the FAO mission issued in November 1993 evaluating the food situation in Iraq clearly describes this situation. Statistics also show that the mortality rate among children below five years of age has risen sevenfold from 1989 to 1993, and fourfold for those above this age. The comprehensive embargo that has been going on for four years has greatly damaged the level of public services, education, health, transportation, agriculture, civilian industries, environment and all other fields. From this premise, the approach the Iraqi people and their leadership have toward the embargo issue cannot be one of indulgence toward the timetable certain members or countries view as a political game. For Iraq, this is a question of life and death. Third, following these experiences, Iraq is not reassured that the Council, in view of the pressure by specific countries, will ever fulfill its obligations since Iraq has already fulfilled its obligations under Section C of Resolution 687. This lack of reassurance reflects itself on Iraq's assessment of the Council's stand on this issue and the other topics mentioned in the other pertinent Council resolutions. Iraq demands that the Council apply Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 immediately and without any additional restrictions or conditions, that it respect the provisions of its resolutions, that it interpret them in a sound legal manner, and that it reject the tendentious political interpretations of its resolutions that some states are seeking to impose on the Council. Allowing for such political interpretations of resolutions as noted in some parties' statements not only clashes with the provisions of the resolutions themselves, but actually means that every party inside and outside the Council can have its own interpretation. This means that the Council resolutions will have no specific meaning or target. Fourth, regarding the other topics mentioned in the relevant Security Council resolutions, including the issue of Kuwait, which was raised by some member states in their contacts with the Iraqi side, we would like to point out the following: A. This issue is absolutely unconnected with the issue of applying Paragraph 22, in accordance with the provisions of Resolution 687. B. Iraq has taken measures regarding this issue in accordance with Paragraph 2A of Resolution 686 of 1991 and informed the Council of this. Iraq has also accepted Resolution 687, which dealt with the subject. C. It is obvious that when the Council fulfills its commitments toward Iraq as cited in Paragraph 22 and proves its credibility and good intentions toward a UN member state that contributed to the founding of the International organization, and when Iraq feels that its rights and legitimate interests have been respected by the Council and that its sovereignty has been respected by the Council member states, which are violating its sovereignty through the imposition of a ban on military and civilian flights in the north and south and interference in its domestic affairs in all possible means, a new atmosphere will certainly emerge and the issue can then be discussed in accordance with the rules regulating relations among states as cited in the UN Charter and the Arab League Charter, which Iraq has always respected. This atmosphere will also help the Arab states in the region to solve their problems in a peaceful manner on the basis of mutual respect for rights and interests and in accordance with the rules of the Arab League Charter, which regulates relations among the Arab states. The Security Council can, in such a climate, also contribute to encouraging the Arab states to achieve this objective and in a manner that guarantees the peace and security and rights of states in a fair manner. Fifth, Iraq hopes these points will be studied very carefully by the Council. When the Security Council asks a certain state to abide by a resolution, the resolution must also be binding on the Council and the Council must apply the commitments stipulated by the Charter or by the resolution itself toward that state. Regarding the resolutions passed on Iraq, their provisions are clear. There are commitments and steps that Iraq is required to implement and Iraq has implemented the substantial parts of them, including all those pertaining to the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. Therefore, the Council is requested to respect and implement Iraq's rights as stipulated by the Council resolutions. The issue cannot be dealt with by asking one party to honor its commitments without the other party's implementation of its commitments. The continuation of this state, from which the Iraqi people are bitterly and harshly suffering, places the people and leadership of Iraq in a position that will certainly lead to a reassessment of the situation and to an action [tasarruf] that will protect the Iraqi people from the harm to which they are being exposed. We are awaiting tangible steps that we hope will emerge in the near future, foremost of which is the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 without additional restrictions or conditions. Please accept our great respect and appreciation. [Signed] Tariq 'Aziz, deputy prime minister, New York, 16 March 1994
