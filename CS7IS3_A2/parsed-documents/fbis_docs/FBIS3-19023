This happened yesterday during the discussion of a statute law aimed at amending the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Aruba debate was one of the rare occasions in which the Chamber was filled with "special delegates" from the Antilles and Aruban states. The last time this happened was almost 10 years ago, when a provision was included in the Charter stipulating that Aruba would assume a separate status as of 1 January 1996, becoming independent as of the same date under international law. In the bill currently on the table, this provision has been scrapped. Minister Hirsch Ballin was assisted in the defense by the prime ministers of Aruba and the Antilles, the ministers plenipotentiary from both countries, and the Aruban justice minister. Only the two single-person groups, the Reformist Political Federation and the Center Democrats, opposed the bill. The Parliaments of the Antilles and Aruba unanimously supported it. The Netherlands still includes the condition that talks with Aruba on improving the administration of the island and reorganizing government finances are held and implemented in good time. [passage omitted] Aruban opposition leader Eman lashed out fiercely at the government of Prime Minister Oduber, who, he said, has brought the island to the brink of bankruptcy with an overly generous spending policy and by appointing political friends to official posts. Eman warned Minister Hirsch Ballin that financial support by the Netherlands for Oduber in Aruba will be construed as "a bonus for improper administration." The Aruban prime minister had already said before the debate that Eman practiced dishonest opposition and has no time for the radical re-organization which he initiated.
