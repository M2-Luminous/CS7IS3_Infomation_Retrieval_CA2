Hosokawa and Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji reached the accord in a meeting at the prime minister's official residence, the officials said. Details of Hosokawa's itinerary will be further worked out by the two governments, they said. Zhu conveyed messages from Chinese President and Communist Party Leader Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng saying they are looking forward to meeting Hosokawa in Beijing in March, the officials said. Hosokawa replied that he looks forward to the trip, they said. During the 50-minute meeting, Hosokawa called for China's continued role in persuading North Korea to accept international inspections of its suspected nuclear weapons development sites, the officials said. Hosokawa told Zhu that Pyongyang should further accept special inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and implement an accord with South Korea to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. Zhu, currently on a nine-day visit to Japan starting Wednesday, was quoted as saying there have been developments recently concerning North Korea's suspected nuclear problem and that China intends to extend efforts within its capacity. Hosokawa gave high marks to China's efforts to promote reform and open-door policies and added Japan will continue to support such efforts, the officials said. Zhu predicted that mutual economic interdependence between China and Japan will further strengthen, noting that trade between the two amounted to 39 billion dollars last year, up 54 percent from the previous year. The vice premier also noted that Japan is now China's top trading partner exceeding Hong Kong, while China is Japan's second biggest trading partner. Zhu was quoted as saying the two nations should further promote economic exchanges. Hosokawa voiced support for China's bid to become a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the officials said. Zhu told Hosokawa that China has been making various efforts to become a GATT member, lowering duties and improving transparency of its legislation. He handed Premier Li's letter to Hosokawa which asked for Tokyo's continued cooperation in China's bid to enter the world trade body. Foreign Ministry officials said Beijing has apparently been sending similar letters to other major countries as well. Hosokawa told the Chinese that Japan is interested in China's environmental preservation and military expenses. The prime minister cited Japanese guidelines in extending official development assistance (ODA) which takes note of such fields. Zhu told Hosokawa that China has been making various efforts to preserve the environment including beefing up legislation, they said. The vice premier noted China's military expenses in 1993 were 43.7 million yuan (about 655 million yen), about 1 percent of its gross national product (GNP). He said the military expenses are mostly used for defensive purposes and that the expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary to defend its population of 1.2 billion. Zhu told Hosokawa he does not think it appropriate to link China's human rights record to the "most-favored-nation" trade status in the United States.
