FR941216-2-00150 FR941216-2-00088 Personal information to satisfy general legal requirements, when applicable, such as citizenship, veterans' preference, minimum and maximum age requirements, and proof of competitive status. Applicant preferences, where applicable, such as work location, work schedule, type of employment (permanent or temporary). OPM's flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, tells applicants they must furnish the information requested in the flyer and the information requested in the agency vacancy announcement. The flyer also tells applicants not to send certain information, for example, college transcripts, unless requested in the vacancy announcement. (19) May an agency use the flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, in conjunction with its vacancy announcements to tell applicants what to include in their résumés or applications? Yes. The flyer is intended to help agencies communicate with applicants about the types of information to include in their applications. The vacancy announcement may repeat all the information requested in the flyer or a copy of the flyer may be attached to the vacancy announcement. If the vacancy announcement merely references the flyer, applicants need to know where they can get a copy to assure their applications are complete. Until the procedures become widely known, agencies may want to include full information in their announcements. (20) Can vacancy announcements require applicants to describe all their work experience over a period of years, for example, to show where they were employed over the past 5 years? Since a goal of the new application process is reducing the burden on applicants, they should be asked to describe only job-related qualifications rather than their entire work history over a period of years. (21) Can agencies require applicants to certify on their résumés that the information they have provided is correct? This certification is not needed at the beginning of the employment process. Before appointing an individual, the agency will get the certification on the Declaration for Federal Employment. (See next question.) The optional application also contains a certification and the flyer alerts applicants that they will be required to sign a certification. (22) The SF 171 contained questions about an applicant's suitability for Federal employment. Under the new procedures how will agencies obtain this information? Suitability questions are now included on the new Declaration for Federal employment. Separating this sensitive information from the job application makes it possible to restrict access to the information and thus to give greater protection to an individual's privacy. (23) Is the new Declaration for Federal Employment required for all Federal civilian service appointments or just appointments in the competitive service? Before anyone can be appointed or converted to a new appointment in the competitive service, the excepted service, or the Senior Executive Service, he or she must execute a Declaration for Federal Employment. In addition, the form may be needed in position changes, for example, for agency determinations concerning nepotism and for OPM background investigations. OPM will publish specific requirements in The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions. (24) At what point in the hiring process should agencies require individuals to complete the new Declaration for Federal Employment? An individual must complete the form before he or she is appointed, but agencies should not routinely ask applicants to submit a Declaration along with their résumé or application. A major reason for creating the Declaration was to separate qualifications information from suitability information so that agencies could better protect the privacy of individuals by restricting access to more sensitive background data. Given the privacy concerns and the intent to reduce the burden on applicants, OPM strongly encourages agencies to require the Declaration only from the job finalists who have met all qualifications requirements except where to do otherwise would have a significantly adverse impact on the hiring process. (25) Can agencies use the SF 61&hyph;B, Declaration of Appointee, after December 31, 1994? No, the OMB authorization for that form expires on December 31, 1994. After that date agencies must use the new Declaration for Federal Employment before appointing an individual in the Federal civilian service. (26) After December 31, 1994, if an applicant chooses to use the SF 171 as an application form, must he or she complete the Background Information section (items 37&hyph;47 on conduct and suitability)? Must the individual sign the application? No. An applicant using the SF 171 by choice is required to provide only the information in OPM's flyer Applying for a Federal Job and in the agency vacancy announcement. The hiring agency will obtain the suitability information and signature through the new Declaration for Federal Employment. (27) Did OMB approve the proposed collection of information relating to military spouse preference and child care providers? Yes. To determine eligibility for military spouse preference as required by section 806 of the Defense Authorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;145), the Department of Defense may include the following question in its materials, for example, in job announcements or in the Declaration for Federal Employment. Are you applying to exercise Spouse Preference? (␣) Yes␣␣(␣) No If yes, attach a copy of your sponsor's active duty military orders of assignment to the geographic location of the position vacancy or written evidence or documentation that verifies eligibility. To assure compliance with section 231 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647), agencies may include the following questions on the Declaration for Federal Employment signed by applicants for Federal child care positions: Have you ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child? If ``Yes,'' provide the date, explanation of the violation, disposition of the arrest or charge, place or occurrence, and the name and address of the police department or court involved. Note: A Federal agency is required by law to conduct a criminal check. In addition to the purposes explained in block 16, your signature also certifies that (1) your response to this question is made under penalty of perjury, which is punishable by (insert Federal punishment for perjury); and (2) you have received notice that a criminal check will be conducted, of your right to obtain a copy of the criminal history report made available to the employing Federal agency, and of your right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in the report. To assure compliance with Pub. L. 101&hyph;647 and also with section 408 of the Miscellaneous Indian Legislation (Pub. L. 101&hyph;630), the Departments of Interior and Health and Human Services may add the following question to the Declaration for Federal Employment, for positions that involve regular contact with or control over Indian children:
