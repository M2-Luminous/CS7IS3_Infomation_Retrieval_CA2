The report said that these soldiers who were sent from Takeo Province to Route 10 by their puppet commanders did not want to fight and kill fellow Cambodians. They want peace and national reconciliation so that they can return to their parents, wives, and children. The report added that these puppet soldiers from Takeo Province have seen with their own eyes how hundreds of the two-headed government's soldiers from both the Vietnamese and U.S. puppet groups were killed and wounded every day. Some stepped on land mines or were attacked by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, while others were shot dead by the communist Vietnamese and U.S. puppet commanders who were angry that the two categories of puppet soldiers kept refusing to fight. Some of them died of malaria and a shortage of food and medicine. Under such conditions, the two categories of puppet soldiers mobilized from all areas have continued to desert the battlefield in groups of 10, 20, and even hundreds. The fleeing puppet soldiers do not hesitate to shoot at anyone who tries to stop them.
