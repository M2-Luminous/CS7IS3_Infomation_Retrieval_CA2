And when do you expect the talks to resume? [Qaddumi] From the outset we insisted that the talks be resumed after the Security Council adopts a resolution and after measures are taken on the ground. In other words, providing measures for the protection of our people in the occupied territories, especially in Hebron, in order to create a suitable climate for the negotiating process. Hence, to date we have been discussing those measures with the Israelis and the cosponsors before beginning talks about other issues. [Arna'ut] Recent Palestinian statements indicate that there is an emphasis by the Palestinian leadership on the presence of international protection in Hebron although there are other areas which require such protection no less than Hebron. Is the leadership insisting on the presence of this protection in Hebron only? [Qaddumi] Security Council Resolution 904 covered all the occupied territories, but in particular we asked for special arrangements in Hebron because of the presence of settlers and students there and because of the ongoing friction in the city, which regrettably witnessed those repugnant massacres. However, all the measures that we demanded cover all the occupied territories. Those include the presence of international observers and Palestinian security forces and the adoption of measures aimed at disarming the settlers and preventing them from wandering around with their weapons. Moreover, other measures will have to be adopted so that we will have enough reason to resume the talks. [Arna'ut] Do you believe that the international presence, on the basis of the Security Council resolution, will be adequate in providing protection for the Palestinian people under occupation? [Qaddumi] This is one of the measures that must be taken in accordance with the Security Council resolution, but the definite guarantee for our people in the occupied territories is when the Palestinian police assumes this protection. Above all, there must first be a speedy Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the Jericho area. [Arna'ut] Don't you believe that the presence of police in the Hebron area, then in other parts of the West Bank, will be a deviation from the Declaration of Principles? And in light of Israeli procrastination, will this not mean -- as some observers have indicated -- that Gaza and Jericho will be first and last? [Qaddumi] This is neither correct nor accurate. The withdrawal is supposed to begin on 13 April. Afterward, the Israeli forces will withdraw from all heavily populated areas and be deployed along the red line. Thus, there will be an initial and speedy withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, then before elections are held in July there will be another withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories. [Arna'ut] Do you expect the arrival of the first vanguards of the Palestinian police to the occupied territories? [Qaddumi] First of all agreement must be reached on security measures, then in the talks we will discuss the date for the entry of these battalions into Gaza and the Jericho area. [Arna'ut] What is your perception of the nature of Palestinian action in the period up to the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories? And are there any guarantees that a massacre, similar to the one in Hebron, will not be repeated? [Qaddumi] There are no guarantees that similar incidents will not occur, but world public opinion, which has denounced and condemned such deeds, has put Israel in a difficult position. However, we cannot say for sure that such deeds will not be repeated. We have absolutely no confidence in the occupation. As long as there is occupation and as long as Israeli soldiers suppress the Palestinian people, resistance must continue by all available means. Arna'ut] Don't you think there is a contradiction between the continuation of the talks and the practices by the Israeli authorities against the sons of our people? [Qaddumi] First of all, war is another form of policy. Second, it does not at all prevent talks from taking place. These sorts of talks were conducted when Vietnam was waging a war. Vietnam witnessed the most abhorrent kinds of inhuman wars and the most intensive bombing during the negotiations that were held between the Americans and the Vietnamese. This is the nature of aggressive wars waged by occupation forces and international imperialist forces. [Arna'ut] Many calls have been made by the Palestinian street to the Palestinian leadership to halt the talks until a change occurs in the Israeli position. Meanwhile, the leadership is going to decide to resume the talks. How could the leadership be harmonious with the mood of the masses in the Palestinian street? [Qaddumi] First of all, undoubtedly leaderships are the ones representing public opinion. Second, what is the alternative to negotiations? Will we achieve what we want if we halt the talks completely or if we walk out of the talks and not insist on implementation of the Security Council resolutions in terms of the adoption of measures for the protection of our people? [Arna'ut] Does continued Israeli settlement activity in Jerusalem not represent a violation of the Oslo accord and the bases and principles of the invitation to the Madrid conference? [Qaddumi] The United States and European countries say that settlements are an obstacle to peace. European countries stress in official communiques that settlements are illegal. In Resolution 465, the Security Council says that these settlements are illegal and must be dismantled. For all these reasons, we say that we adhere to international legitimacy and that the solution should be based on this legitimacy. We cannot make the slightest concession on these rights. [Arna'ut] What is the state of Arab coordination regarding the resumption of talks? [Qaddumi] We maintain bilateral contacts with our brothers in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan and consult on these issues. Although some Arab states believe the Oslo accord to be a deviation from Arab coordination, they must understand that there is a transitional stage. This stage does not exist in the other Arab tracks. We had to take off in order to conclude the transitional stage so that we would reach the final stage with the Arabs and so that all of us would negotiate over this stage, leading ultimately to a comprehensive peace agreement which all of us will sign at the same time. [Arna'ut] Did the Arab foreign ministers meeting today yield positive results for the Palestinian territories and the Arab arena in terms of reconciliation and joint Arab action, for example? [Qaddumi] There were positive indications. All the Arab foreign ministers agreed to the Palestinian decisions, supported the intifadah, stressed that Jerusalem was part of the occupied Palestinian territories, and issued a statement condemning the Hebron massacre. These are positive measures that have begun to evolve with time and prove the Arabs' desire to enhance Arab coordination and solidarity. [Arna'ut] Do you have a statement for the Palestinian people? [Qaddumi] If there is one thing I want to say it is that our conflict is long but we will triumph. I am not saying this to encourage our great people who have waited for many years, but the historical process affirms that we will triumph and regain all our rights. Patience is a good thing, but action and resistance should continue. While resisting, we are keen for the safety of our cadres and are trying to reduce our losses as much as possible. We will continue in this struggle and will not become restless. We will act when we see that such action is beneficial to our cause.
