It emphasized on more than one occasion that its acceptance of this stems from the letter and spirit of the resolution, which was issued in accordance with the provisions and principles of the UN Charter, which guarantees the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states. Accordingly, the Government of the Republic of Yemen pursued all possible means to entrench the cease-fire and thus prevent the rebels and those standing behind them from prolonging the conflict, shedding more Yemeni blood, and internationalizing an internal problem. Our people have encountered this problem and our valiant Armed Forces have foiled its aims. Out of its concern to put an end to those desperate attempts, the Government of the Republic of Yemen made a fourth attempt to entrench the cease-fire. The Yemeni members of the military committee, formed by the brother chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces before the rebels exploded the military situation in preparation for their secessionist announcement, were instructed to entrench the cease-fire. Despite that sincere initiative, the secessionist rebels immediately rejected it and shamelessly demanded international observers in the country, to be appointed by the UN Security Council. They have thus disregarded the fact that the Government of the Republic of Yemen has on more than occasion categorically rejected this. Concluding, the source said: News media reports said our country has accepted a proposal the rebels presented to brother Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's fact-finding envoy. This proposal was immediately rejected in part and parcel because it is in spirit and content a flagrant violation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 924; it also conflicts with it in letter and spirit. The source added that the maximum that our country has expressed readiness to accept is to discuss the possibility of reactivating the entire joint military committee, formed upon a decision by the brother chairman of the Presidential Council and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces. It is noteworthy that the joint military committee mentioned in the statement consists of six high-ranking Yemeni Armed Forces officers, five Jordanian officers, five Omani officers, the American military attache, and the French military attache.
