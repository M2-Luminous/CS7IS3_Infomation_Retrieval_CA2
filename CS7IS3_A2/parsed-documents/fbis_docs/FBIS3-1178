Capital outflows of over R16-billion [rand] had reached something of a "crescendo" last year due to political uncertainty and ongoing unrest, and total almost R50-billion since 1985 when the country introduced debt standstill arrangements. "1994 looks as though its going to go in the other direction," he told a business breakfast in Johannesburg. "We've had two good months so far, and march also looks alright." Mr Keys said SA's [South Africa] arrangements with its international creditor banks, worked out late last year, created a good long-term basis for the management of the country's capital account. He was confident the economic policies pursued by a government of national unity following April's elections would not divorce the country from the global economy. The country simply could not afford to adopt policies that would scare foreign investors as evidenced by SA's foreign exchange reserves which amounted to an alarmingly low level of five months of imports. The long-term creation of sustainable jobs could not take place with the limited amount of capital available. Instead, above average economic growth would have to be achieved. He expected the imperative of creating employment would drive the cabinet ministers responsible for the economy towards policies aimed at boosting growth. Mr Keys said the consensual approach towards national economic policy determination augured well for a future government, as well as the ability of the country's enterprises to emerge from one of its worst recessions. "We're in good shape now for future growth. A lot of business in the last period have become more efficient," he said referring to the competitive pressure of the country's re-integration into international markets and systems like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
