The ministry has already decided upon four areas in Mexico to assist Taiwan manufacturers in setting up investment and factories. The NAFTA formally went into effect at the beginning of this year. Due to the advantageous position of Mexico, the ministry has decided to put focus on developing markets in that country. The ministry's Investment Commission, the China External Trade Development Council, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Mexico jointly held the fact- finding mission and selected the areas most suited to the needs of local manufacturers. The ministry will hold forums explaining the investment targets in Taipei and Taichung over the next several days, as well as introducing the NAFTA and the effects of it on Taiwan.
