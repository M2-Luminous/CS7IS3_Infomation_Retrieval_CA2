Kovalevskyy warned against a possible explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant from the accumulation of a critical mass of plutonium and uranium in certain parts of the reactor. This frightening theory has its peculiarities, because the scientist based his calculations on his own research, still not acknowledged by official scientific circles. This is why Kovalevskyy's attempts to draw attention to his theory were ignored. However, if there is even the slightest chance that a new accident might occur, the hypothesis should be thoroughly examined, the more so since the author of the letter refers to analogous research by Japanese scientists. VECHIRNIY KYYIV sees its goal as receiving a clear and grounded response from representatives of the official scientific community. Today, we are publishing the first response, provided by physicist Yuriy Shvaydok, manager of the International Institute [as published]. Shvaydok: According to our calculations, there should have been another explosion at the Chernobyl plant in May 1989. I made the calculations along with Candidate of Technical Sciences M. Koponenko and radiologist V. Savin. A reaction indeed, was launched then; fuel caught fire and the temperature increased. However, the concrete plate cooled with liquefied nitrogen cracked because of a difference in temperatures and the accumulation of a critical mass was postponed. All the arguments furnished by A. Kovalevskyy are correct. He claims that the accumulation of uranium and plutonium presents a danger. This is correct, but the critical mass of plutonium is 14 kilograms and it may take a long time for the process to complete. However, the threat presented by americium is much more real. One should keep in mind that a huge plate is hanging on pieces of wire and pipes inside the containment bunker. Its fall would inevitably result in a gigantic dust cloud. We cannot rule out that this might bring the mass of americium-242 to a critical level. Americium is the material used to build neutron bombs. It takes 16 hours for americium-241 to transform into americium-242, while its critical mass is just a couple of grams. Taking into account the data on accumulation, periods of disintegration, and complete decomposition, I have come to the conclusion that the final explosion at the Chernobyl plant will take place on 22 May 1999. What will be the consequences? The one-kilogram bomb used on Hiroshima claimed 100,000 lives. The Chernobyl explosion could destroy mankind by initiating a ``chain reaction of reactors,'' both in Ukraine and abroad, including nuclear warheads. What should be done with the reactor? There was a suggestion to apply the ``green meadow'' method. To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to use this method in Chernobyl. The idea is a bluff. I think that preference should be given to so-called ``membrane technologies.'' Basically, they call for the use of flat membranes to equalize the concentration of matter in a solution. By using this method, we can interrupt the process of building up a critical mass. Following this, we may begin the decontamination of the Chernobyl facility.
