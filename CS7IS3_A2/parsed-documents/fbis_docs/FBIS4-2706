With nearly 10 million yuan it has raised, the project has set up schooling foundations in 21 counties and built 21 primary and secondary schools, the officials said. Poverty, plus the big flood in 1991, has led to the exodus of thousands of children in the province from their schools. But the Hope Project, which is helping to reverse the trend, has received wide support both from within and from outside the province. Donors range from kindergarten children to professors and government officials, as well as companies and other institutions. State Councilor Peng Penyun now personally underwrites one child's schooling. Youths in Tianjin made donations to build three schools. The China Pingan Insurance Company donated 500,000 yuan to help 1,000 children with their education. The company also helped build a primary school at Liuan County. Donators also included business people and artists from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overseas institutions and individuals have also given a helping hand. Chinese Americans in Los Angeles funded China's first Hope Project school in Jinzhai County. A Hong Kong entrepreneur donated 200,000 yuan. The United Nations Children's Fund and a British organization for children have also contributed to the cause. In 1993, the province raised 11 million yuan through the issue of a "love heart" lottery. Zhang Zongyou, a sophomore at Fuyang Teacher's College, has become China's first college student to reach campus through Hope Project help.
