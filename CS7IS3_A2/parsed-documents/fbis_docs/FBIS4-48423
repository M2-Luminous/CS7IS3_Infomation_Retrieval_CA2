The discovery has already been recognized by the World Health Organization, and many African and other countries have been expressing their interest in the new medicine. Emil Zinsou, the first head of state of Benin, held power until 1968. [Begin Zinsou recording] I then briefed the Angolan head of state on an important project. I am a doctor, and this project deals with a widespread disease among blacks, Africans, and the American people. It is called (?trypanosomiasis), a disease which attacks red cells. Like malaria, it is a very common disease among Africans. My compatriot here Professor Fagna found a medicine which had never been discovered before. He has already had an opportunity to treat some Angolans. Thus, we want to maintain with the Angolan people and government close contacts so that this medicine can cure the largest number possible of Africans. This will also permit us to develop efforts to discover new medicines for other diseases. The Angolan president received our views favorably. [end recording]
