Mitterrand, during a 30-minute meeting with Qian Qichen who arrived earlier Saturday, said he wanted to "give a new departure to our relations. It would be beneficial for both our countries." The French president was quoted by his spokesman Jean Musitelli, who added that the meeting "confirmed the desire for a rapprochement" on both sides. Mitterrand notably said that "we must increase initiatives now that we agree that things should improve." Qian told reporters after his meeting with Mitterrand that "the future of Sino-French relations is very promising," when asked about prospects for economic and industrial cooperation. But later Foreign Minister Alain Juppe rebuked China for its human rights record, saying "a lot must still be done" in that area. But Juppe said that Qian's trip to France marks "a new departure" in Franco-Chinese relations following the healing of the year-long rift over French arms sales to Taiwan. He said in addition to the human rights issue his meeting with Qian also focused on nuclear proliferation, regional conflicts and the role of the UN Security Council of which Beijing is a permanent member. The minister's three-day official visit was scheduled after Franco-Chinese relations returned to normal on January 12 when Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms contracts with Taiwan. Relations had been strained for a year after a contract for the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by the sale of gunboats, but Juppe said these contracts would be honored although France would not be signing any new arms sales agreements. Mitterrand noted that "in recent years, Franco-Chinese relations went through difficulties, particularly because of a dip in trade," according to Musitelli. Qian, pointing out that China was experiencing high growth rates, said his country "is a market with strong potential for foreign businesses, particularly French ones, which are welcome." French businessmen are keen to return to the lucrative Chinese market after being excluded over arms deals with Taiwan. A pro-Tibet committee on Thursday urged French authorities to push the issue of human rights in the autonomous region during Qian's visit. Qian was due to meet French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on Monday. Balladur is soon to pay a visit to China, probably in March. On Monday he is also to meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to discuss human rights issues, conditional on the United States renewing China's most favoured nation status next June.
