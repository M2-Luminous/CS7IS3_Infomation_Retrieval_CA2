The 2,400-ton HMS Unseen will officially leave naval service at a sad ceremony at Devonport on April 6 after just a few months of operational work. HMS Upholder will be decommissioned shortly afterwards and the other two vessels -- Ursula and Unicorn -- will follow later in the year. There is widespread dismay in the Navy that swingeing defence cuts has forced admirals to part with the conventionally powered Upholders -- the most advanced submarines of their type in the world. But the boats, which were originally designed for Cold War operations in the Greenland/Iceland Gap, will be either sold, leased or put into storage. A significant number of countries have expressed a keen interest in buying or leasing the submarines. They are understood to include India, Pakistan and Malaysia, which despite the current row over the arms for aid allegations still has a military requirement for submarines. Saudi Arabia is also very interested as it is anxious to acquire underwater capability in the Gulf, because of Iran's decision to buy three Russian Kilo submarines that could threaten a third of the world's oil supplies. The Iranians are also building mini-submarines that could be used for terrorist-style attacks as part of a huge programme to rearm their war machine. The Upholders would be ideal for operations in the shallow waters of the Gulf, as naval experts agree that nuclear submarines are more suited to deep water. As the Upholders are highly sophisticated vessels, the Navy could provide most, if not all, of the 44-strong crew if a leasing plan is approved. The move would be warmly welcomed by the Gulf states, such as Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. It would have the knock-on benefit of releasing Royal Navy frigates and destroyers tied up on the Armilla Patrol, which was set up in 1980. There is already a precedent for British forces operating for a foreign power. An infantry battalion of Army Gurkhas is based in Brunei, with the costs paid for by the Sultan.
