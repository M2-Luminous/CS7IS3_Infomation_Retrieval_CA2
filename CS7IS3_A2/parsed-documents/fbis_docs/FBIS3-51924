This is not the first time statements on this topic have been made by politicians, governments, or unity-seeking groups; however, the United States has always used various excuses to reject the idea of Cuba rejoining the organization. This time the rejection has been expressed by Alexander Watson, assistant secretary for Inter-American Affairs. When asked to comment on Bernd Niehaus' statement, Mr. Watson said that it was premature to consider Cuba's reinstatement in the OAS because, according to him, the factors that determined Cuba's exclusion from the OAS in 1962 continue to prevail. Let us stop here for a minute and add: At no time has Cuba requested reinstatement as a member of the OAS. Our country's position regarding this matter is as follows: If the regional organization believes it would be useful and convenient for Latin American unity, and should it request Cuba's reinstatement in the organization, then our country would have no reason to deny the request, despite the presence of the United States. Second, those excluding factors Mr. Watson has mentioned are none other than the socialist nature of the Cuban Revolution and Cuba's categorical refusal to assume the role of subordinate to U.S. policy. Since this is what Mr. Watson is referring to, then the factors continue to prevail. Third, Cuba, as a Latin American and Caribbean country, has worked as hard as any other country to ensure well-being and security for the peoples of the continent. It has worked hard to ensure unity and integration of the peoples of the continent, based on absolute respect for the rights of sovereignty and self-determination. We wish to remind Mr. Watson that: Cuba is willing to be a part of a united and integrated Latin American and to sit down and broach any issue. President Fidel Castro, at the First Ibero-American Summit in Guadalajara, Mexico in 1991, said: The important thing is to unite our wills and efforts to ensure not only economic, but also political integration and unity. There can be no greater commitment to a neighbor than this, whether or not we are members of the OAS. Mr. Watson must not forget this.
