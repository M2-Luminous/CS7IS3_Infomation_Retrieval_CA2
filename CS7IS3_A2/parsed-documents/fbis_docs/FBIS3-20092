There must be no leniency for the culprits, the Central Council said in Bonn today. The latest attack was "part of a series of shameful assaults on foreigners and perceived foreigners which have already claimed numerous lives." The public and society were called upon to "outlaw the spiritual fathers of such attacks who are based in the right-wing extremist parties and groupings and are preparing the ground for them with their slogans and pamphlets."
