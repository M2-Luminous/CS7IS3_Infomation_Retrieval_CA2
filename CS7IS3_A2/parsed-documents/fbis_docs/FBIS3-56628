This is what Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov said in an interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. He emphasized that the draft agreement on the peaceful settlement proposed by the Russian diplomat drew a mixed reaction from the Baku authorities. According to the Azerbaijani minister, the draft does not include provisions on the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian troops from all occupied territories, on which Baku has been insisting. Instead, the two sides were invited to sit down at a negotiating table to discuss all contentious matters. Gasan Gasanov asked the Russian diplomat to make substantial adjustments to the peaceful settlement draft. "Azerbaijan insists on a phased solution to the question," he told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent. "We will give security guarantees to the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, but in exchange the Armenian side must create all requisite conditions for a return of more than a million Azerbaijani refugees to the areas of their permanent residence." When asked by the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent about Baku's attitude to Moscow's proposal for the Iranian-Azerbaijani border to be protected jointly, the Azerbaijani minister said: "This proposal may be a matter of discussion after Azerbaijan and Iran sign a treaty "On the Regime of the Azerbaijani-Iranian Border." During my visit to Tehran we reached agreement on setting up a working group for drawing up this document."
