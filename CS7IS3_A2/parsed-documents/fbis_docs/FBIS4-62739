Kannik announced that the Israeli company "El-Bit" has expressed its interest in participating the contest for suppliers of radar and surveillance systems for the border guard. The Israel Aircraft Industries had mentioned possible supply of aircraft, but Kannik stressed that both military and financial aspects of the issue must be considered, due to Estonia's limited resources. The company TAAS Israel Industries had expressed its interest in the privatisation of the Estonian electronics factory Tarkom in order to organise the production of telephones there. Kannik also hoped that an agreement could be made, enabling to replace the unusable weapons by fit ones. The Estonian General Headquarters will have to present a list of equipment that needs to be replaced, Kannik said. Kannik met Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Friday [13 May] and discussed mostly general political issues, including the Estonian-Russian negotiations.
