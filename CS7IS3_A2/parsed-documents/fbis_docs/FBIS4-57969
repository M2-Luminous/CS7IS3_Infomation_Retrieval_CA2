A similar statement was once made by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. Wasmosy made this remark during an exclusive interview with the Buenos Aires newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO. Wasmosy said the Congressional Committee on Illegal Activities "puts its foot in its mouth so often it has totally lost credibility." The Paraguayan president noted that Fujimori "strengthened democracy" in Peru and expressed hopes that "the Paraguayan people will mature." Wasmosy said: "Part of the labor movement believes in violence and makes demands they know cannot be granted." Wasmosy added that the appearance of a guerrilla movement in Mexico and the people's rebellions in Paraguay and Argentina "are part of the same plan." He said former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti handled the democratic transition in Uruguay "better" than Raul Alfonsin did in Argentina. Juan Carlos Wasmosy said the peasant rebellion is part of an ultra-leftist campaign and that the Paraguayan military "have adapted to democracy even though no one wants to admit it." "We reduced the number of generals from 62 to 38. Congress stripped them even of their food coupons and reduced everything they had," Wasmosy said referring to his policy to reorganize the Armed Forces "without losing the chain of command or discipline." The Paraguayan president said labor leaders "know" the government "cannot give them a 40 percent salary increase because it would mean 40 percent inflation." Wasmosy ratified the Paraguayan commitment to the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) which his country is implementing with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. "There is no path other than integration, unless someone shows me something better," the president stressed, adding that he rejected labor leaders' requests to withdraw from Mercosur. He added: "This does not mean I will jump into an empty swimming pool and kill my country with me." Wasmosy said Paraguay supports the coordination of Mercosur member countries' economic policies. "We must find a way to understand the problems facing Brazilians without ruining Argentine industrialists," Wasmosy added. The president said that during the Alfonsin administration (1983-89), "there was a reaction against the Argentine Army" following the repression of guerrillas which resulted in some 9,000 deaths, according to official figures. "If the military did not do what they did, Alfonsin could not have done what he did, and President (Carlos) Menem could not have consolidated the Argentine economy," Wasmosy stressed.
