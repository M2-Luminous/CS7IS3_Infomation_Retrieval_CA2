You have suddenly changed your mind. Why? [Schnoor] It simply won't do to send indiscriminately all Croatian refugees back to a country marked by civil war. [DER SPIEGEL] But you yourself have agreed to precisely this resolution. [Schnoor] I agreed only on condition that the Federal Government and laender finance a repatriation program. It is to assist the refugees in making a new start in their homeland. Above all, we must create new housing. Only in this way can we avoid having the Bosnian Muslims who have fled to Croatia being driven out in turn and perhaps coming to the FRG. [DER SPIEGEL] Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther rejects participating in the financing of such a program. There is no money for it, he says. [Schnoor] The Federal Government, laender, communities--none of us have any money. But that is no reason to simply send people away, or to let them starve here. For me, the agreement on deportation stands or falls with repatriation assistance. If the Federal Government thinks it has no money for that, then I can only call upon Mr. Kanther to revise our joint resolution. Then everybody will stay here. [DER SPIEGEL] And how do you intend to enforce that? [Schnoor] I am bound by the extremely rigid Aliens Law. Nonetheless, I can order a general halt of deportations for six months. The crux is, however, that the refugees will be concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia, if the other laender don't go along. Naturally, it will also quickly get about among the refugees which land will not deport them. [DER SPIEGEL] So you are not solving the problem, only shifting it. [Schnoor] For a longer halt of deportations I do indeed need the approval of the federal interior minister, but not for other stipulations of the law. Thus I still have the possibility of examining individual cases. For example, I can instruct the authorities dealing with foreigners to exempt hardship cases from deportation. To me that means refugees from the occupied or destroyed part of Croatia, and those who have found refuge with relatives in North Rhine-Westphalia or come from ethnically mixed families. [DER SPIEGEL] What about deserters, whose fate will be totally uncertain in case of deportation? [Schnoor] I would also exempt deserters from deportation if they can expect punishment in Croatia. If I should not come to an agreement this week with my laender colleagues on regulations for such hardship cases, we shall initiate examinations of individual cases in North Rhine-Westphalia. Thereby many people can be helped, and Mr. Kanther can't do anything about it. [DER SPIEGEL] Foreign Ministry situation reports from the respective crisis regions play a decisive role in the decisionmaking by authorities and courts on the deportation of refugees. Its content of truth is controversial. Contrary to the recommendations of the UN refugee commissioner, the Foreign Ministry sees hardly any obstacles to deportations to Angola, a country where there is civil war. Does the Federal Government want to get rid of the costly refugees at any price? [Schnoor] I must defend the Foreign Ministry. I received good cooperation from the Foreign Ministry regarding refugees from Iraq, and in the case of Kurds from Turkey I had the best of experiences with the German ambassador in that country. [DER SPIEGEL] At the end of January, the Berlin administrative court stopped the deportation of a refugee from Angola, because the judges considered press reports more credible than the Foreign Ministry information. And Frieder Birzele, your Social Democratic colleague in Baden-Wuerttemberg, demands more precise information from the Foreign Ministry on the local situation, especially in the case of Croatia. [Schnoor] For me, the Foreign Ministry reports are only one decision-making aid. In addition, we also rely on the knowledge gained by refugee organizations. Certainly, the Foreign Ministry now and then is taken in by an informant. [DER SPIEGEL] Many Social Democrats agreed to the new asylum law passed last year by the Bundestag only after the coalition and opposition came to an agreement on Section 32a of the Aliens Law which stipulates a special status for refugees from civil wars. In the case of the Croats, this stipulation has no effect because Bonn does not want to pay. [Schnoor] It must not fail because of the petty souls in the Federal Government. The Federal Government must share half of the costs for civil war refugees; on this all interior ministers of the laender are agreed, even those of the Christian Union [CDU/CSU]. [DER SPIEGEL] Interior Minister Kanther is obstinate. He has stated that there is no money, and as long as the laender do not understand that, the special status for Croatian refugees will not be introduced. In agreeing to the asylum law, were the Social Democrats taken for a ride? [Schnoor] I insist: We must breathe life into Section 32a. If no accord can be reached with the federal government on its financing, we must look for other ways. [DER SPIEGEL] But no way bypasses Kanther? [Schnoor] Perhaps, yes. I can imagine, for example, that I might ask the North Rhine-Westphalian finance minister to withhold money for the refugees from those taxes which we pay over to the Federal Government. [DER SPIEGEL] A blocked account as a means of political pressure? This would be a novel approach in German domestic policy. [Schnoor] The new asylum law has greatly restricted the possibility of people finding refuge in Germany. The stipulation for civil war refugees should make it clear that the FRG stands in the humanitarian tradition of West Europe. Like many others, for years I fought against a change of Article 16 of the Basic Law. Only the stipulation of a special status for civil war refugees in the law enabled me to consent, albeit with clenched teeth. [DER SPIEGEL] As long as there is no agreement on the special status, civil war refugees will continue to go through asylum procedures. [Schnoor] What that means is absolutely clear: They are turned down and deported. That is the present practice which the federal interior minister apparently has in mind as a permanent regulation. [DER SPIEGEL] Don't the interior ministers of the laender make it easy for him, since the resolutions by the conference of interior ministers must be adopted unanimously? [Schnoor] Yes. Mr. Kanther is tricking the laender. Because of the different interests of the laender, the resolutions almost always are adopted at the lowest common denominator. For extending the halt in deporting civil war refugees, Kanther insists on the unanimous vote of 16 laender ministers. But for his approval, actually he does not even need this assent. With this demand he plainly diverges from the clear-cut legal situation. [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you let him get away with it? [Schnoor] I don't intend to. I want even more. I shall make every effort to ensure that on such an important issue as the civil war refugees, not the conference of interior ministers, but rather the majority in the Bundesrat must give its consent. In the Bundesrat, a simple majority is enough to decide which refugees under which conditions will be deported, or not.
