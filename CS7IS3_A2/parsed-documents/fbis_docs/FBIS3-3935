"We're concerned about inflationary pressure at present, but we are confident we can deal with it," Zhou Zhengqing, Vice-Governor of the People's Bank of China, told journalists in Beijing yesterday. Inflation in 35 major Chinese cities hit 23.3 percent in January. This far exceeds the government target of 10 percent for the whole year. "We will screen out excessive investment in fixed assets, but that does not mean a stringent policy will be imposed," said Dai Xianglong, another vice-governor of the bank. The country's commercial banks have big reserves and are ready to finance "sustained development" of the economy, he said. He predicted that domestic production would soon pick up from a low last month when the country was on holiday. Tight control over money supply means funding key projects afloat, while putting a brake on runaway investment, he explained.

At the moment about 80 percent of national banks loans are used to bolster large and medium-sized State-enterprises. The bankers sought to dispel fears that China's economy would continue to suffer money floods alternating with financial drought. "We have adopted a cautious monetary policy since last year, which is neither austere nor liberal." Dai said. Zhou outlined measures to control growing inflation. These included: -- Keeping a tight control over the national credit, especially in fixed assets; -- Bolstering the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, sugar and vegetables to curb price rises; -- Making every effort to recoup bank loans on time; -- Putting an end to borrowing from banks to settle the nation's budgetary deficit. Instead the deficit will be offset by the sale of State treasury bonds. Bond issues help stabilize the value of the yuan, Zhou said. Whereas funding the deficit with massive bank loans only leads to currency fluctuation. Zhou said the yuan had held its value against the US dollar after the unification of the two-tier foreign exchange rates. But he added that the devaluation of the yuan on the black market, must end. "On the whole, we're confident we can maintain a stable yuan against the US dollar. "This is because current account exchanges have been conducted at the market rate of $1 against 8.7 yuan," he explained. Zhou also said that the central bank would not raise its interest rate to boost savings. Bank deposits by city dwellers had increased 320 billion yuan ($36.8 billion) by the end of last year. Bank interest rates were raised twice last year as a result of runaway money supply that fueled the inflation. The country's foreign exchange reserves also jumped from $21.2 billion at the end of last year to $27.2 billion by February. Zhou said the nation will have embraced a unified inter-bank foreign exchange swap market in April, to which both domestic and foreign banks can have access. In another development, Zhou said China is to hammer out a series of banking laws this year to bring its financial reforms onto a legal track. The laws concerning the central bank, commercial banks, securities, negotiable instruments and insurance are all expected to be ready by the end of the year, he said.
