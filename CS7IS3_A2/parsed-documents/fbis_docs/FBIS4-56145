The roundtable was held at the Budapest University of Economics and was attended by Imre Szekeres, acting deputy chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), Gabor Kuncze, head of the parliamentary group and prime minister candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), Prime Minister Peter Boross of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), and Jozsef Torgyan, the national chairman of the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP). With respect to what should be done on the economy, participants said privatization should be reconsidered, the privatization techniques modified, and a balanced budget ensured. As regards the latter, Kuncze was of the opinion that the new government will probably have to submit a supplementary budget, with the idea of reducing government expenditures. Imre Szekeres said the new cabinet faces "fire extinguishing" work in the economic sphere. He said a lot depends on how the outgoing government deals with handing over the ongoing matters, and on how in-depth the analyses and information it provides will be. In the discussion of economic issues, Boross said economic growth should definitely receive top priority in the future. Szekeres voiced the hope that the new government can be formed by the end of June or the beginning of July. In detailing the mechanism of political and coalition coordination, the officials of the individual parties set forth different views. Peter Boross was of the opinion that a constant coordination constraint can easily render government work impossible. On the other hand, the senior MSZP and SZDSZ politicians considered a coalition agreement to be indispensable, and for efficient legislative work they stated that they consider it necessary for the six parliamentary parties to reach consensus. Szekeres said the Socialists would like to have a coalition government. He said that if the MSZP will be in the position to ask coalition partners to participate in the government, then the parties it can seriously consider, based on similarity in principle and policy of the manifestos, are primarily the SZDSZ, and secondly the Federation of Young Democrats. The matter of the Hungarian president's authority, and the identity of the future president, was also discussed at the roundtable. Irrespective of party standing, the politicians agreed that the president of the Republic should be a person above party politics. Kuncze said the Free Democrats do not wish to alter the constitutional-law status of the president. However, they wish to make certain authorities more precise. Szekeres said it is conceivable that the position of the president will be strengthened, and added that in this case the president should be elected by referendum. The representatives of both the MSZP and the SZDSZ were of the opinion that Arpad Goncz could serve on as president even after 1995.
