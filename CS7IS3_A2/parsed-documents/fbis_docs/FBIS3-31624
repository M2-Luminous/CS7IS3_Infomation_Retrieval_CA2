"This is a prelude to the election," Kwasniewski said in an interview for a PAP journalist. He confirmed that the Commission was working in accordance with the 1991 law on the procedures of preparing and adopting the constitution, and that it was going to continue its task irrespective of the presidential representative's absence. He added that the "Constitution issue is moving to a political plane with the constitutional referendum as an epilogue." According to Kwasniewski, there will be a clear division of political forces during the referendum, with one group calling for the support of the constitution and another being against it. "The president clearly wants to attach himself to such an alternative to the present parliament," Kwasniewski said. The SLD leader does not see the conflict as a kind of a "game at the top" between the president and parliament, as there are divergent interests. "The president is anxious to be reelected and he assumed that he could treat the Constitution as an element in the battle for reelection," Kwasniewski said. While commenting on Lech Walesa's statement that the "post- communists have started feeling strong and they are becoming too cocksure and the president would like to clip their wings a bit," Kwasniewski said that he "did not know where this strength lay." According to him, the president "clearly wants to place himself closer to the right side, seeing there a chance for support. But if this is the way -- the president comments on the vote on his constitutional bills -- then he is exaggerating. There was no strategy in the voting. Not only the SLD deputies, but also his favorite Polish Peasant Party deputies voted against," Kwasniewski stated.
