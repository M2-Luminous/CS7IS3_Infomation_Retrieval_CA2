The governor said in his report that Jiangsu recorded a GNP [gross national product] value of 255 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 18.5 percent over 1992. Its per capita GNP reached 3,675 yuan in the same year, which is almost 1,000 yuan more than the national average, according to the report. Jiangsu has been one of the Chinese regions of fast development ever since the country adopted the policy of reform and opening to the outside world. Statistics by the provincial statistics bureau show that from 1979 to 1993, the province's GNP value increased at 11.6 percent a year. The rate of increase shot up to an average of 18.6 percent from 1991 to 1993. Such a fast, sustained and healthy development of the economy, as described by the report, was only made possible by a consistent effort in restructuring its industrial structure and improving the economic performances of enterprises, the governor said. In 1993, the province saw increases varying from 20 percent to 90 percent in its production of washing machines, motor vehicles, glass, cement, steel, sodium carbonate, beans and fruit, all of which sold well in the market. The province also witnessed a big boost in its raw materials industry over the past few years. While it took the province 28 years to bring its annual steel production up to one million tons and five years to two million tons, the jump to three million tons, its original goal for the year 2000, was only a matter of two years. Meanwhile, the province's consumption of raw materials and energy per unit industrial output has dropped, resulting in its comprehensive index for industrial economic efficiency rising by 10 percent to reach 99.3 percent. Economic experts hold that Jiangsu's powerful development is the result of an economy that is getting more and more market-oriented and internationalized, with market demand the ultimate determinant behind the increase. In the past year, the province started 450 markets for labor and raw materials and wholesale markets for industrial and agricultural products. Six of them reported an annual business volume of one billion yuan apiece. Its consumer products retail value and sales of means of production both exceeded 100 billion yuan in 1993, increasing by 33.9 percent and 43.7 percent over those of 1992, respectively. The province has been seeking to expand its overseas market. It exported 5.96 billion U.S. dollars worth of products in 1993, ranking it fourth among Chinese regions. The province now owns 368 non-trade enterprises overseas, among which 210 were started last year. It is now the Chinese region with the biggest number of such ventures. Various development zones have become an important locomotive for the province's economic growth. By the end of 1993, there were more than 6,000 enterprises in operation or under construction in the province's 10 economic development zones, high-tech development zones, free-trade zones and tourist resorts at the national level and a larger number of such zones at the provincial level. The service industry has been one of the economic sectors enjoying the greatest boom. In 1993, the output value of the service industry accounted for 24.4 percent of the province's total GNP value, while in rural areas, 84.6 percent of the GNP value was produced by the processing and service industries.
