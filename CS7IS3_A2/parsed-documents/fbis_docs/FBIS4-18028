Yeltsin at Meeting with Leadership and Staff of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service": "Rights and Duties of Intelligence Officers"] [Text] Russia is currently going through one of the most crucial stages in the formation of its statehood, the Russian Federation president said. The Constitution has been adopted by a nationwide vote. The country has received the legal basis for continuing its profound economic and political transformations and for organizing normal activity by state institutions. One of the main tasks today is to expand the Russian Federation's legislative infrastructure and develop the mechanisms for cooperation among power structures at federal, regional, and local level. Without this we will be unable to resolve Russia's numerous problems or to overcome the economic crisis. Our state is obliged to ensure stability and to guarantee the security of the country and of citizens. That is why it must be strong. The Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] is directly involved in solving this problem. Some two or so years ago the decision was made to split the former KGB into separate services. Serious reform of the Russian special services began. A number of fundamental issues have been successfully settled. For the first time in its history Russia has a law on the foreign intelligence service. A statute on the FIS has been ratified. Thus, a firm legal base has been provided for your activities. Guarantees have been created for the legal status of and social support for intelligence officers and for the confidentiality of information about them. The necessary reorganization has been carried out. A number of new subunits have been set up. Important steps have been taken within the FIS structure in the direction of greater openness on the part of the intelligence service toward society. Taking account of specific situations, of course. The recently adopted Constitution has consolidated the new procedure for regulating the questions of safeguarding the state's security. These come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal authorities. Leadership of the relevant organs is provided by the president. The FIS too is directly subordinate to the president. The supreme purpose of Russia's foreign intelligence is to serve Russia's national and state interests. We will be strengthening the service and enhancing the prestige of those who work for it. This is not only the president's principled view, it is my policy. The country's leadership has a clear and unambiguous opinion -- at a time when military budgets are being cut, intelligence information is becoming a most important guarantee of security. This means that the role of intelligence should and will increase. Extensive use is made of the methods of secret diplomacy in the practice of international relations. We should be able to look under the cover of these secrets so as not to be caught napping. Your service has direct access to the Russian leadership, and this means it is obliged to supply it with objective, up-to-the-minute, and full information. I must say that the FIS has a high reputation within the system of Russian state power. I expect that henceforth your operational information, analytical conclusions, and recommendations will receive only high assessments. The time when the intelligence service's merits were mainly measured by how vigorously it served ideological precepts and expanded zones of ideological influence on different continents is a thing of the past. We expect foreign intelligence to produce the intelligence information needed for the adoption of fundamental state decisions on the issues of Russia's foreign and domestic policy, the implementation of our economic policy, and the securing of scientific and technical progress. I am well aware that the FIS has probably never faced a more complex period than it does at present. And this is determined above all by the present-day international situation. Its main feature is the scale and high speed of the changes which are continuously complicating an already complex world. The vector of world development is, on the whole, favorable for Russia, but we should bear in mind that its direction can change. The world is at a crossroads, largely because one of the greatest powers -- Russia -- is in transition. You know just as well as I that there are forces abroad which would like to keep Russia in a state of controlled paralysis. But I am convinced that only a strong, democratic, and prosperous Russian state will be a factor in helping the world acquire a new outlook. Making Russia just such a factor is our common task. The period of global confrontation in international politics is over, but its inertia is still strong. The Cold War has left behind a smattering of burning and smoldering conflicts. The norms of international law are proving difficult to assert. Strong-arm military factors could be brought into play at any time. The priority task for the FIS is to anticipate problems which the state may encounter in the immediate and more distant future. Consequently, intelligence should be one of the leading think tanks for stabilizing the situation in the world and for averting any threats to Russia's national security. We are improving the activeness of Russian foreign policy and doing the groundwork for the 21st century. Relations between Russia and the Western countries have been improving radically of late. We have achieved a level of partnership with some of these countries. But now it is particularly important to differentiate between partnership and attempts to dominate us and to impose on us actions that run counter to Russia's interests. This is unacceptable to us. The fundamental point in Russia's military and foreign policy doctrines is that they view no state as an enemy. This approach should also underpin Russia's intelligence doctrine. We have concluded important arms reduction agreements and we want to be confident that our partners are strictly observing them. It is the intelligence service's constant duty to issue warnings about attempts to create [o popytkakh sozdaniya] new types of weapons or about breakthroughs by other countries [otryv drugikh stran] in the military-technical sphere. This is all the more important because the majority of countries working on the development [sozdaniye] of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction are located relatively close to Russia. Our direct duty is to prevent any escalation of this danger and to avoid it turning into a direct threat to Russia. Russia has its own view of its foreign and domestic policy priorities, and it has its own interests in the international arena. This is graphically visible in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis, and in our actions in nearby foreign countries and on other issues. Recently we have clearly seen that this activeness on Russia's part sometimes gives rise to irritation. A clear illustration of this is the political campaign over the so-called "Ames affair." The real motives and goals of this anti-Russian action have clearly political overtones. U.S. intelligence is stepping up its efforts to acquire agents in Russia. But the U.S. special services believe that the FIS and its military counterparts have no right to act in the same way. I can assure you that Russia does not intend to put up with this kind of discrimination any more. We are prepared to take every measure provided for by international law in order to rectify the situation. Russia advocates equal and mutually advantageous cooperation and mutual respect. And I believe that our partners will learn to take our position into account. I see the occasional outbreaks of nervousness as evidence of a gradual recognition of the fact that the newly independent states are areas of vital interest to Russia [novoye nezavisimoye gosudarstvo -- zona zhiznennykh interesov Rossii]. We want there to be a zone of stability, mutually advantageous cooperation, and good-neighborliness around the perimeter of the Russian border. And nobody can rebuke us for that. We are interested in stepping up integration processes within the CIS framework and we are striving to play a more active role in them. It is no secret that certain politicians in the West see this as evidence of a revival of Russia's former imperial ambitions. We can clearly see that this far-fetched thesis is being used to artificially exacerbate relations between the CIS and Baltic countries and Russia. Some of the newly independent states are also trying to derive an advantage for themselves. They are rushing to demonstrate their readiness to accept dubious proposals from outside [so storony]. The FIS faces the crucial task of acquiring preemptive information on the corresponding plans and intentions of the leading Western countries in respect of our neighbors. And of providing timely proposals for neutralizing schemes of this kind. Rejecting the concept of "global" and "total" intelligence, it is necessary above all to systematically monitor the situation along the entire perimeter of our borders. Russia faces near its borders a direct threat from armed conflicts which threaten here and there to spill over into Russian territory. A great deal of effort will be needed to find ways to neutralize conflict situations in adjacent countries. The intelligence service is obliged to expose in good time the driving forces behind each conflict and the potential for a political, compromise settlement. Guarantees for Russians living in neighboring countries are a special issue. We will vigorously protect their interests in the Baltic countries and in other states. We need profound and accurate assessments of foreign states' attitudes to Russia itself and to the processes taking place in it. It is important to expose and skillfully thwart any attempts to influence the situation in our country from outside. All the more so if these actions are aimed at stepping up disintegration processes. International financial and economic support for our country is a special issue. I have already said and I repeat that we do not reject it but nor are we linking the fate of reform to foreign support. Intelligence can also make a weighty contribution to safeguarding Russia's economic security. It is far more important for Russia's economic interests to ensure free access to other countries' markets for goods and other Russian products. The solution of this problem is an important task for both our foreign policy and our intelligence service. Organized crime has already gone beyond the confines of the country and is establishing links with European and U.S. criminal clans. The intelligence service and Russian law enforcement organs must expose these links and prevent them becoming part of an established criminal system. A useful role in combating global threats may be played by partnership ties with foreign special services. The FIS has such powers and, as is well known, is making successful use of them. The fact that you are organizing collaboration and exchanges of information in a number of areas -- the struggle against international terrorism, the illegal trade in radioactive substances, drug trafficking, organized crime, and so forth -- can only be welcomed. In conclusion I would like to note that foreign intelligence should help to consolidate positive trends in Russia, in the world, and in relations with our new partners. Under no circumstances should we leave any loopholes for those who are interested in our secrets or who are trying to infiltrate Russian state institutions. Firm barriers must be put in the way of that. In short, we expect a lot from you, as we do from your military counterparts. The FIS is a special organization. Its ranks boast top-notch specialists with rare and valuable skills. People who have confirmed their lofty patriotism and devotion to Russia through their intensive work abroad are employed here. Your work requires exceptional efforts. For my part, I wish to assure you that the state will provide every possible support for the FIS. All intelligence officers, wherever they may be, can be firmly confident that their homeland needs their work, and Russia will always show proper concern for them and their families.
