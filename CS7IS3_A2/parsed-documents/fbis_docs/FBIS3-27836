Japanese Ambassador to Ukraine Shoji Suezawa handed Hosokawa's written message to Nikolay Makarevych, Ukraine's first vice foreign minister, Terada said. In the letter, Hosokawa gave high marks to a recent trilateral accord among Ukraine, Russia and the United States in which Ukraine pledged to give up its nuclear arms. He also urged Kravchuk to implement the accord as soon as possible, Terada said. Hosokawa called on Ukraine to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) unconditionally and accede to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a nonnuclear state, the spokesman said. He also said Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for Peace," endorsed by the leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Brussels last month, is meaningful in enhancing global security. The plan is intended to bring former Warsaw Pact adversaries into a limited partnership with the Western Military Alliance. Hosokawa's letter also expressed Japan's strong expectations that Ukraine will further promote efforts for economic development, Terada said.
