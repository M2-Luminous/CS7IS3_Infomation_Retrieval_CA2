FBIS4-6187 "dreas075_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 South Korea Inspections Linked to Team Spirit Suspension Inspections Linked to Team Spirit Suspension SK1704061294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0600 GMT 17 Apr 94 SK1704061294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United States have decided to agree on suspending their joint military exercise "Team Spirit '94" and holding a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks if Pyongyang lets additional IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections of its nuclear facilities be successfully concluded, YONHAP learned on Sunday [17 April]. "The April 1 statement by the U.N. Security Council president on the North Korean nuclear problem reaffirmed that the U.S.-North Korean agreement reached on Feb. 25 in New York was still effective," a high-ranking government official said. "In view of this development, Seoul and Washington share the position that further U.S.-North Korean talks and suspension of the annual military drill are linked to more inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency." Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of State for political and military affairs, and Kim Sam-hun, ambassador for nuclear issue, are expected to reiterate their position when they hold a meeting here Monday [18 April]. Regarding Team Spirit in particular, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, who will soon to visit South Korea, and his South Korean counterpart are expected to agree that the military maneuver will be suspended only after they get hard evidence that North Korea did not divert nuclear materials to making weapons. "Dropping the demand for inter-Korean special envoy exchange is part of the preconditions set in the New York agreement," the official said. "The remaining conditions still hold good."
