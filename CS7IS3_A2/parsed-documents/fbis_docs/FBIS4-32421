The commission is responsible for carrying out Paragraph 4 of the decision of the Sixth SDS National Conference, aimed at uncovering former members of the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party], leading members of the BCP nomenklatura, and members of the Active Fighters Against Fascism Union who have found their way into the SDS structures. Ms. Rasheeva's reasons for her resignation are that the National Coordinating Council is disregarding the commission's recommendations and, moreover, an instruction has been issued in the council's name that the "clean past" Paragraph 4 should be implemented selectively. Ms. Rasheeva will continue to serve as a member of the commission. [passage omitted]
