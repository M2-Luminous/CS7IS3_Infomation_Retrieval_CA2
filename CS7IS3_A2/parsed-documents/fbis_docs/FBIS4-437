If all goes well, I will now have my colleague Gui Polspoel on the line from Kigali. Gui, do you hear me? [Polspoel] I hear you loud and clear, Jan. [Becaus] Where are you at this very moment, Gui? [Polspoel] I am on the tarmac at the airport where we landed some 10 minutes ago aboard a C-130 of the Belgian Air Force. [Becaus] What is going on there? [Polspoel] Mostly military movements. The C-130s are still shuttling between Nairobi and Kigali, flying in military equipment inlcuding trucks, jeeps, and so on, because only then can the Belgians start their operation. The go-ahead for that rests with the Rwandan authorities who thus far have not permitted them to leave the airport. The French can leave, but the Belgians must remain in place. Negotiations are continuing. [Becaus] Can you judge from there how the evacuation is proceeding? [Polspoel] It is being carried out reasonably well, but mainly with the French, who can pick up people in town. A flight with 75 people onboard left for Nairobi, Kenya some 30 minutes ago. The passengers will be flown back from Nairobi to Belgium probably on board two Belgian Air Force planes, actually passenger planes, which are waiting at Nairobi airport. Most of those 75 are Belgians, but we do not have the exact information on their identities. [Becaus] If I understand it well, Gui, the Belgian military is still inactive at this very moment? [Polspoel] Yes, that is correct. Obviously they are helping the refugees arriving at the airport, but they have not been permitted real operations in the town or outside the airport yet. [Becaus] Can you hear, from where you are, hostilities in or around Kigali? [Polspoel] No. Last night, however, the Air Force people told us that when they left here around 1800, there was heavy shooting in this neighborhood. [Becaus] Well, thanks Gui Polspoel. We will certainly hear from you later in our next newscast.
