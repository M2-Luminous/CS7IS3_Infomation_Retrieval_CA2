Lopata and Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Defense I. Bizhan held a briefing for diplomats accredited in Ukraine on the incident that took place in Odessa between subdivisions of the Odessa Military District and the Black Sea Fleet. Lopata sent a telegram to the Russian Ministry of Defense in which he asked that the departure of the vessel the Cheleken from Odessa be halted until the situation is finally clarified. Ukrainian Minister of Defense V. Radetskyy tried to get in touch with P. Grachev, his counterpart in the Russian Federation. He sent Grachev a telegram in which the essence of the conflict and the position of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense were explained. Grachev's reply revealed a total lack of knowledge of the circumstances and a deliberate distortion of facts. For example, in his telegram, Grachev referred to the Cheleken as a Russian vessel. On the proposal by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, on 12 April, consultations started between the Ministries of Defense of Ukraine and Russia and a search for ways to resolve the Black Sea Fleet problem. The delegation of the Russian Federation includes chief commander of the Naval Forces F. Gromov and Ambassador for Special Missions Yu. Dubinin. The Ukrainian delegation is headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs B. Tarasyuk. On the first day, the sides did not reach any agreement. On 13 April, the consultations continued in Sevastopol.
