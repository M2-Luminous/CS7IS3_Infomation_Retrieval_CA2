Practically every day brings new instances of Russian border posts and detachments being fired upon and attempted armed breakthroughs from the Afghan to the Tajik side of the river. In January and February Russian troop stationing locations came under rocket fire more than 60 times. "This is a protracted guerrilla war," the military are saying. The Tajik authorities insist, on the contrary, that the civil war in the republic is now over. After yet another border skirmish, the republic's Foreign Ministry is sending Kabul a protest note. Kabul rejects Dushanbe's protests, dismissing as groundless all accusations that "subversive activity against Tajikistan is being initiated from Afghan territory." Kabul is of the opinion that Tajikistan should resolve its internal conflict independently, without enlisting any outside military force, and through political dialogue with the Tajik opposition. Kabul is uneasy about the Russian military presence near its borders. Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the group of Russian Border Guards in Tajikistan, has stated that if border troops come under fire from Afghanistan, they are to return fire with all weapons at their disposal. This extreme measure is justified by the Afghan leadership's powerlessness to control the situation in the border regions and avert audacious strikes by the Islamic opposition and Afghan mojahedin. It is apparently implied that the targets are the uncontrollable opposition groupings. But how are they to be distinguished? The gunmen do not stay in the same place; they prefer guerrilla methods of warfare: They arrive in an Afghan village, shell a border post, and go away again. Or small groups cross the border and strike from the rear. General Chechulin does not share the opinion that armed confrontation between Russian servicemen and the government subunits supporting them on the one hand, and the Islamic opposition on the other, could lead to the outbreak of a new war. The opposition is not strong enough for this, he believes. However, there is no doubt that the development of events in such a scenario will only lead to an escalation of hostilities. Moscow faces a choice: Either condemn its small military contingent in Tajikistan to further casualties, or increase its military presence, which risks inevitable embroilment in another war. Moscow is therefore forcing a start to political dialogue between the Tajik authorities and the Islamic opposition. To this end Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy foreign minister, has paid a lightning visit to Dushanbe. It has taken Moscow just over a year of effort for a Russian diplomat finally to be able to declare: The Tajik leadership has displayed its goodwill and expressed its readiness to embark on talks with the opposition. This is apparently a reference to the most moderate section of the representatives of the Islamic movement. It is planned to hold talks under the auspices of the United Nations. These talks could be held in Moscow. In which case the Russian side would be prepared to undertake to resolve organizational problems. If the talks break down, the blame, according to Adamishin, would lie not with Russia or Tajikistan but with the opposition, which, in the diplomat's words, "could turn nasty." In a year that has seen no political dialogue whatsoever, the demands of the opponents of the Dushanbe authorities have grown much more exacting. It is symptomatic that the Islamic opposition leaders are inclining toward Tehran as the most acceptable place for them to hold talks. They are clearly hoping for Iranian support and consequently the support of orthodox Muslims in their upcoming dialogue with Moscow and Dushanbe.
