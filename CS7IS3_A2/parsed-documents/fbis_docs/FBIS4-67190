The Seoul District Prosecutor's Office said yesterday that two medical doctors were also indicted without formal arrest on charges of violating the Pharmaceutical Law for helping distributors take the products out of hospital inventory. According to state prosecutors, the 12 arrested allegedly engaged in the distribution of products containing nalbuphane HC1, hallucinating its users, from April last year through last month. Initial investigations showed that the 12, mostly pharmaceutical company employees, distributed 22,000 ampules (one ampule contains 10 centiliters) of the injection drug which have a market value of 60-100 million won (750,000-1.2 million U.S. dollars). The prosecutors said the drug, which is believed to bring reactions as powerful as methamphetamine, sells for about 30,000-50,000 won per ampule, mostly to youths and drug addicts. "The distributors worked clandestinely with doctors and pharmacists to gain access to large quantities of nalbuphane and sold them through organized networks run by hooligans," one prosecutor explained. In one instance, the prosecutors said, Yi Sok-chae, a manager of a pharmaceutical company, purchased 11,800 ampules at 400-500 won each and sold them to another distributor at 1,500-2,000 won. "What is shocking about this case is that it involved organized groups of people who are well aware of the dangerous implications of administering the painkiller," one prosecutor said.
