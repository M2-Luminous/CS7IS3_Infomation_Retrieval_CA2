[Gligorov] We achieved our independence by peaceful and legitimate means: by the referendum, a new constitution, and democratic elections. This independence has fulfilled the national dreams of entire generations. Our people fought for this for 150 years. But we live in a region where there is a war going on that led to UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, and we have had an embargo imposed on us by Greece. These two things make it difficult for the Macedonian economy to develop. Our major connecting routes for people, goods, and capital have been interrupted. Our future lies in association with the European Union. [Vujovic] Balkans experts fear that the conflict might spread to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. [Gligorov] As long as there is a war in our region, there is obviously some threat. The Kosovo problem is also a danger to us. That is why we have called upon the United Nations to send us observers for preventive reasons. It has since emerged just how correct this measure was. But I would also like to point out that we are conducting a clear-cut policy: good relations with all our neighbors. Thanks to this policy we have hardly any problems with Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia. We even have very good economic and cultural relations with Bulgaria and Albania. We used to have very good economic relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which we are trying to maintain under the embargo today. Everything will certainly be back to normal once the war has ended and the sanctions have been lifted. [Vujovic] Recent signals coming from Serbia are not all that encouraging. President Slobodan Milosevic's policy is very pro-Greek. Many Serbian politicians consider Macedonia to be part of Serbia. Is that a real danger or are these just verbal threats? [Gligorov] Yes, there are such threats. The independent state of Macedonia is a reality in spite of the Greek embargo. I am sure that a Balkans war would break out if Serbia or another neighbor tried to enforce their claims. And a Balkans war was always the beginning of a world conflict. That is why it is also in our neighbors' interests to renounce such historic burdens. [Vujovic] Greek-Macedonian relations are the biggest problem today. [Gligorov] There is no objective reason why there should be conflicts between Greeks and Macedonians. There are no territorial claims. Cooperation is in both countries' interest. None of the things going on between Greece and Macedonia are in the interests of our states. It is all just a matter of emotions, which unfortunately play a great role in the Balkans. [Vujovic] There have been speculations lately about Macedonia wanting to change its flag and coat of arms. Is that right? [Gligorov] That is just gossip. But we are determined to discuss all the questions with Greece and to find solutions that are acceptable to both sides. We will talk this over in the next few days. [Vujovic] Many observers believe that the United States is using Macedonia as a base in that part of the Balkans. What is the role that the United States plays in Macedonia? [Gligorov] There are no U.S. bases here; these are mere speculations. We asked the United Nations to send peacekeeping troops to Macedonia for preventive reasons. That was a good move. Even UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has called Macedonia a good example, a model that the United Nations should use in the future. Preventive measures always achieve much better results than war does. At the beginning there were only Scandinavian UN troops stationed in Macedonia, but, today, about half the contingent are U.S. troops, the other half are Scandinavians. That is it, the Americans are here only as part of the UN peacekeeping contingent, not as U.S. Army. [Vujovic] The Macedonian Parliament has given the go-ahead for NATO membership. Why? [Gligorov] It is not easy for a small country to survive today without being part of a collective security system. The United Nations is certainly the most important organization. But it does not have a military structure of its own, its possibilities are limited. NATO is the only collective security system that is still in existence. The Partnership for Peace offer is a real possibility for all those seeking protection today. Our parliament's resolution is to be seen as a statement of general orientation. Joining the Partnership for Peace would be a first step for us that could be realized as soon as we are a member of the CSCE. [Vujovic] Is Greece the only country preventing Macedonia from joining the CSCE? [Gligorov] Yes, it is. [Vujovic] What is your view of Austria-Macedonia relations? [Gligorov] We have a tradition of good relations and good economic cooperation with Austria. Austria supported our UN membership. But Austria is still cautious in establishing full diplomatic relations; we are still waiting for an Austrian ambassador to come to Macedonia.
