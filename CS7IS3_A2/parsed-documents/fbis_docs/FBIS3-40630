If we look back at the decisions made during the last two years, we feel these to be very painful. We are beating the drum of progress and development by inviting multi-national companies here. India's modern history where the East India Company started the loot-oriented trade and made us slaves is not yet forgotten. Nor is how the British destroyed Indian crafts, arts, trade, and industry, and made this country depend on agriculture. Nor how the British loaded away raw materials and took over our markets. Now, we are opening our markets to the foreigners and are talking about progress. Were the decisions we had made during the earlier awakening of Indian society, and the swadesh movement on which our freedom campaign was depended, illogical, anti-national, and wrong? Can we determine a new direction and avoid our experience? The Indian campaigns of nineteenth-twentieth century were against imperialism, colonialism, neo-feudalism, capitalism, and westernization. We never felt worried and threatened at that time as we are now. The main goal of our swadeshi campaign and boycott campaign was to gain independence. We wanted to be free in thinking, working, and in all spheres of life and wanted to reinstall those moral values that the British were destroying. The main call of awareness of these campaigns was to get rid of mental slavery and join the creative and independent currents. However, we forgot our promises after the independence during the Nehru era. The storms of westernized modernism labeled the Indian life style backward. All the blocks that dulled the Indian thought such as learning English, westernized education, universities organized on foreign models, desire for consumer culture, and neglect of Indian philosophy endangered the feeling of being Indian. Our independent thinking, which had been blocked for 200 years, became more helpless after independence. The burden of the slaverish dependence on English increased for Hindi and other Indian languages. Every area of Indian creativity was operated upon, and its nerves were severed. No embarrassment was felt when our country was made a mimic of the West. The Nehru era continued to show us the dream that if we became industrialized like the West and expanded our development mechanism, all our caste-related problems would be resolved. Not only this, even India's left-wing politicians supported this economic model. However, the hollowness of this model was evident after 1970. This economic model made a few leaders, officials, and industrialists rich overnight, and tied the majority of our society in the knot of poverty. It is difficult to estimate what price the Indian people have had to pay for it. The whole society reeks of stagnation. The philosophy of existence emerged in the area of creativity, and the Indian face of self-reproachment was formed. The average man, who had dreamed about happiness after independence, was covered with the thick sheet of disillusion. We learned that the assurance of self-respect we had earned during the independence movement was disappearing in darkness. The plans for development and progress became brutal and our villages were destroyed. Blind industrialization and the demonic structure of the mechanical age deprived Indian life of its natural atmosphere and tied the foreign blindfold on the eyes of Indian cultural values. All our cultural and religious symbols were seen to be useless and helped only the regressive kind of thought. The broad trust we had developed in creativity and thinking, despite our poverty, during the independence struggle was strangled by the westernized modern beliefs. The extraordinary era of creativity and thinking led by Dadabhai Nauroji, Tilak, Bipin Chander Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Arvind, Vivekananda, Gandhi, Ravinder Nath, Jai Shankar Prasad, Lohia, and Narender Dev is neglected now. The whole system got engrossed in the illusion of inhuman, barren, and parodoxical pandemonium of modernism. In Hindi literature, Bhartendu who had started the new literature and started the swadeshi movement, Mahavir Prasad Divavedi, Prem Chand, Ram Chander Shukla, Maithilisharan Gupta, Makhan Lal Chaturvedi, and Nirala who had followed him could not even imagine how the swadeshi movement would be destroyed on such a large scale under an organized plan after the independence. Our builders worked hard sacrificing their body, soul, and property for nationalism and worship to get rid of western slavery. They never once thought that their whole work could be ground to dust after independence. We remember a line from Jaya Shankar Prasad's KAMAYNI over this tragedy, "All the invaluable stars were decomposed in the dark gale." The situation is now that "this crazy society is running around in the dark." In our craziness, we had insulted Gandhi so much that he was ready to let a foreign company take over the job of making salt in Gujrat. The crocodiles of international economic organizations and multi-national companies have surrounded us to devour India's swadeshi movement. Our government, in the name of economic liberalization and foreign investments, is conspiring to invite those notorious foreign companies that have been causing havoc by exploiting poor nations. The mask from the face of a government that chants the mantra of progress through development plans with foreign loans and economic slavery is easily lifted; it cannot be self-dependent and proud. "My great India" is not eager to accept the slavery of economic imperialism and be their agent, but is mentally preparing itself. The conspiracy to expand the open plan of looting by inviting the multi-national companies is being hatched. The fact is that under the pressure of U.S. multi-national companies, natural seeds from all over the world are being researched and developed using biotechnology and "new artificial seeds" are being created and forced on all developing countries. U.S. companies have developed such seeds and they want markets for it. These markets are poor nations such as India where the swadeshi movement led by Nauroji, Tilak, and Gandhi has lost its direction. The United States imposes the right of intellectual property and India bows down. The life of these artificial seeds is not more than three or four years and after three or four years, they become useless. Thus, the farmers cannot make their own seeds. Obviously, these foreign companies want to control India's agricultural system, and we are raising the slogan of "Great India!" The greatest challenge we have now is to analyze this tragedy happening to our country, our language, our pride. We should think about Bhartendu's desire for India to understand itself and think about what kind of India are we making. Was our Indian pride in the struggle for independence a deception? Do not we love our nation now? What is the use of prosperity that depends on begging? Indian poet Rahim had said that begging makes even the greatest person inferior. Even Lord Narayan had to become a dwarf in one incarnation because of begging. Our repeated contemplation makes us hear one thing: Begging, be it by a person or a nation, makes one low and destroys one's self-respect. It distorts one's racial and cultural identity. This international begging is not appropriate just to make India modern. Those who have the responsibility of protecting the esteem of even the most common person in the country should learn something from the proud tradition of India's freedom struggle. They should get out of the political chaos for a while and try to understand the thoughts of Tilak, Gandhi, and Ravinder Nath. They will learn that the 20th century began with the swadeshi movement in India. This movement strengthened India's independence campaign, and sowed the seeds of patriotism, unity, and sacrifice in the people in villages and cities. This movement also strengthened socialist movements. It was not just a political movement; it was a resolution to free the nation from economic and cultural imperialism in the areas of literature, art, philosophy, music, science, and industry. This movement awakened us with the call to boycott cloth from Manchester and salt from Liverpool. This movement also raised the slogan to boycott foreign goods. It was this movement for which Tilak, Bhagat Singh, and Lala Lajpat Rai sacrificed their lives. Gokhale and Arvind Ghosh also took softer steps. The women in enslaved India stopped using foreign-made bangles because of this movement. Even holy men stopped using foreign sugar for worship offerings. This movement spread much political awareness and created thousands of patriotic songs resulting in the shake- up of British imperialism. This movement helped open training centers for domestic industry. Living during that period of wave must have been unique. The swadeshi movement had spread with the support of Indian festivals, auspicious days, traditions, fairs, folk music, and folk drama. The swadeshi movement had spread in every village in Bengal through the folk play tours. It was the first time that modern political thought had explained to the people the meaning of patriotic awakening. The swadeshi movement grew with self-dependence and inner strength, and sparkled as national pride. Ravinder Nath Tagore, Arvind, Avninder Nath and Nand Lal Bose got their inspiration from the swadeshi movement and blew the conch shell calling for cultural awakening. They taught the lessons of nationalism. independence, and united political struggle that revitalized Indian life. Today, we are trying to prove that this whole lesson was wrong!
