Correctly understanding and handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability is of important significance to the proper manipulation of the general work set forth by the central authorities and to the successful completion of all tasks. Reform, development, and stability, which form a dialectical unity, are interrelated and complement each other. They are three indispensable pivots supporting the comprehensive development of society. Reform is the motivating force, development is the goal, and stability is the indispensable precondition for reform and development, while reform and development on their part serve as a solid foundation ensuring social stability and perpetual political stability. We must certainly proceed from the general interests and make sure everything is properly done regarding reform, development, and stability. Failure in any one of these three aspects is bound to affect the two other aspects and thus upset the whole situation. Deepening reform and expanding the opening up process is the only way to boost the economy. Reform is a process of self-perfection and the development of the socialist system. Reform further revitalizes the productive forces in society and brings forth great economic development through a profound readjustment of the relationship between the productive forces and production relations and of that between the economic base and the superstructure of socialist society. The further reform and opening up advances, the more conditions favorable to economic development are available. In the course of its development, China's economy still faces some contradictions and difficulties. For instance, the unsound state of the macroeconomic regulation and control system, the irrational economic structure, and the serious drain on the central government's financial and tax revenues; the overexpanded scale of investment in fixed assets and the rather wide margin of price increases, which have resulted in more restrictive "bottleneck" effects on economic growth and stronger inflationary pressures; greater operational difficulties facing many state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and the undermining of agriculture as the basis; and so on. These phenomena are due to the interaction between residual shortcomings of the old structure and the unsound state of the new structure and mechanisms, and are problems stemming from the deeper level of the structure, which is inevitable when reform is advancing on all fronts. The fundamental solution to the problems should be to further in-depth reform. Since last year, the central authorities have advanced reform to a new breakthrough stage in key links and reform is advancing on all fronts in accordance with the requirement for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. Plans to reform the financial and taxation system, the banking system, the investment system, and the foreign trade system have been formulated and put forth, while enterprise reform is continuing to develop in depth with the focus laid on the transformation of operational mechanisms, and efforts are being made to foster the market system and to establish and perfect a system of macroeconomic regulation and control. These new measures and plans are to meet the objective needs of and serve as an effective guarantee for the in-depth development of reform. If we fail to conscientiously and promptly carry out these measures and plans, it will be difficult for us to deepen reform, the process of establishing a socialist market economic structure will be prolonged, and, consequently, long-term economic development will be jeopardized. So long as we fight this "hard-won major campaign" well and successfully establish the basic framework of a socialist market economy, we will lay down an important foundation for the revitalization of China's economy. Therefore, leading people at all levels must devote more energy to reform; work more conscientiously, more meticulously, and in a down-to-earth manner; and ensure constant development of in-depth reform. They must further emancipate their minds, uphold the principle of proceeding in everything from reality, boldly blaze new trails, sum up experiences in good time, properly solve contradictions and problems arising from the in-depth development of reform, and thus ensure the successful accomplishment of all reform targets. Development is the last word. It is the starting point and the destination of reform, and the result of the reforms will finally be displayed through development. In order to prepare a solid material basis for all the undertakings of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the key lies in economic development. To achieve development we need new ideas and new methods, which spring from reform. Bypassing reform as a key process means we are seeking development through the old structure and old methods. Only by conducting reform, establishing a new structure, and creating new methods will we be able achieve development. When talking about development, we not only mean striving to achieve a quantitative increase, but also to seek a qualitative improvement of the economy. We must increase economic returns through structural readjustment, technological transformation, product development, and scientific management, and we should no longer follow the old path of extensive management--blindly seeking high output and expanding the scale of investment. The normal operation and healthy development of the socialist market economy depends on coordination between different trades and between the part and the whole, and on the balance between economic returns and the growth rate. When seeking development, a locality or a sector should never sacrifice general and long-term interests for partial and immediate interests. Partial interests must be submitted to general interests, and one must give consideration to partial interests as well when seeking general interests. Only in this way can both partial and general interests be promoted side by side. The economic growth rate should increase along with an improvement in economic returns. The growth rate should be set within the limits of our resources and ability. We do not want a high growth rate only, but also steady and solid growth with the simultaneous improvement of economic returns ensured. This sort of development is solid development, the sort of development that socialism with Chinese characteristics wants and which we are striving for while ensuring stability. Reform and development needs a stable social environment. Without stability, no economy can thrive under any social system. There are no exceptions in history, in China or in other parts of the world alike. Only when a country is enjoying political and social stability and the public are in a tranquil mental state can reform be carried out in an orderly manner and can the country achieve its set targets for development. Without stability, nothing can be achieved. Reform cannot be carried out successfully, let alone development. As pointed out by Comrade Deng Xiaoping: "Without a stable environment, everything will fall through. Even achievements already made will be void." Of course, reform and development can also give an impetus to the promotion of stability. Reform helps eliminate existing irregularities and problems and establishes a more scientific and rational new structure, thus bringing about economic prosperity and an improvement in living standards. This is also a reliable approach to and fundamental guarantee for the achievement of stability. Properly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability is an important strategic matter which has a bearing on the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The faster reform develops in depth, the more one needs to keep sober-headed. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze and accurately judge the basic conditions regarding reform, development, and stability from a realistic point of view and in light of actual circumstances, and then handle the situation properly. Out of consideration for general interests which rest on reform, development, and stability, we must treat and resolve the issues of an overheated economy and inflation. At present, the scale of ongoing construction projects is already very large in our country. The scale of investment to be launched this year is not small either, and therefore restrictions due to the "bottleneck" effect and inflationary pressures will increase in the wake of economic development. Nevertheless, some localities and sectors are still blindly seeking high output value and growth rates and are expanding the scale of investment in quite a big way. If the scale of investment gets seriously out of control, this will inevitably aggravate inflation and price hikes. It will not only cause drastic economic fluctuations and affect the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development process, but will also create many difficulties in the basic livelihood of the public. Exceptional increases in commodity prices will in turn disturb the public and cause social unrest, affecting the smooth progress of reform and economic development as a whole. Therefore, this problem will not only affect reform and development but will also upset social stability; therefore, it is necessary to deal with it seriously. All localities and all sectors must give first consideration to general interests, strictly implement the state's macroeconomic regulation and control policy, set an appropriate development speed according to their own conditions, and actively support the central authorities in comprehensively coordinating economic operations and maintaining a balance between aggregate supply and demand. Out of a consideration of the general interests which rest on reform, development, and stability, we must make great efforts to reinvigorate state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture, both of which are the mainstays and foundation of the national economy and support social development and stability. How well they do will not only determine whether sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development can be maintained, but will also have a bearing on improved living standards for the vast number of staff members, workers, peasants, and cadres. Running well state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and reform of the agricultural structure will not only give a great impetus to overall development and to work on all fronts, but will also help promote closer ties between the party and the public and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, thus ensuring that the party and the masses, as well as the workers and peasants, will work together with one heart and one mind to safeguard the general interests. All localities and sectors must place the operation to invigorate state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises as the order of the day, work hard to ensure a smooth transformation of the operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises, gradually establish a modern enterprise system, actively improve the internal management of enterprises, vitalize enterprises, increase their potential for development, make sure the value of state-owned assets is preserved and increased, and give full play to the leading role of state-owned enterprises in the national economy. Principal leading members of party committees at all levels must personally attend to work; adopt effective measures to reinforce the position of agriculture as a basic sector; promote the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries while ensuring steady growth in grain and cotton output; keep township and town enterprises constantly growing; and make every effort to ensure increasing peasants' incomes. Out of consideration for the general interests which rest on reform, development, and stability, we must correctly handle all kinds of social problems that emerge in the wake of reform and development. Reform as a process of readjustment in the interest structure and relations will inevitably give rise to one type of social problem or another. Failure to properly solve these problems will jeopardize the general interests. Our cadres at all levels must conscientiously look into contradictions among the people that arise from new circumstances, and distinguish between the two categories of contradictions of a different nature and handle them correctly. They must try to correctly handle relations between the urban and rural areas, as well as the relations between the central and western parts of the country on the one hand and coastal areas on the other, and properly deal with issues concerning nationality solidarity, economic development in minority nationality areas, and the issue of unfair distribution of income and great disparities in income. They must be concerned about the people's livelihood. Reform has brought about extensive, remarkable improvement in the people's living standards, but there are still some people with limited income or who are living in poverty. Therefore, our cadres at all levels, while concentrating on deepening reform of state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises and reform of the agricultural structure, must always bear in mind the masses' wellbeing and show special concern for and extend aid to those in difficulties. In relaxing price controls, one should never relax market management. By relying on market regulation alone, we can hardly stabilize the prices of important commodities that have a direct bearing on the people's livelihood. Therefore, we must strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control with a view to keeping commodity prices stable. All localities must pay attention to the "shopping basket" project and try their best to raise the people's living standards. Out of consideration for the general interests which rest on reform, development, and stability, we must carry on the anticorruption struggle in depth, unremittingly, and more efficiently, and step up the comprehensive management of social order with real earnest. The struggle against corruption is a task of vital importance to the party's survival. If we let corruption spread unchecked, we will lose popular support. If so, we can hardly ensure social stability even with a prosperous economy. At present, the anticorruption struggle remains a very arduous task and brooks no slackness. The key to the anticorruption operation lies in strengthening leadership and keeping up our efforts. It is necessary to perfectly combine the anticorruption struggle with deepening reform, expanding opening up, and expediting development; to fully rely on the masses; to take actions to deal with both symptoms and root causes; and to make unremitting efforts to strive for new successes. Poor conditions of social order may have a very bad influence on reform and opening up, economic construction, and social stability. Straightening out social order is the public's strong desire and an important duty of governments at all levels. This issue must be brought to the attention of leaders at all levels, and effective measures must be taken to solve it. It is necessary to deal severe blows at all kinds of criminal activities and hooligans, thieves, and robbers who threaten and jeopardize people's lives, state security, and nationality solidarity. It is necessary to resolutely do away with the practice of being hard on the one hand but soft on the other, promote both the material and spiritual civilizations, and strive to thoroughly improve social order. The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the basis of the scientific theory guiding us to properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave a precise and scientific exposition of this issue in volume three of his Selected Works. General Secretary Jiang Zemin also brilliantly elaborated his view in this regard in his report to the 14th party congress and in a series of speeches. By conscientiously studying these ideological theories, thoroughly understanding the essences of these theories, and by applying them to the social practice of reform and opening up, we will be able to win one victory after another in the course of reform and development, constantly preserve social and political stability, and continuously advance the socialist cause.
