Or rather a situation which we have brought on ourselves by granting President Yeltsin such unlimited powers. The citizens have ceded him these powers not for his fine looks but to enable him to conduct transformations in society, the national economy and politics, taking counsel with representatives of democratic parties. Having received this power, however, Yeltsin immediately stopped in his tracks because he thereby accomplished his objective. At present there are all the makings of stagnation in evidence. Even the president's recent ailment, in my view, also belongs here, not to mention, for instance, such a decision of his as a proposal to postpone elections of administration heads till 1996. What is this if not an attempt to freeze the situation? Stagnation is precisely a situation being frozen. In contrast to democracy, where all ailments are exposed and treated. Under democracy, officials who, say, have committed crimes are immediately dismissed and the president or any other head of government is obligated to do this because he depends on those who have voted for him, on public opinion, and finally on the mass media. Boris Yeltsin, however, does not depend on anyone at present. His dependence even on the State Duma can be defined as very insignificant. What is the point of the president's meeting with democratic party leaders and proving to them that he is conducting democratic transformations in the economy and politics? There is absolutely no need for him to do this because the entire power is concentrated in his hands. This situation is terrible and all that one can rely on now is the president's conscience. Otherwise the consequences of, let us say, the situation being preserved or of one-man rule emerging can be rather explosive. Stagnation can well lead to popular unrest and various actions by political parties. That Yeltsin is not changing but preserving an extremely hard- line cabinet of ministers which was imposed on him, incapable and unwilling to undertake reform, is probably the most shining sign of stagnation. If we talk of economic transformations in Russia, what on earth does Chernomyrdin or Zaveryukha have to do with this?! All that they and people like them can do is to turn Russian into a Ukraine. This is very dangerous indeed. A way to resolve our economic problems lies in raising economic effectiveness, creating normal jobs, the abandonment of economic regulation by the state, and stopping subsidies to unprofitable and unwanted enterprises whose needs are growing in proportion to what is being handed out to them all the time. This is a typical pattern of addiction: If six cubic millimeters is given to a drug addict who is accustomed to two cu mm a day, soon two will not be enough. Economic problems can be resolved only by liberalizing the economy and promoting unrestrained competition. Unfortunately, at present the economy is dominated by the parasitic interests of groups whose representatives are in the government. Moreover, the most incapable representatives of these groups are in the government. I will start to support Yeltsin only when there is no Chernomyrdin in the government and when there is a reformer at its head. Everything else is empty talk about the need for an efficient economy, advancement, and so forth. Today I am giving much thought to how Yeltsin will go down in history, how posterity will appraise the present time; and I am almost convinced that he will not be called a reformer. His time will be seen as the time of struggle by reformers whom Yeltsin first supported, then opposed. True, the president has two years in reserve, but the way he has begun to use his remaining tenure shows that my assessment of him can yet become even more sharply negative.
