The reduced water surface, mineral resources, and environmental concerns are issues which affect all the organisation's four-member states -- Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. It is likely, however, that these pressing problems might be overshadowed by the current border dispute involving Nigeria and Cameroon over the ownership of the 1000 square kilometre Bakassi Peninsula. The summit in Abuja, will take place against the background of intense diplomatic. [sentence as received] Diplomatic sources in the federal capital and Lagos said that apart from the commission's agenda, the summit could be a prelude to the elusive summit between Abacha and Biya over oil-rich Bakassi in the Gulf of Guinea. According to the summit programme released by the Presidency in Abuja, Nigerian head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha was to receive Cameroonian President Paul Biya at the airport and later host the delegates, including those from Chad and Niger Republic to a state dinner. Cameroon has said the bilateral summit was subject to the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the disputed territory, while Nigeria insists that it would not pull out its soldiers. Egypt, the current chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) had been previously mentioned as another possible venue for the summit. But according to political analysts, the venue of the eighth summit of the Lake Chad Basin Commission was agreed at the last summit in Abuja in 1993. The commission was set up in 1964 as a forum for mutual exploration of the mineral resources in the Lake Chad region. It also serves as a platform for the resolution of border disputes among member states. One of such disputes involved Nigeria and Chad in 1983, which led to the establishment of a joint patrol team by both countries as an "interim measure for eventual proper demarcation of the common borders." The issue was eventually resolved at the 36th ministerial session of the commission in Maroua, Camaeroon in 1989. But of late, the lake region has come under what environmentalists called "indiscrimate human activities, especially the construction of dams," which threatens the area with "extinction." The lake water is shrinking, and so are the mineral resources. An environmentalist, Enoch Okpara, told a recent seminar in Lagos that "serious ecological deterioration has taken place and this has affected the flora and fauna of the lake region. The fish harvest and hence the nutritional health of the people of the countries who share the waters of the Chad (lake) are adversely affected," he said. In a paper titled "Environment Watch: How Do Nigerians Know," Okpara said the problem had accentuated migration with "unpleasant consequences on existing inadequate infrastructure in various urban centres acting as destinations for such migrants." Quoting a recent environmental survey, he said that Nigeria alone "lost about 351,000 square km of its mass land to desertification, advancing southwards at an estimated rate of at least 0.6 km per annum." On the global level, Okpara said that the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), has warned that the world might "lose all its productive land mass if the current annual loss of 27 million hectares of its productive land to desertification" remained unchecked. The UN body estimates that some 900 million people are afflicted by desertification worldwide, adding that the enormity of the problem required urgent international and local remedial measures.
