The project will investigate new technologies to replace cadmium plating in corrosion protection and in bearing materials. The grant offer covers up to 40 percent of the eligible project costs. The Centre will undertake the project along with a consortium of twenty or more companies which are either current users of cadmium surface treatments, or suppliers of potential replacement treatment technologies. Announcing the project, Lord Arran said: "I am very pleased to announce this latest project which my Department has been able to support under the Environmental Technology Innovation Scheme [ETIS]. In its own interests, and for the benefit of all of us, industry must research ways of making its products more environmentally friendly by replacing harmful substances wherever possible. This project is a contribution to the drive to identify alternatives to cadmium plating. This is an important objective and I wish the participants every success." Notes to Editors ETIS was launched in October 1990 with the aim of helping companies to undertake research into new environmental technology. It is run jointly by the Departments of Environment and Trade and Industry. The period for submission of applications under ETIS has now ended. The grant offer announced today is the last which will be made under the Scheme. In December 1993, the President of the Board of Trade announced a new environmental technology best practice programme operated jointly by DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] and DOE [Department of Energy]. This programme will build on experience of previous environmental technology schemes but with emphasis on provision and delivery of information rather than grant assistance to firms. The programme, which is due to be launched later in 1994, will aim to make good environmental technology and techniques more widely known to potential users and suppliers. The Departments have allocated 16 million pounds to the programme to be spent over five years. The programme will operate within a set of priority areas to be selected by the Departments in consultation with industry. Cadmium is a toxic metal which may enter the environment through many routes as a result of processes including metal plating. It can be taken up by humans in several ways, including through food. At high levels it can damage kidneys and other organs and tissues. A European Directive, 83/513/EEC, lays down limit values for the discharge of cadmium from various industrial processes and also quality objectives and monitoring procedures. The project announced today targets uses of cadmium which are currently exempt from the controls of the Directive.
