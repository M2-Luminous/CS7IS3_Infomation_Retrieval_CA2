Another five deaths were reported yesterday as figures showed 178 cases of flu-like illness per 100,000 members of the population, compared with the usual average of 40-50 per 100,000. "I am willing to call it an epidemic," said Douglas Fleming, director of the Royal College of General Practitioners' flu monitoring centre in Birmingham. The five deaths occurred among 23 elderly patients on one ward in Ladywell hospital, Salford, of whom 14 caught the virus. Deaths attributed to flu in any winter vary from 1,000 to the 25,000 estimated for the winter of the last epidemic in 1989. Nine out of ten victims are over 65. The rate of increase in flu cases is highest in the South, where they more than doubled between October 31 and November 7, to 145 per 100,000. But the numbers falling ill are still lower than the 201 per 100,000 in the North, where the epidemic started. "The rate of increase is not as rapid as in 1989, so I am optimistic that this will not be as bad an epidemic," Dr. Fleming said. At the peak of the 1989 epidemic, 580 cases per 100,000 were being recorded and, in 1969, the figure rose to more than 1,000. However, scientists could not explain why the virus strain causing this year's illness -- Flu A Beijing -- is proving so virulent. First identified in China in 1992, it arrived in Britain last March but caused few problems. The current wave of illness began in Mississippi in the United States last August. It was first detected in the UK in October. Alan Hay, director of the Influenza Research Centre at the National Institute for Medical Research in north London, said that this year's virus strain was little different from that of previous years.
