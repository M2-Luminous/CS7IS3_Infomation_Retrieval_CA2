This was the question being asked yesterday evening in Paris, 24 hours after the U.S. President had taken a clear position -- in public at the National Assembly but also in private in talks with [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur, [President] Francois Mitterrand, and [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe -- in favor of the European peace plan. This plan provides for a division of the territory of Bosnia between the Serbs and the Croatian-Muslim alliance (created under the aegis of the United States). No one dared answer the question in the affirmative, but some senior figures were hoping firmly that the cease-fire would not "be broken nearly as soon as it was signed," like so many others in the former Yugoslavia. This glimmer of hope was largely due to the determination shown by Clinton during his stay in Paris. "His declarations before the deputies were very clear," it was said in Juppe's entourage. "But his resolution was clearer still during the talks in the Hotel Matignon [office of the prime minister office] and the Elysee palace [office of the president]." Reliable sources confirmed that Bosnia was the only topic of the discussions at the Elysee palace, bringing together the two presidents, Juppe, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher and various staffers. This was at President Clinton's request; he was virtually the only one to talk for the U.S. side and showed an excellent grasp of such a complex subject. "We were talking with a politician," it was said on the French side, "whereas when we talk with State Department officials, we have the impression of dealing with ideologues who only think in terms of good and evil." This sneer obviously refers to Warren Christopher, who four months ago reproached the Europeans for supporting an "immoral and unjust" plan and confusing "aggressors and aggressed." On Tuesday [7 June] in the Elysee he is reported to not have said a word, whereas Clinton proved that he had "understood the catastrophic scenario" which would result from lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia. Clinton gave the impression that he was not prepared to allow the Muslims to increase their territorial claims much beyond the 51 percent accorded by the European peace plan to the Croatian-Muslim federation. The solution could lie in turning a number of urban centers currently occupied by the Serbs, but where a large number of Muslims lived before the hostilities started, into "gray" zones under UN control. Juppe put forward the idea in an interview published today in LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Juppe said in the interview that "there is a chance" that the peace plan will work. "The Croats accept the Geneva plan. The Serbs accept the Geneva plan," the foreign minister said, "I think that the Muslims will accept the 51/49 proportion, as they did last December in Geneva, if we define another 4-5 percent of `gray zones.'" In this interview, given before Clinton came to Paris, Juppe also attacked those who accused him of "capitulation." "With 58 percent, we would be respecting, they say, international morality, right, and justice," he said. "But with 51 percent, we would be blamed with capitulation and the acceptance of an ethnic division! Does the difference between good and evil lie in 7 percent more or less land?" Although nothing allows Juppe's prudent optimism to be taken at face value as yet, it is certain that Clinton's determination has strengthened him. More will be known in the coming days, when the contact group, which includes the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, will look again at the subject of territorial partition, which was not covered in the agreement signed yesterday. This contact group could very soon be enlarged to include Italy, and if all goes more or less well, France hopes to achieve a meeting of the contact group countries by the end of the month, but at the ministerial level this time. Another crucial date, if no solution is in sight in the short term, is that of the summit meeting of the main industrialized countries, the G-7, to be held in Naples from 8 to 10 July. The main powers involved in seeking a negotiated settlement will be gathered there: the United States, the UK, France, Germany, and also Italy and above all Russia. It has been decided that Boris Yeltsin, whose country is theoretically responsible for putting pressure on the Serbs, will take part in the political part of the summit. For France, the Naples meeting is particularly important. It is, Juppe said, a sort of deadline after which Paris will reexamine the presence of its contingent in Bosnia. A way of keeping pressure on negotiations which will have many more low points yet.
