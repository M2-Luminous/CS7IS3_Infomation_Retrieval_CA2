FR941025-0-00072 FR941025-0-00025 3. Can be addressed through emergency regulations for which the immediate benefits outweigh the value of advance notice, public comment, and deliberative consideration of the impacts on participants to the same extent as would be expected under the normal rulemaking process. This emergency interim rule would temporarily relieve a restriction on the participants in the fishery without the likelihood of jeopardizing the long-term biological viability of the royal red shrimp resource. NMFS concurs with the Council's findings about the economic emergency and the need for immediate regulatory action. Accordingly, NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule, effective from October 19, 1994, through December 31, 1994, as authorized by section 305(c)(1) and (c)(3) of the Magnuson Act. Classification The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. This emergency interim rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. The AA finds that the immediate need to relieve an economic emergency in the royal red shrimp fishery constitutes good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and an opportunity for public comment, pursuant to authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), as such procedures would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Similarly, the need to implement these measures in a timely manner to address the economic emergency constitutes good cause under authority contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to waive the 30-day delay in effective date.
