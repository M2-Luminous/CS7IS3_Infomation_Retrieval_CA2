RIA - Leader of the People's Rukh of Ukraine Vyacheslav Chornovil holds the view that the national-democratic forces have suffered a defeat at the elections to the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine. In an interview with RIA he said that by the middle of April 10 it became clear that the frankly pro-communist forces will have at the minimum one-third of the seats in the new parliament of Ukraine. However, it is too early for the communists to celebrate a full victory, he went on to say. In his opinion, they will not have one half of the seats in the parliament, and the question what political force will dominate in the Supreme Soviet will be resolved somewhat later, when it becomes clear whom the numerous independent deputies and centrists will side with. In Chornovil's view, the RUKH movement will be able to form parliamentary group, but the national-democratic forces will hardly win more than one third of the seats. The RUKH leader has stated that he has documents proving the numerous violations of the electoral legislation. The respective documents will be turned over to the Supreme Court of the republic.
