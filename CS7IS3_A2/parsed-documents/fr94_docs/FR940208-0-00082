FR940208-0-00082 FR940208-0-00031 The Service is required to base critical habitat designations upon the best scientific and commercial data available (50 CFR 424.12). In designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise, the Service has reviewed its overall approach to the conservation of the desert tortoise undertaken since its emergency listing in 1989. In addition, the Service reviewed all available information that pertains to habitat requirements of this species, including material received during the public comment period from State and Federal agencies, other entities, and members of the public. Inherent difficulties in designating critical habitat for wide-ranging threatened species, such as the desert tortoise, make it unlikely that all habitat within the range of the species would be included in the designation. In fact, section 3(5)(C) of the Act states that, in most cases, critical habitat should not encompass the entire range of the species. Based upon the parameters discussed below, the Service determined the appropriateness of including specific areas. Habitat Characteristics The Service has determined that the physical and biological habitat features (referred to as the primary constituent elements) that support nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow are essential to the conservation of the desert tortoise. These elements were determined from studies on desert tortoise habitat preferences (e.g., habitat structure and use, forage requirements) throughout the range of the species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). Desert tortoise habitat consists of the following primary constituent elements: Sufficient space to support viable populations within each of the six recovery units and provide for movements, dispersal, and gene flow; sufficient quantity and quality of forage species and the proper soil conditions to provide for the growth of such species; suitable substrates for burrowing, nesting, and overwintering; burrows, caliche caves, and other shelter sites; sufficient vegetation for shelter from temperature extremes and predators; and habitat protected from disturbance and human-caused mortality. Designated critical habitat for the desert tortoise encompasses portions of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts that contain the primary constituent elements and focuses on areas that are essential to the species' recovery. The CHU boundaries are based on proposed DWMAs in the Draft Recovery Plan. Because the boundaries were drawn to conform with accepted principles of conservation biology (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993), the areas may contain both ``suitable'' and ``unsuitable'' habitat. The term ``suitable'' generally refers to habitat that provides the constituent elements of nesting, sheltering, foraging, dispersal, and/or gene flow. Ecological Considerations The range of the Mojave population of the desert tortoise includes portions of the Mojave Desert and the Colorado Desert division of the Sonoran Desert (Colorado Desert) and spans portions of four States. The Mojave Desert is located in southern California, southern Nevada, northwestern Arizona, and southwestern Utah. It is bordered on the north by the Great Basin Desert, on the west by the Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi ranges, on the south by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains and the Colorado Desert, and on the east by the Grand Wash Cliffs and Hualapai Mountains of Arizona. This area includes parts of Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside Counties in California; the northwestern part of Mohave County in Arizona; Clark County, and the southern parts of Esmeralda, Nye, and Lincoln Counties in Nevada; and part of Washington County in Utah. The Colorado Desert is located south of the Mojave Desert, east of California's Peninsular Ranges, and west of the Colorado River. This area includes Imperial County and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, California. The desert tortoise is most commonly found within the desert scrub vegetation type, primarily in creosote bush scrub vegetation, but also in succulent scrub, cheesebush scrub, blackbush scrub, hopsage scrub, shadscale scrub, microphyll woodland, and Mojave saltbush-allscale scrub. Within the desert microphyll woodland, the desert tortoise occurs in blue palo verde-ironwood-smoke tree woodland. The desert tortoise also occurs in scrub-steppe vegetation types of the desert and semidesert grassland complex (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). Within these vegetation types, desert tortoises potentially can survive and reproduce where their basic habitat requirements are met. These requirements include a sufficient amount and quality of forage species; shelter sites for protection from predators and environmental extremes; suitable substrates for burrowing, nesting, and overwintering; various plants for shelter; and adequate area for movement, dispersal, and gene flow. Throughout most of the Mojave Region, tortoises occur most commonly on gently sloping terrain with soils ranging from sand to sandy-gravel and with scattered shrubs, and where there is abundant inter-shrub space for growth of herbaceous plants. Throughout their range, however, tortoises can be found in steeper, rockier areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). The size of desert tortoise home ranges varies with respect to location and year. Females have long-term home ranges that are approximately half that of the average male, which range from 10 to 80 hectares (Berry 1986).
