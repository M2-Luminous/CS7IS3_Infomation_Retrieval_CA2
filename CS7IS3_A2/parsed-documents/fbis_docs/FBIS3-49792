When do you expect from the signing of the peace partnership declaration adopted in Brussels? [Jeszenszky] I cannot yet give you a firm answer to this question, but it will take place soon. After certain political consultations at home, the signing of this cooperation will take place soon. The U.S. side plans to send a further delegation to Hungary, as well as to the other states, in the near future. This is not an international agreement, so it does not need parliamentary ratification; however, the government believes it important to have the broadest possible political consensus behind this. [Gog] The signing of the statement will be followed by the bilateral NATO-Hungarian agreement on cooperation, one that contains the details of cooperation. What does Hungary plan to include in this project? [Jeszenszky] Definitely the framework of concrete cooperation, political representation, and participation in the activity of the NATO Headquarters. We would also like to include something that is there in the Brussels document, namely that the goal is full membership and, at the same time, that we accept certain obligations. [Gog] Will certain concrete elements of military cooperation, such as the organization of military exercises, military training, and participation in peacekeeping missions also be included in the treaty? [Jeszenszky] Of course. However, some elements of military cooperation have already been effected, such as the training of Hungarian officers in various NATO countries, as well as the broadening of control over airspace. As a UN member, Hungary also participates in certain peacekeeping actions, for example in Mozambique and Cambodia. When we train in a NATO framework, this will also advance the reform of the Hungarian Army. [Gog] All four Visegrad countries have already announced their willingness to participate in the cooperation offered under the Partnership for Peace program. In your opinion, in what way are President Clinton's visit and discussions in Prague important? [Jeszenszky] Actually, exactly what NATO was offering only transpired on Monday [10 January]. This is an American proposal and it had to be accepted by NATO. The United States played an important and positive role in making the NATO summit accept this rich cooperation program after all and, in this way, opened a possible venue. It was not their goal in Prague to convince us that this peace partnership is good for us and that it provides adequate security, and it was not our goal to convince them that this should be better and that they should give as much as possible; instead, we talked of ways in which the stability of Hungary and its neighbors could be advanced, for example in economic matters, because these matters are very important from the viewpoint of security.
