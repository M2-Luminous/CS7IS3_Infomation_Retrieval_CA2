"Newsreel" first asked the opinion of [Defense Minister] Lajos Fur. [Begin Fur recording] A very important statement has been attributed to President Clinton: NATO does not need Hungary and the other east-central European countries. However, it is my conviction that this is only a temporary political view. Sooner or later Western Europe and the Atlantic countries must realize that without creating and guaranteeing the security of east-central Europe it is impossible to create general European security. [end recording] Does the Foreign Ministry consider the announcement official? [Begin recording] [Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman] No, it is clear from news agency reports that this is a newspaper's opinion. The United States has never said recently that admission of this region's countries to NATO is expected in the near future. It is obvious that this is a process and that within this process, the NATO summit on 10 January in Brussels is going to be a very important event. We expect that the NATO summit will make it unequivocal: The North Atlantic Alliance is an open organization, so the countries that meet the requirements, in perspective, may become members of the organization. A new initiative, the Partnership for Peace program, has come about. We expect that the NATO summit will open up and make this program accessible. Hungary accepts the Partnership for Peace initiative and strives to fill it with real content. [Unidentified correspondent] However, the Partnership for Peace means a lot less than the possible membership. [Herman] Yes, it means less. We can clearly see that it does not quite meet the expectations prevailing in the region and also in Hungary. However, it is a step in the right direction, and an important step at that, and we have no reason for not hoping that other steps will follow in the future. [end recording]
