The secretary's visit to the cosmodrome is of a sight-seeing nature. However, the aims pursued by this trip are self-evident. The U.S. side is interested in studying Baykonur's possibilities with a view to U.S. participation in the use of its unique potential. In the opinion of several local analysts, Kazakhstan tries to bring pressure on Russia by organising the U.S. defence secretary's visit to Baykonur. Several rounds of the Kazakh-Russian talks held in the recent past brought closer the positions of the sides. However, they could not agree, for the time being, on the period of a lease and the amount of a lease payment. Almaty believes that if the United States displays readiness for cooperation with the Republic in the use of the cosmodrome, it will be possible to cut short the duration of its leasing to Russia and, consequently, to start earlier the establishment of an international space company or any other form of its utilisation on a multilateral basis. Following the visit to Baykonur, Perry and his party will go to Kiev.
