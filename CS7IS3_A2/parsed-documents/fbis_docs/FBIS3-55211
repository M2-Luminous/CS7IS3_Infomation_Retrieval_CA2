Esteemed members of Government! For several days there have been reports in various mass media and on television and the radio concerning the closure of the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, the inaugurator of which was the former Russian Federation Council of Ministers. The reason for the destruction of a newspaper which in the course of the past year has become one of Russia's leading publications, and one, moreover, with its own identity (which is very rare for the present rich newspaper market) is the decision of the journalists' collective to become the founder of its newspaper. In our view the arguments for and aims of this decision are set forth with full justification in published items (ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Nos. 250, 254, and 1-2). ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's desire to become an autonomous and free representative of the mass media, independent of organs of power, cannot and should not be viewed as a compromise or an attempt to enter into opposition with the government. On the contrary, we are sure that the theme of power and society, the theme of the establishment of Russian statehood, which have been the main ones in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and its supplement -- VEKHI, the newspaper of the independent intelligentsia -- must remain leading ones. It is this free and open expression of feelings and profound thoughts about Russia's paths, its economy, politics, and culture, and about man above all, which must not be fettered by any bureaucratic pressure or membership of the apparatus. In the democratic state which we have proclaimed and in which we are all learning to live there should be no "vassal press." Otherwise we shall return again to the obedient semi-official organ of PRAVDA and authoritarian methods of leadership. As readers of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI we cannot fail to note that the VEKHI supplement is as of today the only platform to express the views and arguments, positions and creations of the most diverse writers, journalists, critics, historians, philosophers, and art critics. Do not allow the destruction of a child in whose birth you yourselves were involved! Defend the interests of our fellow citizens and readers who have chosen ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. And there are 600,000 of them.
