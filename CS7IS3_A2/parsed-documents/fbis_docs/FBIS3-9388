The convention adopted the [word indistinct] declaration and elected delegates to the assembly of the Serbian Civic Council, which will be held in Sarajevo on 27 March. Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, attended the meeting. Our correspondent Enes Osmancevic reports on the meeting: [Begin recording] [Osmancevic] With the genuine feeling of overall affiliation to Bosnia-Herzegovina as an irrefutable historical fact, we voice our reason and spirit against national-fascism expressed in the genocide, which was aimed not only at creating ethnically pure areas but also at destroying basic human values. This is the basic message of the consultative convention of the Serbian people held in Tuzla today, which was attended by Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fact that we wanted to live on this territory and that we remain living here is the best proof that we did not succumb to Greater Serbia national hysteria. We voice our condemnation of the inspirers and perpetrators of war crimes, it is said in the joint statement of ethnic Serb citizens who attended today's convention. Rejecting, as he put it, all forms of tribal loyalty to Karadzic, Koljevic, and Plavsic, (Miso) Bozic expressed the stand that was accepted as the basis for the statement by Tuzla delegates to the forthcoming Sarajevo convention. It reads as follows: We accept joint life in Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent, sovereign, united state within its internationally recognized borders, which was for centuries adorned by a multinational and multicultural character. Addressing the people present, Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, proposed the following: [Pejanovic] [Words indistinct] halting of all military activities and offensives on the part of the Serbian side with the decisive pressure by the international community to control a cease-fire and peace in all points [words indistinct]. Second, we demand that the Serbian side be included in negotiations on an overall peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina under the auspices of the United Nations, the United States, the European Union, the Russian Federation, other countries, and all other factors participating in determining our destiny. Third, we think that the federal [word indistinct] setup based on cantons is a basis for reaching a global solution for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is really involved is a slight modification of the well-known Vance-Owen plan, which was not given full support (?then) in the given historical situation. In our opinion, that is one of the best solutions that keeps the wholeness of Bosnia-Herzegovina and enables equality of the peoples, as well as self-assurance [samobitnost] and cultural autonomy. Fourth, we think that Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a joint state of equal peoples, in its wholeness within internationally recognized borders, according to the Republican Presidency's platform on the work under war conditions, has economic, cultural, and national interests of Muslims, Serbs, and Croats. Fifth, we propose that it is in the ultimate interest of all peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina that the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina join the union of European countries and thereby ensure its economic and cultural prosperity and restoration [words indistinct] interests in Europe. [applause] Sixth, I propose to demand that the Serbian Civic Council take part in negotiations with the international community on the political future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serbian Civic Council will be constituted in Sarajevo on Sunday [27 March] as the proponent of the interests of ethnic Serbian citizens in Bosnia-Herzegovina who favor a just peace, the equality of peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, civil and human rights, and Bosnia-Herzegovina in its historical and internationally recognized borders. [applause] [Osmancevic] Supporting the assembly of ethnic Serb citizens which, as was said, together with the Pan-Bosniak convention and the assembly of Croats, is striving toward a full respect for human and civil rights, which are a prerequisite of a modern democratic society in which national, cultural, religious, and other characteristics of all citizens of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be respected, cherished, and admired, the Serb People's Convention held in Tuzla today has elected delegates to the Sarajevo assembly, where the Serbian Civic Council will be constituted.
