The bill seeks to reform laws related to intellectual property. A group of lawyers considers the bill to have serious flaws because it was not proposed by the Executive or Judicial Branches as stipulated by the Constitution. [Begin lawyer Alvaro Cedeno recording] First, this law is unconstitutional. According to our Constitution, a law of this nature has to be proposed by the Executive Branch. Furthermore, this law annuls articles, chapters, and entire sections of our codes. Laws that annul or modify national codes are organic laws, and they, specifically the ones that annul our codes, have to be proposed by either the Supreme Court, the attorney general, or the solicitor general. [end recording] Lawyer Cedeno said that the bill had been proposed by a Legislative Assembly commission and that it was not empowered to do so by the Constitution. This, he added, is another factor that makes the bill under discussion unconstitutional. The bill attempts to create a confiscation penalty, and the criminal code indicates that a confiscation is an accessory penalty. The bill, thus, violates the pretrial concept, Cedeno observed. [Begin Cedeno recording] Apparently, the law intends to give authors protection. [end recording] Cedeno said he would promote protests from several sectors if the legislators insist on passing this bill.
