As discussed above in Subsection 9, Labor Requirements and Possible Employment Benefits of Regulatory Compliance, EPA also recognized that the manufacture, installation, and operation of equipment for complying with the Option 3/S.1 regulation would require use of labor resources. To the extent that these labor needs translate into employment increases in complying firms, the regulation has the potential to generate employment benefits that may partially offset the employment losses that are expected to occur in facilities impacted by the rule. Using the same methodology as described in Subsection 9, EPA estimated an annual direct labor requirement of 211 full-time equivalent positions for complying with the Option 3/S.1 regulation. This labor requirement may offset somewhat the conservatively estimated 688 employment losses in impacted PFPR facilities (see Table 21).
