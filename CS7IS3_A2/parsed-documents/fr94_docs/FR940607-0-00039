FR940607-0-00039 FR940607-0-00015 For these reasons, EPA will also consider ash from combined sources to be newly identified for purposes of the land disposal restrictions. Furthermore, it will not apply the existing treatment standards for EP toxicity. As a result of this decision, Section 3004(g)(4) requires EPA to promulgate treatment standards for combined ash within 6 months of the date of this notice. V. Other Subtitle C Requirements EPA is not extending compliance dates for any other aspect of the hazardous waste regulations. Facilities generating, transporting, or treating, storing or disposing of hazardous ash must, as a matter of federal law, comply with the substantive requirements of 40 CFR parts 260&hyph;270 on the effective date of the Court's decision. (See the discussion of state authorization below to determine when the decision takes effect under authorized state RCRA programs.) EPA reminds generators, transporters and treatment, storage and disposal facilities that they must promptly obtain EPA identification numbers. See, e.g., 40 CFR 262.12. EPA intends to issue an implementation strategy in the near future that will provide additional information on complying with other RCRA requirements. To facilitate compliance with Subtitle C, EPA has developed draft guidance for the sampling of ash from waste-to-energy facilities. EPA has already released this draft. Interested parties may obtain a copy by calling the RCRA/Superfund Hotline, Office of Solid Waste, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (800) 424&hyph;9346, TDD (800) 553&hyph;7672 (hearing impaired); in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the number is (703) 920&hyph;9810, TDD (703) 486&hyph;3323. EPA soon will publish a separate Federal Register notice requesting comment on the draft. EPA notes that by following certain waste management practices, some facilities may not need interim status or a RCRA permit. For example, under federal regulations, generators of hazardous ash may accumulate and treat ash onsite in tanks or containers for up to 90 days without obtaining hazardous waste permits under 40 CFR 262.34. See also 51 FR 10186 (May 24, 1986.) VI. State Authorization and Implementation A. Permit Deadline Extension 1. General Principles Section 3006(b) of RCRA allows states to obtain authorization to implement state hazardous waste programs in lieu of federal law. To obtain authorization, a state must show that its program is equivalent to the Federal program. EPA interprets this requirement to mean that state laws and rules must be no less stringent than federal requirements. Section 3009, however, expressly allows states the option of establishing more stringent requirements. Forty-eight states and territories are now authorized for all of the RCRA requirements established prior to November 1984 (the RCRA ``base program''). In these states, the state's definition of hazardous waste_including any exemptions_operates in lieu of the federal definition. Changes to the federal definition do not automatically revise independently promulgated state regulations. Rather, the states are required to revise their programs and submit the revisions to EPA for approval. The revision does not take effect under federal law until EPA approves the revision. As explained below, in a few of these states, the Court's decision may not take effect on its federal law effective date. EPA believes that there are very few states in this category. Where the Court's decision does eliminate an exemption for ash, the hazardous waste characteristic most likely to apply to ash is the TC as determined by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (``TCLP'') promulgated by EPA in 1990. This rule was promulgated under one of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (``HSWA''). Section 3006(g) provides that rules promulgated under HSWA take effect in all states at the same time, displacing state rules unless the state rules are more stringent. EPA implements the new HSWA rule until the state adopts an equivalent provision, submits it to EPA, and obtains EPA approval. 50 FR 28728&hyph;30. (July 15, 1985). The TC and TCLP displaced the 1980 EP toxicity characteristic and leaching procedure. The EP, however, also remains in effect as a matter of state law in many states. Sixteen states are now authorized for the TC and TCLP (see list in Table 1). EPA continues to implement the TC and the TCLP in the remaining states. EPA takes the position that, where it implements the TC, it uses federal permitting procedures. Consequently, EPA will implement the permit deadline extension announced today in all states where it implements the TC. Owners and operators in those states would file Part A applications with EPA Regional Offices. (See list in Table 2.) Where a state has been authorized to implement the TC, however, state permit procedures are in effect. Today's deadline extension is not in effect in those states. Moreover, since the extension makes permit requirements less stringent, states are not required to adopt equivalent extensions. If any of these states chooses to provide equivalent relief, owners and operators would file permit applications with the state agency. To summarize, in order to determine the impact of today's action, persons handling ash must determine (1) the impact of the Court's decision on the RCRA program in each state (primarily an issue of whether a state's base program contains an authorized exemption for ash) and (2) whether the entity authorized to implement the TC and TCLP has extended its permit deadline. 2. Application of Principles: Status of Court Decision and Permit Exemption in Individual States a. Unauthorized states. In the eight states and territories where EPA implements all portions of the RCRA program (see Table 1 for a list of these states and territories), including the base program, the Court's decision will eliminate EPA's interpretative ash exemption on the opinion's effective date. Since EPA implements the TC, the permit deadline extension will take effect today. Owners and operators of facilities who wish to obtain interim status to manage hazardous ash may file Part A applications with EPA Regional Offices. (See list in Table 2.) b. Authorized states. The issues in authorized states are very complex. Table 3 summarizes the status of the decision and the permit deadline for major categories of states. This text presents a few explanatory notes.
