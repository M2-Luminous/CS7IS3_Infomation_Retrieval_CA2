The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by Serbs in the Serb ethnic and historical territories in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and Croatia's violations of human and national rights of Serbs there. It lies between the former Yugoslav Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The Belgrade daily set out that the French convoy was stopped at the Krajina-Croatia Turanj border-crossing and that the explosive cargo was intended for the Moslems in the Cazin region, a Moslem enclave in western Bosnia. The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members presented the papers for the cargo showing they were carrying 720 rounds of mines for 80 mm mortars, 60 smoke pots, 112 packs of teargas and 21 signal rockets which the Moslems in the Cazin region used as a gift from NATO, the daily said. When asked by the R.S.K. border police to examine the cargo's content and establish it matched the description in the papers, the check was not allowed. After that the R.S.K. police returned the convoy to Croatia, the daily noted. The daily added that one day (Sunday) prior to this event Canadian UNPROFOR member tried in the same way to drive six trucks with 10 tonnes of ammunition towards their base in the Lika area, but lacking permission and prior announcement were turned back to Croatia. One may understand the claim that UNPROFOR was "replenishing" its ammunition stocks, but the question remained what the teargas and smoke grenades and mines were for, asked the daily. "Does the U.N. expect some special military action soon and what kind? Perhaps this action is to be veiled by a smoke screen, so that there can be no detection from which side hostile action comes from. Or is this the "dowry", as ordered, for the latest Croatian-Moslem "marriage" in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for some future time?" the daily asked. The Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who clashed for the past year for domination over territories, signed under U.S. pressure last Friday in Washington an agreement on forming a Moslem-Croatian federation in Bosnia which would later form a confederation with the neighboring Croatia. Political analysts say the motive for creating the Moslem-Croatian federation and subsequently a confederation with Croatia was to isolate and pressure the Serb side into accepting the peace settlement as designed by the West.
