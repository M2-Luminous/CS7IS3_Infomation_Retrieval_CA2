The defense minister made these remarks at the National Congress Administrative Headquarters where he had been summoned by the Chamber of Deputies Environment Committee to discuss issues related to the environmental problems faced in the southern part of the country. The hearing was called off due to absence of the parliamentarians, only Committee President Cesar Perez Vivas was present. In this respect, the defense minister urged the media not to fall prey to the rumors "since they only overwhelm the country and what we want to do is pull away from this crisis through employment, before the violence which has appeared recently spreads throughout the country and threatens all Venezuelans. With or without weapons, we must maintain peace." On the presence of masked groups [encapuchados], Gen.

We believe the students are confident that these problems will not continue and that there will be an end to violence, as well as that we will all work in peace." In reference to the accusations made by retired Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias with respect to a coup attempt, the defense minister said that Chavez must present evidence of his allegations since intelligence operations have failed to turn up anything. There have been new reports and we are confronting a situation of constant accusations without any evidence, which are aimed at specific institutions or trade unions." Nevertheless, he added, the National Armed Forces [FAN] intelligence members and other state security organizations are working 24 hours a day. With respect to military promotions, he indicated that the promotion process has been clear throughout the current year, and that the list of candidates will be forwarded to the National Congress for evaluation sometime at the end of this month. With respect to the summons, the general indicated that during the next few days he will present a report to the Committee on Environmental Problems, which will be from the military's perspective.
