"Such actions can be interpreted only as political irresponsibility and deliberate ignoring of the Russian-Ukrainian agreements reached in Yalta and Massandra", the press service of the Navy told TASS on Monday qualifying the events as "provocative". "The actions of the Ukrainian side are provocative in essence and form, are a flagrant violation of the reached agreements and create an explosive situation on the Black Sea Fleet", the press service said. 120 Ukrainian commandos from a special task force seized late on Sunday a division of the Black Sea Fleet, including its coast facilities, the communication centre, the premises containing secret documents and weapons. Commander of the unit Captain First Rank Oleg Feoktistov and Commander of the coast units Captain Second Rank Dmitriy Starikov were arrested, handcuffed and taken to the military commandant's office. Chief of staff Captain Second Rank Aleksandr Zelenko was also arrested. Navymen and members of their families were beaten during the attack. "Who could have ordered such actions against a military unit making part of the Black Sea Fleet which is subordinated to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine?", the press service asked and added that most indignation is caused by brutalities of Ukrainian commandos towards family members of navymen.
