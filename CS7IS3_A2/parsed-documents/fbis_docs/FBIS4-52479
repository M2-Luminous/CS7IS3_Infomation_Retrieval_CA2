Japanese trade officials in charge of the framework talks, for example, have made contacts with their U.S. counterparts by telephone, Hata told a regular press conference. As there is little time before the end-of-June target for restarting the talks, Japan wants more opportunities for discussion with Washington, Hata said. The trade minister previously said Japan wants to use "all kinds of communication channels" with the U.S. to pave the way for an early reopening of the framework talks, suspended since the breakdown in the February summit between then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Tokyo and Washington vowed efforts for a breakthrough in the suspended trade talks before the July summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrialized nations in Naples. On Japan's assistance to South Africa, Hata said his ministry is now working to formulate specific aid programs for the country.
