FBIS4-43067 "drweu113_l_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-113 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 SPAIN Gonzalez Concedes Defeat Gonzalez Concedes Defeat LD1206221994 Madrid TVE Internacional Television in Spanish 1755 GMT 12 Jun 94 LD1206221994 Madrid TVE Internacional Television Spanish BFN [Statement by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez from the Spanish Socialist Workers Party headquarters in Madrid -- live] [Text] I want to make a statement in the first place to say that according to the results known so far in these elections, which I think are now unchangeable, the People's Party [PP] has won the elections. Therefore, elections to the European Parliament belong to the People's Party. They are to be congratulated and congratulated democratically. Therefore, this is the first statement. I phoned PP leader Jose Maria Aznar as soon as these first results were known to congratulate him. Second, we are awaiting the results from the elections to the Andalusian Parliament. We will be the major party, although with less seats. I have also congratulated Manuel Chaves [prime minister of the Andalusian Autonomous Government]. Third, and this is addressed to all of you, I want to say something. Twelve years ago, a little more than 12 years ago, 12 years as everyone knows...[pauses] we have been winning elections as the Socialist party. We have an extraordinarily faithful electorate, over 30 percent. We have to give our deepest thanks for its loyalty and faithfulness at moments of difficulty. I sincerely believe that this is a good base for recovery. We have time ahead of us. We have to carry out government capable of overcoming the two elements that I believe have had a negative influence in what is probably the worst moment we are experiencing. One of these elements, without a doubt, has been corruption, and the other element has been the economic crisis. Despite the fact that we are coming out of it, despite this, it is still not being noticed among the people. Therefore, there has been a part of the electorate that on this occasion I believe has abstained. It has not given us its vote and this has meant that we have gone down in the results. I want to give you all the encouragement that I feel. Even if the results were not what they were, and they are respectable, being over 30 percent, even if they had not been what they have been, I repeat, I would have the fighting spirit to try to win the next elections as I think is right for a political program such as the one we represent. According to the figures I have, I think that at the level of the European Union [EU], which could also be a complementary element, we will continue to be the largest group in the European Parliament, but we still have to wait. The Socialist and Social Democratic group will be the largest in the European Parliament. We also have the satisfaction that Austria has won its referendum by approximately two-thirds of the population, therefore, there is a new EU member. I do not want to go on much longer. But I want to remind you that democratically and unreservedly I congratulate those who have won. We know how to win and lose elections and we are going to win the next elections. Therefore, take heart, you have worked very hard. There is a very significant part of the electorate that continues to give us its support at moments of extreme difficulty. Therefore, as is already happening, when we clearly begin to overcome the economic crisis the wind will blow in our favor. When we try and succeed in eliminating from public life those who take advantage of it, from wherever they come from, we will also improve our electoral possibilities. Finally, I just want to make a personal comment. When I win elections, when we have won elections, and we have won many times, you see me a bit serious. I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility. Now we have lost I want to encourage you with a smile to try to win the next elections. It is in our power and we can do so. So, take heart. Do not let this work fail because it is for a great political program that has historically transformed our life and will continue to do so in the future. Finally, I want to say something else especially to the press. Tomorrow morning government has to continue. I am absolutely prepared to give stability to the country's government, to try to improve the economic situation, and to strengthen the fight against corruption. Therefore, as from tomorrow, when I have to make an unavoidable trip to Colombia, as from tomorrow, we will again begin our work as a government and we will try to carry out a deeper analysis than I have just done as to what have been the causes, the deep causes, of this electoral situation, and we will try to overcome them. Have confidence, trust in the future, the future belongs to democratic socialism. Thank you.
