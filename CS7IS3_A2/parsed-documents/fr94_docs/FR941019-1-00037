FR941019-1-00037 FR941019-1-00004 C. Duty To Correct or Update A further criticism of the Commission's existing safe harbor is that the rule has created confusion over whether and when there is a duty to correct or update projections once they are made. A recent article suggests that issuers are often advised by their counsel to refrain from making forward-looking statements in Commission filings, or even from speaking to analysts, because they fear that by doing so they will ``assume'' a duty to update their forward-looking statements as and when the facts and circumstances surrounding their original statements change. 73 Furthermore, the paucity of caselaw in this area has left issuers without comfort or certainty as to when and if there is any duty to update or correct. 74 Commentators have questioned how long a forward-looking statement will be considered current and how far in the future, if at all, an issuer must continue to update. 75 73 See H. Pitt and K. Groskaufmanis, Selective Disclosure can be Perilous , Nat'l. L. J. (Apr. 18, 1994) at B4. 74 The First Circuit has stated that the duty to update is triggered if a statement having a forward intent or implication, upon which investors are expected to rely, has been made. Backman v. Polaroid , 910 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (en banc). The Ninth Circuit stated that an accurate announcement of past events did not carry with it the duty to disclose whether past trends would continue. In re Convergent Technologies Securities Litigation , 948 F.2d 507 (9th Cir. 1991). See generally Schneider, Update on the Duty to Update: Did Polaroid Produce the Instant Movie After All? , 23 Rev. of Sec. & Commodities Reg. 83 (May 9, 1990). 75 See generally , C. Schneider, Soft Disclosure: Thrust and Parries When Bad News Follows Optimistic Statements , 26 Rev. Sec. & Comm. Reg. 5 (1993); R. Rosenblum, An Issuer's Duty Under Rule 10b&hyph;5 To Correct and Update Materially Misleading Statements , 40 Cath. Univ. L. Rev. 289 (1991). D. Entanglement and Endorsement Another concern voiced by companies is whether to make forward-looking disclosures to securities analysts and institutional investors, whether in the context of initial public offering ``roadshows'' or otherwise, and the corresponding liability for any forward-looking statements included in the analysts' reports or statements. Companies complain that a better balance must be struck between the incentives and disincentives of disclosure to analysts. 76 The New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities Dealers encourage listed or quoted corporations to seek out formal and informal contact with analysts to facilitate the accurate pricing of their securities. 77 The Commission also encourages such communications as a complement to disclosure under the Exchange Act. 78 76 See generally A. Berkeley & M. Smith, Corporate Disclosure: Potential Pitfalls , Securities & Commodities Regulation (June 26, 1991). 77 See New York Stock Exchange Manual, ยง202.02; American Stock Exchange Guide ยง402; and National Association of Securities Dealers Investor Relations Guide, Cultivating the Investment Community , at 18. 78 Securities Act Release No. 6504 (Jan. 13, 1984).
