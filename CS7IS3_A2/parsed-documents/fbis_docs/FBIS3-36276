But If You Went to School With Pavel Grachev It Might Be Invented for You"] [Text] Sources in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry report that increasingly serious irritation at the minister's personnel policy is brewing among officers and generals in the military department. Photocopies of the biographical details of generals in Pavel Grachev's immediate entourage who have moved up the promotion ladder unusually swiftly for the military have been circulated in Russian Federation Defense Ministry directorates and departments and the General Staff in the past few days. These generals include Lieutenant General Valeriy Lapshov, leader of the defense minister's administration, who was an ordinary senior officer in the General Staff Main Operations Directorate until 1991. He once studied in the same group as Grachev at the General Staff Academy. In fall of 1991 Grachev, who was then Shaposhnikov's deputy, took him under his wing, making him first a major general, and later a lieutenant general. It is confirmed that only Deputy Minister Valeriy Mironov, who at that time supervised personnel questions, objected to Lapshov acquiring the rank of colonel general. (He is not supervising them any more.) Today Lapshov occupies one of the key posts in the Defense Ministry: He largely controls whether a particular document or person reaches the minister. Among the senior officers in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry, Lapshov is known as a sociable man, an indispensable organizer of dinners for friends. It cannot be ruled out that this is precisely the reason why the equally sociable Pavel Grachev took a shine to him. Major General Sergey Zdorikov, a career political worker recently appointed chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Directorate for Work With Personnel, was also a student in the same group as Grachev and Lapshov at the General Staff Academy. According to the recollections of his fellow students, he was renowned as an extremely undisciplined student and persistent truant. Now he is the head teacher in the Russian Army. Dmitriy Kharchenko was also a student in the same group as Grachev, Lapshov, and Zdorikov. After the General Staff Academy, he was in command of a supernumerary [zashtatnyy] division near Nizhniy Novgorod for a short time, and then became chief of the General Staff International Treaty Directorate. He has neither a legal nor a diplomatic education, but he quickly obtained the post of lieutenant general and moved up to deputy chief of the General Staff, although it would appear that the post of chief of an ordinary General Staff directorate does not merit this promotion. The military department suspects that the explanation is quite simple: Kharchenko managed to become part of Grachev's family -- their children married. It is now planned that Kharchenko's directorate will be given main directorate status, and he himself will be awarded the rank of colonel general. Gennadiy Ivanov also studied together with Grachev, Lapshov, Zdorikov, and Kharchenko at the General Staff Academy. Before studying at the academy, he headed a group at an operational-strategic research center, now abolished in view of the fact that it was completely useless. According to his classmates' opinions, he was no genius, but, following Grachev's appointment as defense minister, the latter took Colonel Ivanov under his wing -- and made him first chief of group and then chief of the Directorate for Military Organizational Development and Reform. This directorate was dubbed "Directorate for the Rising and Setting of the Sun" at the Defense Ministry. Within a short time Ivanov became lieutenant general and today is in charge of all questions connected with the reform of the Army. Everyone has the right to judge for themselves the results of his work. Major General Vladimir Nikitin, chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Administrative Directorate, alas, did not go to school with Grachev, Lapshov, Zdorikov, Kharchenko, and Ivanov. Maybe that is why, having entered the Main Personnel Directorate as an ordinary civilian employee, he only reached the rank of major over a period of a number of years. However, the events of August 1991 were his hour of triumph -- after spending three days in the "White House," Nikitin was invited to join the State-Legal Administration under the Russian Federation president. There, within a year, he became a major general (although, as his fellow workers joke, before he received his general's shoulder boards, he had never been in command of any larger troop grouping than a couple of typists), and returned to the Defense Ministry to head the Administrative Directorate. People in the Defense Ministry recall that after Shaposhnikov's unruly democracy, Grachev's arrival here was greeted with enthusiasm. And at first, relying on comrades from Afghanistan, from Gromov and Mironov to the late Dubynin, he really was able to establish some kind of order and restore the practically lost command and control of both the troops and the apparatus. However, in time, some of his former friends distanced themselves from the minister, some were moved aside, and the posts of the closest advisers were occupied by other, more convenient people. That, according to one high-ranking Defense Ministry staffer, is Pavel Grachev's tragedy. ...The list of the defense minister's current entourage runs to more than one page. Reading the service records of the closest people, some people get exasperated and indignant, while others just laugh. However, in our opinion, it is more alarming that increasing numbers of professional servicemen, coming up against such cases, get fed up and leave the apparatus of the military department. The question "Whom are we serving?" is being asked behind the scenes increasingly frequently in the Defense Ministry and the General Staff. The technical elite -- the purchasing directorates of the Defense Ministry: the Defense Ministry Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate, the Main Armored Directorate, the GATU [expansion unknown], and the 12th Main Directorate, and the chemical troops... -- are being gradually left without work. The Army is being deprived of the most important thing -- military intellect, which, despite the not entirely groundless jokes of the man in the street, did nevertheless exist. What are we getting in return?
