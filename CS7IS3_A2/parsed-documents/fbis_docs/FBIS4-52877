The U.S. hardline conservative forces said if we do not comprehensively implement the safeguards accord, they would not exclude a possibility of taking military steps against us. Thus, they are attempting to ignite the fuse of a nuclear war. The U.S. military leaders, whenever they found an opportunity, made violent remarks that with a view to blocking North Korean nuclear arms development, they would be ready to make a venture even for starting a war, that the United States would advance along the road of applying pressure on North Korea, including taking sanctions, by getting rid of the diplomatic method, and that they would not exclude the possibility of a preemptive military attack on North Korea. Amid such violent remarks, the U.S. warmongers are attempting to work out a plot [kyechaegul kkumigo issumnida] to ignite a fire hazard for the northward war of aggression--the nuclear war--by frequently visiting South Korea. U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who flew to South Korea on 19 April, decided to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise--a nuclear war exercise--in November this year with the South Korean puppets, and to take joint military measures in order to block the North's so-called nuclear threat. This is a practical example of such an attempt by the U.S. warmongers. Today the U.S. armed forces are being constantly reinforced around the Korean peninsula. As has already been known, the United States brought numerous military equipment, including Patriot missiles--mass lethal weapons--together with several hundred troops, Stinger missiles, and ultramodern offensive helicopters, Apaches, into South Korea. Besides, the United States deployed many combat warships including carriers in the sea zones close to the Korean peninsula. In addition, the U.S. military authorities are pushing ahead with a new aggressive war plan to deploy the U.S. mainland-based 600,000 aggressive troops including two Marine Corps divisions, 200-odd warships, and 1,600-odd airplanes on the Korean peninsula within 80 days in an emergency. Moreover, the U.S. imperialist aggressors are staging northward aggressive aerial war exercises each day by mobilizing and deploying numerous overseas-based fighter planes and lethal weapons in South Korea. They are constantly committing aerial reconnaissance activities against the northern half of the Republic. This is indeed an alarming military move that can be seen only on the eve of war. By kicking off a row on the pretext of our nuclear issue, the U.S. imperialists reinforced armed forces on a large-scale, and are are straining the situation to an extreme pitch while staging various northward aggressive war exercises. This is intended to crush [apsal] our nation militarily and gain supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region. Prompted by such intentiions, the U.S. imperialists are trying to ignite the fuse of war on the Korean peninsula by all means. Because of the reckless U.S. policy of strong power, the dark clouds of nuclear war are, in actuality, rushing into the Korean peninsula, and the U.S. imperialists' military threat to the Asia-Pacific region is increasing furthermore. The prevailing situation demands that the people in the Asia-Pacific region resolutely smash the U.S. arms buildup maneuvers. The United States must squarely look at the trend of the time. It should act with discretion. Those who play with fire are doomed to be burned by the fire they ignited. The U.S. imperialists should not ignore the demand of our people and the world's progressive people aspiring to independence and peace. They must immediately stop arms buildup and new war provocation maneuvers. If the U.S. imperialists ignite the flames of nuclear war at last defying strong protests and denunciation by our people and peaceloving people of the world, the rascals will not be able to evade a bitter miserable defeat. The U.S. imperialists must be keenly aware of this, and must act with discretion.
