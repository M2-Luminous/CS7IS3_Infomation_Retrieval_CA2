In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rafael Huguet, former member of the Alpha 66 group, stressed that the theory of violence as the way to solve Cuban problems has been irreversibly defeated, thus confirming the opinion of a majority of the Cuban community living in the United States expressed during a recent poll. Those who defend the idea of war are desperate despite the control exerted on the Miami media and the hopes of those with extreme positions who want to protect their economic profits, Huguet said. Huguet also stressed the increase in support by U.S. congressmen who are demanding an end to the U.S. blockade of Cuba as the initial step toward improving bilateral relations. The former Alpha 66 member also believes the future of his country of origin is very positive and described that the current "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference as historical. The conference was convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry and more than 200 emigrants, from various countries throughout the continent [as received], are attending. Meanwhile, Luis Tornes, a man who participated in the foiled Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, admitted the failure of the use of weapons, which he himself used on occasion, and stressed the progress being made by those who support the normalization of ties between the emigrants and the homeland. Regarding the differences between Cuba and the United States, Tornes said Washington must realize that the island is not part of its territory. "We are a free, independent, and sovereign country," he added. Tornes strongly criticized the spokespersons for the most recalcitrant counterrevolutionary organizations in Miami, adding that they are trying to use a sort of "radio violence" against those who defend a just position regarding Cuba. With regard to the conference, Tornes concluded by saying: I have been working toward this for some time and now that it is being held, I am very optimistic and sure that everyone will be pleased with the results.
