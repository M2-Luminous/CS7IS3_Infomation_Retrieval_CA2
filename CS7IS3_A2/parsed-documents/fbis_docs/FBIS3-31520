That is what Prime Minister Lyuben Berov pointed out in a statement about the Bulgarian Government's stand on the NATO ultimatum related to attacks from the air against positions of the Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo. Let us hear part of the statement: [Begin Berov recording] Bulgaria regards the request to lift the arms embargo imposed by Resolution No. 715 of the UN Security Council of 1991 as an element of the military balance in the Balkans which has not been disrupted so far, as a matter of fact. The lifting of the embargo is not only likely to disrupt the balance, but would also cause an escalation and expansion of the conflict. The warning about air attacks according to the NATO Council ultimatum adopted on 9 February 1994 deserves particular attention. It confronts Bosnia-Herzegovina and presumably other Balkan countries with the menace of an escalation of the conflict accompanied by great material damages and the loss of human lives. Any external military interference whatsoever cannot be a solution for the Bosnian conflict as such, as long as the three sides involved in the conflict do not manifest sufficient good will for a peaceful solution. The interest of Bulgaria and of all Balkan states demands that they should contribute to such a solution.
