The Angolan Government believes an Angolan peace accord will be reached soon. [begin de Moura recording] We are hopeful that an agreement will soon be reached in Lusaka, which can then be signed to conclude the negotiations. A day will be chosen, we can call it D-day, to proclaim a cease-fire, not a unilateral cease-fire as the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has publicized and which has never existed, but an effective and overall cease- fire, that is, covering the whole country.
