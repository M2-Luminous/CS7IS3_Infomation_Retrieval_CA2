He Approves Struggle Against Gangsters"] [Text] Ivan Rybkin, who has just returned from Germany, has reproached Boris Yeltsin for his failure to submit a bill on additions and amendments to the Criminal Procedural Code to the State Duma before issuing the edict on the struggle against gangsters was issued. The lower chamber could have "adopted such a law within one day," the speaker emphasized, calling the presidential edict "necessary." In so doing, he cited the experience of other countries and politicians in setting similar precedents, including that of the United States and Franklin Roosevelt, who would probably have turned in his grave from surprise, had he heard Mr. Rybkin's arguments. It has become clear from the speaker's account of the State Duma mission's trip to Germany that it worked on matters of cooperation at three levels: European, interstate, and interparliamentary. At the meeting with Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth the two sides discussed cooperation within the Council of Europe and the CSCE. In particular, Mr. Rybkin pointed to the possibility that a conflict could have irreparable consequences because of the UN peacekeeping mechanism's unwieldiness, and spoke in favor of using the CSCE mandate in Europe's "hot spots." As for interstate relations, the main event of the year will be the withdrawal of Russian troops in August. Mr. Rybkin pointed out that this matter is very sensitive for Russian public opinion, adding, however, that when he met with German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe they managed to reach agreement on releasing the second part of the credit, sufficient to build 28,000 apartments for Russian servicemen returning to their home country. The State Duma speaker believes that the pullout of the Russian troops will be followed by an upswing in Russian-German cooperation, because both sides are going through similar processes of renewal. Strange as it might seem, Vladimir Lukin, chief of the Committee on International Affairs, was just as optimistic: In his view, a chill would not serve German interests. Thus both State Duma leaders echoed the opinion expressed by Helmut Kohl and Boris Yeltsin last May. Let us hope they are right.... Communication between the parliaments will from now on also be maintained at the level of their internal structures: An operational plan of cooperation has been drawn up and direct contacts between State Duma committees on defense, international affairs, and organizational matters with their Bundestag counterparts are envisioned.
