FR940620-0-00088 FR940620-0-00029 Response. The chart at ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(a) refers to the required number of single wheelchair spaces. ADAAG 4.33.2 (Size of Wheelchair Locations) references Figure 46 (Space Requirements for Wheelchair Seating Spaces in Series) which illustrates two wheelchair spaces and specifies the clear floor space required depending on whether a side, rear, or forward approach is provided. Figure 46 is only illustrative of wheelchair seating spaces in a series and does not require that all wheelchair locations provide two wheelchair spaces. No changes were made to this provision. Audible Announcements and Effective Communication for Persons With Hearing Impairments ADAAG 10.3.1(14) and 10.4.1(6) (Transit Facilities) require that when transportation facilities provide information through a public address system, equivalent information be provided to persons who are deaf or hearing impaired. In the NPRM, a similar requirement was considered for State and local government facilities which also provide audible announcements to the public. The NPRM sought information on what types of State and local government facilities typically provide audible announcements to the public and what alternative means are available for providing this information to persons who are deaf or hearing impaired. Information on the costs of audible systems and alternatives was also sought. Comment. Commenters indicated that a broad range of facilities such as public schools, welfare and motor vehicle departments, correctional and medical facilities, and convention centers often use audible announcements. Commenters from State and local governments indicated that the use of a system of audible announcements depends on the programs and services provided, the nature of the information, and the number of people served by the facility. Self Help for Hard of Hearing People (SHHH), which represents persons with hearing impairments, noted that in order to determine which announcement system best serves the public, the information being provided must be evaluated and the methods of communication selected accordingly. Another commenter indicated that it may be necessary to provide a number of methods to ensure effective communication. Some commenters suggested providing video monitors, electronic message boards, or tactile pagers as a means of providing equivalent information to persons with hearing impairments. Commenters suggested that if a provision requiring equivalent information is added to ADAAG, the requirement should be flexible enough to facilitate compliance with the Department of Justice regulations requiring effective communication and program access. Little cost data on audible announcement systems and other alternatives was received. Response. The comments suggested that the nature of the information provided in State and local government facilities differs from the information provided in transit facilities. In the view of commenters representing State and local governments, the information provided by the audible announcements in State and local government facilities varies depending on the programs and services provided and may be primarily directed to the employees, not to the public. On the other hand, the information provided through the public address system in transit facilities is integral to the use of the transit system. Audible announcements in transit facilities provide critical information on arrivals, departures, boarding, destinations, and delays or cancellations. Although commenters recommended various methods for providing equivalent information to persons with hearing impairments when audible announcements are used, there was no consensus as to the most effective means of providing such information to the public. Therefore, no ADAAG provision has been included. The Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA, however, does require State and local government entities to ensure that communications with applicants, participants, and members of the public with disabilities are as effective as communications with others, unless the public entity can demonstrate that action would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. See 28 CFR 35.160(a) and 35.164. Assistive Listening Systems ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b) requires permanently installed assistive listening systems to be provided where audible communications are integral to the use of an assembly area, if the assembly area accommodates at least 50 people or has an audio-amplification system, and has fixed seating. ADAAG 11.9 requires that permanently installed assistive listening systems be provided in certain rooms in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities, regardless of the number of persons accommodated or whether there is an amplification system and fixed seating is provided. The NPRM asked whether there are additional types of State and local government facilities where requirements for permanently installed assistive listening systems should be based on the type of room rather than the criteria in ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b). Comment. Commenters responded that assistive listening systems should be provided in educational facilities, large public waiting rooms, job-applicant testing and professional-licensing testing facilities, gymnasiums and emergency shelters. Many other commenters recommended that assistive listening systems be provided in all facilities available to the general public for meetings, hearings and other facilities available for public use. In addition, a few commenters requested that ADAAG 11.9(2) be clarified so that rooms used for public policy hearings are considered legislative or regulatory facilities. A number of commenters stated that the criteria of ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b) should be applied and that no additional requirements for assistive listening systems are necessary. However, other commenters recommended a change to ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b) so that assistive listening systems are provided in rooms without fixed seating. Many commenters recommended that portable devices be permitted to allow for more flexibility, less cost and retrofitting. No supporting documentation on portable systems or cost information was provided. Response. Certain rooms and spaces recommended by commenters such as job applicant testing sites and gymnasiums are already required to provide assistive listening systems if they meet the criteria in ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b). As commenters pointed out, facilities that do not have fixed seating do not meet these criteria. However, those facilities listed in ADAAG 11.9 are required to provide permanently installed assistive listening systems even if they do not have fixed seating. Some of those areas recommended by commenters in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities are addressed in ADAAG 11.9. For example, one of each type of hearing room is required to be equipped with an assistive listening system. Rooms in other types of facilities are not required to provide assistive listening systems based on the occupancy or type of room. However, all State and local government entities are subject to the Department of Justice's title II regulations requiring that programs and services provide effective communications, including auxiliary aids unless it can be demonstrated that such action would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. See 28 CFR 35.160(a) and 28 CFR 35.164. To facilitate the use of portable systems, ADAAG 11.8 requires electrical outlets, wiring, and conduit for communications systems in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities. No changes were made to ADAAG 4.1.3(19)(b). Comment. The NPRM asked questions regarding areas or spaces in State or local government facilities which require protection from electronic eavesdropping. The NPRM also sought technical options for solving security-related problems and asked whether one type of system is more secure than another. Commenters were requested to provide cost information for providing a secure assistive listening system. Finally, the NPRM asked whether any areas should be exempt from the requirement of an assistive listening system due to risks associated with electronic eavesdropping.
