Mr Major was speaking at Commons question time after Andrew Robathan, Conservative MP for Blaby, said there was "very real concern" at the continuing reduction in Britain's defence capability. A Whitehall leak earlier this week suggested the jobs of more than 20,000 servicemen were at risk under the Front Line First study, which aims to cut the defence budget by 2.3 billion pounds over the next three years. Mr Major declared: "The Front Line First programme will do nothing to reduce the fighting effectiveness of our armed forces and our ability to undertake defence commitments." He told Mr Robathan: "I can reassure you that our commitment to effective front line forces remains undiminished. The Front Line First study is designed to make sure that money spent on defence administration and support is kept to a minimum. That is a sensible aim." Mr Robathan told the prime minister: "There is very real concern around the country about the continuing reduction in our defence capability, as illustrated yesterday by the leak about the defence costs study." To loud Tory cheers, he asked: "Can you reassure your friends on this side of the House that you will never allow the growth of expenditure on social security to undermine our national security?" Tory Cyril Townsend, MP for Bexleyheath, told Mr Major that since earlier defence cuts were prepared, the "world has become more turbulent and less certain." Calling for the current study to be reviewed, Mr Townsend said the French, who had roughly similar international defence commitments, had recently agreed to increase their defence budget. The prime minister said of the French: "In cash, they spend broadly the same as we do, although they have a conscript army in France as compared to the professional army we have in the UK." He went on: "Through the Front Line First defence costs study we aim to maximise the proportion of defence resources allocated to the front line. I believe that is the right way to determine our defence expenditure -- unlike Labour who scream `cuts' but would halve defence expenditure and,... if they had the opportunity, might also scrap our nuclear capacity."
