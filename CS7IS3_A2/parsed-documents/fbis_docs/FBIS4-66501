Abderrahmane: "Does the FIS Still Count in the Field?"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] [Text] The threats contained in the latest communique from the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] and directed at Hamas [Islamic Society Movement] and Nahdah are more than eloquent. After accusing them of being either hypocrites or "mukhabarat," the spokesman in Bonn promises a violent death for their leaders as well as any leaders of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] who might have the poor judgment to hold discussions with the government. Are those threats the reason why the FIS has not lived up to the terms of its deal with the government? The communique dated from Bonn accuses Nahnah's party of being in fact a tool of the regime because delegations consisting of Hamas cadres held press conferences in Europe and the Middle East regarding the situation in Algeria to deny the existence of any holy war and say that those claiming to be war veterans were simpleminded. According to the GIA, those trips were sponsored in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a circumstance that does not enhance Nahnah's image among the armed groups already accusing him of collaboration with the "junta" because he showed too much zeal for the dialogue initiated by the CDN [National Dialogue Commission]. So following the contract that Said Makhloufi put out on Abdallah Djaballah, the armed groups have now issued a new sentence, this one against an Islamist leader because of his receptiveness to a political solution. The communique reiterates rejection of all dialogue with the government by denouncing any member of the FIS "Majlis Echoura" [advisory council] who takes part in such an initiative. Is that the real reason for the failure of the arrangement between Zeroual and the imprisoned Islamist leaders? According to the office of the president, Abassi and Benhadj delegated Djeddi and Boukhamkham to talk to the group leaders and achieve a cease-fire, that being the main condition for holding new elections as soon as possible. One month after the release of those two members of the "Majlis Echoura," there has been no tangible result to encourage supporters of that initiative. Even worse, Boukhamkham is said to have delivered certain inflammatory sermons encouraging armed action and supporting certain group leaders whose barbarity has seriously eroded convictions among the rank and file. There are two possible explanations for the lack of desire on the part of the FIS leaders to keep their promise. The first has to do with what the "boarders" at Blida Prison really want. Do they want calm to be restored as long as they are in prison? The content of the letter sent by Ali Benhadj to Chebouti, in which he promised to place himself at the latter's disposal upon being released from prison--a letter that got his lawyer Touati a three-year prison term for smuggling it out--stuns those who think there is a difference between the FIS' politicians and its armed branch, whether that be the MIA [Armed Islamic Movement], the HDI [Haraket addawla al islamiya], or even the GIA. That multiplication of acronyms, which serves only to appease leadership ambitions and conceal sometimes bloody internal struggles and squabbling among cliques, must not make us lose sight of the fact that the methods, strategy, and objectives are the same. Rejection of any idea of dialogue with the government, rejection of any possible truce before the pure and simple abdication of all those governing today, and trials for everyone who participated in one way or another in interrupting the electoral process are constants in every communication from the armed groups, whether over the illegal radio station Wafa, in the publications they issue in Europe thanks to their intermediaries there, or the posters they put up on the walls of mosques. What is the reason for the promise made to Zeroual to halt terrorist acts--a promise implying tacit agreement to participate in dialogue? Does it mean that the minister of defense possesses a sufficiently persuasive gift of gab to make Abassi and Benhadj go back on their word somewhere? The reasons for all this might be found in the things that have been successively left unsaid. Beginning with the CDN, which had managed to convince everyone that the FIS would participate through Hachani, for just a few hours, in the opening session of the national conference, thus spicing up a meeting that was promising to be dull. And also the office of the president, which first contradicts remarks made by the party leaders and then confirms them in a statement by its spokesman. There is no assurance that the story of the meeting between Zeroual and the shaykhs will someday be written. The second explanation for what the office of the president discreetly calls "nonimplementation of the promises made to date" may be that the FIS leaders are in fact incapable of controlling armed groups that deny them any authority over young and bloodthirsty amirs who suffer no doubts. However, there is still that murderous sound bite by Abassi in his heyday, when he told the crowds astounded by laser technology that: "I will turn my men loose on your tanks, and they will eat them!" His statement showed that he already had troops prepared for any eventuality and able to go from civil disobedience to armed insurrection and that that army was simply waiting for word from him--in other words, that he had sufficient influence over the "Afghans" and the people he had sent to join the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah in the Bekaa Valley--and, last, that Chebouti was being exhibited at political rallies by the FIS president as a postmortem surety for armed Islamism in Algeria as incarnated by the Bouyali symbol. All those factors tend to prove that Abassi and Benhadj have influence over the armed groups, but there is a discrepancy between what someone like Makhloufi or Redjam says and the promise by the FIS leaders as announced by Bensalah during the national conference and confirmed a few days later by Mihoubi in the statement by the office of the president. Does this indicate a tactical division of labor between Islamist politicians and the Islamist military or--as is more likely--an undeclared challenge to the authority of the shaykhs? Beyond all those questions about whether Abassi and Benhadj are capable of halting the terrorist acts, there is another question that is of the greatest interest to observers: what are they going to be offered in return?
