Yesterday you again described the possible NATO air strikes over Bosnia as unfair in human terms. However, in fact, it should be an action to help end fighting by forceful action. Can you clarify what you meant by this: unfair in human terms? [Klaus] I said this in an open conversation on Thursday [10 February] and yesterday. I have not repeated it. [passage omitted] Let us leave behind this hyperbole. Of course, it poses the question first of all whether it is possible to reach some sort of stable solution only by military, or, to be more precise, by air attacks. We hold a certain opinion on this that is [word indistinct] at variance with the rest of the world. I think that today and everyday we repeatedly hear the opinions of politicians on one hand, and the views of military experts on the other, [the latter] saying that these air strikes could not be a lasting solution, [and] that after [air strikes], the army would have to move in. I admit that I believe in the analyses of military experts; they seem to me to be quite realistic. [passage omitted] [Weissova] Prime minister, you called upon the Slovak Prime Minister Meciar yesterday [14 Feb] asking that the Slovak side withdraw measures complicating the import of the Czech foodstuffs. At the same time, you said that it would be foolish if we answered in a similar way and that the Czech side would not consider this. What are the Czech Government's intentions if Slovakia does not withdraw these obstacles? [Klaus] When playing chess, I do not disclose my intentions after the first move. I am not going to tell you in advance what will be my second, third, fourth, and so on moves, as the other side can take various countermeasures. Please do not ask me for a ready-made script of our steps. We have to work on it alone and be prepared to implement it. If we demand a halt to any protectionism from the West as well as from the East, it is not wise to treat our neighbors in this way. Therefore, it seems to me that a one-sided action, same in kind--according to [words indistinct] tooth for tooth--is neither imaginative nor very wise. So let us keep the alternatives. I would be very glad if the Slovak Government assessed our proposal in order to make it possible for this measure (?to be discussed) by the first meeting of the customs union, at which certain concrete rules of these relations are to be established. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything wiser to better. [passage omitted]
