The statement demanded that the Japanese Government rectify the external policy, with which it, following the U.S. Korea policy, has been hostile to the DPRK and joined in freezing the division of the Korean peninsula. For Japan to normalize diplomatic relations with the DPRK is to put an end to the past hostile relations and make a true international contribution, the statement said, and stressed: The Japanese Government should normalize Japan-Korea diplomatic relations, not clamouring for "sanctions" against the DPRK. The statement urged the Japanese Government to respect the spirit of the joint declaration published by the Liberal Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party of Japan and the Workers' Party of Korea on September 28, 1990, and propel negotiations for the normalization of Japan-Korea diplomatic relations in this spirit. "The members of the National Interchange Society of Listeners to Radio Pyongyang will conduct a more energetic movement to realize negotiations for the normalization of Japan-Korea diplomatic relations," it declared.
