Sao Paulo businessman Marcio Goldfarb, who is a retailer and who deals in ready-made clothes, gave this signal of alert. He said manufacturers hiked compact disk prices by 90 percent in January. To replace products as they are sold, supermarkets are paying 50 percent more for them and contracts are being written with safeguard clauses. Exporters seek to move up the dates for closing exchange contracts and thus have less dollars in cash when the day to convert them comes. Pouring his heart out, Ivan Botelho, president of the Cataguazes-Leopoldina Group, said: "There is an atmosphere of unpatriotic speculation." The inflation rate calculated on basis of the IGP-DI [General Prices Index-Domestic Availability] totalled 42.19 percent in January. This is the highest since March 1990. The IPCA [Expanded Consumer Price Index] rose to 41.31 percent and the INPC [National Consumer Price Index] to 41.32 percent. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has asserted that he will not subordinate the economic calendar to the political one.
