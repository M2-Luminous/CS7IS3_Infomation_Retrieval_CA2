FBIS3-42572 "jpusr008___94016" FBIS-USR-94-008 Document Type:JPRS Document Title: FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 2 February 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 1992, 1993 Export, Import Figures Compared 944Q0127A Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 30 Dec 93 p 11 944Q0127A Moscow SEGODNYA Language: Russian Article Type:CSO [Economic report by the Center for Economic and Business Conditions of the Russian Federation Government: "On the Commodity Structure of Exports and Imports"] [Text] The Center for Economic and Business Conditions of the Council of Ministers--Government of the Russian Federation has used official reporting data from state statistics organs to conduct an analysis of the dynamics of the physical and cost indices of exports and imports of the most important commodities in Russia's foreign trade turnover with the states of the far abroad for the period January-October 1993. It follows from the analysis conducted that in comparison with the period January-October 1992: --exports, amounting to $31.4 billion, were maintained on the level of the same period of 1992, this basically due to the influence of extensive factors; --an increase in export production was observed in: --ferrous metallurgy--by $1.34 billion; --timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry--by $0.37 billion; --fresh and frozen fish--by $0.2 billion; --a reduction took place at the same time in the export production of: --the fuel and energy complex--by $0.7 billion; --uncut diamonds--by $0.66 billion; --machine building--by $0.47 billion; --chemicals and petrochemicals--by $0.16 billion; --nonferrous metallurgy--by $0.16 billion; --imports, amounting to $15.5 billion, decreased by almost 46 percent, 3 percent more than for January-September 1993; --in absolute terms, the reduction in imports came to $13.2 billion; --proportion of the total reduction in imports attributable to specific commodity groups: --machinery and equipment--45.4 percent; --foodstuffs--28.1 percent; --nonfood consumer products--10.2 percent; --medicines--5.1 percent; --other products--11.2 percent. EXPORTS Production in the Fuel and Energy Complex A weak but steady trend toward diminished percentages of commodities representing fuel and energy production output was observed in 1993. Thus, in January-August of 1993, this index amounted to 53.2 percent; in January-September it was 52.7 percent; and in January-October it was 52 percent, approximately 2 percent lower than the levels seen for the same period of 1992. Aggregate deliveries of fuel and energy complex output in physical terms (taking into account gas converted to standard tonnes) increased by 23 percent in January-October 1993 as compared with the same period of 1992, at the same time that hard currency proceeds decreased by 4.1 percent. The total reduction in export production output in the fuel and energy complex from the level of January-October 1992 amounted to $695 million. Oil shipments in January-October 1993 increased 30 percent over the level of the same period of 1992. The contract price for oil over this period was established at the level of $105.10 per tonne, 18.9 percent lower than the January-October 1992 price. The rate of decrease of contract prices for oil in 1993 correspond to the price decrease rates on the world market. In spite of the increased volumes of oil shipments due to the drop in contract prices, hard currency proceeds increased by just 5.8 percent. The rate of increase in deliveries of oil products (in physical terms) continues to grow. In January-August 1993, as compared with the same period of 1992, this rate comprised 36.8 percent, in January-September it was 40.7 percent, and in January-October--45.2 percent. While the average weighted contract price in January-October 1993 amounted to just $95.70 per tonne, having decreased by 42.4 percent from the level of the same period in 1992. As compared with the contract price level for January-September 1993, the January-October price was reduced by another $7.50. In this manner, the average weighted cost of a tonne of oil products in 1993 was almost $10 lower than the cost of a tonne of crude oil. The price ratio for these products in 1992 was contradictory in nature: In January-October, the price of a tonne of oil was fixed at the level of $129, while the price of a tonne of oil products came to $166.30. The emergence in 1993 of the situation outlined here is related primarily to a significant change in the structure of oil product shipments due to increased exports of the less expensive products in this group, in particular--fuel oil. This process is showing a trend toward more active development in 1993. Changes in the Coefficient Indicating Ratio of the Average Weighted Price of One Tonne of Oil Products to the Price of Oil Year January-March January-June January-September January-October 1992 1.22 1.26 1.29 1.29 1993 1.14 1.04 0.96 0.91 In January-October 1993, shipments of natural gas increased over the January-October 1992 level by 2.7 percent. However, hard currency proceeds over this period decreased by $411 million (6.7 percent). This can be explained by the average drop of 9 percent over this period in the contract price. The physical volume of coal shipments in January-October 1993 increased by 11.6 percent over the same period of last year. The rate of increase of the export of coal is gradually diminishing--in January-August 1993 this was 19.6 percent; in January-September it was 14.2 percent. Ferrous Metallurgy Output In January-October 1993, the share of total production output export volume attributable to ferrous metallurgy was 8.8 percent, as opposed to 4.5 percent in January-October of 1992. The main increase in hard currency proceeds from the export of commodities representative of this sector is directly attributable to the ferrous metals group (rolled metal, steel), which provided for 98 percent, or $1.3 billion, of the increase in sector exports. In cost terms, the export of rolled metals and steels in January-October 1993 increased by a factor of 2.3 over the January-October 1992 level, amounting to $2.3 billion. The rate of growth of cast iron exports in physical terms over January-October 1993 was 29 percent greater than the January-October 1992 level, while the contract price over this period decreased by 27 percent. As a result, hard currency proceeds were reduced by $10.4 million. The rate of reduction of hard currency proceeds from the export of ores and concentrates--amounting in January-October 1993 to a 16 percent drop from the level of January-October 1992--is slightly outpacing the rate of reduction of their shipment volumes--13.2 percent. Nonferrous Metallurgy Production Output The share of nonferrous metallurgy output commodities (aluminum, nickel, copper) of the total export volume in January-October 1993 amounted to 4.8 percent, or $1.5 billion, as opposed to 5.3 percent in January-October of 1992. The same indices for January-September 1993 were at the level of 3.2 percent, or $0.9 billion. The significant increase in export volumes for October 1993 (of $0.6 billion) is related primarily to insufficiently exhaustive statistical information for the previous months, especially with respect to the export of copper and nickel. The share of nonferrous metals exported in January-October 1993 attributable to aluminum increased to 63.5 percent, as opposed to 56.4 percent in January-October of 1992. In physical terms, the volume of aluminum exported increased by 50.6 percent. However, the growth of hard currency proceeds from the export of aluminum in January-October 1993 was just 2 percent greater than the January-October 1992 level--caused by the sharp drop (32.4 percent) in average contract price. Preliminary estimates indicate that aluminum exports amounted to about 172,000 tonnes in October, while more precise data for September show a level for that month of 125,000 tonnes. Rate of Change of Physical Volumes and Contract Prices in the Export of Aluminum, Calculated With Respect to January-March Indices Year January-March January-June January-September January-October Compared With January-September Shipment Volume 1992 1.0 2.13 3.43 1.12 1993 1.0 3.06 5.42 1.24 Contract Price 1992 1.0 1.04 1.12 1.04 1993 1.0 0.94 0.93 0.99 In January-October 1993, the export of nickel in physical volume terms decreased by 27.5 percent from the January-October 1992 level, while the contract price dropped by 10.4 percent. The export of copper in physical terms in January-October 1993 was reduced 12.6 percent from the January-October 1992 level, while the contract price increased by 19.2 percent. Uncut Diamonds The share of total export volume attributable to uncut diamonds in January-October 1993 dropped to 1.5 percent, as opposed to 3.6 percent in January-October of 1992. This is the result of a 59 percent reduction in shipment volumes and a 27 percent reduction in contract prices. Chemical and Petrochemical Production Output The share of total export volume attributable to chemicals and petrochemicals in January-October 1993 amounted to 3.3 percent, as opposed to 3.8 percent in January-October of 1992. The structure of export of representative commodities of this sector in January-October 1993 changed somewhat compared to the same period of 1992: --the proportion of fertilizers of all varieties decreased from 75 to 66 percent; --the share of ammonia exports increased from 12 to 18 percent; --the share of synthetic rubber exports increased from 8 to 10 percent. The aggregate export in physical volume of fertilizers of all varieties decreased by 16.2 percent in January-October 1993, as compared with the same period of 1992, while hard currency proceeds decreased by 23.2 percent. Significant changes are being observed in the export structure for fertilizers. The export in physical terms of nitrogen and potash fertilizers decreased by 37.1 and 30.4 percent, respectively, while the export of compound and phosphoric fertilizers increased by 98.6 and 10.7 percent. Contract prices dropped from 1992 levels for all varieties of fertilizers, except nitrogen fertilizers. Timber, Woodworking, and Pulp and Paper Production The rate of increase (in physical terms) of shipments of sector commodities under observation in January-October 1993 slowed down somewhat as compared with January-September of 1993, amounting to: --52.3 percent for unprocessed timber shipments, as opposed to 73.2 percent; --43.5 percent for plywood shipments, as opposed to 103.1 percent; --113.7 percent for pulp shipments, as opposed to 137.6 percent. The trend toward increased deliveries which was characteristic of previous months continued only with respect to newsprint--240.4 percent, as opposed to 219.9 percent. In addition, the gap between 1993 and 1992 contract prices narrowed somewhat, as 1993 contract prices tended to converge gradually upon the 1992 level. Thus, whereas in January-September of 1993 prices for unprocessed timber amounted to 81 percent of the level for the same period of 1992, this ratio for the January-October period came to 98 percent. With respect to plywood, the figures were 57 and 65 percent, respectively, and for pulp--60 and 64 percent, respectively. Machine-Building Output The share of total export production volume attributable to machine building in January-October 1993 decreased by 7.3 percent, as compared to 8.7 percent for the same period of last year. Recent months show a continued augmentation of the drop in machinery and equipment shipments as compared with last year. In January-October 1993, the decrease reached the level of $473 million, as opposed to $394 million in January-September. At the same time that export volumes of civil-sector machine building have been decreasing in 1993, certain changes in its commodity structure are also being observed. However, means of ground transportation (excluding railroad transport) continue to occupy the leading position--with 47.7 percent of the total export volume of this sector, along with technological equipment (excluding electrical equipment)--38.8 percent. In this regard, the share of total shipments attributable to these equipment varieties increased by 1.5 and 4.2 percent, respectively, as compared with 1992 levels. It is significant that the share of export of aircraft decreased by 2.2 percent. The only product group in the machine-building sector that showed a slight increase in the share of production over the period in question was shipbuilding. In addition, hard currency proceeds increased by $4.5 million as compared with January-October 1992. For the remaining production groups in the machine-building sector, a drop in share was observed, ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 percent. These include optical instruments and devices, electrical machinery and equipment, railroad equipment and rolling stock. In assessing the influence of various types of production output on diminished export volumes in the sector, we note that $185.8 million (39.2 percent) of the reduction took place due to reduced exports of means of ground transportation, $102 million (21.5 percent)--due to aircraft, and $69.3 million (14.6 percent)--to technological equipment and machinery (excluding electrical). The share of reduction in hard currency proceeds with respect to the remaining varieties of machine-building output fluctuates within the 6-10 percent range. Fish and Fish Products The share of shipments of fish and fish products in January-October 1993 came to 1.7 percent, as opposed to 1.1 percent for the same period of last year. The shipment increase in physical volume terms amounted to 33.1 percent. The total increase in hard currency proceeds over this period reached $197 million, contributing factors here including a growth in contract prices--amounting to 57.6 percent in January-October 1993. IMPORTS Ferrous Metallurgy Production Output The share of imported representative products of the ferrous metallurgy sector increased significantly in January-October 1993, amounting to 3.5 percent, as opposed to 2.0 percent in January-October of 1992. Despite the overall decrease of 45.9 percent in import purchases in general seen in January-October 1993 as compared with the same period of 1992, import volumes of ferrous metallurgy production remained virtually at last year's level. Purchases of production output in this sector amounted to $541 million, as opposed to $560 million in January-October of 1992. The reduction in expenditures for imports came to just $19.3 million. It must be noted that the structure of imported production in this sector also changed in January-October 1993 as compared with the same period of 1992. Thus, the percentage of sector import volume attributable to pipe increased from 54.3 to 76.3 percent, while the share attributable to ferrous metal imports (rolled metal, steel), on the contrary, decreased, amounting to 23.7 percent as opposed to 45.7 percent in January-October 1992. Machine-Building Production The import of machinery, equipment, and means of transportation in January-October 1993 was virtually halved, amounting to $5.2 billion as opposed to $11.2 billion in January-October of 1992. The rate of decrease in the import of machine-building production is rising. Thus, in January-October 1993 machine-building output amounted to 53.2 percent of import production--4 percent lower than was the case for January-September 1993. We note that the share of rolling stock purchases was reduced from 8.3 to 5.1 percent, and of electrical machinery and equipment--from 20.1 to 14.8 percent, while the share of purchases of all types of ships increased from 1.2 percent to 5.4 percent, and that of ground transportation means--from 11.9 to 13.3 percent. Foodstuffs Food product purchases continue to diminish. Their share of the total volume of imports decreased from 21.5 percent in January-October 1992 to 15.8 percent in January-October 1993. In cost terms, food product purchases were reduced from $6.2 billion to $2.5 billion. The rate of decline of food purchases--reaching 60 percent--is significantly outpacing the rate of decline of imports on the whole (45.9 percent). Food products totaling just $110.7 million were purchased in October--this comprises just 5 percent of the import volume increase for October 1993. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Structure of Food Product Purchases, Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Item |January-October 1992 |January-October 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grain |60.5 |52.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Raw sugar, white sugar |16.3 |29.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Poultry |6.6 |4.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flour |4.1 |0.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Macaroni products |4.0 |2.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vegetable oil |3.5 |1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Milk and cream, butter a-|2.0 |2.7 | |nd other fats | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tea and coffee |1.9 |5.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Citrus fruits and apples |0.8 |1.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is evident that the change in state policy in the sphere of centralized import purchases has exerted a significant influence on the dynamics of the structural indices of food product imports. Medicines The share of import purchases attributable to nonfood consumer products in January-October 1993 amounted to about 7.6 percent, as opposed to 8.8 percent for January-October 1992. The rate of decline in the import of a number of commodity groups is significantly outpacing the overall rate of decline of imports (45.9 percent), constituting: --79.6 percent, for synthetic fabrics; --74.2 percent, for footwear; --70.3 percent, for cotton fabrics; --62.4 percent, for leather clothing; --59.8 percent, for knitted articles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Structure of Nonfood Product Purchases, Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Item |January-October 1992 |January-October 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Clothing |64.0 |79.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |textiles |28.4 |46.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |knitted articles |21.3 |18.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |leather items |11.3 |9.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |fur apparel |3.0 |5.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Footwear |26.4 |14.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fabric, all varieties |9.5 |5.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Insofar as these commodities are being imported mainly through the funds of commercial structures and enterprises, the factor of effective demand exerts a decisive influence on changes in their structure.
