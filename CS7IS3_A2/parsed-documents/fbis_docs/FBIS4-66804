FBIS4-66804 "jpnea027___94045" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 19 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Rajendra Singh New Head of RSS Rajendra Singh New Head of RSS Press Conference 94AS0276B Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE in English 19 Mar 94 p 9 94AS0276B Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE English CSO [Text] New Delhi, March 18--The newly-appointed Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Prof Rajendra Singh, on Friday described the Supreme Court judgment regarding invocation of Article 356 of the Constitution to dismiss State governments as "controversial" which needed interpretation and elaboration by legal experts. Addressing his first press conference after his elevation to the top post in the RSS, Prof Singh, who is popularly known as Rajju Bhayya, said his personal feeling was that the apex court had not appreciated the depth of the issue. Article 356 had been a part of the Constitution from the very beginning, whereas the word "secularism" was introduced in the mid-70s during the Emergency. The judgment appeared to place undue emphasis on this later entrant into the Constitution. It was foolish for anyone even to suggest that the majority community needs to be educated about secularism, it being an integral part of the Indian heritage, he said. Dwelling on the concept of "Hindutva" as espoused by the Sangh Parivar, Prof Singh said he welcomed the ongoing debate on the subject. For him the word signified the entire spiritual and cultural background of the country. It had nothing to do with anyone's personal faith, but the general loyalty to the nation. Unfortunately, there was a leadership in this country which did not allow this to be appreciated by a section of the people, he said. Reiterating his organisation's commitment to persist with the Ayodhya movement, the RSS chief said construction of a temple at Ayodhya would be the first priority even as it considered the liberation of temples at Mathura and Varanasi as important. Prof Singh, who maintained that the various wings of the Sangh Parivar were totally independent of each other, nonetheless willingly answered questions on various Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. He defended the BJP president, Mr L.K. Advani's remarks abroad supporting the government's economic policies. Criticism as an Opposition party did not mean that one runs down his own country's government in foreign countries. At the same time, it was not far off the mark that the BJP did welcome some aspects of the ongoing liberalisation process. It supported the simplification of procedures internally but not the unhindered entry of multinationals into the country. Definitely not for potato chips and coke, he said. Mr A.B. Vajpayee had been sent by the government for the human rights meet at Geneva because of his vast experience and knowledge of foreign affairs and also because of his personal contacts with leaders of different countries. His efforts to ensure that the national prestige was held high at the international forum did not mean that the BJP was joining hands with the Congress, Prof Singh stated. Reacting to the reverses the BJP suffered in last year's Assembly elections, Prof Singh said the results were not as bad as was being made out. Secondly, there was an element of chance in elections and a political party which loses one election comes back to power in the next. Another factor he identified was the ban on the RSS which had made it difficult for its volunteers to work for the party.
