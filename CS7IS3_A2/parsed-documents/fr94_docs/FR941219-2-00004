FR941219-2-00004 FR941219-2-00002 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;583&hyph;810] Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts From Taiwan; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Partial Termination AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Partial Termination. SUMMARY: In response to a request by a petitioner and a respondent, the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The review covers seven firms and the period September 1, 1992, through August 31, 1993. The review indicates the existence of margins for the firms. As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between United States price and foreign market value. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Todd Peterson or Thomas Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4195 or 482&hyph;3814, respectively. Background On September 20, 1991, the Department published the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47116). The petitioner, Consolidated International Automotive, Inc. (Consolidated), and a respondent, Gourmet Equipment (Taiwan) Corporation (Gourmet), requested that we conduct an administrative review for the period September 1, 1992, through August 31, 1993. We published a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53710), for the following firms: Buxton International, Gourmet, Chu Fong Metallic Industrial Corporation (Chu Fong), San Chien Electric Industrial Works, Ltd. (San Chien), Everspring Plastic Corp. (Everspring), Kuang Hong Industries Co., Ltd. (Kuang), and Transcend International Co. (Transcend). Questionnaires were sent to Buxton, Everspring, Kuang, Transcend, Gourmet, Chu Fong, and San Chien. Everspring responded that it has never sold the subject merchandise. Only Gourmet and Buxton responded to the questionnaire. The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review The merchandise covered by this review is one-piece and two-piece chrome-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished, which are more than 11/16 inches (17.45 millimeters) in height and which have a hexagonal (hex) size of at least 3/4 inches (19.05 millimeters). The term ``unfinished'' refers to unplated and/or unassembled chrome-plated lug nuts. The subject merchandise is used for securing wheels to cars, vans, trucks, utility vehicles, and trailers. Zinc-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished, and stainless-steel capped lug nuts are not in the scope of this review. Chrome-plated lock nuts are also not in the scope of this review. During the period of review (POR), chrome-plated lug nuts were provided for under subheading 7318.16.00.10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this review is dispositive. Use of Best Information Available (BIA) In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take into account whether a party refuses to provide requested information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). Thus, the Department determines, on a case-by-case basis, what constitutes BIA. For the purposes of these preliminary results, we applied the following two-tier BIA analysis where we were unable to use a company's response for purposes of determining a dumping margin ( see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative review of Antifriction Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, et al., 58 FR 39739, July 26, 1993): 1. When a company refuses to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impedes these proceedings, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin in the less than fair value investigation (LTFV) or prior administrative reviews; or (2) the highest rate found in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin.
