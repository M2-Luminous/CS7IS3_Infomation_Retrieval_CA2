Since then the situation has become even more threatening: There have been several fires, trains have been halted for a long time, and it has become impossible to get to certain stations at rush hour. Despairing metro officials sent this letter to B. Yeltsin, in which they urge the government to take immediate action to help save the Moscow metro. Dear Boris Nikolayevich! For four years now, with the active assistance of the Moscow government, our labor collectives have been fighting for the right to build and operate the metro in a normal fashion. This struggle stems from the need to resolve the matter of obtaining stable financing for capital investments for the development, rebuilding and modernization of the metro. Every time we have to try to prove that financing the metro's development is not simply a concern of the city itself, but also of the Moscow region and the Russian capital, in that the metro is a key CIS transport and passenger-service hub that carries up to 9 million passengers each day. For more than 63 years, all outlays for the metro's development have been borne by the state in the form of planned central capital investments, since the city alone cannot afford this. Construction of the metro never ceased even during the grimmest war years, when the German fascists were just 30 kilometers from Moscow. And now, despite the instructions of the Russian government, the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics is again failing to provide the required capital investment ceilings for the metro's development in 1994, without which the Russian Ministry of Finance cannot transfer funds to the metro. Nor is the problem of indexing capital investments to the sharply rising inflation rate being solved in a timely fashion. The transfer of funds by the Russian Ministry of Finance is often delayed and extremely irregular. The failure to resolve the issue of allocating funds to repay indebtedness on credits in 1993 has put the metro in an exceptionally grave financial situation. As of January 20 1994, the metro owed 33 billion rubles for work performed by contracting and design organizations and for trains and equipment installed by supplier plants. The financial operations of construction, design, and machinery-building organizations for which the metro is the sole client (the Moscow Metro Construction State Joint-Stock Company, the Moscow Metro Reconstruction firm, several joint ventures in which the Transportation Engineering Construction firm is a partner, the State Metro Transport Design Institute, the Moscow Metro Design Institute, train-building plants in Mytishchi and St. Petersburg, the Escalator Plant in St. Petersburg, and other organizations) have been essentially paralyzed. The Mytishchi and St. Petersburg machinery plants have halted work to modernize train cars' fire-safety systems. Contracting organizations have also stopped replacing escalators, fire alarms, and other equipment. All these things are jeopardizing passenger safety. Work to develop the metro has essentially come to stop, raising the question of halting the city's social development. A volatile, prestrike atmosphere has arisen in the labor collectives of the Moscow Metro Construction State Joint-Stock Company and in other organizations. The halt to financing of the metro's development is already leading to the collapse of unique construction and design organizations involved in building the metro and of the electric train and escalator plants in St. Petersburg and Mytishchi, which are the only plants of their kind not just in Russia but also in the CIS as a whole and whose sole customer is the Moscow metro. Under these circumstances, it is hard to assess the socioeconomic consequences of the step taken by Russian Ministry of Economics for the city and the entire Moscow region. In view of the inadmissibility of an interruption in the construction, operation, and modernization of the metro, its exceptional social importance for the city and the Moscow region, and the lack of any alternative solution to the very difficult transportation problem in the city, the 40,000-strong labor collective of the Moscow metro and the Metro Construction State Joint-Stock Company asks you, Boris Nikolayevich to urgently instruct: - the Russian Ministry of Economics to notify the Russian Ministry of Finance of a capital investment ceiling of 635 million rubles in 1991 prices, which, according to the metro's calculations, amounts to 1,400 billion rubles in 1994 prices; - the Russian Ministry of Finance to resolve, in January 1994, the matter of transferring 33 billion rubles to the metro to repay indebtedness on credits and, in approving the federal budget, to provide in the first quarter of 1994 for the financing of capital investments to develop the metro in the amount of 350 billion rubles, with a view to repaying 1993 indebtedness on credits and making down payments on the purchase of construction materials, equipment, rolling stock and cable products.
