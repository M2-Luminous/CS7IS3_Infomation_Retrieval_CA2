We were well aware that retired members of the upper echelons of the Armed Forces were deliberately outspoken, but had no idea of the degree to which Nicolas Hermoza's [chairman of the Armed Forces Joint command] men had become devoted to proselytism. The OIE document does not address the members of the Armed Forces as professionals, engaged in the defense of the Constitution and the state, but rather real or potential political cadres that are being instigated to mobilize those who oppose the current regime. Couched in the best Leninist style, the tract has a message for insiders, but does not reveal it to outsiders. Besides being a pamphlet of proselytism, the OIE document is a piece of disinformation for military professionals, which caricatures domestic concern for human rights, drug trafficking, and precisely the institutionalism of the Armed Forces. In the view of the OIE there does not seem to be any difference between democratic opposition to Alberto Fujimori and the Shining Path. It is obvious that OIE editors are not interested in promoting a debate within its organization, but rather in dispelling the possible doubts of its captive audience by seeking to provoke in them a mood of paranoia. To this effect they invent the idea that the press and public are hostile to the Armed Forces as a whole. This is, to say the least, a clumsy psychosocial technique. It is not the opposition, but rather high-ranking officials from Fujimori's regime who are against trying the most serious cases of drug trafficking and violations of human rights in civil court. The civil courts are precisely where it is acknowledged that the crimes of which a defendant is accused are of a nonmilitary nature. To insist on military jurisdiction is to do the Armed Forces a disservice. The OIE document seems rather an attempt to involve a protective institution in political matters because of some individuals' "serious mistakes." In fact, rather than a threat against the press (which it certainly is), the document is an attempt to impose a certain political line of thought among those who wear a uniform on behalf of the nation as a whole. The reiterated allusions to "disloyal people" in the pamphlet remind one of the secret pacts outside the law that are made by some organizations like the Yakuza [Japanese mafia]. The officers who at this juncture submit reliable information about drug trafficking in the tropical forests are showing in an exemplary manner what the sole and top loyalty of a military should be: loyalty to the Constitution and to the laws of our homeland. The OIE seems to be inviting members of our Armed Forces to forget their oaths of allegiance and side with a political party. The problem with this lies in the fact that once the military begin to get involved in politics, nothing will prevent them from increasingly siding with those political options offered to them. A leadership that is devoted to making officers and the rank-and-file side with Fujimori may end up harming the professional, institutional, and democratic feelings that prevail in the barracks.
