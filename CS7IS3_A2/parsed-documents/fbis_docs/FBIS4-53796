The meeting was to open in Seoul Friday but less than 24 hours before the delegates planned to get started, the Russian Government told Seoul it could not send a delegation because of unspecified domestic reasons. Moscow then revised its decision and told Seoul it would send a delegation under a different leader. It changed its mind again a short while later, however, saying it wouldn't send a delegation after all. Senior Korean Government officials were reportedly stunned after receiving the first notice, because the meeting was scheduled to be held as they were preparing for President Kim Yong-sam's state visit to Russia. The Korean officials heaved a collective sigh of relief when they received the second message, only to be thrown into confusion again a few hours later. After receiving the first message from Moscow, which said it could not send a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, the Foreign Ministry even made an official announcement to that effect. But the Russian Embassy in Seoul asked the ministry to describe it not as "a cancellation" but as "a suspension," saying it would provide further information two to three hours later. At 8 P.M. Thursday, the Russian side informed the ministry that it would send a delegation led not by Shokhin but by another deputy prime minister. Then three hours later at 11 P.M., the Russian Embassy told the ministry that no delegation would be coming to Seoul after all. Shortly afterward, the Russian Government phoned the Korean Embassy in Moscow and proposed to hold an unofficial committee meeting for two days in the Russian capital from May 30. But the Korean side has decided that it would be meaningless to hold such a meeting only a day before President Kim is scheduled to start his visit to Russia. On Friday, Korean Government officials were unable to find out what those "domestic conditions" were. The most plausible reason put forward by Korean officials appears to be "the political realignment which is taking place in Moscow right now," according to sources.
