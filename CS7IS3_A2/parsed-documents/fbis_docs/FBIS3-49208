Retailers are finding it increasingly hard to obtain goods as production has virtually ground to a halt. Many of the 70,000 shop assistants in Belgrade go to work out of habit. Downtown supermarkets, once full of domestic and imported delicacies, are now empty of both goods and customers and in many shops the only items offered for sale are a few bottles of mineral water or cans of sardines. For a majority of Belgrade stores, Wednesday was the ninth consecutive day on which they stayed closed. Because of the runaway inflation, which reached one million percent in December, they are loathe to accept the national currency in payment for their wares. The value of their takings is completely eroded within a matter of hours and is not enough for even a fraction of the stocks they need. Since cash money is increasingly in short supply, people have to pay for many things with checks. And more and more cashiers in socially-owned as well as private stores are refusing to accept checks or any kind of plastic money. Even farmers at the open-air markets take dinars unwillingly. For months now, the German mark has been in use as a currency and a basis for formation of prices. Even the value of the mark has declined in Yugoslavia. A liter of milk which sold at 0.25 marks before the new year holiday now costs one German mark, while the average wage amounts to about 10 marks and pensions less than five. The crisis has led to the disappearance of the middle class. Sociologists say 95 percent of the population is poor, while the remainder is very wealthy, mainly from illegal gains from crime or the black market. Many economists are surprised that the monetary and financial systems have not caved in completely by now. The federal government announced implementation of a program to rehabilitate the monetary system and curb hyperinflation for January. However, it underlined that easing of the sanctions and unblocking of Yugoslav assets abroad were prerequisites for the program's success.
