NATO's Partnership With Russia Will Differ From its Relations With East European Countries"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Yuriy Ushakov, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry All-European Cooperation Department, has said to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that as it is going to sign the "Partnership for Peace" plan, Russia sees it as a stage on the way to reaching a wide-ranging agreement on cooperation with NATO that could be contemplated both within the "Partnership for Peace" concept and outside it. The program itself is in principle acceptable for Russia at this stage as "a compromise that has come about under the influence of a number of factors." Moscow does not want to approach it from a formal, symbolic point of view that characterizes the stances of a number of East European countries that confuse a NATO membership card with a credit card to borrow money from Western banks. Russia's partnership, however, will be different from the cliches of its former Warsaw Pact allies. It is essential to take into account its weight on the international scene, its status of a nuclear power, and the importance of relations between the two partners -- Russia itself and NATO. The North Atlantic Alliance, however, is preoccupied with the search for a formula that, while formally not recognizing Russia's privileged status within "Partnership for Peace," would still enable them to foster a special cooperation. A number of NATO experts talk about the "16+1" formula, which calls for special consultations between the Russian Federation and NATO. That is precisely what Russia wants. Special conditions will still have to be created for Moscow. There is yet another reservation: Many Russian and foreign mass media have interpreted Grachev's words as meaning that Russia would definitely sign the "Partnership for Peace" in March. Officials on Smolenskaya Square [Foreign Ministry] clarify: "Maybe in late March, maybe later." The latter is more likely. This has been caused by the need to complete the drafting of documents, to wind up interdepartmental consultations, and to solve a number of technical problems. There are two candidates for signing on the Russian side: Kozyrev and Grachev. The site of the signing is already known -- Brussels.
