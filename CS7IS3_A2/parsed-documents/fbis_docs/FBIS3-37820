He has been elected prime minister seven times, twice he has been ousted by the military, but history restores everything to its rightful place and last year he became president of our neighbor, Turkey. His path to the top was as long and arduous as Turkey's path to democracy and economic prosperity. The irony is that it is his name specifically which for millions of Turks is synonymous with democracy (although Demirel translated means "iron hand"). His residence today is the sumptuous "Pink House" (that is the nickname given to the president's palace because of the gaudy color of the stone with which it is finished). It is difficult to gain access to this building even for local journalists -- he has no time for interviews. However he made an exception for us -- Demirel has always paid close attention to Russia and, as it turned out, he knows our newspaper well. [Kulik] The leaders of many former republics of the USSR regard Turkey not only as an "older brother" who will help them in difficult times but also as a "father," in the belief that he will not only bring up his poor children but will also give them a start in "adult life." Do people in those countries not overexaggerate the role of Turkey, which has a host of economic problems of its own, a complex political situation, and vast debts? [Demirel] We consider it our political and moral duty to help the newly independent Turkic republics to strengthen their statehood, overcome their economic problems, and enter the market. Our relations are based on equality of rights. That is why there is no question of an "older" or "younger brother." Turkey has signed more than 200 agreements with those countries in the spheres of the economy, culture, education, communications, transport, technical assistance, and banking. Ankara has granted credits totaling $935 million. In all, taken together with humanitarian and technical assistance, these countries have received $1,200 million. Last year and already this year around 10,000 students from the Central Asian republics and Azerbaijan have come to Turkey to study thanks to an "educational link program" that has been devised. We are also cooperating in air transport. Flights, including charter flights, have begun between Baku, Tashkent, Bishkek, Almaty, Ashgabat, and Istanbul. We have given those countries technical help to improve radio and satellite communications. They will now be able to link up with the rest of the world via Turkey. [Kulik] The creation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation [BSEC] organization was received with great enthusiasm, although with the passage of time interest in this organization has gradually begun to wane. Does this mean that the BSEC has not lived up to the hopes of politicians and businessmen? What specifically is Turkey doing to develop regional cooperation? [Demirel] I do not share the view that interest in the BSEC has waned. It is working fully -- which is confirmed by the number of joint decisions and technical meetings. Moreover, the interest of third parties can be confirmed by the increase in the number of requests for "observer status" from various states or nongovernmental organizations. As you already know, I am sure, Poland, Tunisia, Israel, Slovakia, and Egypt have already been given that status within the BSEC. The same status has been given to the organization's council created by commercial associations from the member countries. The International Black Sea Club has been created. The progress achieved with the framework of the BSEC may be considered outstanding. Its structural organization has been completed and the transition to the level of implementing specific projects has been made. Cooperation in the telecommunications sphere is developing particulary actively. [Kulik] Islamic fundamentalism is worrying the whole world today. Does that problem exist in Turkey? How do you regard it? [Demirel] To be frank, it is hard to understand how world publc opinion can be worried about the activation of Islamic fundamentalism. After all, in former Yugoslavia and especially on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina it is the Muslims who have been subjected to attack. It is they essentially who are suffering genocide. More than 1 million people in Azerbaijan have become refugees in their own country. And it is against that background that the whole world is for some reason talking about Islamic fundamentalism. On the contrary, it is the Muslims who are presently in a defensive position. That must be clearly seen. Islamic fundamentalism in the eighties was a kind of reaction by the populations of various Muslim countries to the lack of democracy and to pressure from the authoriies. But if we look at things from today's perspective, we will see that even the most radical Islamic tendencies of that period which entered the leadership of certain countries have substantially moderated their position. In the nineties the situation began to develop differently. A new world order is being formed in the process of which a host of problems which have accumulated since World War I have surfaced. In such an uncertain atmosphere, religiosity, micronationalism, a hostile attitude to foreigners, and other harmful tendencies have begun to prevail in various regions. It is because the world community did not prevent them in time that we now have the present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is no need to speak of fundamentalism in Turkey: We do not have such a problem. Yes, of course, there are individual fundamentalists or fairly small and uninfluential groups of that kind. But you can encounter that anywhere in the world. But the overwhelming majority of Turks are implacable toward fundamentalism. The fact is that Turkey has quite considerable experience in the sphere of democracy and law -- we have accepted them as a way of life.... Go out into the streets and talk with Turks there and you will see that for yourself. [Kulik] Last year Turkish officials were heard to say a number of times that the "Kurdish Workers' Party [PKK] would be finished off before 1994." Indeed, Ankara did conduct a number of successful operations against Kurdish militants both in Turkey itself and in Europe. However, the strength of the PKK has not diminished, the struggle goes on, and people continue to die. Do you still believe that this organization must be fought by strong-arm methods alone? What is the way out of the present situation? [Demirel] I do not believe that anyone said: "The PKK will be finished off...." I am sure that they were talking about an effective and successful campaign against that terrorist organization and the weakening of it, which has been achieved. Turkey is constantly trying to resolve this problem on the basis of the norms of a democratic, rule-of-law state. We are opposed to the destruction of the country and our villages, attacks on border posts and police stations, and the murder of people, indiscriminate murder furthermore -- of children, women, men, civilians or military, young or old. And Turkey's measures in response to all this are constitutional: We are protecing our democratic regime by the methods of that democratic regime. I do not think that there are any other means of combatting terrorism. It would be a mistake to think that it is only people of Kurdish origin who are members of the terrorist PKK. In Turkey all people are "first class" citizens. Incidentally, there are more Kurds in western Turkey than in the southeast (that is where the war against the PKK is particularly fierce -- author's note). They live as they please and where they please, they work where they want to work. And our task is to protect them from the PKK, a terrorist organzation which engages in racketeering, drug smuggling, and other illegal activity. [Kulik] The Cold War has ended, but Turkey retains its former military concept and there are NATO basis still on its territory. Do you think that it is still necessary to preserve this situation? [Demirel] I do not believe that there is any reason to fear this in Moscow. There is an agreement on friendship and cooperation between Russia and Turkey which I myself signed in 1992. [Kulik] Since you have raised the subject, incidentally, do you not rule out cooperation in the military sphere? [Demirel] Turkey is a part of NATO. If that organization's policy and doctrine allow such cooperation then of course it is possible. But we are already collaborating in the military sphere by buying your military hardware. There are consultations between our generals, the Russian defense minister has visited Turkey.... Russia is no longer our enemy. We have formed good relations. [Kulik] Sometimes the Turkish reforms are called almost an "economic miracle." There is also an opinion that it was only the army, when it held power in Turkey, which ensured stability and prepared the ground for successful political and economic transformations. As a president and a politican who has suffered from the army a number of times, what do you think about that? [Demirel] The involvement of the military in politics is the oldest thing in the world. But sooner or later people always come to the conclusion that power must be civilian. Where the army is under the leadership of civilians, there you get democracy. Where the military run everything, there you get fascism. The army cannot prepare the country for democracy. The people must prepare themselves for democracy which cannot develop "in silence." That is why I shall never agree with the leading role of the army in reforms. [Kulik] How do you view the results of the parliamentary elections in Russia? Will they influence Russian-Turkish relations? [Demirel] The elections in Russia are, of course, entirely Russia's domestic affair. They are a reflection of the Russian people's political will. These were the first free elections in Russia and approved the new post-communist constitution. I am confident that the process of reforms, which are so tumultuous in your country, will continue. As for our bilateral relations, I would like to note that we perceive Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statements with apprehension. However, we do not believe that the many centuries old Russian-Turkish relations can be swayed by such utterances. [Kulik] You are a well-known politician of world stature. Much is said and written about you. But how would Suleyman Demirel describe himself -- as a man and a citizen? [Demirel] I have been serving my state and my people for 40 years now, first as a technocrat, then as a politician. I first became involved in political activity to establish the supremacy of the people's will because my ideal was that of a happy, prosperous, and democratic Turkey built "from scratch." I am constantly working to achieve that ideal today. I have elevated democracy to the level of my own poetry and I have always fought for it even at the most difficult times. I derive my determination here from the determination of the Turkish people. If you look at the past 30 years of the Turkish Republic, you will see that the people have always been with me. I believe that I worked quite hard to ensable us to achieve the level of democracy and economic strength that we have today. Of course, only the people can assess politicans and their actions. That is why I feel pride in and admiration for our people who have always rendered me my due.
