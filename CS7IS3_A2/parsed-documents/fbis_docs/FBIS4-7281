The political chaos wrought over a government to succeed Hosokawa will now come to an end, but the Hata government is a minority party government since the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] seceded from the coalition, which means the government's base is weak. There is already talk it will be a "short-lived government." Once the 1994 budget is passed, the political scene will most likely change, and the House of Representatives will be dissolved for a general election. As regards major policy matters, it would be absurd to have many expectations of the Hata government which became a minority government with the departure of the SDPJ. Most political parties including the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] are showing a positive attitude on deliberating and passing the budget, but, as for the situation after that, there is no telling what will happen. There will be major turbulence on the political scene. The Hata government, which has started with a different coalition framework, is made up of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] members in its axis plus Komeito members and defectors from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. It looks almost like "the former Tanaka faction plus Komeito." As far as political reform is concerned, all that happened was the change of the election system to single-seat election districts; the major problems of preventing political corruption and tearing down the collusion of politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen has not been dealt with at all. Moreover, looking at the faces of the Hata cabinet, we can see there is a major change from the Hosokawa government which had reform as its banner. Indeed, the new cabinet is one which is far from a reform government. The fact it no longer has a minister in charge of political reform symbolizes this well. Various polls show that what the public wants most of Prime Minister Hata is to eradicate the dual power structure created by the remote control of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa behind the scenes. The exercise of absolute influence on government operations by an individual from behind the curtains makes the whereabouts of political responsibilities ambiguous, and entails the risk of government power being abused. From the fact that assigning of posts in the Hata cabinet leaned favorably toward Shinseito and Komeito, we can say that the so-called Ozawa-Ichikawa (the latter being general secretary of Komeito) duo has gained more power. Defectors from the LDP were also picked in the cabinet. Their selection is believed to be window-dressing aimed at further inciting rifts within the LDP and at agitating the SDPJ. The late Kakuei Tanaka who was called the shadow general [yami shogun] put efforts into building the Tanaka faction to gain the power of influence over political circles. To do so, he picked people from other factions as members of his cabinet, thus publicizing the merits of joining the Tanaka faction. The recent cabinet appointments smell strongly of a Kakuei-style political scheme. One face of the new government can be said to have been revealed by this. A feature of the Hata government without the SDPJ is that this is not just simply a coalition government of minority parties, but a minority coalition government which was formed without the participation of the largest party (LDP) and the second-largest party (SDPJ). It is a group of splinter parties of third and lesser ranking parties, plus groups of those who defected from the LDP without waiting for the public to pass judgment on them through elections. The government may be legal in that the prime minister received Diet approval, but there is a question as to whether it is a politically legitimate government with power entrusted to it by the majority of the people. Many people who had expectations of the new government which replaced the LDP and who had been so pleased with the advent of the Hosokawa government could be embarrassed and disappointed by this big change in the basic nature of the coalition government. The political situation now is one which necessitates the dissolution of the House of Representatives for a new general election once the budget is passed.
