Thai and US officials are scheduled to hold their third round of talks this month. They are expected to focus on the illegal shipment clause as it is the last crucial and contentious issue to be resolved in the negotiations. The United States has already proposed some wording it would like to see included in the agreement, but the Thai side did not want to see the final agreement based on a US draft alone. The wording proposed by the US may conflict with some of Gatt's multilateral trade principles. And Thailand's agreement to such a clause might have put the country at a disadvantage on other issues in the future. A source in the Thai Garment Manufacturers Association said the US proposed very tough penalties for circumvention of the country-of-origin rules. Thai garment exporters would stand to lose portions of their quota if their products are found to have been trans-shipped to third countries before entering the US. The condition suggested by the Americans would give the United States the rights to inspect any plant in Thailand suspected of trans-shipping its output to the United States without advance notice. If any plant were shown to be guilty, the firm would be subject to being punished by the reduction of its quota by triple the amount of product illegally transshipped. The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (Gatt) calls for giving accused countries the chance to clear themselves by submitting documentation in support of their innocence. The US wants to be able to check things out at the source. The source said two previous negotiating sessions had failed to extend the textiles and garments agreement because the Thai side could not accept the US proposal. Many other textile and garment exporters like Hong Kong and China have agreed to sign bilateral textile quota agreements with the United States. The circumvention penalties insisted on by the United States differ for each country such an agreement has been concluded with. The old bilateral agreement which allowed for a limited amount of Thai textiles to be exported to the US without harming its domestic garment industry expired on Dec 31 of last year. Wirot Amatakunchai, president of the Thai Garment Manufacturers Association, said Thailand proposed a 20 per cent increase over its former quota of 202 million square metres for the new agreement, since Thailand used up all of the quota granted under the old agreement last year. The upcoming third round of negotiations have been delayed until April or May after a big meeting of the Thai Chamber Commerce. Phongsak Atsakun, president of the Thai Textile Manufacturing Association, said the 30 per cent decrease in sales of cotton products around the world would affect exporters only in the short term. Prices of imported raw cotton, of which Thailand imports 300,000 tonnes annually, have risen by 40-50 per cent over the past two month. Wirot said the finished-clothes industry has also been affected. Cotton thread is currently priced 30 per cent higher with TC thread priced 10 per cent higher as well. Cotton clothing is expected to increase in price by 20 per cent as a consequence.
