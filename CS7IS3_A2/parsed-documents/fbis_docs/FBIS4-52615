Hikasa met with Edward McCracken, cochairman of the U.S. National Information Infrastructure (NII) Council, who is visiting Tokyo. Japan is preparing to build an optical-fiber network for domestic communications, and is calling for a wider network joined by South Korea and other Asian nations. The ministry officials said Hikasa told McCracken that Japan will back the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) project which is being promoted by the United States. The GII plan was proposed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore in March. It aims to provide instant access to information around the world through a large optical-fiber communication network.
