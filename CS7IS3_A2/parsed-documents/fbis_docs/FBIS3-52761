In the area of public opinion the press plays an important role and, generally speaking, its efforts are summed up as either "positive" or "negative." The press in Iran today is facing extremely sensitive conditions that inevitably call for the adoption of a clear stance and firm guidance of public opinion. Actually, why are some of our press today indifferent toward a reality that is known as cultural onslaught? What impact does this indifference have on the current generation and will it have on the coming generation? The esteemed leader, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of a foreign cultural onslaught and has warned against weakness toward this onslaught, said when appointing the new KEYHAN editor that "indifference toward the Iranian nation's mental needs and its Islamic and revolutionary aspirations, which can be seen in some of the country's press today, is a sin that will not be pardoned by our people now or in the future or on the day of divine judgment." Yes! Some of the newspapers in Iran today consider the publication of the ideas of those who do not believe in the Islamic and national grandeur of the people to be better than confronting such ideas. Some newspapers prefer to propagate secular beliefs within the framework of each interview and roundtable discussion that they publish rather than propound the luminous ideas of Islam and of the revolution. Where should we seek the root of such indifference? Where does this indifference, conservatism, and disregard for reality and values come from? It seems that some of the foreign cultural onslaught happens not because it is strong but because our own forces are not firm in stating their views. What answer do those who manage most of the press, especially the newspapers, in Iran today and should meet the mental needs of the Iranian nation, the young generation, and the truth seekers have for this indifference? How successful have some newspapers with a high circulation that publish long interviews and propound the "theory of forbearance" or publish items trying to encourage the country's foreign policy to establish relations with the United States been in their main mission, which is to guide public opinion, clarify reality, and defend the country from the foreign onslaught? Especially at a time when the ideological and cultural trends of heterodox elements are exploiting the freedom of the press in Iran today and are constantly putting forth pro-Western theories. Of course, it is because of the prevailing indifference that such situations are not confronted. The esteemed leader said in his statement appointing the new KEYHAN editor: "The confrontation and rebellion against aspirations that can unfortunately be seen in some newspapers today because of the exploitation of the freedoms that the Islamic Republic enjoys is a heavy and unforgettable sin." Thus, with the clear stances by the leader of the revolution, there is no place for pretexts. The forces that consider themselves pious and committed to the revolution and to its values and who rely on how some of the newspapers guide public opinion do not have any justification for the continuation of this indifference.
