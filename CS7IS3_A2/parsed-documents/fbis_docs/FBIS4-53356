FBIS4-53356 "dreas095_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 17 May 1994 South Korea IAEA Inspectors Leave Beijing for Pyongyang IAEA Inspectors Leave Beijing for Pyongyang SK1705063994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0633 GMT 17 May 94 SK1705063994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] left Beijing for Pyongyang aboard a (North) Korean airways plane Tuesday [17 May] afternoon. The three IAEA experts will conduct additional inspections of nuclear laboratories at Yongbyon, 100 km north of Pyongyang, and check whether nuclear fuel rods have been replaced at the North's 5-megawatt reactor. The inspections, coming after a two-month pause, are important because they will determine whether the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear program is referred to the United Nations Security Council for sanctions, or the United States and North Korea hold a third round of high-level talks. Before departing for Pyongyang, the head of the IAEA inspectors stated that he can say nothing before the actual inspections, which will begin as soon as possible. Western sources here said the IAEA experts may differ with North Korean officials on the scope of the inspections, but such disagreement will never be so serious as to block the holding of a third round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang. North Korea is likely to employ the two undeclared nuclear facilities as a final card to be used in negotiations with the United States and the IAEA. Whether the North accepts inspections of the two undeclared sites will be the final issue to be resolved at the negotiations, the sources said. Meanwhile, the three-man IAEA team will end the first stage of inspections by this weekend and report the results to agency headquarters in Vienna. This means a decision on the third round of high-level dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang will come next week at the latest.
