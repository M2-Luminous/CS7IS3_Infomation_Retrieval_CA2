Semipalatinsk Test Site Continues To Pose Questions"] [Text] At a meeting between Tulegen Zhukeyev, state counselor of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and journalists discussion again turned to the future of a nuclear device prepared for testing at the Semipalatinsk test site but still in an underground gallery, as the test site has been closed to date under an edict of the president of Kazakhstan. Nuclear tests have accordingly ended. What, then, will become of the nuclear charge? What is its future? Could a spontaneous underground nuclear explosion eventually occur? These and other questions are worrying people. The state counselor thinks the nuclear charge should be neutralized. However, according to him, Kazakhstan is unable to do this itself. Only those who prepared the charge and placed it underground for testing are capable of doing it. However, as we have learned from informed sources, the nuclear charge's removal from the gallery entails very complicated engineering operations. This is not only expensive, it is dangerous too, as it was never planned that the device would be removed. It was prepared only for detonation and was carefully sealed up. We have heard from certain officers at the test site that destroying the charge in situ would be the simplest and most expedient solution. That is to say, detonate it and let that be an end to the matter, particularly as its yield compared with those detonated at the test site in previous years is not very great. But a new problem is coming to a head. The military unit which provided support services for tests at the Semipalatinsk site is being disbanded. Shortly there will be no one to remove or detonate the charge, depending on which decision is made. Perhaps our descendants will be left this "surprise" as a keepsake?
