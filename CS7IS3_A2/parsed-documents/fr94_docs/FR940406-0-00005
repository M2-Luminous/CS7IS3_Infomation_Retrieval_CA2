FR940406-0-00005 FR940406-0-00001 Training_7 CFR 272.4(d) Section 322(a) of Public Law 100&hyph;435 amended section 11(e)(6)(C) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(6)(C)) to specifically require that training for case workers provided by the State agency convey the goals of and methods for promptly and accurately certifying eligible households. The interim rule amended 7 CFR 272.4(d)(1)(i) to reflect this statutory language. A commenter did not think it was necessary for the Department to instruct State agencies to include this ``function'' of the Program in their training programs. As the Department explained in the preamble of the interim rule, this language was added to the regulations to emphasize Congressional concern in this area as reflected by Public Law 100&hyph;435. The Department is adopting the interim provisions at 7 CFR 272.4(d)(1)(i) as final without change. In addition, pursuant to section 322(b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule added a new paragraph (d)(2) to 7 CFR 272.4 to allow State agencies, at their option, to offer training and assistance to persons working with certain volunteer or nonprofit organizations. In conjunction with this new option, the interim rule added a new paragraph (f) to 7 CFR 277.4 to provide that expenses (e.g., travel costs, lodging, or meals) of the persons working with the volunteer or nonprofit organization who receive this training and assistance would not be reimbursed. A commenter was concerned that the interim rule language appearing in 7 CFR 277.4(f) could be misinterpreted to mean that travel expenses of State employees who work with organizations that receive this training would not be allowable. The Department agrees that the language could create this misinterpretation. Accordingly, this final rule amends the interim provisions at 7 CFR 277.4(f) to clarify this distinction. The interim provision at 7 CFR 272.4(d)(2) is adopted as final without change. Information for Low-Income Households_7 CFR 272.5(c) Section 204(a) and (b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and 7 CFR 272.5(c) of the interim rule allow State agencies, at their option, to inform low-income households about the availability, eligibility requirements, application procedures and benefits of the Food Stamp Program. Pursuant to section 204(b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule also amended 7 CFR 272.5(c) to specify that State agencies, at their option, may request reimbursement under 7 CFR part 277 for these outreach activities. The interim rule contained a number of conforming amendments necessitated by the addition of these outreach activity provisions. 7 CFR 272.5(c) was amended to specify that if a State agency elects to request reimbursement for Program informational materials directed at low-income households, those materials must meet any applicable bilingual requirements. 7 CFR 272.5(c) was further amended to require that prior to claiming such outreach costs, State agencies must receive approval from the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of an appropriate amendment to their State Plan of Operations. In addition, 7 CFR 272.2(a)(2) was amended to add a reference to the optional ``Program informational activities plan'' as a component of the State Plan of Operation, and 7 CFR 272.2(d)(1) was amended to add the requirement that State agencies submit the optional ``Program informational activity'' planning document to FNS for inclusion in their State Plan of Operation. Lastly, the interim rule added a conforming amendment to 7 CFR part 277, appendix A, to remove paragraph C(14) which was made obsolete. One commenter felt the requirement of 7 CFR 272.2(a)(2) which mandates that State agencies submit a Program informational activities plan is burdensome. The commenter suggested that the budget justification contained on the form FNS&hyph;366A should be sufficient to obtain the prediction of expenditures. The Department disagrees. As State agencies begin to implement outreach under Public Law 100&hyph;435, the Department wishes to make sure that controls are in place that ensure cost-effective spending. The plans provide important information on the kinds of activities and services being planned as well as the sub-populations at which State agencies are targeting their efforts. Having this information and the budget projection data will enable the Department to assist State agencies in developing the most cost-effective outreach programs possible. Therefore, this final rule adopts the interim provisions pertaining to information for low income households as final without change.
