FR940916-0-00074 FR940916-0-00019 C. Family Impact The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this rule will have only an indirect, though beneficial, impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, since it would encourage, when funds are appropriated for this purpose, expenditures in the affected housing for increases in security expenses, and operating, maintenance and capital repair costs primarily due to drug-related criminal activity. The rule, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. D. Regulatory Flexibility In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Secretary by his approval of this rule for publication hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It allows HUD to approve rent adjustments to private owners for substantial general increases in security expenses, and operating, maintenance and capital repair costs primarily due to drug-related criminal activity. E. Semi-Annual Agenda This rule was listed as item number 1692 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (58 FR 20424, 20471) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number is 14.856. List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 882 Grant programs_housing and community development, Homeless, Lead poisoning, Manufactured homes, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR Part 882 as set forth below: PART 882_SECTION 8 HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS PROGRAM_EXISTING HOUSING 1. The authority citation for 24 CFR Part 882 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437a, 1437c, 1437f, 3535(d), 11361, and 11401. 2. In §882.410, paragraph (a)(2) is revised and the OMB control number is added to the end of the section to read as follows: §882.410 Rent adjustments. (a) *␣*␣* (2) Special Adjustments. (i) A special adjustment, to the extent determined by HUD to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the unit which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates and utilities not covered by regulated rates, may be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD. Subject to appropriations, a special adjustment may also be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD when HUD determines that a project is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent, and not specific to a particular project, and the project's operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity. HUD may, on a project-by-project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the current gross rents for each unit size under a Housing Assistance Payments Contract, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs and reserves required for the Owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to HUD for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity. Prior to approval of a special adjustment to cover the cost of physical improvements, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related authorities at 24 CFR 50.4. (ii) The aforementioned special rent adjustments will only be approved if and to the extent the Owner clearly demonstrates that these general increases have caused increases in the owners operating costs which are not adequately compensated for by annual adjustments. (iii) The Owner must submit financial information to the PHA which clearly supports the increase. For Contracts of more than twenty units, the Owner must submit audited financial information. * * * * * (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB approval number 2577&hyph;0196) Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
