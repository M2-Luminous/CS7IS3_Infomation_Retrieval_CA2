The council said in a statement that the actions, which affect the safe and free movement of UNPROFOR personnel, have violated the Security Council's resolutions. The statement said that "the council affirms its full support for UNPROFOR in its execution of the council's relevant resolutions." The council "demands that all parties, and in particular the Bosnian Serb party, allow UNPROFOR unimpeded freedom of movement, and refrain from any further actions which could threaten the safety of UNPROFOR personnel." Reports of Serbs' blocking of UNPROFOR movement came after NATO launched air strikes against Serb positions around the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde on April 10 and 11.
