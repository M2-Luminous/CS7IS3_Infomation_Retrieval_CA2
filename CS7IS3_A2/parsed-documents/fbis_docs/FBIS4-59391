['Abd-al-Shafi] I would like to point out that I am independent; that is, I am not committed to any political faction. To avoid ambiguity, I am not an oppositionist, but I express my own views as a Palestinian citizen. I have expressed my opinion about the Gaza-Jericho agreement right from the start. I believe that my mission ended with the announcement of the secret talks in Oslo. ['Abd-al-'Ati] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has led the Palestinian negotiating team of the Cairo talks and you led the negotiating team of the Madrid process. Do you believe the change was intended to introduce more flexibility in the negotiations with the Israelis? ['Abd-al-Shafi] The change has come because the Palestinian leadership wanted it, and I do not want to comment on it. As for the choice of Nabil Sha'th, I believe that he has followed the leadership's instructions, but not out of conviction. The Cairo agreement itself did not tackle the Israeli claims about several issues. ['Abd-al-'Ati] How do you explain the fact that the Palestinian people in the occupied territories have not come out to express their views on the Cairo agreement? ['Abd-al-Shafi] The whole process has lost much of its credibility. Since September 1993, in many ways what had been told to the people about the agreement removing obstacles and opening the door for a just peace has turned out to be untrue. This is because the attitude and the practices of the Israeli Army remained unchanged. Their settlement activity still continues, as do the repressive measures. In brief, the reality refutes the words. As a result, the people are not pleased with the Cairo Agreement. Even the question of the detainees and their release has not been completed the way we would have liked. Israel turned the issue of the political detainees into a bargaining chip. All this has frustrated the Palestinian people. ['Abd-al-'Ati] In your opinion, what are the drawbacks to the Cairo agreement? ['Abd-al-Shafi] One of the negative points in this agreement is that it is subject to different interpretations. In the absence of equality in the balance of power, the stronger party will prevail. One of the most serious drawbacks is Israel's control of the crossing points in Rafah and at the Allenby Bridge. This means that Israel will control all the borders and exit points of Palestine. We want peace to end the sufferings of our people. I disagree with the opposition, which is too emotional in handling the differences with the PLO. ['Abd-al-'Ati] Will you run in the coming elections after the establishment of the Palestinian Authority? ['Abd-al-Shafi] I do not rule out my participation in any coming elections when the Palestinian Authority is fully established. When elections are called, I will think about running. So long as the goal of every Palestinian is to ease the sufferings of his people, there is no justification for boycotting an election, if there is one.
