Velayati said: During the past few years, this forum has held annual sessions in Crans Montana in Switzerland and has gained great significance in the world. The objective of this forum is to develop political-economic possibilities and to create the grounds and facilities for exchanges of views among personalities from all the countries of the world. Referring to the significant and strategic regional role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in relation to important issues such as the Central Asian countries and the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Velayati said: By clarifying the Islamic Republic's stances on the situation in the northern republics and the steps that Iran has taken to help preserve their independence, to mitigate and to overcome ethnic clashes, and to increase cooperation with these countries within the framework of ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] and the Organization of the Caspian Sea Littoral countries, we have played a pivotal and major role in past sessions. Thus, this year--thanks to efforts that have been made--explaining the economic-political position of the Islamic Republic of Iran at home and in the region became one of the most important and major programs of the World Forum and the first day of this year's session was devoted to Iran. Continuing, Velayati referred to the comprehensive program prepared for the day devoted to the Islamic Republic of Iran at the forum and said: In this program, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani participated in a direct satellite link at the request of the organizers of the session--unprecedented at World Forum sessions--and answered questions put to him by participants in the forum. In conclusion, Velayati referred to the participation of our country's commercial, economic, and banking officials at the session and the briefing of about 600 political and economic personalities from more than 40 countries of the world about Iran's economic, commercial, and industrial plans, and expressed hopes that the grounds for the growth and the further expansion of economic, commercial, and industrial cooperation between Iran and the other countries of the world will be paved.
