He was accompanied by Janusz Bryczkowski, chairman of the Polish National Front. "I am laying flowers on the soil where for centuries Germans, Poles, and Russians fought battles. Grunwald was a joint Polish-Russian victory," Zhirinovskiy said, pointing out that Smolensk battalions took part in the battle. When asked by journalists to whom the former East Prussia should belong, Zhirinovksiy said that "the borders were determined 50 years ago as a result of blood shed by Polish and Russian soldiers, and these territories belong to Poland." Zhirinovskiy said that there is enough room "along the Baltic for everyone--the Germans, the Poles, and the Russians." This morning, before his departure for Olsztyn province, Zhirinovskiy took a walk in Warsaw's Lazienki Park and the Castle Square. Together with Janusz Bryczkowski, he laid flowers in front of the Warsaw Uprising monument.
