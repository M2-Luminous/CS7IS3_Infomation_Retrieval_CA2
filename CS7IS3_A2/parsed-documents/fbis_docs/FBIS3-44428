He said prisons and rehabilitation centers are not only places where criminals are punished, but also places where they are reformed and re-educated. "They offer a special kind of education," said the minister at a national conference of judicial officials, which opened today. The minister said that criminals should be taught both to be law- abiding working people and people useful to the socialist market economy. There were 300,000 inmates in China's prisons and reform-through- labor centers in 1993, he said. Fewer than 0.12 percent of inmates escaped from prisons and fewer than 1 percent from reform centers in the first 11 months of last year, the minister said. In recent years some major changes have occurred in the composition of prisoners, he said. Prisoners involved in criminal cases and economic cases are on the rise, and there are more offenders who are juveniles or former public employees, he said. The minister asked that a network be set up within three to five years to help to offer jobs to people who have finished their sentences. The prisons and reform-through-labor centers should be more open in terms of management, he said. The inmates should have more contacts with society, he added.
