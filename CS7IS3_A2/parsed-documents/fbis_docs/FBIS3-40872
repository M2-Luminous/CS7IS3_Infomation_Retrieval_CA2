It is the Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS) of ABRI [Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces], which was recently scheduled to change form. It will be renamed the ABRI Intelligence Agency (BIA). It will have a slimmer organization and fewer personnel than BAIS. "In accordance with the needs of the time, a large BAIS is no longer needed at the present time," said a high-ranking official commenting on the plans for change. More important, this intelligence agency will have a lower line of command. According to TEMPO's source, BIA will no longer be directly under the commanding general of ABRI's line of command, as is BAIS, which is presently headed by the commanding general of ABRI. The head of BIA, according to that source, will ex officio be the assistant for intelligence to the chief of the General Staff (ASINTEL KASUM) of ABRI. However, according to other high-ranking officers, it is still possible that BIA will be an independent agency under the supervision of ABRI's KASUM [chief of the General Staff], a position now held by Lieutenant General H.L. Mantiri. In that case, BIA will not be a separate agency with easy access to everything. It is said that Gen. Feisal Tanjung, commanding general of ABRI, recently reported to the president that BAIS will be changed into BIA. However, the commanding general of ABRI could not make an official announcement of the change because some details still have to be looked into. "So, this might not be announced until next week (meaning this week)," Brigadier General Syarwan Hamid, head of ABRI's Information Center, told TEMPO last Wednesday [19 January] in Jakarta. This plan has been in preparation for a long time, since Feisal Tanjung became commanding general of ABRI after the MPR's [Parliament] general session in March 1993. ABRI Headquarters formed a team to work on the change. In fact, according to a former high-ranking officer of BAIS, this has been under discussion for some years. Changing the structure of BAIS is to make it more efficient. "But changing the organizational structure and decreasing the number of personnel doesn't mean that the organization will be any less important," he continued. These changes appear to be consistent with the times, which no longer require that the security apparatus, especially those active in the field of military intelligence, act with a "tight fit." Nowadays, he went on to say, given the issues of democratization and human rights, whether we want to or not, the security apparatus is being asked to act with more of a "loose fit." He meant that we only hope that the BIA will limit its role to suggesting actions which will prevent political, social, and economic destabilization. It was different, that retired high-ranking officer continued, in the era of "tight fit," which allowed BAIS to carry out direct actions against those considered "enemies of the state"; for example, imprisonment without due process. The day-to-day operations of the old intelligence agency (BAIS), an organization under the direct control of the commanding general of ABRI, were led by the deputy chairman, an office now held by Major General Arie Sudewo. This agency has eight directorates, each led by a director with the rank of one star, i.e., brigadier general. This does not include the task units (SATGAS), which handle special areas. This agency has really become a filter for every activity here; for example it screens candidates to the DPR/MPR [Parliament/People's Consultative Assembly], candidates to high-ranking government posts, diplomats who are going to be assigned overseas and even BUMN [state-owned company] officials. One important part of BAIS is Directorate A. They say that this directorate has a wide scope of operations because it covers domestic political, social, economic and cultural problems. Its present director is Brigadier General Agum Gumelar. It is this directorate which is well known as having the largest number of aides (PABAN); it has six of them. It is not surprising that members of this directorate have been present at various domestic political incidents. For example, Brig. Gen. Agum played a role in "bringing order to" PDI's [Indonesian Democracy Party] National Congress in Jakarta in December 1993, at which Megawati Soekarnoputri was elected general chairman. BAIS operations also seem to have played a big role in Indonesian political history, such as dealing with opposition groups in East Timor and with those referred to as "disturbers of the peace" in Aceh. This military intelligence agency has played such an important role that it is not surprising that it has become more prestigious than, for example, the State Intelligence Coordinating Board (BAKIN), an agency given the task of coordinating all existing intelligence agencies. However, the conspicuous role played by BAIS is understandable because it has networks at several levels. At the territorial level, for example, BAIS can take advantage of ABRI's existing apparatus, i.e., KODAM [Military Area Command], KOREM [Military Sub-Area Command], KODIM [Military District Command] and KORAMIL [Military Precinct Command], and in fact, if necessary, as far down as the BABINSA [village management noncommissioned officer] at the village level. On the other hand, BAKIN, as a coordinating body, does not need a wide-ranging network, even though it has a limited number of field "correspondents." BAIS plays an important role, and the strength of this agency can also be seen in the number of BAIS "alumni" who have gone on to hold important positions within ABRI and in government administration. Because, according to one of its "alumni," holding a position in BAIS means having the opportunity to learn about territorial problems and national sociopolitical problems at the same time. Lieutenant General (at that time) L.B. Moerdani, who was promoted to commanding general of ABRI for the period 1983 to 1988 and minister of defense and security from 1988 to 1993, came out of BAIS headquarters on Saharjo Street in the Tebet area of South Jakarta. A number of the aides who were with Benny Moerdani when he led the Strategic Intelligence Center--before it became BAIS--have become key leaders in ABRI and the government. Examples are Admiral (retired) M. Arifin (former Navy chief of staff); Rear Admiral (ret.) Sudibjo Rahardjo (former KASUM ABRI), now ambassador to Singapore; Rear Marshal (ret.) Teddy Rusdi (former assistant for general planning); Major General (ret.) Nugroho (former junior attorney general for intelligence and secretary general of the Department of Home Affairs); and Lieutenant General (ret.) Sudibyo, who still heads BAKIN. There are also a number of other high-ranking officers who have risen fast, such as Major General A.M. Hendropriyono (commander of the Greater Jakarta Military Area Command) and Brigadier General Agum Gumelar (commander of Special Mission Forces). The conspicuous role that BAIS has played is the work of its founder, L.B. Moerdani. This agency goes back to the Strategic Intelligence Center (PUSINTELSTRAT), which was under the command of ABRI Headquarters. Benny Moerdani has headed that agency since 1977 and he has also been assistant for intelligence at ABRI Headquarters since 1974. In the late 1970's and the early 1980's he was also entrusted with the task of heading two other important intelligence agencies: he was deputy head of BAKIN and head of intelligence at KOPKAMTIB [Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order]. Not long after Lieut. Gen. Benny was inaugurated as commanding general of ABRI in 1983, PUSINTELSTRAT became BAIS. Richard Tanter, an Australian observer of Indonesian intelligence agencies, thinks that BAIS was formed due to the efforts made by Benny, who thought that ABRI needed a centralized and professional intelligence agency. "It was needed to watch over even the smallest activities and to have the ability to prevent or, if necessary, take action against activities not approved by the government," said Tanter, who now teaches at Kyoto University. He also said that the formation of BAIS, with all its authority, was inspired by Gen. Benny's observation of the South Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) in the 1970's, when he served as defense attache in that country. "Benny very much wanted to create a more professional and sophisticated ABRI intelligence agency," Tanter told TEMPO. Although Benny was already the commanding general of ABRI, he still held the position of head of BAIS. For day-to-day operations he was helped by the deputy chairman of BAIS, at that time Maj. Gen. Sutaryo. After he was no longer commanding general of ABRI and head of BAIS, Benny Moerdani (later to become minister of defense and security) continued to be very influential at the "Saharjo office." In his doctoral dissertation at Monash University in Australia, entitled "Intelligence Agencies in Third World Militarisation, a Case Study of Indonesia 1966-1989," Tanter describes how at that time the deputy chairman of BAIS, Maj. Gen. Sutaryo, reported to two bosses: Try Sutrisno, commanding general of ABRI, and Benny Moerdani, minister of defense and security. This structure, in which the head of BAIS was also the commanding general of ABRI, was heavily criticized, even though it was considered effective. "Intelligence must be separate from direct force. Intelligence must be independent," said Sutopo Yuwono, former head of BAKIN. The products of intelligence should stop at the stage of a "report" to the power holders. The power holders will make policy based on those intelligence reports. But since there are functions and posts held by both the power holders and the intelligence agencies at the same time, the results of the intelligence reports can be used to create power. So Sutopo welcomes the plans for restructuring ABRI's intelligence bodies. "That's the way it should have been," he said. The head of BIA will not be the commanding general of ABRI as well. The number of directorates will also be reduced from eight to five (see diagram). The change in structure will not make BIA's scope of operations very different from those of BAIS. The scope of operations, put simply, can still be formulated as an agency which estimates threats within a strategic range which might endanger the state, especially those connected with domestic and foreign social, political, economic, and cultural problems. At the same time, ASINTEL, structurally below ABRI's KASUM, will deal with matters directly connected with ABRI's operational tactics and strategies. In other words, whatever its name and position within an organization, "intelligence remains ABRI's eyes and ears". So who will be the first head of BIA? Rumors are that it will be Major General Arie Sudewo, the present deputy head of BAIS. In fact, rumors are that he will also hold the position of ASINTEL KASUM of ABRI. These changes will invite attention. Some people are pleased and some are still taking a "wait-and-see" attitude. Some people connect these changes with the government's response to society's demands for a lower approach to security. And some people connect them with government efforts to present a democratic image. As retired Brig. Gen. Soedibjo, former defense attache in Moscow and now on the staff of the Indonesian Strategic Studies Agency, said, "Such tight control, supported by a complex organization, might no longer be necessary." For example, the problem of the recent flare-up of demonstrations. As long as those demonstrations are not aimed at overthrowing the government or replacing the constitution, "Let the police handle it; you don't need the intelligence agencies. People don't feel restrained any more." However, there are some who are not completely sure that these changes have any great importance for Indonesian political life. Changing the structure of BAIS into BIA is like "changing your hat." The objective is the same. Whether it is more of a "tight fit" or a "loose fit" depends completely on who is using those "eyes and ears." Or, as Tanter said, at first glance BIA will play less of a role than BAIS. "Maybe there will be a change in operational style and method. But I'm not convinced that its influence and power will diminish," he said. But he would still like to know who the head of BIA and its five directors will be, and what their influence on and relations with the commanding general of ABRI and the president will be, which are certainly much further away.
