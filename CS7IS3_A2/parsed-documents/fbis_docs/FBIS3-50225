FBIS3-50225 "dreeu017__a94036" FBIS-EEU-94-017-A Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia SNS To Support HZDS Privatization Proposal AU2401201094 Prague CTK in English 1344 GMT 24 Jan 94 AU2401201094 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Jan 24 (CTK) -- The Slovak National Party (SNS) parliamentary group will back a government bill on large privatization in a form submitted by the ruling Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slovak Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar said today. Unlike the government bill, an opposition proposal by the Democratic Left Party (SDL) provides for separation of the post of privatization minister and that of chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM) presidium, now being taken by Meciar. It also seeks the separation of the posts of finance minister and chairman of the FNM supervising council, now being occupied by Julius Toth. After today's SNS-HZDS talks, Meciar said that from the economic viewpoint it is right that constitutional representatives be linked with the FNM. SNS honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes said that it is impossible that one person take decisions and the other bear responsibility for the results of privatization. If the opposition submits a proposal to recall Minister of Transport and Telecommunications Roman Hofbauer, the HZDS and part of the SNS deputies will reject it, Meciar said. The attempt to dismiss Hofbauer is caused by his insensitive approach to the removal of bilingual (Slovak and Hungarian) road signs of villages in southern Slovakia (where the majority of the 560,000-strong Hungarian minority reside) and his interference in broadcasts of the Radio Station Free Europe on the Slovak territory. Out of a total of 150 deputies in the National Council of the Slovak Republic (parliament), 66 seats are occupied by the HZDS, 28 by the opposition SDL and 14 by the coalition SNS.
