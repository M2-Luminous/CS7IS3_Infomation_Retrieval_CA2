Menem said: "Argentina must struggle tirelessly to have those responsible for these aberrant acts severely punished." Menem was referring to the preliminary conclusions of the British police -- Scotland Yard -- based on the accusations made by former Corporal Vincent Bramley regarding abuses and crimes committed by the British after the Mount Longdon battle in 1982. Another investigation, similar to the British, the conclusions of which are being zealously guarded, was also carried out in Buenos Aires two years after the first accusation made by the former British corporal. In a news conference Menem said, however, that "this circumstance will not change in the least the policy we implemented regarding relations with Great Britain." Although some officials labeled the comments as a "political declaration," that is, for domestic use rather than aimed at the British, the president's comments that Argentina must "struggle tirelessly to have those responsible for these aberrant acts severely punished" put the foreign and defense ministries --for different reasons -- in a difficult situation. Just over two months ago in The Hague, in response to a British reporter from the DAILY NEWS, Menem said: "At this stage of events it would be useful to bury that past once and for all." For diplomats, the president's change of position involves a delicate situation in the even more delicate relations with the United Kingdom which is under the so-called "umbrella" protection. A Foreign Ministry source explained to CLARIN the steps to be taken from now on: On one side, wait for the final result of the Scotland Yard report which has already been sent to public prosecutor Barbara Mills who should make a decision next April, and on the other, wait for the British reaction to Menem's comments. The concern in the Defense Ministry was different. On 7 February, after CLARIN carried an exclusive publication of the content of Scotland Yard's report, Defense Minister Oscar Camilion held a meeting with the commanders of the three branches of the Armed Forces. In the meeting a decision was made that the final report of the Argentine commission which carried out an investigation questioning former soldiers be submitted to Armed Forces Auditor General Brigadier Eugenio Miari "to make a decision on the appropriate legal procedures" and to turn it over to the Foreign Ministry to decide "on the appropriate actions to be taken." This is like a merry-go-round. The Foreign Ministry says it does not know the content of the Scotland Yard report despite the fact that its conclusions have been known for 10 days. In the Defense Ministry, depending on who is consulted, it is said that the final Argentine report is not ready or that it is already in the hands of the Armed Forces auditor general. A source who read the Argentine report said "it is absolutely inconsistent" and that the accusations "cannot be proven or denied." Being more sincere, a high official admitted to CLARIN that the conclusions of the Argentine report will be held until the details of the British report are known.
