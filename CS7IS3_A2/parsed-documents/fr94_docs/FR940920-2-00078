FR940920-2-00078 FR940920-2-00035 Interventions which should be evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing firearm injuries are listed below: •firearm design modifications to reduce the lethality of firearms and ammunition, loading indicators, and safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge; •statutory interventions (e.g., prohibiting carrying firearms in public, increasing sentences for felony gun use, or owner liability for firearm injury); •imposing waiting periods and limits on the number of guns which can be purchased within a specified time period; •taxing firearm and/or ammunition purchases; •increased gun dealer fees and restrictions; •metal detectors in schools; •firearm licensure system (e.g., restricting youth access to firearms, owner-registration regulations, etc.); •storage containers which limit unauthorized access to weapons and ammunition; •disrupting illegal gun markets through localized street-level tactics currently used against illegal drug markets, and neighborhood-oriented police coordination with residents and community-based organizations; •public education campaigns to change weapon storage practices. Examples of interpersonal youth violence interventions which deserve further evaluation include: •mentoring programs which provide positive adult role models for high-risk youth; •public information campaigns which dramatize the unacceptability and enormous social and economic cost of violence, while promoting alternatives to violence as a means of conflict resolution; •environmental changes such as improved lighting, protective landscaping, or closed-circuit television monitoring; •legal sanctions restricting youth access to alcohol; •job training and work experiences; •sports and recreational activities which offer young people opportunities to spend time in a structured and purposeful environment; •parent training to increase parental support for non-violent behavior by youths. (2) Identifying modifiable risk factors: In epidemiology, there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions against the four types of violence highlighted in this announcement. Examples of potentially modifiable risk factors which should be examined for each area are listed below: Youth Suicide •impact of acute exposure to alcohol and chronic alcohol abuse on suicidal behavior among youth; •possible relationship between sexual orientation and suicidal behavior among youth; •impact of accessibility to lethal means (e.g., guns, medications) upon youth suicide; •relationship between a history of physical and/or sexual abuse and suicidal behavior among youth; Firearm Injuries •risk of firearm injury vs. the protective value of firearms; •motives and sources of gun acquisition by adolescents; •role of firearms in protecting people from injuries; Interpersonal Youth Violence •role of social and economic factors (e.g., unemployment, poverty, family dysfunction, and racism) in contributing to violent behavior; •early childhood experiences of violence, as a victim or witness, related to later development of violent behavior patterns; •link between television and media portrayals of violence and the development of attitudes which lead to violent behavior as an acceptable method of settling conflict; •influence of alcohol or other drug use upon victimization and perpetration of violent behavior;
