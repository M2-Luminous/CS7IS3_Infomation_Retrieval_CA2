By the end of last year the number of nongovernmental cultural and art troupes in Beijing exceeded 20. The nongovernmental troupes are run by diverse entities, ranging from state industrial enterprises, institutions, collective troupes and individual actors and actresses. Such cultural and art troupes, staffed by 30 to 60 people each, specialize in different art forms, such as music, dance, opera and folk arts. Three of the major enterprises that manage cultural and art troupes of their own are the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, Beijing Yanshan Petrochemicals Corporation and Beijing International Art and Literature, a culture and art-oriented enterprise. Such enterprise-run cultural and art troupes, known for their flexible management system, have appeal for graduates of art schools as well as noted actors and actresses such as Hu Xiaoqin, Yang Jiuhong and Zhang Zhenfu. The new types of cultural and art troupes, by exercising self-autonomy, have cut to the minimum red tape and rigidity in management, which plague government-run cultural and art troupes. Meanwhile there has emerged a surge of marriages between enterprises and cultural and art troupes, the two parties sharing equally profits and losses. An official from the local culture bureau said that that the public-run cultural and art troupes have ended the state monopoly in this sphere and will help enrich the cultural life of the capital, as the practice better taps the initiative and creativeness of the public. But he also said that the overall artistic level of the nongovernmental cultural and art troupes is still inferior to that of those run by the government.
