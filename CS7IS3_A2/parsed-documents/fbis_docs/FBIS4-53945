Miyazawa states in the document, which was submitted in response to questioning by prosecutors, that Shin Kanemaru, former vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), told him in February 1992 that some in the party were opposed to the filing of a bid-rigging allegation against the Saitama Doyo-Kai Association of contractors by the Fair Trade Commission [FTC]. Nakamura was arrested in March and later indicted on a charge of accepting a bribe from one of the nation's top contractors, Kajima Corp., in January 1992 in exchange for helping to block a criminal allegation by the FTC. Kajima was the then leader of the 66-member Saitama Contractor Association. Miyazawa also stated he met with Setsuo Umezawa, then chairman of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), immediately after he met with Kanemaru, they said. Miyazawa was quoted as saying that although he remembered he had talked with Umezawa about the intraparty objection to the criminal accusation, he did not have a clear memory of whether or not he told Umezawa he learned of the objection from Kanemaru. Nakamura allegedly urged Umezawa not to file the criminal accusation with prosecutors against the group over its illegal price fixing. Miyazawa also said in the document that he told Umezawa that the FTC should deal with the case of Saitama Doyo-Kai on its own, since the FTC had jurisdiction over the matter, the sources said. The FTC announced in may 1992 it would not file an accusation with public prosecutors, and instead ordered the 66 companies to stop bid rigging.
