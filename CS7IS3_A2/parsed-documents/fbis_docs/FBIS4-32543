Of these, only the law on presidential elections has been passed. Reviewing the government's performance on the electoral law in an article published in NOVA MAKEDONIJA on 12 and 13 April, Lazar Lubacevski commented that the current draft is almost identical to the one the same government introduced in July 1993 with the same injunction: This needs to be adopted immediately! When the government encountered opposition to its draft, Lubacevski observed, it withdrew the bill from the agenda and remained silent for eight months. According to Lubacevski, the government should have opened The discussion with the participation of citizens' forums and the extraparliamentary parties, and then scheduled a debate on the law in September. However, one part of the governing coalition, Lubacevski said without elaborating, did not like "the expansion of the system because it would interfere with the existing monopolistic situation." In order to leave the existing 120 majority-vote districts intact, Lubacevski continued, the government decided not to change the constitutionally mandated 20 seats chosen by proportional representation. The government should have proposed, according to Lubacevski, a combination of 40-percent proportional representation seats and 60-percent majority vote. This would have led to the creation of 100 new districts and solved the problem of very uneven distribution of registered voters in each district. According to Lubacevski, this figure varies from 6,000 to 17,000 and is one of the chief problems among the coalition partners. Skopje weekly PULS commentator Aleksandar Comovski, in a feature published on 29 April, noted that the party of the Albanian population, the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), wants a 50-50 split between proportional represention and majority-vote seats. Comovski calculated that, even with the additional proportional representation seats, the PDP would probably not get more than one-third of the 140 seats. Further, he advised, the PDP should consider carefully whether proportional representation might have negative consequences for the PDP, such as heightening the danger of ethnic confrontation.
