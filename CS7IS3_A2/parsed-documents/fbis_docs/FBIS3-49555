FBIS3-49555 "dreeu008_h_94008" FBIS-EEU-94-008 Document Type:Daily Report 12 Jan 1994 HUNGARY _o_Societal Impact of Unemployment 94P20200A 94P20200A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The 30 December Budapest daily MAGYAR HIRLAP reported that the National Federation of Associations of Job Seekers and Unemployed (MAEOSZ) believes that the unemployment problem is growing despite National Labor Affairs Center (OMK) figures that show the opposite. According to the paper, MAEOSZ executive president Zoltan Zenkovics and associate president Jozsef Simon said in interviews that while OMK data claiming a steady drop in unemployment from 700,000 in February to 635,000 in November are technically correct, they "do not reflect societal developments realistically." Since last spring the "official classification criteria used by the labor affairs centers have changed," the officials asserted. In any case, they said, in 1993 the overall situation of the unemployed "continued to deteriorate" because unemployment benefits have been reduced from two years to one and the actual value of benefits has eroded. "It has therefore become impossible to halt impoverishment, and even on the governmental level they admit that half a million people will never again be able to return to the work force." Long-term unemployment also has an impact on the family, creating "a spiral that may go downward with frightening speed." While unemployment benefits have have helped some people get a new start, in counties such as Nograd, Somogy, and Zala most of the unemployed find themselves "without any options," the officials said. Zenkovics and Simon charged that government agencies have failed to cooperate with MAEOSZ's efforts to improve the employment situation. MAEOSZ and the Ministry of Labor worked out a "cooperation plan" but MAEOSZ "waited in vain" for an actual agreement from that ministry, while the Ministry of Public Welfare "did not respond at all" to MAEOSZ's requests. In the officials' view, as long as they took "a tolerant stance" they could not get the government to "consider them a partner in working out a clearly conceived employment policy." Therefore, according to MAGYAR HIRLAP, the officials expect that MAEOSZ will be "forced" to "resort to other--strictly legal--measures." First it will have lawyers examine the parts of the social welfare law that appear to be "unconstitutional," and then it will express its protests through county meetings and hunger strikes.
