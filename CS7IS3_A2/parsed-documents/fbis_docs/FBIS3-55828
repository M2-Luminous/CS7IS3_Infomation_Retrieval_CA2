This is being done within the framework of cooperation between the Russian Federation and the United States in the sphere of the power industry and environmental protection. The program is being funded by the United States in stages beginning with a nonreturnable subsidy of $10 million which will be distributed by the Russian Federation Government between the state and private sectors of the Russian economy to finance the import of equipment, materials, and services. The minimum value of a deal for the acquisition of materials and equipment (the supplier in the United States will be selected on a competitive basis) is $100,000 and the financial resources in question will not be subject to taxation or customs duties. Those components of the state and private sectors in the Russian Federation interested in obtaining such a subsidy must submit their applications to the Russian-American joint council created to oversee the general direction of the program under the auspices of the Russian Federation Government's Commission on Questions of International Humanitarian and Technical Assistance.
