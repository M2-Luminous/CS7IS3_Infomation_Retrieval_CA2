The Defense Committee met for three hours and discussed the defense budget, the Kashmir resolution, Sindh operation, reinstatement of U.S. aid, purchasing important equipment for the army, navy, and the air force, the situation in Afghanistan, and the national defense and security. All the issues discussed in the Defense Committee meeting are very important against the background of the regional and international political situation. However, national defense and an increase in our armed forces are priority issues because of the withdrawal of the resolution on human rights violations in Kashmir that was presented in the UN Human Rights Commission and the Indian reaction to it. The political and geographical situation of the region in which Pakistan is located, especially the Kashmir dispute and the attitude of Indian government about it, does not allow any Pakistani government to even think about taking the risk of reducing our armed forces. Pakistan has always maintained that permanent peace in this region can be established if the Kashmir issue is resolved according to the UN resolutions. After it, bilateral discussions with India can be held to reduce military spending in both countries. However, No Pakistani government can take a step to ignore its national security just because the United States or some other country wants Pakistan to unilaterally sign the NPT or roll back its nuclear program. Neither can such a decision of a superpower be imposed on Pakistan. After assurance by some friendly nations and seeing the stance of some member nations of the Human Rights Commission, Pakistan had postponed the resolution on human rights violation in occupied Kashmir by India. However, the Indian government reacted to it by refusing permission to Pakistani and Libyan ambassadors to visit occupied Kashmir. It has not permitted Amnesty International to visit occupied Kashmir to investigate the situation there. It even turned down offers by Iran and other countries to help with reconciliation over Kashmir. India announced this in response to the Iranian representative's statement in the United Nations offering to continue work on reconciliation over Kashmir. The Indian attitude shows that it is not willing to give any importance to the UN resolution and give up its customary rigidity over the Kashmir issue. Therefore, Pakistan has no alternative but to decide not to reduce its defense budget or reduce its armed forces. Instead, in the light of bitter experience of the past, Pakistan badly needs to improve its defense capabilities. The U.S. restrictions on weapons aid calls for us to focus on purchasing weapons from other countries and to use all our resources to strengthen our defense. In the light of the situation described above, there is no room for disagreeing with the government's decision. The decision of the Defense Committee reflects the feelings of the people. Since these decisions are related to our national security and independence, it would not be inappropriate to expect the opposition parties to show their agreement with the government despite their political and ideological differences in the greater interests of the nation. These are the kind of affairs that require all national groups to show full cooperation and agreement. It is the duty of the government in this situation to soften its policies in order to get the opposition's cooperation and work with it. Efforts must be made to get the support and cooperation from all political groups. The cooperation of the government and the opposition will guarantee stability within our administration and the government will be able to confront the Indian situation with more confidence.
