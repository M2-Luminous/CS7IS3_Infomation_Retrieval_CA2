Based on statistics, 147.37 million persons were employed at the end of September nationwide, 580,000 more than at the end of the second quarter, but 550,000 fewer than at the end of last year. Comparing previous year levels at the same period, there was a nearly 100,000 person fluctuation between the end last year and the end of September, such a degree of fluctuation not seen in the last ten years. Comparing ownership systems, we see that urban collective units lost quite a few workers, while the various joint venture units and foreign capital units continued to increase their employee ranks. Comparing industries, industry lost a considerable number of workers, while employment in the construction, health and fitness, and finance and insurance fields rose slightly. Looking at state-owned units, a fair number of permanent employees were cut, while contract employees grew in sizeable numbers. Statistics provided by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce show that at the end of September private and individual employment in urban areas reached 11.5 million, an increase of 800,000 or 4.5 percent over the end of last year. Compared with last year's level at the same period, the increase was 500,000 employees or 5.4 percent. Looking at the different industries, employment growth was sizeable in the commercial and food service industries which accounted for about 70 percent of the total increase. Industry and construction employment, however, grew minimally, accounting for only about 30 percent of the total growth. Comparing regions, employment growth in the four provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Sichuan was significant, with each recording over 50,000 new employees, while employment growth in the three municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin was minimal, with each having less than 10,000 newly employed workers. According to Ministry of Labor statistics, at the end of September, the urban unemployment number stood at 3.78 million persons, or at a rate of 2.4 percent. This is 0.1 percent higher than the level at the end of last year. It is estimated that the unemployment rate will rise to around 2.6 percent by the end of this year. Overall, the current urban unemployment situation is not growing significantly. Yet, in certain areas the unemployment rate continues to grow. This is especially true with respect to the aged, the young, border areas, and certain areas of the defense industry, mining, and the forestry industry where regional economic growth has been slow and workers have not departed in significant numbers. Generally, with respect to these areas, unemployment stands at over three percent, with some areas experiencing upwards of ten percent unemployment.
