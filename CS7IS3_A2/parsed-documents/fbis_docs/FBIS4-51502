During these meetings, Saudi Arabia expressed strong dissatisfaction with the fact Japan completely canceled the 1 trillion yen joint-venture project to transport crude oil to Japan for refining last year, and urged resumption of negotiations. Nazir said: "Japan should allow Saudi Arabia to participate in subsidiary sectors of the oil business, such as refining, in Japan. We are greatly disappointed with Japan's withdrawal." Foreign Minister Saud, a member of the royal family, also touched on the withdrawal from the project, and said: "It is disappointing because we expected much from this project." The project involves a joint venture of three Japanese companies--Nippon Oil Co. Ltd., Nikko Kyoseki Company (presently Japan Energy Company), and Arabian Oil Co. Ltd.--and their Saudi Arabian counterpart to build oil refineries in Japan to refine Saudi Arabian crude oil and sell the finished products in Japan. However, Japan judged this project was not profitable and informed Saudi Arabia of its decision to cancel in November last year.
