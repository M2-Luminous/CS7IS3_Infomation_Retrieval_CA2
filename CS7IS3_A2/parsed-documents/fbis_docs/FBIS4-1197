He told a rally attended by 200 supporters at Brits it now made more sense to reach for the gunpowder than head for the ballot booth. "We don't want war, but we are not white colonists who will be driven from the country," Mr Terreblanche said. He dismissed the pact for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] which Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen was to sign on Saturday as worthless because it did not guarantee a volkstaat. Gen Viljoen had become a "Brutus" to his own nation, and had become a part of the "sick" political system in South Africa. "While the rest of the AWB movement are dug in in the Western Transvaal, we say we do not have an agreement with the African National Congress which states South Africa should be a unitary state." The area from the Northern Transvaal to the Cape border was being prepared as a base for rightwingers. Many had already moved into the area, and many thousands were still on their way, Mr Terreblanche said. Rightwingers would be able to live in this area where the "gangsters" from the new government would not be able to touch them. The hour had arrived for members of the security forces to make a decision on their allegiance, and whether they wanted to become "traitors" who fired on women and children of their own nation. Mr Terreblanche knew white security force officers were preparing plans to act against rightwingers. "If you touch one rightwinger we will donner [hammer] you...," he said, the rest of the sentence being inaudible by the applause. While the AWB had been ordered to withdraw from Mmabatho, it would never withdraw from the Western Transvaal, Mr Terreblanche said. "If anybody will have to withdraw, it will be the forces they want to send in against us." He warned that if the AWB was forced into a fight, it would fight for the whole South Africa, and then decide where it would place blacks. Mr Terreblanche said a chaotic situation would arise in South Africa within days or weeks, and then the AWB would restore law and order and take over the country. "Chaos and order is at the door. You are not heading for peace and prosperity. You are on your way to chaos. We don't want war, but we are not white colonists who will be driven from the country." The enemy would be levelled with the gravel, Mr Terreblanche said.
