[He Zhukang] The "outlines for China's educational reform and development" promulgated by the party Central Committee and the State Council is a very important document, and it represents an important measure adopted by the party and state to accelerate the modernization drive overall. Comprehensive implementation of the "outlines" is a major task for our party committees and governments at all levels. The provincial party committee and government have attached great importance to implementation of the "outlines" and the "law on teachers" and adopted the following three major measures. First, we explicitly defined the strategy of "developing Jilin with science, technology, and education" at the sixth provincial party congress held in April 1993 and regarded education as a strategic priority. Because enthusiasm alone is not enough for our endeavor to build a developed border province near the sea, we need the necessary conditions and ability to accomplish this endeavor and, more fundamentally, an overall education level that is compatible with it. The endeavor of building a developed border province near the sea itself includes developing education and relying on education. Manpower resources equipped with modern scientific knowledge constitute the foundation for us to achieve economic prosperity, and various forms of education are the means to strengthen this foundation. After the party congress, six leaders of the provincial party committee have gone to schools of higher learning and relevant departments to conduct investigation and study and hear opinions on how to develop Jilin with science, technology, and education. The provincial party committee holds that to implement the strategy of "developing Jilin with science, technology, and education," we should respect knowledge and trained personnel and give full play to the role of intellectuals. Therefore, the provincial party committee and government decided to issue special allowances to the 15 academicians and one foreign academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and 21 advisers to doctoral candidates who were working in Jilin. Such an act was the first of its kind in the country. Second, the provincial government held a working conference at an opportune time in May 1993 on raising education funds through various channels and on improving teaching facilities. It studied ways to correctly handle the relations between reducing peasants' burdens and developing rural education. While resolutely carrying out central guidelines on reducing peasants' burdens, we persistently raised education funds from various channels and formulated 10 special policy measures for raising education funds, thus maintaining the healthy development of rural education. Third, to comprehensively implement the "outlines," the provincial party committee and government held a provincial education work conference to study and define the "several opinions of the Jilin Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government concerning implementation of the 'outlines for China's educational reform and development'" (consisting of 30 articles in six parts). I spoke on four issues at that conference, and pertinent leading comrades of the provincial party committee also attended and gave speeches. These measures have effectively promoted Jilin's educational reform and development. [Yu Shui] What practical work have the provincial party committee and government done for education since the promulgation of the "outlines for China's educational reform and development?" [He Zhukang] We have firmly focused on increasing educational investment and improving the status and material benefits of teachers when doing practical work for education. At last year's provincial education work conference, I said: "Shortage of funds will be a long-term problem, and the key is how to use funds and make the limited funds play a still greater role," and "we should firmly establish such a guiding idea that we must promote education even if we have to do so by cutting expenses in other fields, and we should be determined to achieve success in education, a major undertaking that concerns future generations." What I said has become the common understanding in the province, and party committees and governments at all levels have adopted every means to increase educational investment despite strained financial resources. --The provincial government strived to increase the budgeted educational funds, which showed a 20.9 percent increase in 1993 as compared with 1992. --The provincial government decided to establish two special funds for establishing key schools of higher learning and key disciplines in the province and for making the nine-year compulsory education universal. --The provincial government formulated a package of policies on raising education funds from various channels, which, when successfully implemented, will enable Jilin to increase its educational investment by 500 million yuan every year. We increased the 2-percent urban education surcharge to 3 percent, making the total surcharge increase by 27 percent over the preceding year; we extended fund raising in cities, and 58.3 percent more funds were collected when compared with the preceding year; we collected from hotel guests an education surcharge to be used in developing education; fees for shops, environmental benefits, pollution, and land transfer were exempted, and fees for supporting urban facilities were reduced or postponed with government approval when building colleges and primary and middle schools and building houses for school administrative staff and teachers to lower the construction cost by over 100 yuan per square meter, which was equivalent to making an investment of 100 million yuan in the whole year; a part of the fines and confiscated funds from industrial and commercial units was set aisde for educational development; tuitions and fees for noncompulsory education and compulsory education were adjusted to increase by 30 percent over the preceding year; tax breaks were continued for the industries developed by schools of various categories to make the net income from the industries developed by primary and middle schools and secondary specialized schools in the province reach 300 million yuan, ranking the per capita income of students first in the country. --We supported relevant schools of higher learning to cooperate and recommended the cooperated universities to first enter the state's "211 project." --In view of the current price rises, we allocated special living expense allowance to the particularly difficult students of colleges and universities. To improve the status and material benefits of teachers, we have done the following: --The provincial party committee and government decided in June 1993 to issue government special allowance to a small number of high-grade intellectuals beginning 1 July and equally treated the high-grade intellectuals of the units under ministries and those under the province. Academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were given 1,000 yuan each per month, and advisers to doctoral candidates were given 300 yuan. --Last year, we selected 108 special-grade primary and middle school teachers and 33 outstanding school masters who enjoyed the benefit of special-grade primary and middle school teachers (80 yuan of allowance per person every month). --We accelerated construction of houses for the administrative staff and teachers of urban colleges and universities as well as primary and middle schools. Thanks to the preferential policies formulated by the provincial party committee and government, housing construction for the administrative staff and teachers of the colleges and universities as well as primary and middle schools in the province made new headway. New houses totaling 321,000 square meters were built for the teachers of the schools of higher learning under the province; and 349,000 square meters of new houses were built for primary and middle school teachers to make the per capita living space 6.8 square meters. --We strived to improve the material benefits of the teachers supported by local people. The provincial party committee and government demanded that the wage of such teachers, which includes unified township allocation and state subsidies, not be lower than two-thirds of that of the teachers paid by the government. In the past three years, 5,400 outstanding teachers supported by local people became the teachers supported by the government after appraisal. [Yu Shui] What issues should we emphasize in our current efforts to implement the "outlines for China's educational reform and development?" [He Zhukang] In my opinion, we should emphasize three issues when studying, publicizing, and implementing the "outlines for China's educational reform and development" at present and for some time to come. First, our understanding should be in place. When implementing the "outlines," we should understand not only the strategic position of education but, more importantly, the new issues and new conditions we encounter in accelerating educational reform and development. Guided by the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, the "outlines" summarized the experiences in educational reform and development gained in the past four decades and more, especially since the third plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, analyzed the situation in education work, and put forward the targets, strategies, guiding principles, and many important policy measures for China's educational development for the 1990's and even the early 21st century. The "outlines" are a programmatic document guiding China's educational reform and development. It should be said that party committees and governments at all levels in the province have attached great importance to the study and implementation of the "outlines" over the past year. Propaganda and education departments of the province held training for county, city, and district heads in charge of education and carried out mass study and mass discussion on the education front, thus promoting Jilin's education work to a new height. Judging from the situation in the entire province, however, progress in the study and publicity of the "outlines" varied from place to place. The education front did a better job, but as far as the entire society was concerned, study, publicity, and implementation of the "outlines" remained a long-term task. We are carrying out socialist modernization in a country with a large population, relatively insufficient resources, and a rather backward economy. To attain the grand target of modernization and further liberate and develop productive forces, we should develop education on a priority basis, raise the quality of laborers, and turn the heavy burden of population into an advantage in personnel resources. Therefore, an urgent task for the entire party, entire society, and all the people is to study well and conscientiously implement the "outlines." We should include the study of the "outlines" in the political study of party committees, governments, enterprises, and institutions so that every citizen will know and understand the "outlines." Second, investment should be in place. To develop education on a priority basis means to increase educational investment on a priority basis. All undertakings need to be developed, but our financial resources are limited. This is a contradiction, which exists not only today but will also exist for a very long time to come. We should not wait until economy is developed to develop education. Otherwise, developing the economy will also become very difficult. Therefore, governments at all levels, despite their limited financial resources, should strive to have education funds increase at a higher rate than the "increase rates of the two other fields." Educational development is also an undertaking of the masses. We should mobilize the masses to continue donations for education, raise funds for developing schools, expand financial resources, and collect education funds from various channels. Through the efforts of all fields, we should ensure an increase in education funds every year and tackle the fund shortage as much as possible. Third, our work should be in place. Education is the foundation for the undertakings of vital and lasting importance. Now that we have the "outlines" and the blueprint, the key is for leaders at all levels to meticulously organize their implementation. As far as governments are concerned, they should earnestly do more work and practical work for educational development. There are many difficulties in developing education, which cannot be resolved by teachers, schools, and even education departments alone. Government help is required. For instance, they should organize and coordinate efforts to address the issues on the preferential policies on developing education, on improvement of teaching facilities, improvement of the social status and material benefits of teachers, and the favorable conditions for the social practices of college, middle school, and primary school students. Not only should the leaders in charge of education take care of this matter, but also other leading cadres should render help so that all comrades are assigned the tasks and responsibilities for doing practical work in education. The tasks to implement the "outlines" are still heavier for the vast number of education workers on the education front. When studying the "outlines," education workers should further correct their ideas for education and for running schools, persist in the comprehensive moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic development, put moral development particularly in the first place in school work, and train the necessary qualified personnel in the socialist modernization drive. We should extensively educate students with modern history, contemporary history, national situation, patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation. Currently, we should attach importance to and intensify vocational and technical education, provide vocational courses for middle school students, and ensure that students learn some skills before employment. We should improve the quality and efficiency of education in an all-round manner, continuously upgrade the quality of teachers, deepen the reform of education and teaching, and comprehensively implement the party's education policies to turn the next generation we are training into the builders and successors who will carry on our causes into the 21st century. This is where China's hope lies.
