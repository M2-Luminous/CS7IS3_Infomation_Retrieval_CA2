It is a holding operation, designed to get the government through the forthcoming round of local elections, by-elections, and contests for seats in the European Parliament. The camouflage is transparent. The paper intimates, as might be expected, that defence is important. At the same time it affirms that cost savings are being sought in response to the budget cuts announced in November. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has put on record his understanding that, if economies greater than those asked for are found, the cash released may be diverted to the front line forces. Savings in excess of the 2.3 billion pounds agreed with the Treasury may therefore be anticipated. Much of what may be expected is already evident. Civilians, who are cheaper to employ, may be used for back-room tasks. Stock holding, and the storage of spares, may be almost entirely privatised. Overall levels of support staff may be cut. There may be fewer senior officers, following a management downsizing equivalent to that undertaken in non-military enterprises. Expensive institutions, such as Royal Navy and RAF [Royal Air Force] staff colleges, may be closed. The courses could be transferred to an army facility. The Royal Navy have recommended that the base at Rosyth in Fife be shut. Most of the items in the above list are of the sort that governments prefer to avoid when the are about to face the electorate. Job losses and redundancies are never popular. Defenders of Rosyth are already much agitated. The Labour leader, Mr John Smith, has begun to taunt the government for its "piecemeal cuts." He is hitting home. There is little stomach in the Conservative part for further reductions in defence spending. In consequence, nothing specific will be announced until July, when the voting is over. Overriding Fault The white paper's overriding fault, however, is that it is more likely to set off a debate about candle-ends than a fundamental reappraisal of Britain's defence policy. Accountancy has its place. Yet it is deep thinking that is required. Mr Smith has called for a full defence review. Serb expansionism has engendered a less dovish mood than is traditional on the Labour benches. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, confessed on Monday that he had been wrong to advocate sweeping defence cuts after the Berlin wall came down. "It is now clear that we shall see not peace in Europe, but vicious conflicts of a type which we thought we had banished half a century ago," he said. Confusion Reigns Whether or not Mr Ashdown is right, Europe should certainly prepare itself against the day when it must maintain its own stability. In its present mood the United States can no longer be regarded as the Atlantic community's policeman. President Bush saw the conflict in former Yugoslavia as primarily Europe's business, which it is. President Clinton, a reluctant ally, has resolutely refused to commit U.S. ground forces while the fighting continues. The United States remains attached to NATO, but the depth of its commitment may not remain constant. On the eastern side of the Atlantic, confusion reigns. Britain plans to reduce defence spending to around 3 per cent of gross national product in the late 1990s, as against 5.3 per cent a decade ago. Most European countries, France excepted, plan to spend below Britain's projected level. In the absence of a clear pan-European foreign policy framework no one can tell whether these amounts are sufficient. The necessary framework cannot be constructed while Germany remains uncertain about its future defence role, or while France deludes itself that it can behave as a great power, or while Britain distances itself from the continent. In short, there is no cohesion of European thought or action, and little underlying agreement on the future presence in Europe of U.S. forces. A proper white paper would set out the foreign policy options and the defence decisions that flow from them. The starting point would be to focus British eyes on both NATO and the European Union. That is more important than the defence of Tory seats in a borough council or two.
