He was taken away at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) by three police officers, Tong said, adding that Wei had telephoned later in the afternoon to tell her to cancel all his appointments for the next two days. According to Tong, Wei gave no indication as to why he had been picked up or when he would be released. During a meeting in Beijing with U.S. Undersecretary of State John Shattuck last Sunday, Wei had called on the U.S. Government to take a tough stand with China over human rights. Wei, 43, was released from prison on September 14, six months before the end of a 15-year sentence handed down in 1978 for counter-revolutionary activities. Wei played a leading role in the 1978 Democracy Wall movement when he called for full democracy in China and denounced senior leader Deng Xiaoping as a despot.
