[Briceno] OCI Director Guillermo Alvarez Bajares has provided the information but declined to comment on the reasons that prompted Batista to resign, as contained in a letter addressed to President Rafael Caldera. Alvarez has said the president will not appoint a new minister for this portfolio, and he dismissed the possibility that Batista's resignation reflects a serious crisis within the economic cabinet. He contradicted himself in this regard when he said there were differences of opinion with the former head of the Reform of the National Economy Ministry. [Begin Alvarez recording] It is clear, and you have cited the fact on many occasions, certain differences within the economic cabinet emerged some weeks ago; this is something one cannot hide. As I said at the beginning, we have sought to help in this way to make the president and the economic cabinet demonstrate to the country a coherence greater than the one they have been exhibiting thus far. This conflicts with the differences that have caused some damage to the image of the country in terms of image and opinion. [end recording]
