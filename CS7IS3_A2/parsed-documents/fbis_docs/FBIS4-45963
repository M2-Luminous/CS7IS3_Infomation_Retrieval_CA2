Proceeding from common interest in maintaining and consolidating international peace and security, says the document, the governments of both countries are ready to jointly counteract the proliferation of the missile equipment and technologies which could contribute to the elaboration of acquisition of the missile systems for delivering mass annihilation weapons. The memorandum envisages a package of measures aimed at strict control over the proliferation of missile technologies, the carrying out of joint inspections and consultations in this field, exchange of relevant data in case missile equipment and technologies are transferred. Meanwhile, the memorandum emphasizes that the regime of control over the missile technologies rules out the creation of obstacles in the way of creating Ukraine's national space program or its cooperation with other missile and space states in this sphere. By signing this document the United States of America, as a matter of fact, recognized Ukraine's just interests in preserving and further promoting scientific, technological and production capacity of Ukraine in the missile and space field. This agreement also means that Ukraine is recognized as an equal participant in international cooperation and a subject of the world aerospace market. The second important result of the work done by the Ukrainian delegation, led by Valeriy Shmarov, in the U.S. capital was the adoption of a joint statement in which the governments of both countries reaffirm their loyalty to building relations of partnership, mutual trust and respect, and further developing new relations in the cause of security and defense. Recognizing Ukraine's positive contribution to the cause of nuclear disarmament, the specific steps toward deactivating missile installations in Ukraine and the implementation of the trilateral statement as a whole, the Government of the United States of America, in response, announced that after 30 May this year the U.S. strategic missiles will no longer be targeted at Ukraine. This document also emphasizes that as from this date the U.S. missiles will not be targeted at the territories of other countries, which will testify to the lessening of nuclear threat in the world as a whole. Speaking at the signing ceremony in the White House, U.S. Vice President Al Gore underlined that by its actions in many fields over the year Ukraine has proved that it is a reliable and responsible partner. The adoption and signing of these important Ukrainian-American documents is yet another concrete step toward fulfilling the program of a broad development of bilateral relations signed by the presidents of Ukraine and the USA Leonid Kravchuk and Bill Clinton. An agreement was achieved on further contacts between both sides. On behalf of the president and the government of our state Valeriy Shmarov invited the U.S. Vice President to visit Ukraine at a time convenient to him. The invitation was accepted with gratitude.
