He informed representatives of the mass media of the results of his negotiations with U.S. President Bill Clinton. In Washington, they signed a joint declaration on strengthening friendship and partnership between Ukraine and the U.S., as well as a convention to eliminate double taxation and a number of other important documents. Our president declared that they will open new, broad opportunities for business partnership and cooperation. It is very important for the young country that during the negotiations Bill Clinton affirmed American support for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Yet, euphoria from declarations and mutual congratulations appears to be on the wane. A sober assessment of the package of agreements from the point of view of Ukraine's interests comes to the fore, especially of those among them which concern security, economic stabilization and market reform. This was confirmed by the presidential press conference, which attracted a record number of correspondents. Leonid Kravchuk had to make use of all of his political and diplomatic talents to come up with answers to a flood of questions from journalists. As expected, at the center of attention was concrete financial assistance from the U.S. The Ukrainian president returned from his visit with a suitcase full of assurances and promises. The Americans once again showed that they appreciate concessions. Once the tripartite declaration had been signed in Moscow, the promised $300 million assistance for disarmament, as though by magic, instantly doubled. It became $700 million. One half of that sum will be earmarked for nuclear disarmament, while the other half for the implementation of market reform. Today, this sum means nothing, of course. It is only a drop in a bucket. Moreover, will these promised funds be forthcoming? The Americans, as before, managed to give away their cake and to hold on to it at the same time. They put many conditions on their $700 million. Ukraine must first firmly embark on the path to reform, which has become quite problematic given political instability and renewed activity by pro-communist forces. Another condition is that the money will be disbursed if nuclear weapons are removed from the territory of Ukraine. On this issue, it appears that there will be no impediments. Leonid Kravchuk and his team gradually surrender positions on defense under pressure from Moscow and Washington. Today, our northern neighbor is effectively in sole possession of the Black Sea fleet and is trying to turn Sevastopol into a Russian city. It is hard to comprehend why a great European power would surrender unilaterally its nuclear weapons, which give it solid protection, in exchange for nothing but sweet promises. Perhaps we really do not need those thousands of warheads. A protective barrier could have been provided by one or two dozen rockets. Naturally, a space-travelling nation could have found funds for their upkeep as well as first-class specialists to take care of rocket launching facilities. Incidentally, if it possessed nuclear weapons Ukraine would not need to maintain a large standing army which is currently bleeding our budget white. There is another amazing thing: why are nuclear weapons being removed from Ukraine in such haste? President Kravchuk proudly informed journalists that the first train transporting 60 warhead already crossed our border. "Has a single train transporting nuclear fuel for our nuclear power plants crossed the border from Russia, as provided for by the tripartite declaration?" asked one correspondent. "Not yet," replied the president. This, according to him, requires more time. It is a pity that Leonid Kravchuk has already forgotten how he rushed to transfer tactical weapons to Russia, and has looked for promised compensation ever since. These political games are being played at a time when Russian nationalists are playing their Crimea card and carry out a rabid anti-Ukrainian campaign, and when Russia declared that it will stop supplying natural gas to Ukraine. Slyly and easily, the two super powers, having joined forces, effectively put us on our knees and now dictate the rules of the game. From President Kravchuk's responses, I could not figure out by what physical mechanism American assistance be transferred to Ukraine. There is concern that it could flow into the pockets of organized criminal structures. Indeed, a large portion of humanitarian aid has disappeared. For instance, there are growing rumors that a large portion of the money promised by Clinton will be used to buy soy beans from the U.S. Leonid Kravchuk dismissed this as gossip. In its previous issue, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA asked Mr. Miller, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, to explain to our readers the system and timing for the transfer of the promised dollars to Ukraine. For two years, the U.S. has been promising us financial assistance. But, in reality, it turns out as in a Ukrainian folk saying: "The lord promised me a warm coat, but his word is warmer."
