FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Billy R.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the West Virginia Department of Highways (WVDOH), will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the construction of the Elkins Bypass in Randolph County. The proposed project limits extend from U.S. Route 33 in the vicinity of Aggregates Eastward to the vicinity of the four-lane section of U.S. Route 33 near Canfield (approximate project length, 9.1730 kilometers or 5.7 miles). The proposed highway project is considered necessary to adequately provide for a safe and efficient transportation system to serve the existing and future transportation needs of the area and to alleviate traffic congestion within the city of Elkins. Alternatives under consideration will include, but are not limited to (1) taking no action, (2) where possible, widening the existing two-lane highway to four-lanes, and (3) constructing a four-lane, partially controlled access highway on new location. Additional alternatives may be evaluated based upon the results of the preliminary environmental and engineering studies and the public and agency involvement process. Incorporated into and studied with the various build alternatives will be design variations of grade and alignment. Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate federal, state and local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed, or are known to have, interest in this proposal. A scoping meeting was scheduled for September 15, 1994, at the West Virginia Department of Transportation, Division of Highways Office in Charleston, West Virginia. Public meetings and a public hearing will be held. Public notice will be given of the times and places for the meetings and hearing. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issue identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning the proposed action should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided.
