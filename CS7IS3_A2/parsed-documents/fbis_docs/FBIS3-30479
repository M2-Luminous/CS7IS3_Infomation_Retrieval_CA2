Good evening, Mr Granic. [Granic] Good evening. [Correspondent] Thank you for granting us this interview, I know that you are very busy. First of all, could you tell me what is Italy's stand on sanctions against Croatia? [Granic] Italy is concerned about the news on the presence of Croatian forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it was also with great understanding that they accepted my explanations that these are only volunteers, and only up to 2,000 of them, and that there is a much larger number of volunteers from Islamic countries than Croatian volunteers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Also, I explained that Croatia had no intention of initiating a military intervention, and that it suggested that all Bosnia-Herzegovina borders be supervised. [Correspondent] Alright. You had this to say about the presence of volunteers. You therefore stick to your statement that there are up to 2,000 volunteers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Can you comment on Butros Ghali's letter to the Security Council this evening in which he states that there are 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers of the regular Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Granic] They call the volunteers: elements of the Croatian forces -- and that is the only difference. Concerning the figure of 3,000 to 5,000, they have received it from various sources, although not everyone agrees with these figures, including NATO. [Correspondent] In addition to the sanctions, did you discuss with [Italian Foreign Minister] Mr. Andreatta what could happen at the EU meeting in Brussels on 7 and 8 February? Was there any talk of a new plan by the three members [of the EU]? [Granic] The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will certainly be discussed at the meeting, but no discussion about sanctions has been envisaged. Likewise, a presidential communique is expected in the Security Council as well as a certain warning to Croatia, but no proposal of sanctions. Concerning the EU and the discussion they will have, an offer is expected from the EU for more efforts to be invested in organizing a meeting between the Croatian and Muslim sides, and an offer that representatives of the three important EU countries -- Great Britain, France, and Germany -- in addition to the United States, will be present at the meeting. [Correspondent] However, it must be admitted that it is unlikely that any progress in that respect will be made, seeing that [Bosnian Foreign Minister] Mr. Ljubijankic's statement was made public this morning, and he is still insisting on the sanctions. [Granic] You see, Mr. Ljubijankic is usually the one who voices the toughest statements of the Bosnian leadership. We believe, and we have had confirmation that there will be a meeting between the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim sides early next week. [Correspondent] Talking about the improvement in relations between Muslims and Croats, will you perhaps mention some facts from the field. Namely, it is well known that Croats and Muslims are still fighting the Serbs together in some parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example in Usora and Posavina. [Granic] The basic aim of Croatia's policy is to stop all clashes between Croats and Muslims, without any preconditions, and also to establish a permanent peace, and not only peace, but also permanent cooperation, because that is in the strategic interest of both Croat and Muslim nations. [Correspondent] OK. Thank you for now. Tell us just at the end what is awaiting you in Rome tomorrow. [Granic] Tomorrow, I will have a meeting, that is, a reception with the Holy Father, and then with the state secretary, Cardinal Sodano, and the Vatican foreign minister, (Torano). [Correspondent] Mr. Granic, thank you, and I wish you a successful day tomorrow. [Granic] Thank you very much.
