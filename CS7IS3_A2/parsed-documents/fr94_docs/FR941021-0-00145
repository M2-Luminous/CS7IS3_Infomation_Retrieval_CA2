FR941021-0-00145 FR941021-0-00021 Collection of Information This rule contains collection-of-information requirements. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), and OMB has approved them. The section numbers are §§155.750 (Contents of transfer procedures) and 156.150 (Declaration of inspection), and the corresponding OMB approval numbers are 2115&hyph;0120 and 2115&hyph;0506. Section 156.120 is being amended to reflect this new collection of information requirements. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. One comment requested that State and municipalities be allowed to adopt stricter requirements than these Federal regulations. Because tank vessels move between U.S. ports in the national marketplace and between U.S. and foreign ports in the international marketplace, standards for overfill devices should be of national scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variations. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not necessary. An Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact are available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. The EA discusses the action, subsequent expected environmental impacts, and overall need for the action. These regulations are not expected to result in a significant impact on the quality of the human environment because overfills tend to result in relatively small spills. Therefore, the Coast Guard has issued a Finding of No Significant Impact which was placed in the docket for the rulemaking.
