Provincial party Secretary Li Changchun; Vice Governor Fan Qinchen, member of the provincial party committee standing committee; and Vice Governor Yu Jiahua; as well as responsible comrades of the relevant departments directly under provincial authorities; worked together to make an in-depth analysis of the difficulties facing coal industry, and ways to overcome these difficulties and to turn the corner. Li Changchun pointed out that the basic solution to coal industry lies in emancipating our minds, changing our ideass, deepening the reform, and establishing the socialist market economy system as early as possible. Coal was one of the industries that followed the planned economy system rigidly. It also is one of those industries facing great difficulties in its transition to the socialist market economy system. Therefore, it is necessary for us to emancipate our minds as early as possible, change our ideas, and study well the theory of the socialist market economy by combining theory with practice to accelerate the pace of reform. [passage omitted including indistinct portion] Li Changchun stressed: At present, we must do well the work of stabilizing enterprises that face difficulties. Enterprise party organizations at all levels must truly play their key role, and communist party members must play their vanguard and exemplary role to unite with and guide workers and staff members to deepen reforms, and overcome difficulties. They must pay attention to solving practical problems for the masses. They must show consideration for workers and staff members who have difficulties. Some workers and staff members may have complaints about certain problems; for the moment, however, these problems cannot be solved under the present conditions. We must talk to them patiently so as to bring them around. Li Changchun urged relevant quarters to show concern for and support the coal industry. Local governments at all levels must bring diversified operations of coal industry into their plans, and actively support them. Li Changchun hoped that the coal industry, after exerting its efforts for several years, would succeed in putting an end to the passive state of affairs, take on a benign cycle, and become an important new force for invigorating Henan.
