Brill: "All's Well Between India and U.S."] [Text] Pick up a newspaper these days and it is hard to avoid the impression that Indo-U.S. relations are at a low ebb. In this age of instant communications, even minor events can be blown out of proportion overnight, over-interpreted and attributed far greater importance than they can possibly deserve. But despite some of the recent headlines and commentary, Indo-U.S. relations are on a sounder and more substantial footing than they have been in decades. I believe this reflects the new importance each country attaches to the relationship. The relations are broad and complex, running the gamut from education, technology and trade to help to build a post-cold war world that reflects our shared democratic values. Most of the work in the context goes on quietly, away from the media spotlight, carried out by men and women in government, the private sector, voluntary and professional organisations and educational institutions. Their daily activities weave the fabric of the relationship and, in the process, linkages are developed, common interests identified and problems (new and old) are tackled. Bilateral Agenda India and the United States have a more complicated and ambitious bilateral agenda than ever before, a result of the opportunity the changes in the post-cold war world provide for our countries to expand and strengthen relations. This agenda demands two things of us: the vision to recognise and build upon those areas where our economic and political interests converge, and the willingness to engage in the hard work of reducing the differences in those areas where we disagree. From economic reform to environmental protection, from non-proliferation to peace-keeping, the United States and India have identified areas of constructive engagement and have begun substantive dialogue at a variety of official and unofficial levels. To what, then, can one attribute the gap between the reality of our relationship and the public perception? To a great extent, I attribute it to the turbulent times in which we live. Political change is occurring at a dizzying pace, and it is forcing every nation--including, let me stress, the United States--to reconsider long-held assumptions and re-examine old relationships. Always difficult, this process is further complicated when it involves the world's two largest democracies, with a shared tradition of vigorous, unfettered public debate. Both our political systems accommodate a wide range of views. Opposition politicians criticise government policies freely; advocacy groups, lobbyists and private voluntary organisations all work strenuously to gain public support for their positions. These are healthy manifestations of our democratic systems. Justifiably Proud More often than not, this debate takes place in our media. Both the United States and India are justifiably proud of a free press, which serves a vital role informing public debate. But the nature of the business is that conflict makes news. As a result, most of us are more familiar with the well-publicised differences--real or imagined--between our two nations than the positive developments taking place away from the media spotlight. Let me cite a few examples of positive developments in the relationship: The United States is actively and materially supporting India's economic-reform programme. Ours is the largest market for India's exports: we buy 20 per cent of what India sells abroad. We also are the largest foreign investor in India. Last year, new U.S. investment represented over 42 per cent of the more than $2 billion total approved by the government of India. Every dollar of this investment is a vote of confidence in India's future. The Unites States is India's largest technology partner. Thirty-six years ago, Indian and American scientists began working together in areas such as medicine, agriculture and the environment. Today, this programme is the largest of its kind in the world, and has created a substantial body of scholarship and a tradition of collaborative effort that many nations strive to emulate. In addition, through licensing and joint-venture arrangements, the United States is the largest source of foreign commercial technology for Indian industry. Indo-U.S. military co-operation has grown in recent years. Our armed forces have worked together on U.N. peace-keeping missions in Cambodia and Somalia. In addition, our military ties have expanded to include joint steering groups, joint exercises, training programmes and staff exchanges. Our law-enforcement agencies work closely combating the threat posed by international terrorism and narcotics trafficking. At present, we are in the process of negotiating a new Indo-U.S. extradition treaty that will enhance the judicial process in both countries, enabling us to better confront these threats to global security. Better Measure Even in areas where we differ, we have been able to expand our shared agenda. Despite differences on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, for example, we agree on other aspects of non-proliferation--the comprehensive test-ban treaty, and the fissile fuel cut-off. In addition, our two governments worked closely in the final stages of the chemical weapons convention. These developments are a better measure of the quality of Indo-U.S. relations today and their promising future than the headlines trumpeting our differences. Differences are inevitable when nations engage each other seriously on complex issues. Rather than be dismayed, we should be encouraged by the evolution taking place from the carefully-circumscribed dialogue of the past to the constructive engagement that characterises our relationship at present. No doubt, our open political systems will generate a certain amount of surface turbulence between us. The challenge our two countries face is to remain focused on what is important: the steady advance towards more mature, productive and collaborative relations. Both sides have made a good start in this direction, and I can affirm the United States Government looks forward to continuing to work in this spirit with the government and people of India now and in the years ahead.
