Fedorov, deputy of the State Duma and chief of the subcommittee for the credit and monetary policy of the Central Bank of Russia, by N. Zhelnorova, under the rubric "After the Scandal"; place and date not given: "Who Stole Our Wages?"] [Text] Former Minister of Finance of Russia B. Fedorov answered questions put by N. Zhelnorova. Currently, B. Fedorov is a deputy of the State Duma and chief of the subcommittee for the credit and monetary policy of the Central Bank of Russia. [Zhelnorova] Boris Grigoryevich, many people cannot stand the sight of you because you deliberately delayed the payment of wages in order to ensure an "artificial" reduction in inflation. [Fedorov] This is a lie, an attempt to cover up their inability to manage the economy. The government made decisions to spend funds that were not envisioned in the budget and, consequently, were illegal. Most decisions were made contrary to the Ministry of Finance. [Zhelnorova] Why was it happening? [Fedorov] Because our bosses on high believed that it was enough to write on a piece of paper "the Ministry of Finance shall procure" in order for it to definitely "procure" the funds. In no country can an official spend even $100 as he sees fit. Everybody knows from his everyday life that he must live within his means. If you have 100 rubles [R] in your wallet, you may spend more only if you obtain credit. Meanwhile, trillions of rubles are spent in our country without detailed calculations. The government believes that it may spend as much as it wants, and since nobody will extend normal credit to it, it will simply print more money. However, plucking more money out of thin air does not mean that more goods have appeared. If A. Zaveryukha's wife begins to spend money based, in a way, on twice the amount of his salary, he will soon remind her that he has only one salary, after all. However, he acts in the exact opposite way as far as the country is concerned. We pursued our financial policy in 1993 based on the target of credit outlays that had been approved by the government. However, it was also exceeded by a great deal. Enormous unexpected expenditures arose--for the elections and the referendum, repairing the White House, and so on. [Zhelnorova] You have come down hard on your opponents (or adversaries) because they want to extend credit to the agrarian sector. However, it was indeed not fair: to promise the peasants to pay for grain, and later not to pay, just like petty swindlers. [Fedorov] Believe me, nowhere in the world does the state procure grain! Our rural "barons" first pushed through an enormous state order for grain without regard for the financial potential of the state (in July 1993, under pressure from Zaveryukha and Starodubtsev, our prime minister approved the procurement price for grain at the world level, although there was no money). Later, the "barons" began to demand that the "debts" be paid back. Hence the busting of the budget and the ridiculous position of both the prime minister and the minister of finance. However, the "agricultural barons" are now demanding state orders for 1994 once again! Wages in sectors financed from the budget are indexed similarly. Indexation announcements are always backdated, although it is patently clear that there is no money and a delay of one to three months is a virtual certainty. So, a pay rate agreement with the coal miners has just been signed. The absurdity of such agreements has been discussed many times. Wages are not paid; subsidies are illegally spent for purposes other than those envisioned. To cover up mismanagement, the bosses are now forced to print additional money, thus stimulating inflation. Ultimately we will pay for such irresponsibility out of our own pockets. Financial discipline, which means living within our means, as well as responsibility and control--this is the reform we need more than anything. [Zhelnorova] Do you sympathize with the prime minister, who has given up a strong minister of finance? [Fedorov] Chernomyrdin's current task is to play into the hands of the Agrarians and the Communists, to squeeze "youngsters" out of the government, and to begin doing everything his way. However, he does not understand that the economy cannot be made to work by administrative methods. Indeed, I agree that Chernomyrdin and his new team are good managers, but within the framework of a large enterprise. But Russia is not a Gazprom. In this instance, one must know about and understand the connection between the exchange rate, inflation, and the growth of production. [Zhelnorova] Some people from your team maintain that everything in Russia will explode three months from now. [Fedorov] I think it will not be three months but rather six. There are economic laws that are impossible to circumvent. However, I do not intend to foretell a collapse; this is pointless, all the more so because we do not yet know what kind of policy there will be. For now I do not consider myself in opposition to the government. It is another matter to have apprehensions (90 percent) about the government opting for another path which is worse for Russia. Of course, if we analyze the composition of the government, there are few genuine reformers there, except for Chubays (and then it is not clear how long he will hold on). Shokhin is a turncoat, a person who likes sitting down with the prime minister for hours. He will make it to the position of minister of defense. I brought in Dubinin, who has now been appointed acting minister of finance. However, I am not sure whether he can stand up to the wave of pressure being brought to bear on him. (My uniqueness was found in the fact that I could tell anyone to "get lost," while some people, such as Lobov, could not get through to me on the phone at all. I was not inclined to allow the compromises which Gaydar continuously allowed to occur.) [Zhelnorova] Once again, your departure was associated with a scandal. How did it happen--viewing the event from the inside? [Fedorov] When Chernomyrdin saw through our subterfuge and ruses associated with conducting financial stabilization (the Ministry of Finance alone fought everybody), I understood that the time for compromises was over, that is, they would cross the critical line after which you lose respect for yourself. This is why I decided to quit. I do not want to be a commander without an army. Having become accustomed to my quite extensive role in the financial policy pursued, I could not allow someone to order finances about while Fedorov was alive (as minister). [Zhelnorova] What would you advise the president to do? What are your "three cards?" [Fedorov] First: Always adhere to the same course. Second: Put together a homogeneous government. Third: Think about succession of power.
