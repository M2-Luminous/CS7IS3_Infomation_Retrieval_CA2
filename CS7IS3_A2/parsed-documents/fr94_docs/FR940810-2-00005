FR940810-2-00005 FR940810-2-00003 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paragraph (a)(i) of additional U.S. note 3 to chapter 17 of the HTS (``additional U.S. note 3'') authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (``the Secretary'') to establish the total amount of sugars, syrups, and molasses that may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, under subheadings 1701.11.01, 1701.12.01, 1701.91.21, 1701.99.01, 1702.90.31, 1806.10.41, and 2106.90.11 of the HTS, during such period as shall be established by the Secretary. The Secretary must determine such total amount as will give due consideration to the interests in the U.S. sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (``GATT''). Such total amount consists of (1) a base quota amount, (2) a quota adjustment amount, and (3) an amount reserved for the importation of specialty sugars as defined by the Untied States Trade Representative. The base quota amount is allocated by the United States Trade Representative to the supplying countries and areas listed in paragraph (b)(i) of additional U.S. note 3. Paragraph (a)(ii) of additional U.S. note 3 authorizes the Secretary to modify any quantitative limitations (including the time periods for which such limitations are applicable) which have previously been established under paragraph (a)(i), if the Secretary determines that such modification is appropriate to give due consideration to the interests in the U.S. sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the GATT. Paragraph (iv) of additional U.S. note 3 also provides that sugar entering the United States during a quota period may be charged to the previous quota period with the written approval of the Secretary. This notice will constitute such written approval. On May 11, 1993, the Secretary of Agriculture established the current quota period of October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 and a total quota amount of 2,268,000 metric tons, raw value. (58 FR 28545). This quota period now is being shortened by two months, but any allocation of the current quota amount that has not been filled will be allowed to be entered during the next quota period and charged back to the previous quota period. In addition, this notice establishes a new 14-month quota period from August 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995, with a total quota amount of 1,322,978 metric tons. Notice Notice is hereby given that I have determined, in accordance with additional U.S. note 3, that the current tariff-rate quota period is changed from the period October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 to the period October 1, 1992 through July 31, 1994. Any amounts previously allocated to any country for the quota period October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 that have not been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, by July 31, 1994 and that are subsequently entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption will be charged to the quota period October 1, 1992 through July 31, 1994. I have further determined, in accordance with additional U.S. note 3, that the total amount of sugars, syrups, and molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.01, 1701.12.01, 1701.91.21, 1701.99.01, 1702.90.31, 1806.10.41, and 2106.90.11 of the HTS which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the tariff-rate quota period from August 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995 is 1,322,978 metric tons, raw value. Of the 1,322,978 metric tons, raw value, the base quota amount shall consist of 1,320,712 metric tons (including 84,680 metric tons for minimum quota allocations); 1,656 metric tons, raw value, are reserved for specialty sugars as defined by the United States Trade Representative, and 610 metric tons, raw value, are reserved as a quota adjustment amount. These amounts will be allocated to supplying countries and areas by the United States Trade Representative. I have also determined that this modification of the previous quota period and the establishment of the new quota period and quota amount give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Signed at Washington, DC, on August 4, 1994. Mike Espy, Secretary of Agriculture. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19567 Filed 8&hyph;8&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;10&hyph;M
