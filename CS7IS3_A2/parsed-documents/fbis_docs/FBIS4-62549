Grachev told this to journalists today after his meeting with the leaders of the military departments of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. "I am ready to answer any question so that nobody has any doubts about anything after this meeting," Pavel Grachev stated. As far as the Partnership for Peace program is concerned, Pavel Grachev and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will hold another telephone conversation on this at 1915 this evening. The Russian minister said that he does not intend to submit an alternative to the Partnership for Peace program in Brussels, rather its Russian version. "We are nontheless still a superpower," Pavel Grachev stated, "and it is not quite right to put us on the same level as other states, we have to be reckoned with. We should have our own view of partnership."
