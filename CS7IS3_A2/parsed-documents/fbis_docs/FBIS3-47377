In the meeting, the puppet traitor explained the so-called supreme goal of national administration and raved that he will continue pursuing change and reform in the future, that he will work in a fair and square manner, and so forth. Traitor Kim Yong-sam also asked for their active cooperation. Expressing sympathy with this, traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u said that they will not spare active cooperation and support and that traitor Kim Yong-sam's broad-mindedness will contribute to new political culture, thus praising him. This illustrates that the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam has not parted from dictators of the Fifth and Sixth Republics but has become the same gang member. This is unbearable mockery and challenge to the South Korean people who demand liquidation of the Fifth and Sixth Republics' dictatorship and realization of social democracy. As is known to all, the South Korean people, only if they hear the names of traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, become tense with indignation against intolerable crimes of massacre and fascist repressive maneuvers they committed against fellow countrymen. Traitor Kim Yong-sam's meeting with Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u military hooligans, who are notorious as peerlessly atrocious murderers and fascist tyrants, itself evoked surging indignation of the South Korean people. The puppet traitor's criminal act again proved that the reform drive he has been loudly talking about is a cunning trick to deceive the South Korean people. To carry out reform in South Korea, one should, above all, eradicate dictators together with the military fascist rule, and should abolish fascist evil laws including the National Security Law, a remnant of the military fascist rule, as well as repressive organizations including the Agency for National Security Planning. Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam further strengthened them, instead of abolishing them, and bestially oppressed the people's just struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification by wielding fascist evil laws and mobilizing repressive forces. Not satisfied with supporting and protecting the Fifth and Sixth Republic dictators, traitor Kim Yong-sam met with the rascals and asked for their cooperation, thus acting rashly. A South Korean broadcast reported that during the meeting between Kim Yong-sam, No Tae-u, and Chon Tu-hwan, heart-to-heart dialogue and jokes were exchanged between them. The fact shows that puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam came into collusion as one with the Fifth and Sixth Republic dictators, instead of parting from them, and again implemented the full-scale military fascist terrorist rule in South Korea under cooperation of former dictators from long ago. Feeling very grateful to puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u went so far as to talk about his broad- mindedness. The filthy behavior of the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam who fondly talked with Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, objects of the South Korean people's indignation and hatred, can be done by only a peerless political prostitute and expert betrayer, and it can never be tolerable. The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam said as if he had worked for something appreciable for the past 10 months and said he would work in a clean and dignified manner in the future, too. This is also a shameless deceit. What the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam has done for the past 10 months was nothing more than treachery and selling the county. It is traitor Kim Yong-sam that has pursued the North-South confrontation and war, not the fatherland's reunification that all fellow countrymen earnestly desire. It is also traitor Kim Yong-sam that cut off the life line of the six million South Korean farmers and South Korean agriculture and has pushed its overall economy into a catastrophic crisis by opening the rice market, which even preceding dictators could not dare to open. Traitor Kim Yong-sam has been frenzied to bring a nuclear calamity to the nation, cruelly infringed upon the South Korean people's right to live, far from protecting their freedom and right to democracy, and pushed them into the greatest misery. It was a nonsense that he said as if he had worked for something and said he would work in a clean manner in the future. Just like we cannot expect charity from a wolf, there is nothing to expect from traitor Kim Yong-sam who makes it his business to sell the country and the nation. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is dashing into treachery harder and harder as days go by. Realities show that the South Korean people cannot avoid their misfortune and tragedy but be driven to face a worse slavish destiny of a colony as long as they leave traitor Kim Yong-sam as he is. The South Korean people will definitely deal a hard blow to traitor Kim Yong-sam who is trying to dash into a road of crueler fascist oppression in collusion with former dictators. Traitor Kim Yong-sam should clearly be aware that the superficially attractive pretense of civilian government and honeyed words can no longer work. He had batter resign his post of power before being given a stern trial by the people.
