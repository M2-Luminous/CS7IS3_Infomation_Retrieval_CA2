"India is determined to forge ahead by enhancing and sustaining the space services overcoming any external pressure that may come in the way. And, the department of space has become, over the years, a dynamic and vibrant organisation, fully capable of making India a major space power by the turn of the century," says the just-released annual report (1993-94) of the department of space. According to the report, the country was on the threshold of achieving self-reliance in the launch vehicle technology. In the process, a strong technical manpower base has been created and a research and development infrastructure built up. The space department's statement assumes significance in view of the recent remarks made by Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in an interview to INDIA TODAY that restrictions imposed by the missile technology control regime (MTCR) will in no way affect the country's space programmes while referring to the nation's missile projects. Dr Kalam, often described as the father of India's rocket programmes and now tipped to take over as the vice chancellor of Madras University, said that the country was 90 per cent self-sufficient in the aerospace field. The space department's report has stated that the close space-industry partnership among the public, private and joint sectors has enabled Indian industry to meet the production demands for space products and services in a timely and cost effective way. Touching on some of the other projects, the report said as of October 1, 1993, a total of 142 telecommunications terminals were operating in the INSAT (Indian National Satellite System) telecommunication network providing 4,056 two-way speech circuits. Over 400 additional earth stations, including 50 for satellite-based rural telegraphy network pilot project in the north-eastern region were now under various stages of implementation in the department of telecommunication's network, the report said. Under the INSAT scheme, 2,000 direct reception sets have been deployed in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat for the benefit of the local community.
