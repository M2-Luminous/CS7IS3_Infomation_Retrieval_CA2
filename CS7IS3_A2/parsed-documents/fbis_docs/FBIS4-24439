On behalf of the State Council, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua told the conference that there are three essential requirements in bringing about rural electrification: policy implementation, self-reliance, and vigorous utilization of rich local resources. He said that the CPC Central Committee and State Council have always been deeply concerned about agriculture, rural areas, and farmers. They are also deeply concerned about the process of rural electrification. He urged electricity and other departments and sectors to cooperate with each other; enlist the support of local governments and people; redouble their efforts in implementing the project of using electricity supplies to alleviate poverty; help the broad masses overcome poverty and achieve prosperity; and make new, solid contributions to a thriving rural economy. It has been learned that China's rural electrification process, which started in the 1960's, has achieved remarkable progress since China started implementing the policy of reform and opening up. By the end of 1993, electricity consumption at the county and lower levels reached 249 billion kwh, or 35 percent of the nation's total; 97 percent of townships, 93 percent of villages, and 89 percent of farmers' households had been provided with electricity, showing an increase of 5.2, 14.9, and 23.7 percent, respectively, over the 1980 levels. Per capita annual electricity consumption for the rural population reached 48 kwh in 1993, 7.9 times the figure for 1978. Nationwide, 144 counties have accomplished rural electrification while plans for rudimentary electrification through the development of hydroelectric power stations are being carried out smoothly in 200 counties. Power stations are being built in the countryside nationwide at different levels and through multiple channels. A structure of rural power sources that include electricity supplies from the major power grids, small hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations, and wind and solar energy is beginning to take shape. However, due to the restraints of a multitude of historical and economic factors and natural conditions, there are still 28 counties, 1,269 towns, and 54,860 villages that have virtually no electricity supply. About 120 million farmers in poverty-stricken areas in a dozen provinces and autonomous regions, mostly in central and western China, are waiting to get electricity. These areas, often sparsely populated and economically undeveloped, are the most difficult to electrify because they are far from major power grids, and the local finances are tight. At the conference, the MPI put forward the "Program for Electrifying China's Countryside in the 1990's." Among its primary targets are supplying electricity to all counties by the year 2000 so that most of the poverty-stricken villages and over 95 percent of farmers' households will have electricity. It also calls for building 1,000 counties with electricity across the country. These targets have been incorporated as key parts of the State Council's plan for helping 80 million people overcome poverty in the next seven years. It has been learned that the MPI's "project of alleviating poverty and bringing about common prosperity through the supply of electricity" has received vigorous support from local governments. The Shandong Provincial Power Bureau, for example, has announced a six-point preferential policy. The Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region worked out a plan of providing power supplies to all villages. Shaanxi Province has announced a plan of electrifying impoverished areas in three steps. The meeting urged local governments and national departments in charge of planning, economics, electricity, and poverty alleviation to work as one and make contributions to providing electricity to farmers' households across the nation.
