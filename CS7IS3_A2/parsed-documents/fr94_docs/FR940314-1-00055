FR940314-1-00055 FR940314-1-00012 VI. Effective Date Because of the shortness of time until the date on which notices must be filed with the agency to claim the new exemptions, FDA is proposing to make these regulations effective on the date of publication of the final rules in the Federal Register . As stated above, FDA tentatively concludes that it has good cause for this action. VII. Comments Interested persons may, on or before May 13, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Because of the shortness of the time until firms must begin filing notice of claimed exemptions with the agency, FDA will not be able to extend the comment period beyond that date. Also, the agency is advising that it may not be able to consider any comments received at the Dockets Management Branch after the close of business on May 13, 1994. VIII.
