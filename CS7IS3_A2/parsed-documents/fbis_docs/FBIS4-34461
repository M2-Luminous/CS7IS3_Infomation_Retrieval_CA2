President Juan Carlos Wasmosy also defended the right to life and stated his opposition to abortion. The report on the president's activities in Cartagena is summarized by SNT [Sistema Nacional de Television] special correspondents Andres Caballero and Pedro Colman. Cartagena implemented extreme security measures to assure security during the summit. Without a doubt, the first appearance of a civilian Paraguayan president at a summit and the change of Fidel Castro's military uniform for civilian clothes were noted by presidents and the press. The international forum mainly discussed matters pertaining to trade and integration as factors for Ibero-American development. Wasmosy talked about Paraguay's need for an outlet to the Pacific Ocean because of the country's landlocked situation. [passage omitted] President Wasmosy discussed the matter with the presidents of Chile, Peru, and Bolivia trying to find a solution. [Begin Ruben Mengarejo, Paraguayan ambassador to the OAS, recording -- in process] ...an outlet to the Pacific Ocean through a road to Antofagasta.

[end recording] [passage omitted] All presidents participating in the summit are staying at the Cartagena Hilton Hotel. There Wasmosy met Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and King Juan Carlos. [Begin recording] [Wasmosy] He [Felipe Gonzalez] will visit Paraguay between August and September. He will visit the Jesuit ruins, our dams, and other areas of the country. We also have agreed to establish a scholarship system for Paraguayan graduate students. We explained to them our project to regulate the Paraguay River's flow near Bahia Negra on the border between Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is a project that seeks to regulate water flow, establish an irrigation system, maintain the ecology of the swampy area in the north, and permit the navigation of the Paraguay River, which also will benefit Argentina and Uruguay. [King Juan Carlos] I visited Paraguay not long ago. I have been talking with my namesake [Juan Carlos Wasmosy], and I hope I will be able to return soon. The president has invited me, and I hope I will be able to include the country on my agenda, which has to be worked out in accordance with the Spanish Government, which decides on my plans. [end recording] Wasmosy also talked with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who was accompanied by his assistants. Gaviria said he will help Paraguay from his position at the OAS. [Begin recording] [Gaviria] Many American countries require cooperation, particularly technical cooperation, and other programs that help the OAS fulfill its mission. [Wasmosy] He knows I have been one of those who worked for his election to the OAS before other presidents. I think Paraguay will have relevant participation in the OAS. [end recording] Wasmosy also met Chilean President Eduardo Frei. The two presidents discussed investments and Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Did President Wasmosy put any conditions on Chile joining Mercosur?

We are studying the possibility of introducing changes into the treaty to permit the entry of Chile and Bolivia, as the president....[end recording] Wasmosy also met Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran Ballen. Duran Ballen confirmed he will visit our country next September. [Begin recording] [Duran Ballen] I want to visit Paraguay after the Rio meeting [reference unknown] in September. [Unidentified reporter] What issues interest you, for instance? [Duran Ballen] We are interested in learning something about cattle raising; Paraguay has had great success in this area and the area of energy. We are all acquainted with the large hydroelectric projects in Paraguay. We want to learn something from that experience. [end recording] Wasmosy also met Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro. The two presidents talked about problems affecting cotton plantations and possible solutions. [passage omitted] Wasmosy talked with Cuban President Fidel Castro on various occasions. He asked Castro not to send instructors in guerrilla tactics to Paraguay any more. According to Wasmosy, Castro answered that he was only helping the Paraguayan people without hurting the Paraguayan Government. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Do you continue to justify his economic isolation despite the suffering of the Cuban people? [Wasmosy] We do not support any blockade. What we have asked him for is an agreement, a proposal -- to give it a name -- permitting an increased opening and more freedom in his country. [end recording] [passage omitted] Various presidents agreed in pointing out that these meetings must produce more concrete results or more immediate resolutions. Otherwise, people will continue thinking that these types of summits are simply social meetings for the heads of state and government.
