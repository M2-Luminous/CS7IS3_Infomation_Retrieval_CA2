If it were, its so-called small party conference would mainly have discussed the party's recent stroke of bad luck, with a number of affairs going on before the beginning of three election campaigns. Most of the CSU party committee members, however, avoided touching on the worrying issue in front of switched-on microphones. And when the subject was mentioned in Deggendorf, much of what was said did not really sound like defense, but more like heart-searching. Landtag Group Chairman Glueck not only accepted that the parties had the role of a "lightning rod," but he also acknowledged the particularly strict standards applied to politicians. Party Chairman Waigel complained that the party of Lafontaine and Stolpe is viewed more tolerantly than the CSU, but he also said that it is "the politicians' task to be examples." The Christian image of man induced Secretary General Huber to the insight: "We have faults and imperfections. We are not angels." Yet, he called upon his party colleagues "not to give in morally to the opposition and the press." Minister-President Stoiber promised "investigations" into the dubious matters, as had been "my highest principle in dealing with these problems" since he took office a year ago. But on the other hand, he admitted, maybe also beating his own breast: "Moral rigor must not be exaggerated." He strongly rejected the SPD's comparing the CSU with the Mafia, because one cannot condemn an entire group because one or the other of its members does something wrong. Also, he warned the CSU not to be tricked by the suggestion to move away from the Strauss traditions in order to be saved. In spite of all human weaknesses, Strauss achieved great things for Bavaria and the CSU, and this course must be continued. Thus, in the upcoming election campaigns, the women and men of the CSU must simply "present themselves as the more competent people." He also warned against another trap. He could have referred to it asking where the desirable rootedness ends and damnable nepotism starts in the relationship between parties and the population. In Deggendorf he mentioned a "businessman from Pfarrkirchen" who had once given the CSU 500 German marks and now has "problems with social regulations," for which he turned to his deputy. The minister-president described for himself and for the audience how the deputy, influenced by the opposition's accusations of nepotism and quagmire, no longer dares "deal with people's problems." But should the deputy really contend himself with referring the businessman to the relevant authorities or to the legal opportunities available so that "no affair can come of it?" Stoiber: "He will say -- why did I vote for you?" The adopting of a manifesto on Europe that describes the CSU's well-known position was almost routine. European Deputy Friedrich described his party colleagues as "realists" that are different from both the "skeptics" and the "euphorics." The CSU showed skepticism in its own way: The "stability criteria" of the Maastricht Treaty must be "strictly" observed, and in the process of unification, "stability comes before speed." The CSU rejects the idea of a European federal state and welcomes the membership of East European countries in the alliance of states. The only debate took place when a delegate wanted to have the demand for a European social union included in the manifesto. His request was not met, with the delegates probably being most impressed with Stoiber's argument that "social benefits in Portugal" must not be paid for with German money.
