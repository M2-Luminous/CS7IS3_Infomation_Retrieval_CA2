FR940912-2-00026 FR940912-2-00023 Morgantown Energy Technology Center Financial Assistance Award to Illinois Institute of Technology; Grant AGENCY: Morgantown Energy Technology Center, U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of acceptance of an unsolicited financial assistance application for Grant award. SUMMARY: Based upon a determination made pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), (D) the DOE, Morgantown Energy Technology Center gives notice of its plans to award an eighteen-month Grant to Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois in the amount of $204,000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: R. Diane Manilla, U. S. Department of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Center, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, WV 26505, Telephone: (304)291&hyph;4086, Grant No. DE&hyph;FG21&hyph;94MC31078. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The participant shall improve molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) power density, particularly under pressurized low-CO 2 conditions. A new direction will be pursued, prompted by unexpected findings in recent experiments at IIT related to cathode dissolution in the MCFC. These findings indicate spalling of nickel and dissolution of spalled nickel or nickel oxide particles during oxidation of nickel foil and wire. Spalling and dissolutions are relevant to understanding the long-term shorting phenomena in MCFC cells or stacks. A third objective is to carry out systematic measurements on the solubility of the major structural alloy components (as oxides) in various compositions of carbonate. Issued: September 6, 1994. Randolph L. Kesling, Acting Director, Acquisition and Assistance Division, Morgantown Energy Technology Center.
