Some of these also represent terms and conditions with respect to the use by borrowers of the proceeds of loans made or guaranteed by REA. Together, these controls include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) Area coverage requirements set forth in the loan contract and in ยง1710.103; (ii) Requirement that certain borrowers maintain, on an ongoing basis, a power requirements study and a power requirements study work plan, as set forth in ยง1710.201 and ยง1710.202;
