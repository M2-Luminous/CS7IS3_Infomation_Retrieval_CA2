Mr Meyer's announcement that the government was prepared to negotiate with the Independent Electoral Commission and the Transitional Executive Council to allow further time for the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front to submit their candidates lists was almost drowned out by right-wingers' chants and singing of the national anthem. Mr Meyer said, however, the two parties should give a clear indication within the next 24 hours on whether they wanted to submit candidates lists. Campus security personnel handcuffed and arrested a number of students after scuffles broke out in the hall. Right-wing students surged forward, yelling "Constand, Constand (Constand Viljoen, chairman of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front])" and heckled Mr Meyer. Mr Meyer said he would not be threatened, and that the university authorities should act against the errant students.
