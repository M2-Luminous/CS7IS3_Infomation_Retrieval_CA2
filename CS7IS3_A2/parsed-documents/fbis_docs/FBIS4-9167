Mihajlovski: "Orthodox Messages to the Americans"] [Text] What was Yuriy Trushin, a representative of the Russian Federation in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], doing at the news conference of the Democratic Christian Party? If his intention was to impose himself on the Macedonian public opinion or send an indirect message to the Americans, whose additional troops have just landed at Skopje airport, then why did he not do it at the news conference of a larger minor party and in the presence of politicians more-or-less heard of by the people? Particularly because, only a day before, the same Russian diplomat held a news conference with yet unclear motives in the Russian offices in Skopje. Trushin was diplomatically silent, while his host, the president of the party, Vasil Ristevski, was explicit: "The arrival of the U.S. soldiers in Macedonia means acceptance of the position of a protectorate!" He also said that Trushin would speak to the Macedonian authority about including Russian soldiers in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops in Macedonia. The journalists got no further information at this news conference except for the profitable knowledge about Macedonia as a protectorate and the Russian soldiers who are going to save our Orthodox religion. Trushin did not say much about Russian-Macedonian relations, because "there were more questions than answers." He does not know when the Russian Embassy will be opened in Skopje, because it was a "technical question." Trushin also does not know if Macedonia is threatened by Serbia "because he has been here for only three months, and accurate facts are needed for that." It is true that he told us that it was necessary to have a border between us and Yugoslavia as with all the other neighbors, because Russia recognized us as a sovereign state and it also advised us to make an agreement with Serbia, because the border is "still administrative, that is of a conditioned character." In order to do it all in the frameworks of the religious name of the party, there were also discussions about the relations between the Russian and the Macedonian Orthodox Church. It was all "in the name of spiritual unification of the Orthodox world." The Russian diplomat confused us on Tuesday when he called us to a news conference where he spoke about Bosnia. Yesterday, he confused us because he was the one to determine the agenda of a news conference of a Macedonian party. If Mr. Trushin thinks that his appearance yesterday is not a kind of interference in the internal political life of Macedonia and if he announced that "all groups and parties that wish to cooperate with us can call us to a news conference," it means that in a few days we can see the Russian diplomat [whose embassy had to be opened at the beginning of March, as Vitaliy Churkin announced during his unexpected visit to Macedonia] at a news conference held by Dragisa Miletic from the Democratic Party of the Serbs, or with a new communist movement collecting signatures against the Americans. Like Vasil Ristevski, they also think that the Americans will make a protectorate out of us, and they want the Russians on the border with Serbia! Here is another question for consideration: How will the Macedonian state react if tomorrow, for instance, the diplomatic representative of Albania holds a news conference within the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] or the party of Taci [PDP faction]?
