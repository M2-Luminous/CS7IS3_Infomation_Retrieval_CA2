However, the citizens of the Polish Republic do not share his view in this matter. In a March poll conducted by the Public Opinion Survey Center [CBOS], they expressed the opinion that the president wields too much rather than too little power. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |How much power does the president have at the moment? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Too little |22| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Too much |36| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |As much as he should have |29| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hard to say |1310006040ercent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The picture emerging from the public response to the poll seems to highlight the president's "political games." Lech Walesa is perceived more as a person entangled in a variety of tactical stratagems than a politician concentrating on solving the state's problems. In its commentary on the poll, the CBOS admits that it is not clear how far the president's identity and personality influence respondents' inclination to accord him a wider range of powers or, conversely, to stipulate that his powers should be restricted. It seems that the office is to a large extent identified with the person. Lech Walesa generates much public emotion, and, as a result, he is easily assessed according to stereotyped categories. Consequently, the CBOS claims, it could be assumed that opinions on the president's place and range of powers are influenced by the fact that we are talking specifically about Lech Walesa as incumbent in that office. It follows from this that it is important to identify the president's goals. The ultimate targets to which the public believes Lech Walesa aspires are as follows: reinforcement of his power, 46 percent; winning the next election for another term of office, 40 percent; weakening his political opponents, 25 percent; attainment of law and order in the country, 24 percent; keeping the "commies" firmly under control, 19 percent; improvement of Poland's position in the world, 16 percent; acceleration of the economic reforms, 13 percent. A lenient attitude toward the president is conducive to greater tolerance in assessing the activities of the Solidarity Independent Trade Union. Acceptance of the work of the Sejm is, as a rule, accompanied by approval of the government's activities. These two options are, to a large extent, mutually exclusive. Those questioned are on the whole more ready to accept the work of the Sejm and the government than that of the president and Solidarity.
