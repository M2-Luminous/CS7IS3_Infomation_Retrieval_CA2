A final statement issued by the political forces dialogue committee on 18 January 1994: Praise be to God with whose blessings good deeds are done, guidance is obtained, and success is achieved. May God's peace be upon the prophet of love, brotherhood, and peace and upon his family, companions, and followers. O patient Yemeni people: The greatness of any people is best seen in times of hardship and their cultural traits do not stand out except when the approach they follow to remedy crises and the methods they use to address and overcome their effects are known. In light of the political crisis the country is experiencing, and when even the most optimistic people were waiting for the moment when the situation would explode, the Yemeni people were wagering on their patience, endurance, and ability to overcome and end the ordeal. After relying on God, the Yemeni people pinned all their hopes on the dialogue going on between their political forces. O great people: The wisdom of your sons who are holding the dialogue was confirmed and the wager of your enemies was defeated. God has granted success to your political forces in the battle of the greater jihad, the jihad of psyches. Reason has had the upper hand in the dialogue, whims were defeated, and everybody reached an agreement in which the devil alone was the loser and the people were the winner. This agreement is in the public interest. Its essence and spirit is the building of a just, democratic society that believes in progress and in which there is no place for injustice, oppression, violence, despotism, monopolies of power and wealth, violations of the constitution and laws, or violations of human rights. The dialogue committee has reached full agreement on a historic document that represents an important juncture in the march of the Yemeni struggle for freedom and progress. This document strongly bolsters a wise Yemeni approach based on rejection of all forms of violence and adoption of dialogue as the only way to settle differences. The Document of Pledge and Agreement covers the overall military, security, and political foundations that allow for the establishment of a modern state with institutions capable of development and of achieving prosperity and addressing the people's concerns and problems. This state is also founded on democracy, the peaceful rotation of power, and the broad participation of the society on the basis of financial and administrative decentralization. O great Yemeni people: Experience has taught us that violence only breeds destruction and that any concession we make at the dialogue table is stronger and greater than any gains made over a heap of bodies and a river of blood. While declaring the points it had reached and which were agreed on by all the political forces taking part in the dialogue, the Political Forces Dialogue Committee thanks all brothers and friends who have shown sympathy toward Yemen's crisis and expressed willingness to cooperate. The dialogue committee also expresses its appreciation for the Yemeni people, who have been observing its steps and who have supported its work through their popular conferences. The dialogue committee urges every Yemeni, who loves his country and cares for his future and the future of his children, to support the committee's decisions and to cooperate to achieve those decisions. Each Yemeni should also bravely side with the well-intentioned forces that uphold justice, right, and public interests. Each Yemeni should firmly oppose -- by adopting all democratic methods -- all forces of evil harboring bad intentions for Yemen. The dialogue committee further urges all the sons of the Yemeni people, civilian and military, to spread a spirit of love, brotherhood, and tolerance. It also urges them to support the agreement it has reached and to reject any attempt to use any method, be it political or military, that aims at undermining or departing from the agreement. While declaring its finalization of this historic document by the second deadline it had announced, the dialogue committee will continue to make preparations for a meeting between political leaders during which the national document shall be baptized. During this meeting agreement will be reached on guarantees to implement the accord and an announcement will be made on the beginning of its implementation and the Yemeni people's transition to a stage of construction and progress under the canopy of love, peace, unity, democracy, a state of law and order, and respect for human rights. We ask God for success and guidance. We also pray to him not to lead us astray after he has given us guidance. [Signed] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee [Dated] 18 January 1994
