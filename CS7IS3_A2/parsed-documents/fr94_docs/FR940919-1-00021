ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (FMP). This rule would change the minimum size limits of certain species, require charter vessels/headboats and dealers to obtain Federal permits, clarify one of the earned income requirements for a vessel permit, restrict the sale/purchase of snapper-grouper species, modify the criteria for determining when a vessel is operating as a headboat, modify the requirements for possessing multi-day bag limits, specify allowable gear, authorize permits for experimental fishing, and modify the management unit for scup. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to correct and clarify certain regulations, or conform them to current standards. The intended effects of this rule are to conserve snapper-grouper species and enhance effective management of the snapper-grouper fishery. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed rule must be sent to Peter J.
