In the eastern part of the country, following the steps taken to combat illegal exports of goods primarily to Tunisia, Algeria's borders are becoming less and less permissive. That fact is having a favorable impact on the local market in the governorates of Tarf, Souk-Ahras, and Tebessa. Those border areas are beginning to find a greater availability of consumer goods thanks to regular supplies. The steps in question have been all the more effective in that the price deregulation affecting those goods, which have long been subsidized by the state, has discouraged supporters of the black market. The most spectacular result is the pronounced drop in the price of red meat, which now ranges from 160 to 200 dinars [DA]. Fraudulent exports of domestic livestock have been markedly curbed, and stockraisers are being forced to send their livestock to the market in their own governorate. To get back to the subject of food products, implementation of the new price policy has discouraged black marketeers in that even the market stalls in the border villages are beginning to show signs of health, the exceptions being certain localities in the Tebessa Governorate where prices have been holding firm in the case of salad oil, Lahda powdered milk, and coffee. The reason, according to the authorities concerned, is the inadequate supply. As part of the same struggle, the Tarf Governorate, which has set up its own ad hoc committee, is continuing to update its commercial registry thanks to the combined efforts of the governorate's commercial departments and the Customs Service. It has also been decided to introduce permits for merchants who buy consumer goods, the purpose being to achieve better control over food products intended for sale exclusively in that governorate. Early results show that those measures are effective. The fight against the black market is also beginning to produce a few favorable results in the western part of the country. The most recent measure, which consists of prohibiting taxi drivers, for instance, from transporting passengers across the border, is already enabling customs officers to keep better control over individuals and has "facilitated their task when it comes to searching baggage," according to one customs inspector, who adds that "the systematic recording by the customs offices of all outgoing receipts makes the inspection of passengers more effective and gives us more control." On 11 May alone, the number of passengers totaled 1,312, and receipts totaling DA393,600 in taxes were recorded. On that same day, a large quantity of products was seized, including white meat, eggs, rice, black pepper, salad oil, insecticide, and so on. For the moment, aware of the difficulty of covering the entire Algerian-Moroccan border, the trade departments backed by the Customs Service are thinking of starting a major cleanup operation involving in particular an updating of the commercial registries. They will also have the task of finding a way to put an end to the trafficking in fuel, which is carried in vehicles equipped with large fuel tanks and then unloaded somewhere along the road on the other side of the border. According to experts, that activity results in substantial profits. As is true on the country's eastern border, food products are again appearing in the market stalls, meaning that there has been a positive effect since the beefing up of border surveillance. Tea, flour, sugar, and semolina are readily available in localities in the Tlemcen Governorate. Even the price of lamb has dropped to DA260, compared to DA300 a few days ago. In Maghria, however, the price of red meat has not dropped, the reason being the regulations governing the trade in livestock.
