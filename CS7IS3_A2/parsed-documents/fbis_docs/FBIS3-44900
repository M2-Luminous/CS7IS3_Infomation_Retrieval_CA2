Though the number of piracy attacks worldwide dropped from 115 in 1992 to 103, there was an increase in reports of government authorised attacks, particularly prevalent by Chinese naval vessels. Eric Ellen, director of the IMB said there was overwhelming evidence that the attacks had been carried out by Chinese naval vessels. "We have photographs of the vessels, photographs of the crews' uniforms, and photographs of the flags being carried." He said that only yesterday he had received notification of two more vessels attacked in the South China Sea. The Hong Kong, Luzon and Hainan triangle was the biggest area of activity according to the report, where a total of 33 attacks were reported last year. However, it remains unclear as to whether the attacks were officially sanctioned, or were being carried out by criminals appropriating the authority of Chinese state organisations. It is believed by the IMB that there may be a link between the piracy and Chinese claims over the Spratly Islands, whose waters are disputed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Nevertheless, the report also stated that incidents in the area had been reduced since August because of greater protection by the Russian authorities of their vessels, which had been the biggest victim of the attacks, with 27 last year.
