FR940725-0-00133 FR940725-0-00019 SESAC examined requirements proposed in the general industry confined space standard §1910.146, to determine to what extent that proposal should address shipyard work and to determine whether or not specific provisions within that proposal were appropriate for application to work in shipyard confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. The committee agreed that a single standard should apply to this work and recommended the addition to Subpart B of several provisions based on proposed §1910.146 so that the shipyard standard would be as comprehensive as its part 1910 counterpart (Tr. 102, 4/25/90). As noted earlier, OSHA reopened the record on the proposed revision of Subpart B to request comments on SESAC's recommendations in this regard, as well as to explore the possible expansion of the scope of Subpart B to all aspects of shipyard work. The issues raised in the notice reopening the record addressed how Subpart B could be revised to make it as protective as the general industry permit space standard. Paragraph (c)(1) of §1910.146 requires employers to evaluate the workplace to determine if any spaces are permit-required confined spaces. Paragraph (c)(6) of that standard requires employers to reevaluate non-permit confined spaces whenever there are changes that might increase the hazards to entrants. The notice reopening the record on Subpart B requested comments on whether or not shipyard employers should similarly evaluate their workplaces. Most commenters agreed that the shipyard standard should not adopt requirements comparable to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(6) of §1910.146 (Ex. 11&hyph;1, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;7, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;22, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;34, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;42, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;47, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;51). They argued that proposed Subpart B was adequate since it already required testing before initial entry of all confined spaces that could contain atmospheric hazards and additional frequent testing to ensure that atmospheric conditions are maintained. A few contended that the shipyard industry treated all confined spaces alike, evaluating them for hazardous conditions before entry (Ex. 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;49). For example, Mr. Joseph J. Ocken (Ex. 11&hyph;31) stated: The present practice is to consider ANY confined space NOT SAFE until currently tested and posted otherwise. This is a simple fail-safe work practice for workers. To expect every space to have been evaluated and posted properly invites simple error to lead to catastrophe. There are too many confined spaces in shipyards to count on 100% perfection at all times. Enclosed spaces can also contain confined space hazards and must be approached with suspicion by workers as well. On the other hand, a few commenters stated that OSHA should adopt requirements similar to those in §1910.146 for evaluating confined spaces (Ex. 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;28, 11&hyph;33, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;38). They believed that evaluating confined spaces for the types and extent of hazards is a useful tool in any confined space program. Con-Space Communications, Ltd. (Ex. 11&hyph;28), argued as follows: Evaluation of a workplace to determine if it contains Confined Spaces is the very first step that an employer must take in a serious company wide entry program. An inventory of Confined Spaces would be a permanent reference which, if updated on each entry, could be a useful planning tool. In the event of a rescue, this information would be invaluable especially if the Confined Space is assigned a number along with a list of potential hazards associated with it and special equipment needed for safe entry. Physical attributes of the space could also be listed. Section 1910.146 places confined spaces into two categories: permit-required confined spaces and non-permit-required confined spaces. The purpose of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(6) of §1910.146 is to ensure that employers have properly identified confined spaces posing hazards to entrants. The large class of confined spaces are determined not to be permit entry spaces, are evaluated only as required in these two paragraphs. Entry into such spaces is essentially performed without reference to the permit entry procedures of §1910.146 (unless the entrants bring a hazard into the space or create one during entry operations). By contrast, Subpart B treats all confined spaces and other spaces that might contain a hazardous atmosphere equally. Initial testing and inspection, followed by continuous ventilation and further testing, is required of all these spaces to ensure the safety of employees working within them. Because of these additional protection which Subpart B requires on a routine bases, OSHA has determined that no separate, formal evaluation requirements need be adopted in Subpart B.
