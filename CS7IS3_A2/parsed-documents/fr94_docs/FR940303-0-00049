FR940303-0-00049 FR940303-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD13&hyph;93&hyph;028] Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Lake Washington, WA AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is reinstating the temporary regulations governing the operation of the Evergreen Point Bridge (State Route 520) across Lake Washington between Seattle and Bellevue, Washington. This rule will be in effect through June 30, 1994. The amended regulations will provide for the reasonable needs of navigation and allow the bridge owner to provide openings only during periods of reduced vehicular traffic if 12 hours notice is furnished. The purpose of this measure is to avoid risking failure of the drawspan in the open position during commuter hours as has previously occurred. The hours of limited operation insure sufficient time for the owner to restore the retractable span to the closed position before road traffic becomes heavy. During the period that this rule is in effect malfunctions of the draw mechanism will be analyzed and repaired. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation becomes effective on April 4, 1994. This temporary final rule is effective through June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John E. Mikesell, Chief, Plans and Programs Section, Aids to Navigation and Waterways Management Branch, (206) 220&hyph;7270). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of these regulations are Austin Pratt, project officer, and Lieutenant Laticia J. Argenti, project attorney. Regulatory History This same regulation was put into effect on September 21, 1992. It has since expired. On November 2, 1993, the Coast Guard published a proposed rule (58 FR 58518) to consider the reinstatement of the temporary regulations. The Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District, also published a public notice on November 19, 1993. Both articles solicited comments from interested parties until December 17, 1993. No objections to the temporary regulations were received. A public hearing was not requested and was not held. Background and Purpose The temporary regulations allow the bridge owner to limit openings for the passage of vessels to late at night. These restricted hours of operation enable the owner to restore the bridge to the closed position in the event of a malfunction prior to the daylight hours of heavy commuter traffic. Openings during the day are excluded. With 12 hours notice, the bridge will be opened from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday night through Friday morning and from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Friday night through Sunday morning. The hours for opening on weeknights are more restricted to give greater time to restore the drawspan in the event of a failure prior to the start of heavy commuter traffic.
