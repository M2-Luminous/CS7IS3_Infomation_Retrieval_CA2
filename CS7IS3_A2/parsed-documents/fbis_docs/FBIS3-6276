During these three days, the two-headed government's invading forces painstakingly carried out an offensive with infantry, artillery, and tanks. Their warplanes bombarded and attacked many areas. 2. All of their troops came from National Route 10. 3. The invading forces were backed by 18 heavy guns and tanks. 4. Their military maneuvers were the same that they employed on the Anlung Veng battlefield; that is, small special units were sent to carry out swift attacks and fool us into pursuing them, while their ground troops and tanks attacked us from behind. Although they had many thousands of ground troops, most of them were new recruits who lacked fighting spirit. 5. Their fighting spirit was low. We attacked and routed many of their columns; after a short battle, they were dispersed. They only showed the might of their artillery and tanks from a distance; they did not dare move them close to the fighting. We were able to attack them from remote areas, and we intercepted them when they moved forward, just as we did at Anlung Veng. 6. They used L-19 warplanes and helicopters to bombard and shoot at us, but they did not dare come closer because they were afraid of losing their aircraft. 7. We are continuing to counterattack and rout the enemy troops in the north and south. 8. Our commanders were together with our troops, who stayed permanently at the frontline. We are now following a strategy of attacking the invading enemy forces with a high sense of responsibility and lively initiative. We are determined to defend our bases and people and thus contribute to defending our nation and people. We are especially determined to annihilate as many of the invading enemy forces as possible. 9. As always, our forces on the front and in the rear are ready to fight with a high spirit to annihilate the invading forces.
