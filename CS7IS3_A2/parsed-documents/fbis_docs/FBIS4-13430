The paper referred to the downing of two American helicopters by two American F-15 jets last Thursday in which 26 American and allied personnel were killed in what had been termed a `friendly fire' disaster in northern Iraq. It commented that had the helicopters been downed by Iraqi aircraft the consequence would have been disastrous and Pentagon would have mobilized allied support and "once again we would have witnessed a display of American military machismo with innocent Iraqi citizens being the target of relentless hellfire of the allied war machine." The article said, "It is only when Americans erroneously kill their compatriots or get killed by the enemy that it becomes an eye-opener for U.S. policy makers to review their rules of engagements in military operations abroad. The rules defining when U.S. forces can attack enemies have now been tightened." After a series of foreign policy and military faux pas, now the world sees a Clinton deflated and the American people demoralized over Washington's foreign policy. Human errors made at the lower levels are a reflection of bigger blunders committed by the top brass, concluded the editorial.
