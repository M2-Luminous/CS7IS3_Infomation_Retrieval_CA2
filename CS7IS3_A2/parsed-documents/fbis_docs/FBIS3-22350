The five companies are to expand a so-called "back to feedstock" process, involving a method developed by BP Chemicals, in which plastic waste mixtures are broken down into oleaginous products. A pilot plant at Grangemouth, Scotland, is already in operation. The plant in Grangemouth has a capacity of 100 kilograms per hour, and around ten million Dutch guilders have been put into the project. In addition to BP and DSM, the participants are the petrochemical concerns Elf-Atochem, Petrofina and Enichem. DSM primarily conducts research into the products resulting from the process. The company has a small naphtha cracker for that purpose. Interest in "back to feedstock" methods (or chemical recycling) has increased enormously in the last few years. One important reason is that recycling of different synthetic mixtures produces quite some problems. Such mixtures can almost only be recycled into lean materials which usually end up as flower pots or roadside poles. The market for such products is small and is nearly saturated. A not yet socially acceptable alternative for materials recycling is the recovery of its energy content by combustion. Smaller Pieces "Back to feedstock" (or chemical recycling) is a third option. The aim of the technique involved is to disintegrate the polymer material into smaller pieces, in some cases even back to the original chemical ingredients. "Back to feedstock" methods are currently being researched all over the world. The process which BP and DSM are examining turns the plastic waste into an oleaginous product, from which low hydrocarbons can be produced through petrochemical techniques. It produces a wax-like product which can be used as a starting material for naphtha crackers. The base material for the BP/DSM process is waste synthetics from household garbage. Before the process can begin, the plastic fragments must be separated from the rest of the household waste. The isolated plastic fragments are then ground into pieces of two centimeter. This granulate is the base material for the cracking process that comes next. The disintegration, in which the original long polymer chains are broken into pieces, takes place in an fluidized bed incinerator, which is partially filled with sand. When a current of hot air is blown in, the actual fluidized bed comes into being. The waste plastic is thermally crushed at a temperature of between 400 and 600 degrees Celsius, and produces a steam mixture of hydrocarbons. Ninety percent of these gases finally condense into a low molecule wax. The remaining 10 percent are used as fuel which meets the energy requirements of the installation. The remains of additives in the original plastic -- such as fillings and pigments -- are left behind in the sand. Hydrochloric acids resulting from the crushing of PVC are removed separately. In general, DSM regards "back to feedstock" techniques as a promising option which, it is true, does not promise a complete solution for the problem of synthetic waste, but which is a valuable partial solution, next to alternative processing methods such as combustion (energy recovery) or material recycling. In 1990 the Netherlands produced 850,000 tonnes of synthetic waste, of which 150,000 was recycled. According to the environmental policy plan, that last quota will have to reach 450,000 tonnes by the turn of the century.
