Mr. Wichit said the policy to allow Vietnamese firms and Thai-Vietnamese joint-venture firms to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] is part of assistance from Thailand for Vietnam to develop its own stock exchange, set to be established next year. The Vietnamese companies seeking listing on the Thai bourse must meet SET and Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, while the investment size of each company must be substantial. He said the policy to open the Thai stock exchange for listing of foreign firms is similar to that in Singapore and Malaysia. "It is not only our intention to help Vietnam develop its own stock market, but it is also our plan to make our bourse a leader in the region," Mr. Wichit said. The first request for Thailand to help Vietnam develop its stock market was made by the Vietnamese Secretary-General of the Communist Party during his official visit to Thailand last year, the central bank governor said. After that, Vietnamese authorities had sent officials to Thailand to hold talks with Thai officials and study the development of the Thai exchange. Mr. Wichit said it is likely that joint-venture firms between Thai and Vietnamese investors would be approved for listing first as their investment sizes would be relatively larger than those fully owned by Vietnamese. As well, their operation systems, particularly their accounting, are in line with SET requirements. At the same time, Mr. Wichit said the Bank of Thailand has permitted Krung Thai Bank and the Export-Import Bank to extend loans through the central bank of Vietnam to support the development of the Vietnamese stock market. The loans will be channeled through the Bangkok International Banking Facilities scheme. The final round of terms and conditions for the loans is scheduled for March 22. Meanwhile, Thai ministers in an official delegation visiting Vietnam say talks with their Vietnamese counterparts on trade, finance and agriculture have produced good prospects for future bilateral cooperation as both sides managed to achieve some promising results. Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsup told more than 50 prominent Thai businessmen that he had discussed with Vietnam's Agriculture Minister possible cooperation and coordination to prevent their becoming competitors in the world rice market, which could affect their rice prices and export revenues. Mr. Chaiyot said the Vietnamese minister had agreed to visit Bangkok next month for further talks with the Thai private sector on possible Thai-Vietnamese cooperation in rice production and marketing. Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri, meanwhile, said he expected decisions to be made on two joint development projects when he leads a delegation to a meeting of finance ministers from six Mekong River Basin countries -- Burma, China, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand -- in Hanoi from March 1922. The projects are the construction of two transnational roads, one from Prachin Buri to Ho Chi Minh City and the other from Mukdahan to Danang via Savannakhet in Laos and Hue In Vietnam. Mr. Trairong said the two are among 26 projects involving road construction and development of air and water transportation links to be sponsored by the Asian Development Bank. A joint development project can materialize if at least three countries agree to work together, he said. On long-running fishery disputes, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said Thailand and Vietnam have agreed to set up a joint committee to restructure joint fishery systems and manage benefits from marine catches. The ministers and the businessmen are accompanying Prime Minister Chuan Likphai on a four-day official visit to Hanoi from March 16-19.
