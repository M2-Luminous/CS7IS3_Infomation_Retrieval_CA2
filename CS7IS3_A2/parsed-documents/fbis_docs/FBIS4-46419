Al-Muntasir: The Lockerbie crisis will be resolved peacefully. There is no alternative. It is difficult to set a date for that now. But we are seeking to achieve it as soon as possible. What remains now is to agree on the foundations for a solution with the Western parties within the framework of some points proposed by the Arab League. I spoke with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid on the sidelines of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] conference and agreed that the seven-member committee should convene after the African summit scheduled to be held in Tunis within days. We will discuss the two resolutions adopted by the NAM and the African conference and ways of implementing them, especially as NAM ministers welcomed Libya's acceptance of Security Council Resolution 731 and stressed the need for the parties concerned to secure a just settlement that safeguards all interests in accordance with international law and the principles of the UN Charter. Furthermore, the international community and its organizations are showing solidarity with us vis-a-vis the negative results caused by the embargo imposed on the country. This is why there is an inclination to urge the Security Council to take account of the Arab League's new proposal. Abu-Husayn: On what basis are the Western parties responding to a peaceful solution with Libya? Al-Muntasir: There is a Western inclination to ignore a peaceful solution with Libya, especially as its moderate policy no longer threatens world security and peace. It is always trying to find a just way out that meets commitment to international laws. Best proof of this is Libya's full withdrawal from the Aozou strip [Chad], even though this is not in Libya's interests. That is, we lost the legal case but preferred to fully respect the court's decision, while we see the major states advocating international legitimacy and yet they refuse to comply with it in numerous cases. [passage omitted] Abu-Husayn: What about the Security Council? Will it take account of this commitment by Libya and thus allow the gradual lifting of the embargo imposed on your country, especially as it allowed UN observers to use planes to travel to the Aozou strip? Al-Muntasir: That step is regarded as a good precedent in the United Nations, and we hope it will be a good gesture and a good start for further steps toward lifting the embargo on Libya. I personally am optimistic in this connection. [passage omitted]
