A new defense minister of Herceg-Bosna was appointed at the first session of the Presidential Council, the body which took over all duties of the president of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Zdenko Vranjes reporting for Croatian radio. [Vranjes] Vladimir Soljic has been appointed new defense minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Former Minister Perica Jukic will remain one of the deputy prime ministers. Zeljko Obradovic has also been appointed new minister for land management and construction. At the session in Mostar the Presidential Council decided to form an expert group to solve the Mostar situation. The group will nominate a team to take part in negotiations within the framework defined by the conclusions drawn up at the session of the Chamber of Deputies in Livno, whereby Mostar is the capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. The Council accepted in principle the UN peace forces' request for their command for the southwestern sector to be stationed in the territory of Herceg-Bosna. Presidential Council President Kresimir Zubak informed Council members about the course of the peace negotiations in Geneva and Frankfurt. Zubak had the following to say on the results of the latest Muslim-Croat agreements on a confederation of the Croat and Muslim parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Republic of Croatia: [Begin Zubak recording] We agreed on several issues. First, we agree that it is possible, and perhaps even desirable for the interests of both peoples, to organize Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of the Croat and Muslim -- that is, Bosniak Muslims -- nations. We agree on that. We agree that we can organize that union, which will meet the rights and interests of both nations. We also agree that the state union should be formed as a composite state union. These are the principles. We analyzed the principles in greater detail, but we have not yet reached accord on certain issues. Therefore, it is too early to speak about these things. But an important step is that both sides have decided that such a union is possible, that it is in the interests of both nations, that it must have a special relationship with the Republic of Croatia, and that the union must be set up so as to respect the national criterion in the internal organization of the state. That means that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be reorganized on the principle that there will be two or more federal units that will be set up by honoring first of all the national criterion as one of the criteria. [end recording] [Vranjes] The command of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] Vitez Brigade today reported that until 0400 last night, the Muslim army had shelled the center of the town of Vitez and all surrounding areas using mortar and howitzer shells of various calibers. The shelling of Vitez by the Muslim army this morning is only the continuation of yesterday's shelling when three civilians were wounded, including a five-year-old girl who luckily sustained only slight wounds. The shelling caused huge material damage to residential and industrial facilities. [passage omitted]
