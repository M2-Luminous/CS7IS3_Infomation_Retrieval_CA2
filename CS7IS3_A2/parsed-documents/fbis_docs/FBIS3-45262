While China yesterday reiterated its opposition to what it called Hong Kong's unilateral move to go ahead with the airport in the absence of approval from Beijing, at least 32 legislators said they would grant sufficient funds to keep the airport project going. The Government yesterday held two separate sessions for lawmakers and the Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) to collect their opinions before making a final decision tomorrow. From the $1.67 billion, $377 million will be given to the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) to continue operating until March. Critical contracts -- for baggage handling, the automated people mover, foundation work for the passenger terminal, and some construction support facilities -- can be awarded in the first quarter of this year to avoid delay. The Government had earlier offered two options to legislators -- to grant $377 million for the PAA, or to approve $1.3 billion for the critical work. The Government is likely to secure support from the 15 Liberal Party legislators, 13 United Democrat legislators, and independents Emily Lau Wai-hing, Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen, Eric Li Ka-cheung and Jimmy McGregor. Only pro-China legislator Philip Wong Yu-hong indicated that he would not support any funding proposal, while Tam Yiu-chung said he preferred the first option. Mr Tam said approving just enough money to extend the PAA head office funding into 1994/95 would better facilitate the resumption of airport talks with China. Following the legislators' expression of support, the Government will ask the Legislative Council's Finance Committee to approve the $1.67 billion proposal on January 21. Liberal Party legislator Howard Young said there was no dissenting voice among them in make a commitment that the new airport could be completed on time without seeking further substantial injections of cash. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, yesterday reiterated Chinese opposition to any unilateral action taken by the British side before striking a deal on the financial arrangements with China. "Before agreement is reached between the two sides, unilateral actions will do no good to the settlement of the financial arrangements," he said. The Secretary for the Treasury, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, rejected the Chinese suggestion that the British side was taking a unilateral move. Asked whether Britain would take Chinese objections into consideration, Mr Tsang said: "We are used to it." During a meeting of the Legco subcommittee on the financing of the airport core programme, legislators pressed the Government to either give an expected date of reaching a deal with China, or to unveil full contingency plans for the airport projects in the absence of Chinese blessing.
