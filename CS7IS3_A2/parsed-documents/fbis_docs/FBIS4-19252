Italy will send 35 soldiers to the town as observers. Speaking over the phone, Doctor Hanan 'Ashrawi, a lecturer at the Palestinian University of Bir-Zeit [as published], known to the general public as the spokesperson for the PLO delegation in the peace negotiations and currently committed to defending human rights, was skeptical about the role and effectiveness of the 100 or so Norwegian, Danish, and Italian observers who, unarmed, will safeguard the rights of Palestinians in Hebron for the next three months. The PLO asked for these observers to be sent in the wake of Hebron mosque massacre on 25 February, when 30 Palestinians were killed. [Correspondent] How do you view the arrival in Hebron of the foreign observers? ['Ashrawi] Their presence is purely symbolic and formal. Operationally, they serve no purpose. They are few in number and their role is limited. They cannot monitor all the places where there is a potential for flare-ups between Palestinians, Jewish settlers, and the army. Besides, it is a partial solution given that similar conflicts exist in the rest of the occupied territories. [Correspondent] What is the Palestinian reaction to the suicide attacks carried out by Hamas? Do you fear for the peace process? ['Ashrawi] Clearly, the peace process is resting on a knife edge after these attacks. We, the Palestinians, are a people who are aware of reality and the political side of things. We condemn the killing of innocent people, but the Israeli deaths are set against the general background of the violence that is taking hold in the occupied territories. The Israeli victims must be viewed in the context of attacks and reprisals that have also led to dozens of deaths among the Palestinians. They are also a consequence of the slowdown in negotiations which, on the contrary, must be accelerated if we are to achieve autonomy. [Correspondent] What do the majority of Palestinians think of Hamas? Do you think that public support for the PLO and its leader, Yasir 'Arafat, is waning? ['Ashrawi] You would have to carry out an opinion poll. My personal impression is that the credibility of the PLO and 'Arafat's prestige have been eroded, and similarly I believe that people are losing confidence in the peace process.
