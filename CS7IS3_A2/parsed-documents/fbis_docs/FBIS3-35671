Under a previous agreement, they were supposed to deliver by Jan. 27 the complete register of the town's residents as well as the car register. Town secretary Taimi Laar informs that the Russian officials surrendered only the registration forms for new arrivals and departing residents which, however, don't suffice to make up a complete register of the town's population. Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama earlier claimed the register kept by the Russian police cannot be trusted and a new register will have to be made up. Local elections cannot be held in Paldiski until the residents have been registered. Russian officials don't intend to hand over the car register any time soon. They insist the issue be put on the agenda of talks between the two countries. In Laar's opinion, Russians try to put off handing over the documents because many stolen cars are registered in Paldiski.
