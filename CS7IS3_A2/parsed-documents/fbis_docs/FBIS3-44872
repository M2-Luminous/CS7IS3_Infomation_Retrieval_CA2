The five autonomous regions of Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi and Ningxia have taken various measures to help raise the work level of minority nationality cadres. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region in Northwest China has sent ethnic cadres to coastal developed areas to learn and at the same time invited technicians and scientists from elsewhere to give lectures on management and technical know-how. Such cooperative relations have been set up between cities and counties of Xinjiang and those in coastal areas. Since 1980, Tibet autonomous region has held various courses to train a total of 27,363 cadres of minority nationalities, 72.75 percent of the total of trainees in the region. Training of county-level leaders has always been stressed in Tibet. Each year, Tibet sends ethnic management and technical leaders for additional study in related universities and colleges with support from the central government and other provinces. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have also achieved progress in the work. Inner Mongolia has given special attention to training and promotion of ethnic cadres of its three autonomous banners (counties) and over ten autonomous townships. Guangxi stressed a relationship of mutual respect and help between local cadres of the Han and other nationalities.
