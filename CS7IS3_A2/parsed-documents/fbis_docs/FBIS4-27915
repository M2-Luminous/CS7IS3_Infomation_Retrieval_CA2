In the past, the MOPT had rejected the idea because it could have a major impact on long-distance communications operators such as DDI and that the change "was unnecessary." The informal U.S. request for deregulation of the communications industry may serve as a trigger for a change in MOPT policy concerning interconnections. In reference to the linking of communications networks owned by the nine electric-power company-affiliated regional telephone companies, TTNet President Fujimori comments, "We have asked the MOPT to consider the linking of adjacent telephone companies as a matter for research. However, because of the existence of three new long-distance telephone companies, it will be difficult to link all regional telephone companies." There is a strongly rooted view that the linkage of regional telephone companies is an idea that should be developed to provide competition for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), which monopolizes urban telecommunications networks. However, the decontrol programs that went into effect in 1985 provided for a division of operating areas designed to ensure a specified revenue and profit base for long-distance and regional telephone companies and did not authorize direct links among regional telephone companies. On the other hand, at the regular press conference on 24 May, MOPT Administrative Vice Minister Futoshi Shirai referred to the U.S. request for deregulation and expressed caution, saying, "We have not received a formal request, but there is a need to study the proposal for consistency with basic concepts of the past." After the press conference, Vice Minister Shirai said, "I have heard that there is hardly any need for such linkage," reinforcing the past position of the MOPT.
