France recently sent troops to its former colony Cameroon, which is at odds with Nigeria over their border in the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula. Last week it also sent a warship to the Cameroonian port of Douala. "There is no way you can say you want to ease tension with all this show of might," the GUARDIAN quoted a Nigerian official as saying, renewing Friday's accusations that Paris was escalating the dispute with Cameroon. The manoeuvres and an "increasing French military presence" were seen as "part of gun-boat diplomacy by Paris to intimidate Nigeria," the paper wrote. But French diplomats in Lagos said the French-Benin manoeuvres starting Monday had been planned for a year, "long before conflict broke out on the other border, and all countries in the region had been given notice." "The defence attache of the Nigerian embassy in Benin, and two Nigerian military observers, are taking part in the manoeuvres," the diplomats said. Officials in Paris said the arrival of the ship, due to be replaced by a smaller vessel from the French Navy on Monday, was part of "routine" movements which had nothing to do with the Cameroonian border conflict. In an effort to dispel Nigerian suspicions, Paris has also insisted that only about 15 "technical military assistants" were sent to Cameroon at its own request, and that France wanted to see a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
