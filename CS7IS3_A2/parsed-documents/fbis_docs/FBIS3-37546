According to him, he has been invited by some Turkish business companies and the Turkish newspaper SABBATH. The LDP leader also announced that he had quite a number of invitations from abroad, for instance, from Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. However, he planned to pay most of his attention to visits to Russian constituencies. Commenting on the refusal of the Spanish government to give him the entry visa, the LDP leader pointed out that the government had violated human rights. He repeated that he was to go to Spain under an invitation from the Spanish TV which had intended to interview him on television. According to Zhirinovskiy, the move of the Spanish government was due to its "pro-American" position. Zhirinovskiy said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had wanted to meet the LDP leader during his visit to Moscow. However, the invitation was not in conformity with the appropriate order and was sent not personally to Zhirinovskiy but to the whole party. That is why just a rank-and-file LDP member went to the reception. Zhirinovskiy said that the information that the U.S. President had expressed no desire to meet him was "misinformation" and that he had been waited for in the U.S. embassy. According to the LDP leader, the person who did not register the invitation to the reception in the appropriate order was punished. Zhirinovskiy also announced that British Prime Minister John Major had met one of the LDP leaders, the State Duma's Vice Speaker, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, during his recent visit to Moscow. Aleksandr Vengerovskiy added that he would meet U.S. ambassador Thomas Pickering on the very day.
