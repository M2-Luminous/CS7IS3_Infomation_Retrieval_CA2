Protect and Safeguard Restored Communications Lines and Facilities"; place and date not given] [Text] The tragic events that have taken place recently in Samegrelo [Mingrelia], quite aside from terrible human and moral losses, have greatly damaged many economic sectors, including communications. Communications workers undertook restoration work as soon as the combat stopped. They worked very diligently, and often at the risk of their lives; they restored various connections and phone, television, and postal facilities. We asked Deputy Communications Minister Vakhtang Todua to answer a few questions on what has been done and what still has to be done. [Narmania] Batono Vakhtang, you spent quite a long time in the Samegrelo region. What was the situation there and how much were you able to get done? [Todua] First we went to Samtredia with a brigade of specialists; there we were joined by experienced local workers, and we immediately started working to restore inter-city telephone connections, television relay lines, and postal services. As for the situation, we found communications facilities so badly wrecked that we hardly knew where to begin. If it hadn't been for the Samegrelo regional provisional emergency committee's help it would have taken us a lot longer. The lack of fuel hurt us the worst. We started in Samtredia and soon went to Abasha, then Senaki, Khobi, Zugdidi, Tsalendzhikha, Dzhvarzeni, Chkhorotsku, and Martvili. The most difficult section was Zugdidi-Tsalendzhikha-Dzhvarzeni, where restoration work is still going on. Thirty kilometers of cable were completely damaged or stolen; to replace it, the Ministry brought its last stocks of connecting cable to the site. We worked without let-up for almost two months. Let me emphasize once more that we were greatly aided by local cadres, especially Vani's communications workers. The local population also helped out; they did most of the dirty work, in snow, slush, and cold. Our heartfelt thanks to them. [Narmania] We have already reported the work you have done in the Samegrelo region. How much money was spent, and does any particular factor stand out? [Todua] The work cost about 150 million Russian rubles. It's a lot, but it's justified: any place there are no communications, you know, there is no state. So this money has been spent for the sake of independent Georgia's better future. As for your second question, we need to emphasize that the most important thing now is to deal properly with criminals of every kind in order to ensure that our country's very vital communications facilities are not destroyed again. [Narmania] In your opinion, who does the most damage to our communications--the armed gangs who don't care about anything except making money by any means, the general population, or (forgive me for being so blunt) certain dishonest--to say the least--workers in your own system who know what is going on and where and therefore have easy access to booty? And, in your opinion, what must be done to stop this disgracefulness? [Todua] Communications facilities are extremely vital, which is why we have held many meetings with the local population to explain the necessity of safeguarding them. The smooth operation of our facilities now plays an especially vital role. That's why Eduard Shevardnadze, when he was in the conflict zone, went first to the post offices and instructed us to restore their operation as soon as possible, also communications in the cities and villages. "That's the way to restore life to normal," he added. That's the absolute truth, which is why we worked so tirelessly. That's why enemy forces tried to stop us and attacked our communications workers. If it hadn't been for the help provided by operations personnel of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], we couldn't have done much. Still, unless a special service is created to provide reliable protection to communications, we'll still be in trouble. [Narmania] You mentioned attacks. Were they very frequent? [Todua] Quite frequent. One such attack occurred on the Zugdidi-Dzhvarzeni road where we were hauling equipment to repair a mast to restore television in Tsalendzhikha. A 20-man gang attacked us; they riddled our bus with bullets, disarmed our guards and took them prisoner, and forbade us to do the work. Despite these difficulties, we managed to complete some solid and important work, though not all of it. [Narmania] Do you have much more work to do in Samegrelo? [Todua] There's still a lot to do. We're doing everything we can to stock up on necessary materials and components, take them to the sites, and complete the rest of the restoration work.
