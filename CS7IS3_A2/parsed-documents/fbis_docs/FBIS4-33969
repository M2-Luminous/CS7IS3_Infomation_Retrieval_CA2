FBIS4-33969 "drlat114cp_94012" FBIS-LAT-94-114 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 MEXICO Polls Show Fernandez Leading Zedillo Polls Show Fernandez Leading Zedillo PA1106232494 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 11 PA1106232494 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Report by Mireya Cuellar and Raul Llanos] [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos is reportedly ahead of Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] by only 5 percent of the vote in the race for the Presidency of the republic, according to two recent polls, one conducted by the Opinion Research Center (CEO) and the University of Guadalajara and the other by the Indemerc-Louis Harris Firm. The CEO conducted its poll among 6,896 voters in 19 cities of the republic. The results show that, as of 28 May, Fernandez de Cevallos had 33.2 percent of the votes, Zedillo 28.1 percent, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 13 percent. The poll conducted by the private Endemerc-Louis Harris Firm on 24-31 May among 600 people in the valley of Mexico shows that PAN [National Action Party] candidate Fernandez de Cevallos increased his popularity rating to 42 percent after the presidential debate. The PRI candidate placed second with 37 percent followed by Cardenas, candidate of the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], with 9 percent. The CEO poll, which has a statistical reliability rating of 94.2 percent, was conducted on 19-18 May, and the 19 chosen cities make up 36 percent of the national electorate. The criteria used to select the sample of voters included sex, age, and area of residence. The people were approached on the streets. The CEO poll shows that trust in the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), which is tasked with overseeing the process, increased slightly. When asked how trustworthy the IFE is in their opinion, 38.8 percent answered that it is trustworthy and 35.6 said that "it is not trustworthy." The first CEO poll conducted in March showed that 37.3 percent questioned the IFE's trustworthiness and 34.3 percent said it was trustworthy. According to this poll, although more than 30 percent of citizens trust the IFE, only 27 percent think the elections will be "clean and honest." When asked whether they think the upcoming presidential elections will be clean and honest, 41.1 percent replied "no" and 31.9 percent said they do not know. Another interesting fact revealed by the CEO poll is that 61.9 percent of the population thinks the parties will reject the electoral results, only 33 percent think they will accept them, and the rest do not know. If the elections had been held during the last 10 days of May, that is, after the debate, Fernandez de Cevallos would reportedly be the next president of Mexico with 33.2 percent of the vote. Very closely behind was Zedillo with 28.1 percent and Cardenas with 13 percent of the vote. The CEO conducted its first poll on 16-22 March this year. In that poll, 45.8 percent of the voters supported Zedillo, 13.5 percent Fernandez de Cevallos, and 18.1 percent Cardenas. The second and most recent poll was carried out on 19-28 May, amid the debate, and by then the PRI and PRD candidates had lost popularity. CEO Director Cesar Augusto Morones Servin stated that his second and most recent poll makes two things clear: the 21 August election will be "strongly disputed" and the statistical forecasts are very "vulnerable." Any major development between now and the elections could alter the voting. To back his "work theory," Morones Servin, during the same news conference in which he reported the results of the CEO poll yesterday, said they conducted a poll in Guadalajara two days after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, showing that PRI popularity had increased from 45.8 to 65 percent. The assassination favored the official party. The PRI popularity rate, however, had dropped to 35 percent one month after Colosio's death. The analyst attributed this to the confusion created by the incident. In fact, 30 percent of those polled in Guadalajara said they think that the assassination was plotted within the official party. The CEO director said the poll yielded a large amount of additional information that the University of Guadalajara places at the disposal of not only the media but also political organizations and the public at large. Morones Servin said the cost of the poll was 80,000 new pesos, thanks to the support of 19 public universities throughout the country, which collected information in their states at no charge. On the market, this poll would cost 1.5 billion old pesos. The cities where information was collected are: Mexico, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Villahermosa, Hermosillo, Culiacan, Morelia, Veracruz, Acapulco, Torreon, Puebla, Merida, Chihuahua, Oaxaca, Tampico, Leon and Tapachula. Indemerc: Diego grows According to a recent poll conducted by the Indemerc-Louis Harris firm with a representative sample of 600 Valley of Mexico residents, support for Fernandez de Cevallos began to rise after the public debate and as of 31 May he garnered the support of 42 percent of the respondents. Following him very closely is the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon who, according to the poll, has the support of 37 percent of residents in the Valley of Mexico, one of the areas with the largest number of voters in the country. The poll in question, which is part of the weekly follow-up conducted by Indemerc-Louis Harris, shows that support for the former secretary of programming and budget began to drop in the second week of May, days after the televised public debate between the PRI, PAN and PRD candidates. As for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), he received the support of 9 percent of the voters in central Mexico. Support for Cardenas Solorzano has remained steady following the aforementioned debate, although according to polls conducted a few days ago there has been a significant surge of support for the PRD, which is gradually closing the gap that separates Cardenas from his two main contenders as 21 August approaches. As for the six other political parties that will participate in the electoral process, the polls underscore that together they gathered the support of 12 percent of the electorate. Nevertheless, Indemerc-Louis Harris President Vicente Licona said that most of this support has gone to Labor Party (PT) candidate Cecilia Soto, while support for the remaining contenders in this group has shown little or no change. The Indemerc-Louis Harris poll shows the trend of the three leading contenders' campaigns before and after the public debate. Thus, for example, starting in April support for the PRI declined significantly. By then, Ernesto Zedillo had been uncovered as the candidate who would succeed Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, slain in Tijuana on 23 March. According to the poll, popular support for the PRI had stopped dropping up to the day after the televised debate between Zedillo, Diego Fernandez and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. After the debate, the party regained some support which, nevertheless, has proven insufficient to restore it to the levels of support it enjoyed up until April. Meanwhile, the PAN made steady progress prior to the debate. As of that date, 12 May, Diego Fernandez' "bonds" multiplied "like bubbles" and he gained the support of 50 percent of Valley of Mexico residents. Nevertheless, the white and blue party candidate's popularity has decreased slightly due to matters pertaining to his choice of words during his political campaign. As of 31 May, Fernandez de Cevallos maintained the support of 42 percent of the voters in the heart of the nation. To conclude, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' position has remained steady among Valley of Mexico voters, and although he did not "win" the debate, his popularity has not been significantly affected.
