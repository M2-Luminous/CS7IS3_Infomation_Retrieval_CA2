FBIS4-9894 "drlat065_c_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 MEXICO PRI Sources Say Zedillo Embraces Reform PRI Sources Say Zedillo Embraces Reform PA0504031694 Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 4 Apr 94 pp 1, 5 PA0504031694 Mexico City UNOMASUNO Spanish BFN [Report by Joaquin Alvarez] [Text] The reform of the power structure and the strengthening of the federal system, which will give the nation a "new and equitable political balance," are irreversible pledges that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will champion and strengthen, according to the National Executive Council of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. Meanwhile, former PRI President Pedro Ojeda Paullada defended the substitute presidential candidate's political experience and role as activist, stating "he is certainly no newcomer." During an interview yesterday, Ojeda Paullada advised Zedillo to increase his public consultations and to discuss the party's basic political proposals in an effort to place his personal stamp on the presidential campaign. He referred to the PRI's political situation and said Fernando Ortiz Arana's timely refusal to accept the party's nomination prevented an internal split. Meanwhile, Ernesto Zedillo's campaign team said that over the weekend the presidential candidate studied the political strategies he will implement in the next few months, adding, "they will be consistent with the democratic principles of Luis Donaldo Colosio and the party." A source within the campaign coordination team said Zedillo will design his own political philosophy and that it will be consistent with the statements, pledges, and thesis he defended when he was in charge of the Programming and Budget Secretariat, which no longer exists, and the Public Education Secretariat. The source said: "Zedillo is well aware of the nation's problems. Let us not forget he was directly involved in the state reform strategy and policy, one of the current administration's leading achievements." Pedro Ojeda Paullada, former president of the PRI's National Executive Council, said the candidates' nomination to the post of assembly member, deputy, and senator will entail some modifications within the party, but he denied that these include changes in the PRI's national leadership. He also said there is no statute that prevents national leader Fernando Ortiz Arana from being nominated to the post of senator and remaining in charge of the organization. At about 2100 last night -- the eve of the formal start of the campaign, which promises numerous political activities in Mexico City -- a group of community leaders and land holders from Magdalena Contreras and Santa Ursula personally delivered a list of proposals to resolve land ownership problems to Zedillo. Raymundo Munoz Ocadiz, adviser to the group, said Zedillo agreed to contact Manuel Jimenez Guzman, PRI leader in Mexico City, and that the two may discuss the group's problems with Federal District Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez and Agrarian Reform Secretary Victor Cervera Pacheco. According to Ocadiz's version, Zedillo "promised to defend and protect Los Dinamos ecological reserve in Magdalena Contreras." The meeting between the community leaders, the land holders, and Zedillo was held at his private residence in Cruz Verde 172, Lomas Quebradas neighborhood, southern Mexico City. Sources within the PRI's National Executive Council consulted yesterday said Luis Donaldo Colosio's public pledges to reform power and to strengthen the federal system as well as to bolster the autonomy of the municipalities will be endorsed and championed by Ernesto Zedillo, who will even "strengthen" these pledges. "PRI members will fulfill all of the pledges assumed by the man who was our candidate," the sources confirmed. One source recalled that the issues of a new balance between the Union's branches -- reform, particularly within the judicial branch, and the strengthening of the federal system -- remain firm. At the same time, Pedro Ojeda Paullada, currently a federal deputy, openly defended Zedillo's political experience; his role as an activist; and his well-known "capability, skill, knowledge, intelligence, and sensibility" to lead the country should he win the election. Asked about the criticism surrounding Colosio Murrieta's substitute, Ojeda Paullada adamantly said: "He is certainly no newcomer. Quite the contrary, he is knowledgeable about the party because he participated in Carlos Salinas' campaign. At that time, he was programming and budget secretary, and, until recently, he was public education secretary. These secretariats gave him an ample vision of the country and its current reality." Referring to the PRI's internal situation he said: The fact that Fernando Ortiz Arana did not vie for the post (the presidency) shows there is no division because this would have engendered another position, and, at this time, I only see one -- one that supports Zedillo Ponce de Leon's candidacy. Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Barberena, leader of the National Front of Organizations and Citizens, said Zedillo's candidacy restores confidence because it endorses the late Luis Donaldo Colosio's ideology and goals. He said there is unity within the PRI and its members are advancing united toward an election victory in August.
