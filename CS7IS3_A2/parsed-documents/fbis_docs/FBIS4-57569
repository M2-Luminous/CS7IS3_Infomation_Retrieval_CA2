Abreu made his country's position known after some foreign media asserted that only Argentina and Uruguay were willing to participate in a multinational force in Haiti. The U.S. State Department asked the opinion of several OAS member countries on the creation of a multinational force to dislodge the military in power in Haiti. The majority of Latin American countries opposes this idea, which is one of three being studied in Washington. The other ideas include direct intervention by the United States and the creation of a force made up of Haitian refugees. Uruguay has promoted political actions in the OAS in order to prevent the Haitian crisis from turning into a military solution. Abreu stated that the country's position has not changed and it will work with "preventive diplomacy." The foreign minister said Uruguay "is a jealous defender of nonintervention and the self-determination of nations." "Uruguay will support all solutions that come within the framework of international law and the responsible organizations," Abreu reiterated. "The principles of nonintervention and self-determination are not negotiable," he stressed.
