According to local officials, the province has earmarked 1.2 billion yuan in the past three years for the installation of more telephone lines and the opening up of related telecommunications services. At present, the province has 690,000 telephones lines, including 70,000 computer-controlled ones. In 1990 the province had only 170,000 telephone lines. In this provincial capital the telephone numbers will jump from six to seven digits beginning midnight March 5. The increasingly improved telecommunications services have in turn promoted the opening drive in the province, and have helped enterprises locate in remote areas to establish closer links with the outside world.
