During a news conference by the EU presidency, it was noted that talks on solutions to the The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] issue and EU enlargement entered their final stages. On the issue of FYROM, the initiative is now with the EU Council of Foreign Ministers. Even though Greece's partners in the European Union did not back down from their objections to the countermeasures against FYROM, they did not accept a proposal to send Greece before the European Court and now appear to realize the reasons that forced Athens' move. Tomorrow, EU Commissioner on Foreign Affairs Hans Van Den Broek will be in Athens and hold talks with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Van Den Broek said that he will not bring any message from the government of [FYROM President] Kiro Gligorov, but he will raise the points discussed during the unofficial Council of Ministers' meeting. According to some information, a proposal by the foreign minister of Luxembourg on the issue of FYROM was tabled following Van Den Broek's report on the issue. This proposal provided for EU guarantees that FYROM would proceed with changing symbols and giving a binding interpretation of the disputed articles of its Constitution to exclude offensive designs against Greece; in return, Athens would lift the countermeasures. EU Commission President Jacques Delors made it clear that the issue is not under the authority of the EU Commission but under the EU Council of Ministers, after Greece recalled Article 224 of the Maastricht Treaty, which regards issues of foreign security. Delors said that if the issue had been placed on a legal basis, the EU Commission would have sent the case to the European Court. However, this can not be done under these circumstances, as the authority has now been placed with the political branches of the European Union. Foreign Minister Papoulias said that Greece's partners had indeed criticized the countermeasures, but the climate was clearly milder than before. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said that the EU Commission will hold a meeting with the Greek Government in the next few days to find a solution without the need to take the issue to the European Court. It appears that neither France nor Germany want to send Greece to the European Court, as Foreign Ministers Alain Juppe and Klaus Kinkel stressed the need for a mutual settlement of the dispute. The only countries that seem to favor sending Greece to the European Court are the Netherlands and Denmark. The foreign ministers of these two countries made separate statements urging the EU Commission to send Greece to the European Court.
