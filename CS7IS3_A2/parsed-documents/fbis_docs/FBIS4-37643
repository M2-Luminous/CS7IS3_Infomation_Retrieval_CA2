In a press release Wednesday [22 June], the Iranian mission at the United Nations stressed that several billion dollars of Iranian assets and properties in the United States have been frozen by the U.S. Administration. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau had falsely testified that the United States had no forzen Iranian assets except what might be available to the U.S. Claims Commission. He made the statement in the hearing of the Europe and the Middle East subcommittee of the house of foreign affairs committee on June 14 in response to repeated questions about the existence of any Iranian assets that had been frozen in the United States. The press release said that the fund which was made available to the (US) Claims Commission represented the settlement amount for the small claims, an issue totally distinct from Iranian assets frozen by the United States. Terming the testimony as false, the press release said that apart from different types of Iranian properties which have been blocked in the United States, three major categories of Iran's assets are still in the United States which have not been released to Tehran and have neither been put at the disposal of the Iran-U.S. claims tribunal. It added that the Iranian assets which are in the US include: (i) the remaining balance in the Foreign Military Sales Fund (FMS trust funds) (ii) Funds of Iranian diplomatic mission and (iii) balance of stand-by letters of credit issued by U.S. banks on the account of US companies in favour of Iranian Government entities, including but not limited to down payments, good performance guarantees and commercial letters of credit. The press release also said that in addition to blocking some Iranian military and non-military properties including those of Iranian diplomatic missions, the United States has, in violation of its undertaking under the Algiers Accords, refused to return to Iran its remaining assets and continues to hold them in the United States. It stressed that the total value of the items exceeds several billion U.S. dollars.
