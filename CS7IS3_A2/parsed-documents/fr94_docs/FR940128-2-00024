FR940128-2-00024 FR940128-2-00010 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 920535&hyph;3305] RIN 0693&hyph;AA99 Second Solicitation of Comments on Proposed Federal Information Processing Standard for Standard Security Label for the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce the revised proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Standard Security Label for the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile. This proposed FIPS was originally announced in the Federal Register (57 FR 37948) on August 21, 1992. NIST received comments from 28 government and industry organizations in response to the first notice on the proposed FIPS for Standard Security Label for the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile. While many of the comments supported the proposed standard, other comments particularly those received from the Department of Defense, recommended changes to broaden the scope of the standard and make it compatible with other government efforts to develop secure communications processes. NIST has been working with the Department of Defense and other organizations to revise the original proposal and to develop a common standard for security labels that will meet the needs of the interested parties. NIST solicits views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, State and local government users on this revised proposed standard prior to submission to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval. The revised proposed standard contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical aspects of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications section from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816. DATES: Comments on this revised proposed standard must be received on or before March 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the revised proposed standard should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Revised Proposed FIPS for Standard Security Label, Technology Building, room B154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Written comments received in response to this notice will be made part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Noel Nazario, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2837. Dated: January 24, 1994. Samuel Kramer, Associate Director.
