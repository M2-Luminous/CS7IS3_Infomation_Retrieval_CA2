The sources said the letter explains that the commission's session, which was previously scheduled to be held on Seoul on May 20, has been postponed because Aleksandr Shokhin, vice-premier and minister of economics, cannot arrive in South Korea "due to purely domestic problems". Yeltsin suggested that the commission hold a session in Moscow before Kim's visit to Russia. The visit is scheduled for June 1-4.
