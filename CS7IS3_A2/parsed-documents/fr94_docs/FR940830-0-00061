FR940830-0-00061 FR940830-0-00013 The HA may initially budget up to 8% of its annual grant for contingencies, and HUD believes that this provides sufficient flexibility for HAs within each annual grant. When the HA needs to use the funds in this contingency account for cost overruns or other work within its Five-Year Action Plan, the HA is required to ``move the funds'' through internal budgeting to other eligible development accounts and then draw down the funds from other line items. After the HA has moved the funds from the contingency account into other eligible development accounts for purposes of obligation and expenditure, the HA may not replenish this account because at program completion, this account must be zero. Therefore, HUD has not adopted the suggestion that funds resulting from underruns or contract modifications be used to replenish this account since funds in the contingency account must be moved to other line items for drawdown in a timely fashion to meet the HA's approved implementation schedule. Funds resulting from underruns or credit contract modifications, as well as funds not needed for contingencies shall be reprogrammed for other modernization work in the approved Five-Year Action Plan. HA-Wide Line Items Comment: Three commenters recommended a HA-wide line item account for relocation services, asbestos testing and abatement, lead-based paint abatement and ``on demand'' Section 504 accessibility conversions. Response: HUD recognizes that HAs occasionally encounter work items that are unpredictable, such as lead-based paint abatement when a child has been identified as having an elevated blood level or the need to modify a unit for physical accessibility. Therefore, HUD wishes to clarify that HA-wide line item accounts covering HA-wide activities such as lead-based paint, Section 504 compliance, mitigation of environmental hazards such as asbestos abatement, and modernization of vacant units is consistent with established program requirements and procedures and does not require any change to the existing regulation. Note: modernization of vacant units is limited to non-routine maintenance work items. Routine maintenance is not an eligible modernization cost. Funds budgeted in a HA-wide line item should be based on historical data. The HA should estimate the amount of funds that it anticipates will be needed, annually, on the above items. The HA-wide line item would enable the HA to complete these work items at any of its developments, and avoid numerous budget revisions because the estimated needs at a particular development are under-funded or over-funded. However, the HA is required to report in the Performance and Evaluation Report on the quantity and cost for each development where HA-wide activities were carried out. With regard to HA-wide line items, a HA may wish to consider utilizing an indefinite quantity architectural/engineering (A/E) contract to meet its needs with regard to the above types of work. HAs usually hire A/E firms to provide services as specific needs arise. Many HAs, however, have the need for a number of A/E services during the course of the next one or two years. In these cases, the HA may solicit for an indefinite quantity contract where separate orders are issued to the selected A/E firm for each service as the need arises. Another method similar to this approach is to issue a solicitation for several A/E firms to provide services on an as-required basis rather than merely one firm. The solicitation would clearly indicate that the HA anticipates having the need for several A/E services, identify types of services to be provided for that year, and describe how an A/E firm would be selected among the groups. As the need arises, the HA would execute contracts with A/E firms for specific tasks in accordance with the procedures identified in the solicitation. These methods allow the HA to quickly contract for critical services in a timely manner rather than waiting until the need arises to issue the solicitation and select the needed firm. Further information regarding indefinite quantity contracts for A/E services is found in paragraph 4&hyph;26 of the Procurement Handbook. §§905.601 and 968.310␣Eligible costs Management Improvements Comment: Twenty-eight comments were received on the proposal to raise the cap on management improvements from 10% to 20% and to permit high performers under PHMAP or IHAs determined by the Field Office to be high performing and with administrative capacity to exceed the 20% limit. To the maximum extent feasible, the Department proposed that HAs should use management improvement funds to train residents in carrying out activities related to the modernization-funded physical and management improvements. Most commenters saw the proposal as a significant improvement. Some noted that this proposal will not relieve HUD of its responsibility to adequately fund mandates regarding resident services (security improvements, training, etc.) and operating subsidies. Others opposed the Department for even suggesting that modernization improvement funds be utilized for resident training activities and preferred that this be left to local discretion. Many commenters urged a return to ``true'' management improvement activities, rather than recent years' necessity of funding on-going operational need in HAs in areas of security, drug prevention and enforcement and resident services. It was recommended that CGP funds should only be used for incremental improvement to equipment and information systems, but not personnel. It was noted that each HA's modernization grant is based upon a formula allocation, which is based upon that HA's estimated modernization needs. There is nothing in this method of allocation which reflects or is based upon a HA's needs for funding for security, resident services, or resident initiatives programs, nor is the formula allocation process designed to address those needs. Other commenters saw the percentage limitation increase enabling some HAs to address new and greater problems dealing with crime and security as well as family values. One commenter supported the proposal because it could result in needed funds for resident training required for compliance with Section 3 and other programs such as the Family Investment Center Program and Youthbuild. Several commenters recommended that HUD should also broaden the list of allowable management improvements, especially to include the establishment of preventive maintenance systems as an eligible item under management improvements, perhaps up to a certain reasonable percentage limit (one recommended 6% of most HA's CGP grants). CLPHA and NAHRO strongly recommended that management improvement rules allow preventive maintenance to be funded. They recommended where a low AEL has resulted in seriously declining housing stock with high levels of deferred maintenance, the first few years of implementing a Preventive Maintenance Program represent a major non-recurring expense in terms of both manpower and materials. After the first three years, the cost associated with this program was proposed by some commenters to be reduced to a level that is supportable within the normal operating budget.
