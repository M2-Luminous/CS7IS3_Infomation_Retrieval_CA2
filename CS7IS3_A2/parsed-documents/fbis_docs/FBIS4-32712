The new speaker and the three deputy speakers of Parliament have confidence in the present parliamentary officials and will not change the composition of the efficient staff, he said. In reply to a question, Gal said it is essential to modify the house rules as soon as possible so that some long and needless procedures should be a thing of the past. The bulk of work should be carried out in the parliamentary committees, he added. The Speaker also said the opposition should be given a wider scope of control in the government. In a bid to improve discipline, Gal held out the prospect of sanctions to be imposed on deputies who are absent without justification. He added that he would like to see a more efficient and less costly Parliament, and he will thus initiate a revision of entertainment expenses. The Speaker expressed the view that the plenary sessions should invariably be broadcast by Hungarian Television, because many viewers are interested in them. The concrete conditions, he added, should be discussed in autumn with the new leaders of Hungarian Television.
