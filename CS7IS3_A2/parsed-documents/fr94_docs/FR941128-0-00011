FR941128-0-00011 FR941128-0-00004 Notice and Public Participation The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) relating to notice and public participation have not been followed in connection with the adoption of these amendments because the amendments involve adjustments prescribed by statute and by an interpretative statement reaffirming the Board's policy concerning reporting practices. The amendments also reduce regulatory burdens on depository institutions. Accordingly, the Board finds good cause for determining, and so determines, that notice and public participation are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(d) relating to notice of the effective date of a rule have not been followed in connection with the adoption of these amendments because the amendments relieve a restriction on depository institutions, and for this reason there is good cause to determine, and the Board so determines, that such notice is not necessary. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Board certifies that the proposed amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed amendments reduce certain regulatory burdens for all depository institutions, reduce certain burdens for small depository institutions, and have no particular effect on other small entities.
