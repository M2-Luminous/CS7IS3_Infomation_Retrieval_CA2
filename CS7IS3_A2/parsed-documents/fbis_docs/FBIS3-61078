But after the rowdy televised political show, they suddenly went one after the other to register as liberal democrats. Whereas in a southern city of the oblast--Osa--for example, prior to the elections there were just two members of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], this is now a full-fledged primary organization that has demanded the authorities allocate premises and has begun active propaganda in the local mass media. But, naturally, all cities of the oblast have outdone Perm. A news conference of the liberal democrats announced the appointment by the LDPR Supreme Council as "shadow governor" of the Kama region of A. Chulkov, chairman of the party's Perm branch, who presented a program declaration which plunged journalists into confusion. The province of Perm will, according to him, be restored in its prerevolution borders. The people of Perm are called upon here to play more than last fiddle in the liberal democratic faction of the State Duma also. He sees as the paramount task in this organ of power the resignation of the government. And "criminal proceedings will be instituted" against some present ministers, what is more. The new criminal legislation drawn up by the party expands considerably the list of articles providing for the death penalty. In the fight against organized crime it is planned to impose a state of emergency with a curfew in particular regions. Caucasians, Gypsies, and... Chinese will be deported from that same Kama region. Not just Perm Oblast, but all of Russia will in the future be restored in their prerevolution borders. In addition, "an outlet to the Mediterranean will be secured by the diplomatic path." The members of the LDPR attending the news conference heard the new governor and unexpected leader with certain misgivings: garrulous, but too young. Truly, A. Chulkov can as yet be called simply Sasha, he is 19 years old and, he says, he is a second-year student at the Perm Medical Institute, but is already the author of monographs (!) on surgery and medical biology. He hurled himself into politics following the president's September edicts on the breakup of the Supreme Soviet. But this is what he says. After the news conference, A. Odegov, a coordinator of the LDPR in the Kama region, contacted Moscow and ascertained that Sasha was not on the party slate. He was not a student of the Medical Institute either. While the leaders of the LDPR are still confusedly ascertaining the personality of their new leader, he has already taken a stroll down the corridors of power and has paid an official visit to the oblast newspaper ZVEZDA, where he announced that his supporters would try to obtain 25-30 of the 40 seats in the oblast's legislative assembly. "And we will surely win!" he said with great confidence here. After this, A. Zaynullin, another coordinator of the LDPR, urgently left for Moscow for a consultation with Vladimir Volfovich.
