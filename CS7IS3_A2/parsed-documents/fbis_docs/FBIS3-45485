Meanwhile, rapid increases in cross-Strait economic exchanges have considerably enhanced Taiwan's economic progress. Consequently, while maintaining a medium-growth rate, Taiwan has been moving toward economic recovery. According to an estimation by Taiwan's "Economics Ministry," with a total output value of more than $10,000 per capita, Taiwan's economic growth rate in 1993 was 6.08 percent, which fell short of its original growth target of 7.00 percent. Due to a recession in western countries in the first half of 1993, there was almost no increase in Taiwan's industrial production, exports, and export orders. The balance of Taiwan's foreign exchange accounts, its currency supply, its stock price indices, and the exchange rates for the New Taiwan dollar have dropped considerably. In the second half of 1993, after the Taiwan authorities drastically curtailed its Six- Year Economic Construction Plan and formulated the Economic Invigoration Program, and with various internal and external factors exerting a comprehensive impact on the island, Taiwan's economic conditions have improved somewhat. Over the past year Taiwan's foreign trade gradually slowed as its principal economic component. Its exports to Europe and the United States have decreased. Its trade deficit with Japan have continued to worsen, with expected trade deficits with Japan for the entire year totalling over $13 billion. According to statistics, as of 20 November Taiwan's total imports and exports were $68.7 billion and $57.6 billion respectively, registering corresponding growth rates of 8.3 percent and 4.2 percent. Its foreign trade surplus was $940 million [figures as printed], down $2.23 billion over the same period in 1992. That Taiwan was able to maintain a medium economic growth rate of about 6 percent has an inseparable connection with the rapid increase in cross-Strait economic exchanges. According to Taiwan's statistics, cross-Strait transshipping trade from January to September 1993 totalled $6.39 billion, and the value for the entire year is expected to surpass $9 billion. According to statistics, after the value on cross-Strait trade with the PRC was deducted, Taiwan's foreign trade grew only 0.7 percent in 1993. Additionally, as a result of economic progress in the PRC, Taiwanese businessmen have rapidly increased their investments on the mainland. According to a survey by the Zhonghua [Chung-hua] Institute for Economic Research, for every U.S. dollar invested by Taiwanese businessmen in the PRC, Taiwan will be able to increase its exports by $2. Taiwan's "Economic Affairs Minister" Jiang Bingkun [Chiang Ping- kun] admitted: The development of cross-Strait economic relations and trade has become the driving force for Taiwan's economic progress. Furthermore, economic transformation has gradually spread. Following the expansion of island-wide demand in recent years, Taiwan has accelerated its industrial restructuring. On the one hand, contributions by the services industry to the total output value will further increase; they are expected to reach 56 percent, higher than that of the manufacturing industry. On the other hand, the number of labor-intensive industries has further declined, whereas the number of capital and technology-intensive industries has risen steadily. Small enterprises have been developing into large ones. Large enterprises and giant financial groups have been playing more and more important roles during Taiwan's economic progress. Following changes in industrial organizations, the markets of many manufacturing industries -- including vehicle, engines, computer software and hardware devices, and the paper making industry -- have gradually fallen under the control of a small number of giant firms. According to a survey, 300 large enterprise groups control some 20 percent of Taiwan's nongovernmental economic resources, a quarter of which are in the hands of five family groups including Wang Yongqing, Gu Zhenfu, Cai Wanlin, Wu Dongjin, and Xu Youxiang. The annual transactional value of the five family groups amounts to 6,000 billion Taiwan dollars, or more than 10 percent of Taiwan's annual total output. Though Taiwan has begun to transform its economy from catering to exports to fulfilling internal demand, the willingness to invest within the island is still low. The investment environment has not improved because of the following: old production systems have not been withdrawn; new production systems have not been established; and problems include difficulties in obtaining land, increases in labor wages, higher environmental protection requirements, and adverse impacts from political factors. Small and medium enterprises have continued to move out. Taiwan lacks a powerful internal force to enhance economic progress. The "Economic Invigoration Program" aimed at spurring the nongovernmental sector's enthusiasm to invest has failed to obtain its expected target. The number of newly-registered companies has been declining every month since May 1993. There are hidden worries about whether Taiwan can still achieve economic progress in 1994. Factors which will propel Taiwan's economy to recover to some extent include official efforts towards "economic invigoration," the launching of large investment projects already formulated by some giant financial groups, and the ongoing rapid development in cross-Strait economic relations and trade exchanges; but the economy will not develop rapidly. Restraining factors which will hinder Taiwan's economic progress are the restricting international economic recession and the Taiwanese authorities' financial difficulties in 1994, due to which the rate of increase in public investment within the island will decline; private consumption, after rising for several consecutive years, may also decline in 1994.
