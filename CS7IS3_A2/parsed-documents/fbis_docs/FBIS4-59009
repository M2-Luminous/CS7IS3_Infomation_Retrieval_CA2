The head of the Civil Aviation Administration made it clear that the security arrangements in the two airstrips in Gaza and Jericho will be similar to security arrangements in the Rafah and Allenby Bridge border terminals. The Palestinians will be allowed to use two helicopters and four light planes, including Yasir 'Arafat's plane, which will serve him in his flights between Gaza and Jericho. All the Palestinian aerial activity will be conducted under the supervision of the Israel Civil Aviation Administration, and the pilots will have to undergo a special test by this body. Minister Qeysar, who toured the Jordan Valley settlements and the Bet She'an Valley region today, also said that the construction of the Jericho bypass road will cost approximately 200 million shekels. Minister Qeysar added that his office has already prepared detailed plans and maps toward the resumption of the land and sea link between Israel and Jordan after a peace agreement is signed between the two countries. He noted that Israel is interested in supplying Jordan with transport and commerce services via the ports of Haifa and Ashdod.
