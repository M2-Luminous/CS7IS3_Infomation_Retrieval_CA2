The nine-member group is led by Nan Zhenzhong, vice president and editor in-chief of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA), and includes the editors-in-chief of the ECONOMIC DAILY, the GUANGMING DAILY, and the English-language CHINA DAILY. Also traveling with the seven news professionals are two members of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), a semi-official body set up to facilitate cross-Taiwan Strait contacts. The visit was arranged by ARATS Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). The cross-strait exchange of news personnel is one of several agreements reached between SEF and ARATS during a series of meetings held last year. Under the agreement, SEF is planning a reciprocal visit of news professionals to the mainland. The Taiwan delegation is expected to make the trip in March.
