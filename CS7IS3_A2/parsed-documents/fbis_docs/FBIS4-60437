What is your response and how can the ongoing conflict in Yemen be contained? [Al-Dali] Actually I believe that the starting point in resolving the worsening crisis represented by this ferocious war should be an immediate halt to the war. Afterward, we could disengage the forces and then sit and talk about anything or any issue. [Correspondent] How can the fighting be stopped amid these reports and statements by the two sides? [Al-Dali] The aggressor should order a halt to his aggressions against the southern and eastern governorates. The aggressor must stop his aggressions against the eastern and southern governorates. We have agreed on more than one occasion to halt the fighting and to accept mediation efforts, and to sit down for talks with our brothers, but the other side has refused and rejected more than one initiative to halt the fighting. He, the aggressor, has to stop the fighting. [Correspondent] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is very strongly opposed to your declaration of secession from unity. [Al-Dali] We did not choose to proclaim a new state in the southern and eastern governorates at our own choosing; there were reasons and motives that prompted us to do so. [Correspondent] In a few words, what would you say about the YSP's initiative? [Al-Dali] An immediate cease-fire, withdrawing and disengaging the forces, and sitting down for talks without preconditions.
