Davydov: "Let the Railcars Run a Little Longer"] [Text] When they say that we are living in an unstable and unpredictable time, I ask myself: how is this manifested in railroad transport? The overwhelming majority of the sector's employees are continuing to perform their professional duties conscientiously in spite of everything. Otherwise, the freight and passengers would not be delivered to their destinations. But this is being achieved at an increasingly higher price. I will not mention all the aspects of transport activity, just one. In recent years, the number of freight cars in disrepair has been increasing on railroads in both Russia and the CIS countries. This is the result of a certain lack of responsibility in their use and the forced division of the fleet while they continue to be operated jointly, which leads to the steady obsolescence of the rolling stock and sharp deterioration in all types of repair work. Generally speaking, this is not a new problem. It existed even before the collapse of the USSR. But now the crisis in the economy and inflation are aggravating the situation. Investments in railroad transport have been reduced to zero and the purchase of new rolling stock has been practically discontinued. Accordingly, railcars are coming in for maintenance more and more frequently, but there are not enough funds for this. Quite naturally, the question arises: how do we stop the trend of more and more railcars in disrepair? Specialists of the VNIIZhT [All-Russian Railroad Transport Scientific Research Institute] suggest that the railcars be assigned to railroads for repair, which, they say, will make it possible to create a self-regulated organizational-economic mechanism capable of maintaining the railcar fleet in good technical working order. Finding support from specialists in the MPS [Ministry of Railways] Railcars Main Administration, they proposed that this matter be submitted for discussion by the Scientific and Technical Council. While Professor V. Buyanov, head of the Transport Development Prospects Laboratory of the VNIIZhT, and I Glukhov, chief of the Railcars Main Administration, were speaking, the impression was created that after the railcars are assigned to the railroads, the quality of their repair will improve and the expenses for this purpose will even be reduced. But then their opponents--V. Gorbunov, chief engineer of the Transpoort Main Administration, and G. Bugrov, chief of the Statistics Administration--were given the floor, and they cited numerous reasons to show that the existing system for operating and maintaining the railcar fleet must not be changed. Without getting into the details of the dispute, it is still necessary to dwell on the main factors which Deputy Minister A. Kondratenko, who was chairing the session, repeatedly attempted to clarify. What is your conviction--that assigning railcars to the railroads will improve repair quality--based on? What is bad about the system now in use and how do we correct this? Running ahead, I will say that neither side cited exhaustive and sufficiently persuasive arguments. There were many analytical statistics and variations of organizational and economic impact on the operations and repair processes, but on a practical level they looked questionable at times. For example, there are no justifiable grounds for the statement that the railcars' assignment to railroads will make it possible to improve the quality of depot repair, in their opponents' opinion. In such a case, what is to happen to repair cooperation and specialization, which is the basis for the distribution of railcar depots in the railroad system? But the main point is that there continue to be many rulers of the railcar's destiny as before--chiefs of stations, the heads of PTO's [technical inspection points], and so forth on the chain over which it passes--but it has not had and does not have a really responsible owner. Returning to the reasons which forced the VNIIZhT specialists to conduct research on the problem, they were based on an abrupt transition from a critical shortage to a large surplus in the railcar fleet. It did not turn out to be so simple to adapt to the new situation. But the continuing decline in transportation services is leading to a further increase in the freight car surplus. Under the conditions of rising inflation and nonpayments, it is more and more difficult for the Ministry of Railways to maintain them in good operating condition. To emphasize the need to decentralize the railcar fleet, the VNIIZhT referred to experience in the United States, where the basic parameters--length of the system, the distances involved, the freight handling, freight turnover, and so forth--are similar in many respects to Russia's railroads. But there the entire fleet is the property of the railroads and private enterprises, and the railcar owners bear all the expenses for their maintenance and repair. A special automated system follows the 2 million railcars of the common fleet of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. There are no problems with redistribution, and record keeping has been organized at a high level. But after all, it is the last condition which probably will turn out to be a bottleneck for the Russian railroads in assigning railcars. Though according to VNIIZhT calculations, empty runs to "their" railroad and the average waiting time for repair will increase substantially. However, taking into account the undeveloped state of our information systems and the lack of proper control over the transfer of railcars at junctions between railroads, and so forth, V. Gorbunov said, the gain from the innovation is very doubtful, but as far as the losses are concerned, they are obvious. This includes losses in average train weight and locomotive productivity (because of the empty run), which leads to higher operating expenses. All the same, let us return again to the situation that has taken shape now. The MPS is not in a position to buy new railcars in the quantity needed now. The railroads owe huge sums for previous deliveries and repair of freight cars. Taking into account the deterioration of rolling stock, it has not been ruled out that there may be a substantial shortage of rolling stock by the end of the decade, if the country finally begins to emerge from the crisis, of course. At the same time, according to information from the Railcars Main Administration, there are about 110,000 inoperative railcars in the system every day, and as strange as it seems, this figure is not decreasing. Although last year 635,000 railcars were restored by all types of repair! The clearly abnormal situation is forcing us to look not only for a solution to reduce operating expenditures today, but so that we do not end up where we were before if the freight flow begins to increase. I do not know who my neighbors were, but by the end of the session, when it had become completely obvious that the prepared version for assigning railcars to the railroads would not be adopted, an interesting dialogue took place between them: "Actually, they proposed a division for one purpose: to assign a place of repair for each railcar." "But they divided among the CIS administrations, you know, and basically only Russia and Belarus are performing the repair." "Not at all--others are creeping in little by little, although I agree that a great deal depends on how the commanders of independent railroads make use of their levers of influence." "All the same, a transport worker is still in command of the railcar; railcars administration employees essentially are not the proprietors, and with our level of responsibility and discipline in that administration, there will not be any!.." The question automatically arises: did anything of value come out of the discussion that took place? We can firmly say: yes, of considerable value. It defined the specific range of problems which must be resolved in order to put economic levers into use for efficient operation of the current system or a new system, as A. Kondratenko put it. First of all, we need a balance inventory of the railcar fleet by car numbers. In the event that there is a division among railroads, the financing procedure will have to be changed. The principles involved in the division also must be defined more specifically. And so forth. It is regrettable only if the main point is shifted imperceptibly to second place after all these technical problems: will the railcar have an owner, all the same? Whoever receives income from its operation will take care of it. Not because of an order to do so, but because he has an interest in its good working order. Perhaps those who have said that an inspector should be the railcar owner are right? Yes, they are the ones who know "the subject" like no one else and could take care of it. But this "trifle" is needed for that: they must be given the right to determine what happens to it, and neither the station chief, nor the chief of the railcars service, nor even the one in charge of the main administration would be able to countermand their decision! I ask myself: what kind of status and professional level should they have then? And I respond that this is probably the most complicated of all the questions. But we will have to answer it anyway. If not today, then tomorrow.
