"Despite the fact that several ships leased by South Korean shipping companies have entered Chongjin port, the North Koreans insist that South Korean ships use Najin port," KMPA officials said Monday. "We think that's a step to prevent the shock of opening from spreading to other places by separating the special economic area from other regions." Chongjin has an advantage over Najin in terms of railroad facilities but suffers a freight vehicle shortage, while Najin offers better land transportation with good road conditions, the officials quoted ethnic Koreans living in China as saying. Pyongyang seems to have designated Najin as the South-North direct trading center in the East Sea, the officials said. Negotiations on the direct shipping route are stalled, however, because the North wants the Seoul government not to interfere in direct investment by South Korean businesses in the development of unloading and transportation facilities at Najin port, according to the officials.
