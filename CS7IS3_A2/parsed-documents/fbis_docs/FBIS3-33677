He promised to exert everything in his power to establish an honorable and permanent peace that is acceptable to all parties. President Clinton said in the interview he gave to CNN that his meeting in Geneva with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was great and serious. He added that he is convinced that the Syrian president is honest when confirming Syria's interest in establishing peace and is committed to finding an agreement for a settlement with Israel on the basis of peace prevailing on both the Lebanese and Jordanian fronts, in addition to the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The statements by the U.S. President came after he met twice with Jordanian monarch King Husayn and before a series of meetings that were held in Oslo between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. The preparatory meetings start in Washington today between the Arab delegations taking part in the bilateral peace talks with Israel in preparation for resuming these negotiations at the beginning of the next month, after they have been stopped and stalled for a long time. Since the United States gives priority to peace efforts in the Middle East, we hope that the U.S. capital will soon witness concurrent agreements between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan respectively along the lines of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which will bring about a historic reconciliation and an honorable and permanent peace through which cooperation and good neighborliness can replace bloodshed and fighting.
