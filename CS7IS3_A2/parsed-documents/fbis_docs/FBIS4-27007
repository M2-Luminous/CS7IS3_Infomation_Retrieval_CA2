According to the new regulations titled "the economic standards and scale of fixed assets investment projects," banks must now give loans and funding priorities to the industries listed by the State Council, the CHINA SECURITIES DAILY reported. Such industries, after further approval of the State Council, or China's cabinet, will also be eligible to raise funds by issuing stocks and bonds, the paper said. The first group of industries which will enjoy investment approval and priority include those involved in the production of refined oil, electrolytic copper and aluminum, polyamide and polyester fiber, ethylene and polyethylene fiber, video recorders, engines and motor vehicles, it said. The industries listed by the State Council will be subject to change, the paper said, while it refrained from detailing what recourse healthy companies in other sectors of the economy can take to assure credit or investment funds. The Chinese Government has largely blamed an overheated economy marked by high inflation, massive speculation, huge losses and giant profit taking on high fixed assets investment, which grew by an average of 75 percent between 1990-92 and 47 percent last year.
