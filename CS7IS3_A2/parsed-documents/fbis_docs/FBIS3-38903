Nor will he run in this fall's elections. The reason is that he does not feel he has the party's support for the tough, straightforward policies he wants to pursue. "New Democracy is moving toward something we already have too much of -- vote maximization," he said in a television interview on Saturday [5 February] evening. By this he means that too many people in the party are keeping an eye on the opinion poll figures. They are attempting to put forward proposals that will win as many votes as possible instead of pursuing the right policies. He admitted that the criticism from Bert Karlsson, New Democracy's deputy chairman, is one of the reasons for his resignation. "If you cannot lead the party in the right way then you should resign." Wachtmeister believes that New Democracy will run in the election without him, but "it will probably be with what in part at least is a different program." Bert Karlsson does not want to lead the party himself. And party secretary Marianne Ostlund is shocked. "I have difficulty in envisaging a future of which Ian is not a part," Marianne Ostlund told DAGENS NYHETER. In recent opinion polls New Democracy has been dangerously close to the 4-percent threshold for representation in the Riksdag.
