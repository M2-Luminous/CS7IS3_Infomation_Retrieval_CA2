This new unit, with an annual capacity of 800 tonnes, should come into production this summer and reach its nominal power in 1996. It will be entirely dedicated to fuel from the EDF [French Electricity Company] power stations. The General Nuclear Materials Company (COGEMA) has just received from Industry Minister Gerard Longuet and Environment Minister Michel Barnier permission to start up the latest units of its new UP2-800 irradiated fuel reprocessing plant in La Hague (Manche). This decision is the latest stage in the program to extend the reprocessing capabilities of the La Hague plant launched in 1979. Henceforth COGEMA has two factories, each with a capacity of 800 tonnes, on this nuclear site situated at the extremity of the La Manche departement, a few kilometers from Cherbourg. The first, UP3, which came into service on 23 August 1990, is an ultramodern plant, valued at 27.8 billion francs [Fr], the cost of which was virtually completely funded by the contracts which 27 foreign electricity companies have signed with COGEMA for the reprocessing of around 7,000 tonnes of nuclear fuel. EDF Contract The implementation of these contracts, which has already begun, had prompted some anger in November 1992 when France delivered 1.5 tonnes of plutonium to the Japanese authorities. Between now and the year 2000, around 20 tonnes of plutonium should leave for Japan, because it is the very function of reprocessing nuclear fuel to sort through the "ashes" left by the reactors to find the reusable pure material (96 percent uranium and 1 percent plutonium) in the waste proper (3 percent). Although foreign reprocessing requirements are fulfilled by the operation of UP3, at present the only factory in the world capable of reprocessing on an industrial scale, EDF's requirements should be fulfilled by the very new UP2-800 plant. Moreover, EDF has signed a contract with COGEMA for the reprocessing of 8,400 tonnes of fuel from its pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear power stations. Around Fr30 billion has been spent (the difference in price between the two factories is partly due to taking account of inflation) to equip this new unit, which was built on the remains of the former UP-2 plant which reprocessed its first barrel of fuel in June 1966, but which experienced real problems during its conversion for the reprocessing the PWR fuel in the eighties. It then only slowly reached its nominal production capability set at 400 tonnes per year. Installation Rethought UP2-800 is, however, an installation which has been entirely rethought, virtually an identical copy of UP3, but which has benefited from the experience of this factory which, so far, has reprocessed a little more than 1,900 tonnes of foreign used fuel. But it differs from it slightly in that in the future it will have to reprocess relatively limited tonnages of other kinds of fuel known as mixed uranium-plutonium fuels (MOX). Taking this MOX reprocessing into account in the UP2-800 concept made it necessary to think in advance about process modifications because of the presence of bigger quantities of plutonium in the installation. Therefore, there is already a plan to build a factory known as R-4, which will make it possible, in particular, to run that process. It could start around the year 2000 and, according to COGEMA, presupposes "a technological leap forward if we wish to keep reprocessing costs down." This concern seems particularly legitimate because, after the lifting of many legal obstacles, Britain is starting up its Thorp plant worth 2.8 billion pounds (around Fr25 billion) situated in Sellafield in northwest Britain. But, although COGEMA is no longer alone on the reprocessing market because of this competition, the announcement of the launch of UP2-800 will undoubtedly revive the controversy over the value of reprocessing used fuel.
