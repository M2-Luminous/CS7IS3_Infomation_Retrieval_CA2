Bratislava company be granted a license for the STV [Slovak Television] 2 channel. One of CTV's representatives is Marcel Dekanovsky, the Kosice movie director. In the course of the preceding weeks, 12 contenders presented their concepts to obtain 12 hours of broadcasting time on STV 2. Slovak Television will continue to operate the channel during the remaining hours. The commercial station will broadcast from 1700 to 0500 hours. Apart from the victorious CTV, whose nomination still must be approved by parliament, the license had also been sought by the following firms: Redstone, Davay, Sola, Sezam TV, SP, Artep, Markiza, Danube Television Channel, Medium 5, Sitno 5, and Cent Eur (behind which stands U.S. the capital of Turner BS, which owns, among other things, the Cable News Network). In a secret ballot, CTV won five votes from members of the Council, Cent Eur won three votes, and Sitno 5 won one vote.
