First, the Serbs shot down a British war plane belonging to NATO and later entered Gorazde with tanks. It was reported moments ago that they opened mortar fire on houses in Gorazde. The latest news is regarding the NATO air operation. How do you assess these developments? [Cetin] I would like to say first, that for a long time now, the United Nations has been acting very hesitantly. It has been 15 days now that intense Serb attacks have been continuing around Gorazde. The United Nations thought that the crisis could be solved at the table and therefore tried to perpetuate diplomatic contacts. There is only one language the assailant can understand, and that is the language of determination from the opposite side. The Serbs gained courage when hesitancy started -- on whether NATO should intervene or not -- or when the allies and the forces serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina disagreed. As a result, the Serbs intensified their siege of Gorazde since last night. Civilians live in Gorazde and actually the situation this afternoon was the consequence of mortar fire on a hospital. The air operation was started to stop the Serbs and consequently the Serbs shot down a British plane. Since we had already foreseen these developments while we were closely following the events last night, we conducted intensive contacts in NATO and at the United Nations. We called on the UN Security Council to hold an extraordinary meeting. It is obvious that there is a difference of views between the civilian and the military branch of the United Nations in Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is obvious that there is a lack of communication between General Rose and Yasushi Akashi. Proof of this is when General Rose asked for intervention yesterday but there was a belief that the situation would be solved by negotiations. A meeting was held with the Bosnian authorities in Sarajevo this afternoon but no results were reached. I held two to three telephone conversations with the Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and contacted the United Nations and NATO once more. The important issue in this matter is as follows: There are civilians living in Gorazde and the Bosnian army is not mounting serious opposition. In view of this situation, great responsibility falls on the United Nations and NATO. It goes without saying that we do not want war but we have to respond in a language that those that choose war understand. Gorazde is totally encircled right now. They can capture Gorazde whenever they want. Actually Gorazde has been in such a situation from the beginning. The interesting thing in this situation is that the United Nations chose six safe areas. How can the United Nations, which cannot secure the safe areas, secure the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina? As a matter of fact, a number of UN officials were abducted by Serbs yesterday and a lot of effort went into freeing them, during which a soldier was killed. We are especially stressing the fact that we are taking every initiative necessary. Our president sent -- will send -- messages now. We are conducting the necessary contacts. What is important is to act with determination. The minute we show we are hesitant -- when NATO intervenes then asks whether it should have done so or not or whether it was sufficient or not -- then we are not talking the same language as our opponent. There should be no hesitation. The opposite side gains courage when there is hesitation. For this reason the UN authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina should use their power without waiting any longer and with the power invested in them should call NATO to duty. Only by these means can the situation be saved, otherwise, the United Nations will be responsible for what happens to the people of Gorazde. We will follow the situation closely all through the night. All our friends in the Ministry are on duty and I hope that the Serbs will be deterred when they see this determination and in case they are not, NATO should conduct a serious intervention in the situation. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, don't you think the NATO air operation is a favorable development? [Cetin] Yes, the operation is very favorable. We reiterated our appeal to NATO. We continued with our contacts all through last night. NATO should not show hesitancy until a result is achieved. What we wish, actually, is that the result be reached by means of negotiations. That is, the Serbs should give up their siege and surrender all their heavy weapons to the United Nations and if not, the necessary response should be given because it is obvious that the only language the Serb administration understands is the language of force and determination and this determination should be shown.
