The device is 1.4 millimeters in diameter and has a pivot that rotates 100 to 160 times a minute, said officials at the institute, a subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers. To make the motor, researchers covered a ceramic pivot one millimeter in diameter with resin, fixed 16 electrodes to the resin and enveloped them in a cylinder. Then they dissolved the resin to let the pivot rotate within the cylinder. They aim to upgrade the motor several years from now to produce as much power as the one currently used for pagers, which is 1.2 centimeters long and six millimeters in diameter, said Takeo Sato of the institute based in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture. The motor could be applicable to micro-technology for use in human blood vessels to check or treat diseases, he said.
