In an interview with BBC Radio, Major strongly rejected charges that he was a weak leader and indicated that he refused to accept much of the criticism. "I was elected to remain prime minister of this country at least until the next election, and beyond it if I win the next election. I have never run away from a challenge in my life and I'm surely not doing so now," he claimed. He recalled that last year, when his Tory Party was in turmoil over the Maastricht Treaty, he heard week after week that he was too weak and that his leadership was about to be challenged. But "it didn't materialise. It's an extremely good story for a small number of journalists and a small number of people to pursue week after week, but it isn't real," he said. Major had this interview following a week of media speculation that Trade and Industry Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was defeated by Major in 1990 contest to replace Margaret Thatcher, would seek the leadership again if the "indecisive" John Major stumbles. On March 4, a Mori poll for THE TIMES newspaper showed that Major's public rating remains at the lowest level since the image of party leaders was last examined in July last year. And his personal rating was even lower than his predecessor Margaret Thatcher in the darkest days before she was forced to resign in 1990. However, Michael Heseltine hurried to distance himself yesterday from the media speculation that he was poised to launch a bid for Tory leadership. According to press reports here today, the trade and industry secretary pledged loyalty to Major because Major "has steered us through a very difficult period." He was quoted as saying that he believed that Major would lead the conservatives to win the next election and as a loyal member of the current cabinet, he would help major to win the next election. Meanwhile, British Home Secretary Michael Howard also openly dismissed the above-said media speculation. Howard insisted that John Major would not hand over to "an older man," the DAILY MAIL said today. The home secretary hinted strongly that the Tories were likely to skip a generation when the time came to pick Major's successor and could choose from lots of young rising stars, such as Treasury Chief Secretary Michael Portillo, who is 40 now.
