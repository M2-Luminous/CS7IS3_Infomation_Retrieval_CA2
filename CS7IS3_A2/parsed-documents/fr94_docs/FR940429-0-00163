ACTION: Interim final regulations with invitation for comment. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program regulations, and the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations to implement changes in the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and to improve the monitoring and accountability of institutions and third-party servicers participating in the student financial assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs). These changes also establish standards of administrative and financial responsibility for third-party servicers that administer any aspect of a guaranty agency's or lender's participation in the FFEL programs. These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of Federal student aid programs and, by so doing, to improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. The Secretary invites comment on these regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;325, (the Amendments of 1992) and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;208 (the Technical Amendments of 1993) amended the HEA in several areas relating to the participation of institutions in the Title IV, HEA programs. Further, the Amendments of 1992 amended the HEA to expand the Secretary's authority to regulate the activities of those individuals and organizations now called third-party servicers . The Student Assistance General Provisions regulations contain requirements that are common to educational institutions that participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. On February 28, 1994, the Secretary published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for parts 668 and 690 in the Federal Register (59 FR 9526). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion of those issues can be found: The Secretary proposed to clarify the terms used in the statutory definition of academic year (pages 9529&hyph;9530); The Secretary proposed a definition of an eligible program to implement statutory requirements, including requirements for ``short-term'' programs (at least 300 but less than 600 clock hours) that would be eligible for the FFEL programs only. The Secretary proposed methodologies for the measurement of completion and placement rates for short-term programs, as required by the statute. Also in accordance with the statute, the Secretary proposed further provisions to evaluate the quality of short-term programs (pages 9530&hyph;9531); The Secretary proposed to add two new sections to codify procedures with regard to applications to participate initially or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA program and procedures by which the Secretary certifies that an institution meets the standards in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may participate in a Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary proposed procedures to codify new statutory provisions governing provisional certification procedures for participation in a Title IV, HEA program (pages 9533&hyph;9536); The Secretary proposed to amend the regulations governing program participation agreements to include numerous new provisions added by the Amendments of 1992 and provisions previously prescribed by the HEA but not specifically spelled out in the regulations. The Secretary also proposed provisions to amend the regulations governing program participation agreements (pages 9536&hyph;9539); The Secretary proposed significant changes to the section governing the evaluation of an institution's financial responsibility. The Secretary proposed to strengthen the factors used to evaluate an institution's financial responsibility and to reflect statutory changes (pages 9539&hyph;9544);
