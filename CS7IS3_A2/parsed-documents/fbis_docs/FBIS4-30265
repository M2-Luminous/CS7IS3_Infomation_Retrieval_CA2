He said that if the forum in Malaysia is allowed to proceed, the solidarity and good relations between Indonesia and Malaysia will be negatively affected. The Indonesian Government hopes that the Malaysian Government will adopt the same attitude as that of the Philippine Government, whereby a planned forum on East Timor was canceled. The ABRI Information Center chief feels that the forum to be held in Malaysia can tarnish the good reputation of the Indonesian Government, particularly the ABRI.
