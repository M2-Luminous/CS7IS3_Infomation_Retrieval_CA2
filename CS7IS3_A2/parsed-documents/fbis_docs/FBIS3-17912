In his words, both the elections and the poll actually recorded the existing situation. The deputy prime minister also stressed that Crimea had no intention of breaking away from Ukraine if a sensible economic policy is implemented and if the work of the Crimean leadership is not disrupted. However, it was clear that this was unrealistic in the near future, Saburov said. Therefore, Crimea is going to raise the question of special relations, first and foremost in the economic sphere, and it will go as far as concluding international treaties.
