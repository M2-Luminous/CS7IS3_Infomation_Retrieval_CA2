ONPAR Director Jose Javier Mulino told LA PRENSA that, since Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted, some 200 Haitians have requested refuge in Panama and that, of these, only 27 have qualified and nine cases are currently under study. "We studied all the requests and confirmed that only 27 are classified as victims of political persecution by the regime of dictator Raoul Cedras," Mulino explained. The ONPAR conducts these analyses jointly with officials of the Endara administration and the UNHCR office. Mulino explained that to obtain political asylum the person must prove he is truly being politically persecuted.
