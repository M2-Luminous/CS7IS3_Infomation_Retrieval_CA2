The message was circulated on March 26. "I am gratified to note that the leadership of Russia has promptly responded to my letter and expressed concern over the latest aggravation of the conflict in Abkhazia. "We support the proposal expressed in the Russian Government's message to resume talks and are prepared to continue them in Moscow in the coming days", Shevardnadze emphasised. The Georgian leader voiced conviction that Russia can exert an active influence and play a positive role in a settlement of the Abkhazian problem, primarily in securing the return of more than 300,000 refugees to their homes. "I am confident that the authorities of the two countries will remain true to the accord signed in Tbilisi on February 3 and will accomplish the major mission to implement them. This is fully consonant with the consideration expressed by Boris Yeltsin about the historic necessity for strategic cooperation between Georgia and Russia", Shevardnadze said.
