"Russia, as well as China, has major trade and economic interests in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. That is why Moscow will take into consideration its economic interests in relations with the DPRK while working out its position towards trilateral sanctions against Pyongyang", the official told TASS on Monday. However, he added that the common goal of Russia and other states is to ensure the nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula and make North Korea observe the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The official reiterated the position voiced by President Boris Yeltsin that Russia stands for a gradual approach to sanctions against Pyongyang and said all other measures are to be used first. "Moscow believes that it is necessary to try and use all possible political measures without infringing on the interests of the sides", the official stressed. He recalled the proposal of the Russian president to convene an international conference on security and nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula. "This proposal does not mean that other variants of the settlement are brushed aside", he added.
