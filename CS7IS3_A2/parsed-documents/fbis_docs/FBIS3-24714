He appealed to the private sector to demonstrate a high sense of sincere commitment to the development of the country by responding appropriately to the policies. The head of state assured all investors of the security of their investment and specifically to the foreign investors the opportunity to repatriate returns on their investment. He also solicited the assistance of the private sector in monitoring the implementation of the budget which, he said, is a cooperative affair, and charged sector to shout aloud whenever there is a serious deviation on the part of the government or its agencies. The minister of commerce and tourism, Chief Melford Okilo, unfolded a number of plans by his ministry to stimulate economic recovery and development. They include setting up of a Commodity Exchange Market, Comex, to give information on the availability of markets and prices of primary products, the promotion of nonoil exports, completion of the export processing zone in Calabar, and the establishment of a trade malpractices tribunal to handle cases of trade complaints which tarnish the image of the country.
