The Chinese sturgeon, an important endangered aquatic animal protected by the Chinese Government, used spawn in the Jinsha River, a branch of the Yangzte at its upper reaches. [sentence as received] With the construction of the Gezhou Dam, this species of fish was greatly reduced in number since their way back upstream for spawning had been cut off by the dam. In order to protect this variety of fish, considered a precious "living fossil", the Chinese Sturgeon Research Institute succeeded in developing an artificial sturgeon reproduction programme in 1984 and since that time they have sent back 2.35 million young sturgeons into the river. A survey conducted in 1991 showed that the number of this fish in the river has nearly reached the level before the construction of the dam. According to experts, the above success has offered beneficial experience for the protection of precious endangered species facing similar environmental problems with the construction of the three Gorges Project.
