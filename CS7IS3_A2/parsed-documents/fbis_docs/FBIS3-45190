Ma Zhongchen said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee set the objective of establishing a socialist market economy system in China. The establishment of this system makes new and increased demands on higher education. For some time to come, the central tasks of our province's higher education are to deepen the reform and to improve the quality of teaching and efficiency of operation. It is necessary to emancipate the mind, change the current state of closed operation, gradually open universities up, and achieve a higher gains-to-scale ratio.

With regard to the problem of teachers' salary arrears in some places in the province, Ma Zhongchen demanded that the principal leaders of party committees and governments in those localities attend to this matter personally and adopt all necessary measures to ensure that teachers get their salary arrears before the Spring Festival, so that they can have a good holiday.
