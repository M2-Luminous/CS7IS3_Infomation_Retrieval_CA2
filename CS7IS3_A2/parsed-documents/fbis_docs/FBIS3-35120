Nursultan Nazarbayev told correspondents in New York yesterday: Unfortunately the U.S. Administration's attitude toward the Iranian Government is negative. But Kazakhstan oes not believe in isolating Iran, which enjoys special importance in northern and central Asian affairs. The Kazakh president pointed out that Almaty's relations with Tehran are extremely good and constructive and that despite all the bad propaganda by enemies, the two countries are expanding their relations. Nazarbayev rejected allegations of a threat from Islamic fundamentalism in the Central Asian republics and stressed: We are all Muslims and respect Islamic beliefs. After having lived through the antireligious years in the former Soviet Union, the people in the Central Asian republics are extremely interested in returning to their religious beliefs. Nevertheless, he added, in Kazakhstan religion and politics are kept separate. The Kazakh president described the Economic Cooperation Organization, ECO, as a good example of successful regional cooperation for the world. Referring to the agreements between Washington and Almaty, he said that the two countries have concluded agreements in the political, economic, scientific, technological, and defense fields as well as in the joint use of Kazakhstan's space center, and that the United States has promised $300 million in aid to Kazakhstan.
