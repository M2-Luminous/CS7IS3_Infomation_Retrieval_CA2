The Pentagon's number one man met with Honduran Armed Forces Commander General Luis Alonso Discua, Vice President Retired General Walter Lopez Reyes, and Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar at noon today. The meeting was held at Palmerola, a military base that was constructed in 1982 and is located 84 km to the north of Tegucigalpa. There are approximately 1,000 U.S. soldiers stationed at Palmerola. Perry arrived in Honduras this morning after visiting Panama and traveled to Puerto Rico later in the day. The United States must withdraw approximately 10,000 Southern Command soldiers from the Panama Canal area by December 1999 at the latest. Perry said the withdrawal from Panama had prompted them to consider transferring several air units to Palmerola. He said, however, that "in general, all the military installations in the region are being reduced because of geopolitical changes." Honduran Foreign Minister Paz reported, however, that "this issue had not been discussed" at the meeting with Perry and that "Honduras is not going to become a military platform" for the United States. "I believe the U.S. policy, at an international level, is to close bases and to decrease the number of their soldiers stationed abroad. I do not believe they are interested" in increasing their presence in Honduras, Paz asserted. The Honduran minister added that, at the meeting with the U.S. secretary, it was agreed within the framework of a treaty to establish a regional center in Honduras to counter drug trafficking" and that Honduras would want the center to be located at Palmerola. "It is clear that Honduras has to redefine its relations with the United States based on dignity," Paz observed, alluding to several reforms to the 1954 U.S.-Honduras military treaties that were proposed by the Honduran Government several months ago. The presence of the U.S. troops in Honduran territory is included in those agreements. According to the foreign minister, the issue "was broached in a very preliminary manner" during the meeting with Perry.
