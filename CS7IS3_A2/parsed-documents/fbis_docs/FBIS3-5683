FBIS3-5683 "dreas047__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-047-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 March 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Demands at Framework Talks Detailed OW1003050094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1003050094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Details of a statement of demands on a competition policy that the U.S. Government presented to the Japanese Government at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks have been disclosed. One major point is a demand for intensified enforcement of the Antimonopoly Act to prevent bid-rigging. Other demands include increases of at least 10 percent by fiscal year 1995 in the personnel and budget for the Investigation Department of the Fair Trade Commission [FTC], and the creation of a system for paying rewards to those who have provided information on cases of unfair trade practices. The intensified enforcement of the competition policy is also one major point of the measures for promoting market opening to be worked out by the government in mid-March. However, with regard to the U.S. demands, some Japanese Government officials have refuted the statement, saying that "it includes proposals such as creating a reward system which are unsuitable in the climate of Japanese society" (as stated by an FTC source). Therefore, this issue may possibly cause new friction between Japan and the United States. At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, this statement of demands was submitted to the working-level panel on "transparency and circulation connected with the competition policy and concerned procedures." The U.S. Government is demanding that, to strengthen enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law, the Investigation Department, which is responsible for direct investigations of and prosecutions for Antimonopoly Law violations, should be expanded. Approval has been given to the FTC in its draft budget for fiscal year 1994 to add 17 staff members to its inspection department -- a 9-percent increase compared to that of the previous year. However, the U.S. Government is demanding that a larger number of staff members be added. Aside from demanding that the structure of various industries -- such as the construction industry -- be strengthened to prevent bid-rigging, the U.S. Government has also proposed creation of a system of paying rewards to those who provide information on unfair trade practices, and for taking stronger administrative measures against those who have violated regulations. Moreover, the U.S. Government is also demanding that those companies involved in bid-rigging be prohibited from participating in bidding on public works projects or on government procurement contracts for at least 12 months, and that a system be introduced for forcing these companies to pay compensation to the government for the damage caused by bid-rigging. The U.S. Government also made requests concerning business organizations. It requested that various agencies and ministries issue administrative guidance so that foreign companies will not be excluded from or discriminated against by organizations of various business circles. Moreover, it should be guaranteed that those foreign companies which are members of business organizations be provided with the same information as are their Japanese counterparts, and that the appropriate information be provided to nonmember foreign companies. At the same time, the United States is demanding that regulations concerning the offering of premiums to customers be eased. In many cases, U.S. companies promote sales by offering premiums to customers. However, the U.S. Government is not happy about the fact that strict Japanese regulations on offering premiums constitute a barrier when a foreign company intends to join Japanese business organizations. The U.S. Government is now trying to urge the FTC to increase the ceiling for lotteries or premiums to at least 10 million yen by the end of June and to abolish all regulations concerning offering premiums by the end of fiscal year 1995.
