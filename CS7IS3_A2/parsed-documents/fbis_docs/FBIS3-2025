Addressing a press conference held in Zagreb, Akashi said 4,600 soldiers are needed for Sarajevo and 6,050 for other regions of Bosnia. He stressed that the international community must guarantee the increase if it sincerely hopes for a peace in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic. If the request is not met, he warned, all the achievements of the peace efforts made in Sarajevo will be lost again. According to Jean Cote, former commander of the UN protection force in Bosnia, Turkey, Malaysia, Egypt and Jordan are willing to join the protection force in Bosnia. But whether these countries will be invited to send their troops will be decided by the United Nations. Cote said the United States, Britain and France should contribute the most to the protection force.
